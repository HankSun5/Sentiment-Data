Between market rallies and wild presale activity, everyone’s got their eye on that next crypto to explode. While some tokens ride the hype, others build tech that solves real-world pain points—and that’s where things get real interesting. Take Qubetics, for example. It’s not just riding the wave. It’s making it. With over 509 million $TICS tokens sold, 25,200+ holders, and more than $16.4 million raised in crypto presale stage 31, this isn’t just hype—it’s traction. At just $0.1902 per $TICS, some folks are loading up for what could be a breakout year. Now, let’s not forget Maker and Binance. Both powerhouses in their own lanes. Maker’s locking horns with real-world asset backing, while Binance keeps expanding its empire across regions and regulations. But Qubetics? It’s rewriting the rulebook. What’s coming next is a look at how each of these three could be the next crypto to explode, where they stand right now, and why one of them might just flip the script on blockchain as to know it. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain Utility in 2025 Qubetics isn’t trying to copy what came before—it’s filling the gaps left wide open. Built for everyday people, business pros, and devs, its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet and Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace put real usability in your hands. Qubetics is rolling out a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, a feature making waves across blockchain forums and crypto Reddit. Why does it matter? Because converting physical or traditional assets (like property deeds, invoices, or contracts) into secure digital tokens is unlocking new economies. Unlike past attempts that lacked user-friendly execution, Qubetics keeps things intuitive. Here’s what sets it apart: Seamless access via its multi-chain wallet Built-in security audits and compliance layers Tools tailored for freelancers, SMBs, and global firms On-chain transparency for legal clarity and dispute resolution Quick asset liquidity with minimal middlemen Beyond its marketplace, Qubetics’ presale stats alone scream traction: Stage: 31 $TICS Token Price: $0.1902 Tokens Sold: 509M+ Holders: 25,200+ Raised: $16.4M+ Some blockchain analysts have weighed in too. With mainnet launch around the corner, $TICS at $1 could yield a 425% ROI, $5 brings 2527%, and if it hits $15—you’re staring at 7783% ROI. But here’s the kicker—Qubetics is focused on function over fanfare. Add in cross-chain compatibility, mobile-ready features, and dev-friendly APIs, and this thing’s not just surviving—it’s building. Maker: Solid, Stable, and All About Real-World Assets Maker’s always played the long game. One of the OGs in decentralized finance (DeFi), MakerDAO’s bread and butter is Dai—the algorithmic stablecoin backed by collateralized assets. But in 2025, Maker’s doing more than keeping things stable—it’s doubling down on Real-World Asset (RWA) integration. Recent reports on MakerDAO’s Endgame Plan reveal the protocol is actively working with fintech partners to onboard traditional assets like bonds, invoices, and real estate-backed instruments into the ecosystem. Still, it’s not without hurdles. Regulatory uncertainties, rising competition in stablecoins, and limited user interface innovation have held it back from being that next crypto to explode. While it’s trustworthy and proven, the lack of everyday user appeal may keep it more niche than mass-market. Yet for those looking at risk-minimized exposure in the blockchain space? Maker’s still a heavyweight. Binance: The CeFi Titan Keeping the Pressure On Binance is like that tech billionaire who just won’t sit down. Love it or hate it, Binance is everywhere. From NFTs to DeFi to its own BNB Chain, it’s more than just an exchange now—it’s infrastructure. And here’s what’s got folks buzzing in 2025: BNB Greenfield, a decentralized storage and data solution that’s gaining traction among Web3 app builders. Binance is pushing to dominate beyond just buying/selling crypto—now it wants to own how data flows across blockchain. But it’s not all smooth sailing. Centralized exchange tokens like BNB are facing pressure from DeFi protocols and regulatory authorities. Questions around asset custody and internal governance transparency still loom. Still, BNB remains a top-5 token by market cap and consistently ranks in high daily trading volumes. If Binance keeps innovating while navigating the legal maze? It might just reclaim the crown as the next crypto to explode. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: Why It Matters One of the hottest topics in 2025? Real-world asset tokenization. Here’s why it’s taking over headlines: Makes global trade frictionless Enables partial ownership of expensive assets (like real estate) Provides transparent, immutable records on-chain Opens access to financing for underserved markets Cuts out middlemen and legal complexity Qubetics is going all-in on this. While others are talking theory, Qubetics has built the pipes. From its cross-chain compatibility to legal-grade smart contracts, it’s turning buzzwords into blueprints. For businesses in Central Asia or small-time operators in Canada? This kind of infrastructure is a game-changer. Real-world tokenization isn’t just a feature—it’s the future of finance. And Qubetics isn’t waiting around. Conclusion Crypto hype comes and goes, but tech that solves actual problems? That’s where the gold’s at. Qubetics is digging into that goldmine with a tokenization platform and tools that actually work. Maker’s playing it smart and secure, and Binance? Well, it’s still the big dog making bold moves. Looking at the facts, traction, and what’s being built—not just talked about—Qubetics might just be the next crypto to explode . Don’t sit on the sidelines watching others scoop up what could be one of blockchain’s biggest plays in 2025. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics Frequently Asked Questions What is Qubetics’ Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace? It’s a platform that turns real-world assets like contracts and property into secure, tradable digital tokens. How does $TICS compare to Maker’s Dai in 2025? $TICS offers growth potential and real-world use cases, while Dai focuses on price stability through collateral. Is Binance still a safe bet after regulatory challenges? Yes, Binance has regained momentum by securing licenses in 15+ countries and launching new Web3 solutions. What’s the current price of Qubetics $TICS token? As of Stage 31, $TICS is priced at $0.1902 with over 509 million tokens sold. Which crypto project is solving real business problems in 2025? Qubetics leads with tools like a multi-chain wallet and asset tokenization for global SMBs.

According to SMQKE, Digital Commodities Capital Corp. (CSE: RIPP), a publicly traded company, has officially confirmed holding XRP in its corporate treasury, marking the first public disclosure of XRP holdings by a listed firm. The company’s announcement revealed that it currently holds 103,000 XRP and is exploring further exposure to Ripple-affiliated assets and technologies. SMQKE noted that this moment signals a shift in how institutional players position XRP.

Digital Commodities… pic.twitter.com/AQzejOTR9g — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 25, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Unlocks Institutional Interest The announcement follows the March 24, 2025, settlement between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which ended a years-long legal dispute. Digital Commodities Capital described the settlement as a pivotal moment that delivered long-awaited regulatory clarity to the digital asset space. According to the company, this clarity enables more balanced engagement between innovators and regulators and strengthens the legal framework for classifying utility-driven tokens like XRP. In this context, SMQKE pointed out that institutions were already preparing for this outcome, even as retail investors grew uncertain during the litigation period. Strategic Long-Term Positioning Around XRP Digital Commodities Capital’s CEO, Brayden Sutton, stated that the company believes in the future of compliant, utility-based digital assets and identified XRP as a prime example. The confirmed holdings are part of a broader strategy to build long-term value through diversified digital assets. Sutton also indicated that the company is actively reviewing further investment opportunities within Ripple’s ecosystem . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SMQKE interpreted this as a clear sign that XRP is being taken seriously by strategic capital allocators, not just as a speculative asset, but as part of long-term institutional investment theses. A Precedent That May Influence Other Institutions SMQKE emphasized that this is more than a single corporate action. It is a precedent that could influence other publicly traded entities to disclose their XRP positions or consider adding the asset to their portfolios. According to the post, XRP is entering a new phase where its role in digital finance is acknowledged not only by early adopters but by formal institutions operating under public market oversight. The researcher concluded that XRP has never lost its value proposition among those who understand long-term fundamentals and that its official recognition by a public company marks the beginning of broader institutional engagement.

Van de Poppe stated that altcoins are showing signs of recovery after a four-year historical bear market. According to the analyst, investor expectations have been seriously shaken over the past 3 months. However, current indicators show that the market is green. Van de Poppe said that many factors that move the markets come from outside the cryptocurrency sector. Van de Poppe stated that the increase in liquidity has a direct upward effect on Bitcoin. He said that as the money supply (M2) expands, the prices of rare assets like Bitcoin are expected to rise. The analyst stated that China has started quantitative easing (QE), Europe has lowered interest rates and the US is preparing to increase the money supply with interest rate cuts, and that these steps create a strong driving force for risky assets. Related News: SEC Approves Highly Anticipated XRP ETF - Price Reacts - Not Yet Approved Spot ETF on the Horizon Now According to Van de Poppe, the peak in gold in the short term and the increase in risk appetite create a positive environment for Bitcoin and altcoins. The analyst stated that Bitcoin is supported by developments such as ETF approval and Donald Trump becoming the US President, and that these factors create a new wave of liquidity. Van de Poppe, who said that gold has outperformed the S&P 500 by 20% since 2022, argued that despite this, the markets are now starting to lose their upward momentum in gold. He predicted that the next 12-18 months could offer a strong performance for risky assets. Van de Poppe stated that the CNH/USD (Chinese Yuan/US Dollar) parity has a decisive effect on the altcoin market. Past data shows that major rallies begin in altcoin markets when the CNH/USD parity bottoms. Recalling the examples of 2016 and 2019, the analyst pointed out that the yuan has bottomed after the sharp declines experienced recently. He claimed that this development could open the door to a new period of rise in the altcoin market. Van de Poppe stated that macroeconomic factors have replaced the traditional four-year market cycle approach, and that liquidity and global economic conditions will now be more at the forefront. He stated that a serious revival could occur in altcoins as the Chinese Yuan strengthens and gold prices correct. *This is not investment advice.

Livingston said miners currently produce around 450 BTC per day or approximately 13,500 BTC per month, but Strategy acquired 379,800 BTC in the last six months. This translates to the firm purchasing roughly 2,087 BTC per day — far in excess of daily miner output. The author added: ""When Bitcoin becomes this scarce, access to Bitcoin will require paying a premium. Lending against Bitcoin will cost more. Borrowing Bitcoin will become a luxury business reserved for nation-states and corporate whales, and Strategy will control the bottleneck."" ""BTC's global cost of capital will no longer be set by 'the market.' It will be set by the gravitational policies of the first Bitcoin superpower: Strategy,"" Livingston continued. The author's prediction of a Bitcoin supply crunch translates into much higher BTC prices if Strategy can continue its pace of BTC acquisitions while market demand for the supply-capped digital asset grows among institutional and retail investors. The Bitcoin miner reserve, a metric tracking the total amount of BTC held in miner wallets, continues to decline.

Critics of the company warn that the debt-based approach to BTC acquisition could sink Strategy financially if a prolonged BTC bear market takes effect and also warn of greater systemic risks to BTC from such a high concentration of the digital currency held by a single entity.

Ammous argued that institutions like BlackRock and Strategy holding high concentrations of BTC could not engineer a hard fork increasing Bitcoin's maximum supply, as it would massively devalue their holdings, which, at the end of the day, belong to shareholders with the power to divest.

Analysts expect Bitcoin to gain an additional 40% by the end of the year Select altcoins are showing a positive bias on improving crypto sentiment. Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose more than 10% this week as buyers made a strong comeback, pushing the price to the overhead resistance at $95,000. Although buyers are struggling to clear the overhead hurdle, a positive sign is that they have not given up much ground to the bears. The sharp up move is backed by solid buying in the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which witnessed inflows of $3.06 billion , according to Farside Investors data. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a post on X that it was really notable to see “HOW FAST the flows can go from 1st gear to 5th gear.” Crypto market data daily view.

Sina’s Bitcoin Quantile Model projects Bitcoin to reach between $130,000 and $163,000 before the end of 2025. Anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 had an even bigger target of more than $200,000 for Bitcoin in Q4 of this year. Could Bitcoin maintain its momentum and rise above the overhead resistance? Let’s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that look strong in the near term. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the crucial $95,000 level. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($88,619) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone indicate that bulls are in command. A close above $95,000 could propel the BTC/USDT pair to $100,000 and eventually to $107,000. Sellers are expected to aggressively defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA is the critical near-term support to watch out for because a break below it brings the large $95,000 to $73,777 range into play. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 4-hour chart shows the bears are fiercely defending the $95,000 level but are struggling to sink the pair below the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it enhances the prospects of a break above $95,000. The pair could then surge to $100,000. Instead, if the price maintains below the 20-EMA, the pair could tumble to the 50-simple moving average. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it could pull the pair to $86,000. Sui price prediction Sui ( SUI ) has been facing resistance near $3.90, but the shallow pullback suggests that the bulls are in no hurry to dump their positions. SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price stays above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $3.14, the bulls will make another attempt to shove the SUI/USDT pair above $3.90. If they can pull it off, the pair may skyrocket to $4.25 and then to $5. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $3.14, it signals the start of a deeper correction toward the 50% retracement level of $2.94. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $2.94 and the 20-day EMA ($2.69). SUI/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the pair is finding support at the 20-EMA, but the sellers are active at higher levels. The bears will again attempt to sink the pair below the 20-EMA. If they succeed, the pair could slump to $3.14. Buyers will have to swiftly push the price above the $3.81 to $3.90 overhead resistance zone if they want to retain the advantage. If they do that, the pair could start the next leg of the up move to $4.25. Avalanche price prediction Avalanche ( AVAX ) has been range-bound between $23.50 and $15.27 for the past few days. In a range, traders usually buy near the support and sell close to the resistance. AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Although buyers have failed to push the price above $23.50, a positive sign is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That increases the likelihood of a break above $23.50. If that happens, the AVAX/USDT pair will complete a double-bottom pattern, which has a target objective of $31.73. This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. The pair may then remain stuck inside the range for a few more days. AVAX/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has been consolidating in a narrow range between $21.60 and $23.10 for some time. That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher. If buyers propel the price above $23.10, the pair could surge to $25. There is resistance at $23.50, but it is likely to be crossed. Alternatively, a drop below $21.60 signals that the bulls have given up. That may pull the price down to $19.50.

TRUMP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView A rally above $16 is attracting sellers, but a shallow pullback suggests that every minor dip is being purchased. If buyers drive the price above $16, the TRUMP/USDT pair may reach $17.69, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. However, if buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair could skyrocket to $19.60 and then to $22.40. Conversely, a deeper pullback suggests that the short-term bulls are booking profits. The zone between $11.56 and $12.45 is expected to act as a solid support. If the price rebounds off the support zone, the pair may swing between $11.56 and $16 for some time. Selling could accelerate if the pair breaks below the 20-day EMA ($10.73). TRUMP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair turned down from $16 but is finding support near the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. That suggests the bulls are active at lower levels. Buyers will try to push the price above the $16 overhead resistance, starting the next leg of the uptrend. Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-EMA suggests that the bullish momentum has weakened. The pair may then slump to $14 and later to the solid support near $12. Sellers will be back in the driver’s seat on a drop below $11.50. Bittensor price prediction Bittensor ( TAO ) broke and closed above the downtrend line on April 20, suggesting that the bears are losing their grip. TAO/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The up move is facing resistance at $375, but the pullback is expected to find support at the 20-day EMA ($298). A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA signals a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. The bulls will then attempt to drive the TAO/USDT pair above $375. If they succeed, the next stop may be $495. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the downtrend line, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the breakout. The pair then risks falling to $222. TAO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pullback is finding support at the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. Buyers will try to resume the up move by pushing the price above the $375 resistance. If they manage to do that, the pair could reach $425. Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to sink the price below the 20-EMA, opening the doors for a drop to the 50-SMA and later to the downtrend line. A break below the downtrend line tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

That’s exactly where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out. Still priced at just $0.025, this DeFi project is starting to generate serious attention, and analysts are now pointing to a possible 2,000% return as its utility rolls out and adoption scales. With most new tokens offering hype but no real backing, MUTM is doing the opposite—quietly building an ecosystem that makes decentralized finance more accessible, more flexible, and more rewarding for everyone involved. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Low-cap crypto assets often get overlooked—but when utility meets timing, they tend to outperform. Mutuum Finance is still in its presale phase, yet it has already attracted nearly 9,000 participants and raised over $7 million. More than 420 million tokens have been sold to date, and momentum is building fast as the current pricing window begins to narrow. Every new presale phase increases the token price, and many investors are stepping in now to lock in their allocation before the next jump to $0.03. At the heart of Mutuum’s architecture is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Users who deposit crypto assets into the system receive mtTokens, which represent their deposits and grow in value over time by accruing interest. These tokens can be held, transferred, or used within other decentralized applications, making them more than just placeholders—they’re active earning tools. On the borrowing side, the system is designed to protect both users and the protocol itself. Borrowers must provide more collateral than the loan value, following a strict Loan-to-Value (LTV) threshold. This model ensures long-term sustainability and positions Mutuum as a protocol with structure, not guesswork. One of the standout features for long-term holders is the platform’s revenue alignment model. Instead of constantly issuing new tokens to reward users, Mutuum channels a portion of its revenue back into buying MUTM directly from the market. These tokens are then redistributed to ecosystem participants—especially mtToken holders, who are rewarded for their involvement. This system not only avoids the pitfalls of inflationary emissions, but also creates sustained demand over time—a key driver in token appreciation and yield generation. At the current rate of $0.025 per token, a $1,000 investment would grant access to 40,000 MUTM tokens. When forecasts come to fruition and MUTM climbs to $0.50, that position would be worth $20,000—a 20x increase. Stretch that further toward the projected 2,000% growth, and the potential multiplies even more. This isn’t just a numbers game; it’s a strategy. With real utility, strong community growth, and protocol revenue working behind the scenes, this token has ingredients many established cryptocurrencies are still missing. The team behind Mutuum has already announced that a beta version of the platform will be released around the time of token launch, giving users an immediate opportunity to engage with its features. Additionally, the platform’s overcollateralized stablecoin is in development, allowing users to borrow against their assets without needing to sell them—adding another layer of usability and flexibility. Once live, MUTM is expected to be listed on multiple exchanges, opening the door to broader access and significantly increasing its exposure across the crypto market. Mutuum Finance is doing what many low-priced tokens don’t—it’s delivering structure, smart mechanics, and meaningful growth potential. For those looking into the best crypto to invest in for long-term gains, MUTM is emerging as a strong candidate. At just a fraction of a dollar, with strong utility, passive income mechanisms, and a clear path forward, it represents more than just another presale. It’s a project with real legs—and the potential to change portfolios in the months ahead.

While Bitcoin and Solana are prime examples of how small, early investments can multiply into life-changing returns, today’s spotlight is shifting to a new name: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . This token isn’t promising overnight riches—but what it is offering is the combination of timing, structure, and momentum that defined the earliest days of both Bitcoin and Solana. That’s why early adopters are watching closely. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining the Kind of Early-Stage Traction That Matters What makes a project stand out in its first phase? Consistent delivery, growing wallet activity, and conversations that go beyond the hype. That’s exactly what MAGACOINFINANCE is doing—and why it’s earning a spot on investor shortlists across the board. The token isn’t just climbing—it’s gaining credibility. Community channels are growing by the hour. Early holders are sticking around, not selling. And its roadmap is being checked off in real-time. It’s the kind of build-up that looks eerily similar to the patterns Bitcoin and Solana showed before they took off. Notable Competitors Still in the Mix: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin, and Litecoin Uniswap remains dominant in decentralized trading, with unmatched liquidity and smart contract simplicity. But its market cap suggests its biggest run may already be behind it. Polkadot is still pushing boundaries in blockchain interoperability, and its parachain system is driving useful experimentation—but it’s a maturing network. Bitcoin , of course, still leads the market. But at its current stage, it’s a store of value, not a surprise mover. Litecoin continues to be a reliable transactional coin, with low fees and broad integration. However, it’s largely seen as stable rather than explosive. Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE still lives in the discovery zone—and that’s where the most growth often hides. Final Word Can MAGACOINFINANCE.COM turn a small investment into millions? Time will tell—but the elements are all there: strong launch, growing trust, and market timing that feels exactly right. Bitcoin and Solana proved that the early mover gets the biggest reward. The next one could already be here.

The US President said that the accompanying tax reduction will focus on those earning less than $200,000 per year. ""It will be a bonanza for America. The External Revenue Service is happening,"" Trump wrote in an April 27 Truth Social post . Source: Donald Trump President Trump previously floated the idea of eliminating the federal income tax collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and replacing revenues from income taxes with tariffs collected on imported goods. The US President's April 27 Truth Social post revealed the first concrete details of the proposed plan since Trump and members of his cabinet began touting comprehensive tax reform in October 2024. Bitcoin treasury firms driving $200 trillion hyperbitcoinization — Adam Back Investment firms with Bitcoin-focused treasuries are front-running global Bitcoin adoption , which may see the world’s first cryptocurrency soar to a $200 trillion market capitalization in the coming decade. Institutions and governments worldwide are starting to recognize the unique monetary properties of Bitcoin ( BTC ), according to Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream and the inventor of Hashcash. “$MSTR and other treasury companies are an arbitrage of the dislocation between the bitcoin future and todays fiat world,” Back wrote in an April 26 X post. “A sustainable and scalable $100-$200 trillion trade front-running hyperbitcoinization. scalable enough for most big listed companies to move to btc treasury,” he added. Hyperbitcoinization refers to the theoretical future where Bitcoin soars to become the largest global currency, replacing fiat money due to its inflationary economics and growing distrust in the legacy financial system. Source: Adam Back Bitcoin’s price outpacing fiat money inflation remains the main driver of global hyperbitcoinization, Back said, adding: “Some people think treasury strategy is a temporary glitch. i’m saying no it's a logical and sustainable arbitrage. but not for ever, the driver is bitcoin price going up over 4 year periods faster than interest and inflation.” US crypto rules like “floor is lava” game without lights — Hester Peirce SEC Commissioner and head of the crypto task force , Hester Peirce, says US financial firms are navigating crypto in a way that’s similar to playing the children’s game “the floor is lava,” but in the dark. “It is time that we find a way to end this game. We need to turn on the lights and build some walkways over the lava pit,” Peirce said at the SEC “Know Your Custodian” roundtable event on April 25. Peirce explained that SEC registrants are forced to approach crypto-related activities like “the floor is lava,” where the aim is to jump from one piece of furniture to the next without touching the ground, except here, touching crypto directly is the lava. “A D.C. version of this game is our regulatory approach to crypto assets, and crypto asset custody in particular,” she said. Peirce said that, much like in the game, firms wanting to engage with crypto must avoid directly holding it due to unclear regulatory rules. “To engage in crypto-related activities, SEC-registrants have had to hop from one poorly illuminated regulatory space to the next, all while ensuring that they never touch any crypto asset,” Peirce said.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XRP|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-27 22:10:43

Over the course of the year, the IC3 recorded over 140,000 complaints linked to cryptocurrency, which led to staggering financial losses of $9.3 billion. Alarming Trend A significant portion of these losses came from individuals aged 60 and above, who filed roughly 33,000 complaints and suffered a combined total of $2.8 billion in losses. This age group also saw the largest increase in both reported complaints and financial harm. The IC3’s report also noted a dramatic year-over-year increase in losses – 66% higher than in 2023, when total losses amounted to $5.6 billion. Investment scams involving cryptocurrency were the primary source of these losses, but the report also highlighted other schemes such as sextortion, where criminals manipulate personal content to coerce victims into sending money, and fraud involving crypto ATMs. Additionally, ransomware attacks, which had been a recurring issue, showed a 9% rise in 2024, thereby posing a growing threat to critical infrastructure. Overall, fraud and crypto scams were the most significant contributors to the rise in reported cybercrimes, with older individuals particularly vulnerable to these high-stakes digital fraud schemes. On the other hand, pig butchering scams, which were once mainly targeted at older adults, are now increasingly affecting younger individuals, particularly those aged 30 to 49. A recent study by Cyvers examined 150 major crypto platforms, revealing over 200,000 scam incidents and $5.5 billion in losses in 2024. The research focused on Ethereum-based scams and uncovered significant fraud across various platforms, including major exchanges, a crypto-friendly bank, and institutional trading platforms. The scale of impact varied, but the trend is clear: younger people are becoming the prime victims. Operation Level Up ‘Operation Level Up’ was thus initiated with the assistance of FBI agents and the US Secret Service to address the growing issue of cryptocurrency investment fraud. Pig butchering involves fraudsters building online relationships with victims and convincing them to invest in a fraudulent cryptocurrency platform. As a result of this operation, a total of 4,323 individuals affected by cryptocurrency investment fraud were informed of the scam. Of these victims, 76% were unaware they had fallen victim to fraud. The estimated financial savings for these victims amounted to $285.6 million. Additionally, 42 victims were referred to an FBI victim specialist for support regarding potential suicidal thoughts.

Bitwise CEO Drops Jaw-Dropping New Prediction,https://thecoinrise.com/50-trillion-bitcoin-boom-bitwise-ceo-drops-jaw-dropping-new-prediction/,"Hunter Horsley, Bitwise CEO, has dropped a bold prediction concerning Bitcoin (BTC). Horsley says Bitcoin can hit a $50 trillion valuation if it assumes the role of a digital alternative to the U.S fiat. Bitcoin Positioned Beyond Gold as a Global Value Store In an update shared on X, Horsley maintained that BTC’s worth is much more than that of gold, a traditional store of value. He notes that BTC is more like U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar, which, when aggregated, are valued at approximately $50 trillion. Bitcoin is an apolitical, digital monetary asset. The right comparison may be not just Gold (~$23T) — But also Treasuries and USD (~$50T). When people want to digitally store value, the latter is often the way. — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) April 26, 2025 The estimated value of gold is about $23 trillion globally, but Horsley highlights that Bitcoin has more advantages as it exists online. He insists that the coin remains the preferred way investors store “value” in today’s financial world. According to the Bitwise CEO, some features that make Bitcoin appealing are that it is “an apolitical digital monetary asset.” That is, it is not tied to anyone, country, or government. The decentralized feature sets Bitcoin out as an asset. The message behind Horsley’s update is to highlight the possibility of Bitcoin if countries worldwide progressively adopt digital value storage. Bitwise’s Growing BTC Bet Reflects Horsley’s Conviction Horsley has always been bullish about BTC. His stance aligns with the principle of Bitwise. The asset management company under Horsley’s leadership has increased Bitwise’s BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF), BITB, to over 39,000 BTC. Bitwise’s Bitcoin holding has been estimated at approximately $3.67 billion. Hence, Horsley’s stance on the potential of Bitcoin is based on a position of knowledge. Clearly, Bitcoin has grown from competing with gold or chasing technology stocks to positioning itself as a notable force in the financial world . How Bitwise’s CEO’s prediction materializes remains an event to look forward to in the financial world. Bitcoin’s Rising Institutional Adoption Fuels Optimism As of this writing, the coin was trading at $94,118.85 with a market capitalization of $1.86 trillion. This positions it as the leading digital asset in the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin’s appeal has led to growing institutional adoption from firms like Metaplanet, Semler Scientific , and Strategy.

Bitcoin, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM, and Ethereum Are Heating Up!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-580-turn-into-1-9-million-bitcoin-magacoinfinance-com-and-ethereum-are-heating-up/,"In a market known for once-in-a-generation wins, timing is everything. Catching the right project at the right moment is how legends are made. And now, early investors are wondering whether MAGACOINFINANCE.COM could be that next major play—the kind of early entry that shifts portfolios entirely. There’s no question this token is attracting serious attention. From organic growth to mounting analyst discussions, this isn’t another project trying to go viral overnight. It’s one that’s quietly gaining power—and smart investors are noticing. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Steam While Others Stall Not every token launch is worth watching—but this one is. MAGACOINFINANCE has been steadily building momentum with real traction: growing wallet counts, strong retention rates, and increasing visibility in investor forums. It’s not relying on influencers or hype cycles. Instead, it’s executing with purpose—developing a community-first ecosystem that’s attracting early believers and long-term thinkers alike. There’s a seriousness to its rollout that sets it apart from the typical short-burst memecoins. More importantly, it’s doing this at a moment when the market is hungry for new momentum. With attention shifting toward early-stage entries that could define the next run, MAGACOINFINANCE is standing right in the spotlight. Other Solid Projects—But With Limited Early Entry: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin Uniswap remains a key player in the decentralized exchange space. Its model for token swaps and liquidity pools has changed how people trade—but it’s now a well-known giant, with much of its explosive upside already realized. Polkadot is doing valuable work around interoperability and multi-chain scaling. It’s vital to Web3 innovation—but as a large-cap asset, its growth arc is longer and more gradual. Bitcoin Cash continues to serve those focused on simple, peer-to-peer digital payments. It has strong utility and global adoption—but few would describe it as an “undiscovered” asset. Litecoin is one of the oldest altcoins still standing. It remains relevant, especially for fast, low-cost transactions—but it’s also fully matured in its current form. These projects are dependable—but they’re no longer in their early days. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is just beginning its ascent. Final Thought Can $750 really become $1.2 million? It depends on the project. It depends on timing. And it depends on execution. Right now, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is hitting all three. The structure is there. The interest is growing. And the window is still wide open—for now. If history has taught us anything, it’s that those who move early often move the farthest.

Meme coins require minimal capital investment to build a sizable positions, yet promise explosive initial gains, which continue to attract millions of buyers from all over the world into meme assets to date. One of the up-and-coming contenders within the meme coins market this year is CartelFi . But does this newcomer have what it takes to uncrown some of the more established names within this space like Shiba Inu? Let’s explore. CartelFi vs Shiba Inu: which one offers better utility? Shiba Inu has long been touted as the “Dogecoin killer”. It gained famed as a community-driven meme coin upon launch in 2020. Over the years, it has grown its ecosystem to include ShibaSwap, a decentralised exchange, and other tokens as well like LEASH and BONE. Shiba Inu continues to thrive on a vibrant community and speculative trading, but its utility remains rather limited. CartelFi, on the other hand, is more innovative. It’s fully committed to becoming more than just a meme coin. CartelFi is marketing itself as a platform with a mission. It wants to help the community transform its idle meme coins into yield-generating assets, branding itself as “the ultimate staking cartel.” This means that instead of letting meme coins idle in wallets, they get to put them to work and set up a new source of passive income with CartelFi. It’s a unique approach that bridges the gap between meme culture and decentralised finance (DeFi), offering real utility and value to users. Click here if you’d like to learn more about CartelFi and its native meme coin. CartelFi vs Shiba Inu: which one has better growth potential? CartelFi may be a better pick than Shiba Inu in 2025 also because it’s currently in its early stages only, which makes it a prime opportunity for investors looking to get in on the ground floor. CartelFi presale has attracted massive interest, raising more than $1 million in within a matter of weeks. This momentum indicates strong investor confidence and potential a bright future ahead. Note that meme coins are broadly known to offer explosive initial gains. This narrative makes CartelFi all the more exciting to own than Shiba Inu as the latter has been around for years. So, it’s reasonable to believe that it has already had its moment in the sun. However, CartelFi is yet to realise that explosive growth, indicating building an early position in it today could prove rather lucrative for investors as we proceed through the remainder of 2025. All in all, CartelFi’s innovative approach, strong growth potential, and focus on utility make it a standout in the crowded world of meme coins. For investors looking to merge the fun of meme coins with an added benefit of yield generation, CartelFi is the clear winner.

Amid wild market movements for TRUMP, a Georgia senator has labeled the invitation an impeachable offense. Meanwhile, a shift in sentiment sees investors turn to PepeX , a project looking to revolutionize the memecoin space. Georgia senator slams Trump’s memecoin dinner It’s an impeachable offense, US Senator Jon Ossoff from Georgia said. Ossoff said this as he publicly criticized President Donald Trump’s reported gala dinner for top 220 investors of his $TRUMP memecoin. The lawmaker criticized the move as “selling access,” noting that the event set for May 22 could be grounds for impeachment proceedings against the president. This is the latest controversy around the TRUMP token, which launched in January 2025 amid market euphoria on Trump’s election win and inauguration. Critics point to TRUMP soaring amid the dinner news as a scenario that will only enrich these few whales and insiders. The criticism, which has come from other congressional lawmakers and the crypto circle as well, see the president’s involvement as a conflict of interest and a dangerous precedent. Notably, the token’s creators hold 80% of supply. Memecoin investors buy PepeX While analysts suggest TRUMP memecoin could be worth watching, investors keen on other opportunities are flocking to PepeX. The AI-powered memecoin launchpad, which seeks to challenge Pump.fun and others in the market, has raised over $1.6 million in its presale. PepeX, targeted for multi chain use, eyes a user-friendly platform for memecoins creation. Its main selling point is it’s focus on community rather than token creators and a few top whales. The platform’s AI-powered technology provides a fair token distribution. It caps creators at 5% of supply while allocating 95% to the public. PepeX also includes anti-sniping tech and real-time transparency tools like bubble maps. This means the platform removes the potential for manipulation and rugs, which have dominated Pump.fun launches. Moreover, only 0.04% of Pump.fun participants profitable.

PepeX is here to let YOU tokenize your way through the chaos. 🚀Forget tech stocks, PepeX is where AI-powered tokens and degen plays meet.

According to the PepeX whitepaper , the planned public launch is in Q3 2025. The roadmap includes key milestones such as decentralized AI launchpad, DEX partnerships and staking. Its presale, with tokens priced at $0.0243, offered early birds up to 332% in presale returns. This has many looking to buy early before the 90-day ICO ends. Overall crypto-friendly environment under President Donald Trump Despite the controversy around TRUMP, the broader crypto landscape is experiencing a notable shift under President Trump’s administration. Since his campaign for election in 2024, Trump has increasingly taken a pro-crypto stance. The industry supported him and other leaders amid the push for clarity in the regulation of digital assets, with the signing executive orders to promote cryptocurrencies among key developments in 2025. On April 25, 2025, new SEC chair Paul Atkins said the agency was ready to work with Trump’s administration and Congress to support efforts for regulatory clarity.

The bank’s indirect Bitcoin exposure via stocks reached $356 million, raising sell pressure risk amid a global trade war and recession concerns. Abu Dhabi’s $437 million spot Bitcoin ETF stake shows sovereign wealth funds see Bitcoin as a hedge. Norges Bank, Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund, reported a $40 billion loss in the first quarter of 2025, with most of the decline caused by a drop in the value of US-listed technology companies. Norges Bank also indirectly owned 3,821 BTC through its stock market investments by the end of 2024, presenting a potential sell pressure risk to Bitcoin, especially when considering the socio-political uncertainty and the risk of an economic recession caused by the global trade war. In such times, could Norges Bank increase its investments in Bitcoin-related companies or even buy spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a way to hedge risk? For now, it seems unlikely that Norway’s investment fund would consider buying a Bitcoin ETF, especially since the fund does not hold any gold. Besides stocks and bonds, Norges Bank invests in real estate, including retail, industrial, renewable energy, and logistics properties worldwide. Norway sold all of the central bank’s gold by early 2004, when gold was trading below $400. Since then, gold has outperformed the S&P 500 by 280%. Equities now make up 71.4% of the fund’s total investments, so if the global trade war continues, significant losses could occur. Gold/USD (orange) vs. S&P 500. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Norges Bank investments generated $222 billion in profits in 2024, and its stock market portfolio dropped by only 1.6% in the first quarter of 2025. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund is “mainly index-driven,” according to CEO Nicolai Tangen, specifically following the FTSE Global All Cap Index. Although this index includes over 7,100 stocks from both developed and emerging markets, it is based on market capitalization, which means 65% of the exposure is to North American companies. But, according to Norges Bank Deputy CEO Trond Grande, there is some flexibility for active investment, and their exposure to US-listed tech stocks has been below the benchmark for the past 18 months. Some of these holdings, such as Strategy, Mara Holdings, Coinbase, and Riot Platforms, hold large amounts of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on their balance sheets. As a result, even if not intentional, the sovereign wealth fund had a $356 million indirect exposure to Bitcoin at the end of 2024. FTSE Global All Cap (purple) vs. FTSE + 10% Bitcoin (green). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Data shows a 5% hypothetical allocation in Bitcoin back in 2018 would have boosted the fund’s equities benchmark performance by 56%. Buying Bitcoin ETFs seems unlikely, but indirect exposure remains possible Technically, it seems unlikely that Norges Bank could buy into the spot Bitcoin ETF without changing the fund’s mandate. However, increasing exposure to companies with significant Bitcoin holdings appears possible. Still, there is no sign of such a move, although Nicolai Tangen stated on April 24 that the fund will increase investments in US stocks.

Similarly, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board held $321 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs, showing the growing use of cryptocurrency as a hedge.

Cardano just rolled out a governance framework update that aims to sharpen its community-led innovation. Meanwhile, Litecoin celebrated its latest halving with a modest uptick in hash rate and community engagement, reminding everyone it’s still swinging in the heavyweight division of payments-focused coins. But amidst the buzz, a new heavyweight contender is emerging: Qubetic s. It isn’t just another blockchain play. With over $16.4 million raised and more than 509 million $TICS tokens sold to over 25,200 holders, this one’s building tools real folks and businesses need—starting with a decentralized VPN. At $0.1902 per token in its 31st presale stage, Qubetics is not just solving blockchain’s old headaches; it’s crafting new paths for the future of digital finance. Let’s dive into what makes Qubetics, Cardano, and Litecoin each worth watching and how one of them could end up being your ticket to the best crypto to get rich. Qubetics ($TICS): A Real-World Blockchain With Utility that Hits Home Here’s the deal. Crypto ain’t just about charts and candle patterns anymore. It’s about solving problems—real ones. And Qubetics is out here treating blockchain like a Swiss Army knife. Whether you’re a professional handling sensitive data or a small business owner dealing with sketchy internet providers, this one hits different. The standout? Its built-in decentralized VPN. Imagine ditching shady VPN services and replacing them with one that’s on-chain, secure, and anonymous by design. It’s not just smart—it’s what the ecosystem’s been crying out for. And it doesn’t stop there. What’s Popping Right Now? Qubetics is in Stage 31 of its crypto presale . $0.1902 per $TICS token. Over 509 million tokens sold. More than 25,200 holders. Over $16.4 million raised. With tech that simplifies cross-border payments, creates secure file transfers, and decentralizes cloud services, Qubetics isn’t following trends. It’s setting them. The QubeQode IDE & Business Simplicity This isn’t just a playground for coders. Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE is designed for devs, professionals, and even non-tech folks who want in on blockchain without wrestling code like a python in the jungle. Add in lower transaction fees and scalable infrastructure, and you’ve got something built for the long haul. The Buzz from Analysts Look, folks in the know are calling out numbers like $1, $5, even $15 post-mainnet. That’s up to a 7783% return. Of course, this ain’t financial advice—it’s simply what’s out there in credible circles. Why It Could Be the Best Crypto to Get Rich When you’re looking for the best crypto to get rich, utility and early entry matter. Qubetics isn’t just a whitepaper dream. It’s a functional, scalable project that’s making tech smoother and privacy tighter. Cardano (ADA): Smart Contracts Meet Real-World Governance Cardano’s been around the block—literally. It was one of the earliest Proof-of-Stake champions and has long pitched itself as an academically serious blockchain. In 2025, Cardano isn’t chasing hype. It’s refining the fundamentals. Cardano just activated an upgrade to its Voltaire governance model, putting more power directly in the hands of ADA holders. Community voting, treasury allocation, and even on-chain proposals are seeing streamlined improvements. That’s real decentralization, not just lip service. With over 1,200 dApps currently built on Cardano and a dev community that’s growing like it’s on Miracle-Gro, ADA keeps climbing the ranks. Its low transaction fees, energy efficiency, and secure Haskell-based coding environment keep it appealing. Education systems, agricultural supply chains, and even digital ID solutions in emerging markets are actively integrating with Cardano tech. This isn’t fantasy—it’s happening. It’s not the fastest mover, but it’s steady and consistent. For those scoping out the best crypto to get rich with a balance of safety and innovation, ADA earns its seat at the table. Litecoin (LTC): The OG Payments Coin Still Holding It Down Don’t let the quiet demeanor fool you—Litecoin’s a beast that’s aged like fine whiskey. It’s got roots going back to 2011, and while many have come and gone, LTC is still here, doing its thing. Litecoin’s August 2024 halving event is already showing its ripple effects. The hash rate is up, miner activity is steady, and LTC has crept back into payment gateway headlines. With transaction speed sitting at around 2.5 minutes per block, it still lives up to its “silver to Bitcoin’s gold” nickname. While newer blockchains chase the shiny DeFi narrative, Litecoin keeps it simple: be fast, cheap, and reliable. Whether it’s cross-border remittance, ecommerce checkout, or ATM withdrawals, LTC is quietly powering real transactions every day. It’s accepted at thousands of merchants globally, from retail stores to online platforms. Payment processors keep integrating it. Litecoin is that old-school friend who never asks for the spotlight but always shows up. If you’re betting on dependability and wide acceptance, Litecoin’s got the goods. It’s not flashy, but it works—and sometimes, that’s exactly what pays off. What’s a Decentralized VPN and Why Should Anyone Care? A decentralized VPN flips the script on traditional ones. No central authority. No single point of failure. Just pure peer-to-peer privacy. Here’s why this matters: Traditional VPNs can be hacked or surveilled. Centralized systems log your data—even if they swear they don’t. Governments can block access or demand logs. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN changes the game: User data isn’t stored—ever. Connections route anonymously through a mesh network. It’s blockchain-backed, meaning secure and transparent without compromising privacy. Great for business use, remote work, or just surfing without big brother peeking in. This isn’t some side project—it’s a core piece of Qubetics’ infrastructure. And that’s what makes it a serious contender when folks talk about the best crypto to get rich. Conclusion: Who’s the Best Bet? Cardano’s playing the long game with governance and academic rigor. Litecoin’s old-school but steady, with widespread real-world usage. But Qubetics? That one’s rewriting the rules—solving the problems that’ve tripped up other chains and doing it with tools people can actually use. The best crypto to get rich in 2025 might not be the loudest one. It’s the one laying down real-world foundations—one decentralized VPN, secure payment system, and developer IDE at a time. Want in before the crowd catches on? This might be your shot.

Earlier this month, the BTC mining hotspot of Irkutsk unveiled the nation’s first-ever year-round ban on crypto mining in the southern part of the oblast. This move came just months after Moscow imposed a wintertime ban on crypto mining in 10 Russian and Russian-controlled regions until 2031. Russian Gas Alternative for Irkutsk Bitcoin Miners? Per the Russian news agency Interfax , the Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev has urged major players in the mining market to join forces with oil and gas companies. A Gazprom Neft oil refinery. (Source: Neftehim [CC BY-SA 3.0]) He said that the parties should unite to build data centers that use “alternative fuel sources.” Kobzev made the comments during an April 25 address on the state of affairs in the region. He claimed that the Irkutsk government was “not against mining as a phenomenon.” However, he reasserted claims that miners need to overcome electricity shortages. And he said his government had a duty to ensure residents and enterprises in the region enjoyed uninterrupted electricity supplies. Kobzev said: “The regional government is ready to act as a platform to coordinate interaction between mining operators and enterprises working in the oil and gas production sector. There are already successful cases of firms building data centers powered by autonomous generation. These firms use associated gas.” Iran, Russia agree on 55 bcm of gas supplies, nuclear plant funding https://t.co/cP4vZjiySE https://t.co/cP4vZjiySE — Reuters (@Reuters) April 25, 2025 Russian oil firms have been working with crypto miners on associated gas-related pilots since the start of the current decade. Some of the nation’s biggest BTC miners and oil firms, including BitRiver and Gazprom Neft, started working together in 2022. Irkutsk’s Governor Igor Kobzev meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2019, in a photograph released by the Kremlin’s press service. Russia Starting to Feel Crypto Mining Boom Downside? Russia has seen one of the world’s biggest booms in Bitcoin and altcoin mining in recent years. With many miners forced out of China, Russian miners have claimed that taxing their industry could bring Moscow hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of revenue. But this growth has taken a toll on many areas’ energy grids. The Ministry of Energy is reportedly mulling issuing three more regional mining bans as networks in some areas begin to suffer. Other parts of the country claim they have surplus power that they can use to power miners’ rigs. But Kobzev appears keen to keep miners in southern Irkutsk away from public grids at all costs. He pledged to support associated gas-powered crypto mining initiatives “in every possible way.” He also said that such a partnership could help improve the Irkutsk environment by reducing flaring. Could BTC Miners Switch to Russian Gas Power? When drilling for crude oil, producers often release pockets of natural (associated) gas. If drillers do not have any infrastructure that lets them capture this gas, they must instead burn it using flare stacks. Many industries are hesitant about using associated gas, as it tends to produce intense but irregular bursts of energy, rather than uninterrupted flows. Russia said it arrested a man suspected in the murder of a senior military official near Moscow and claimed that a car bomb had been activated remotely from Ukraine. https://t.co/Gut35SJH0z — Bloomberg (@business) April 26, 2025 Some Russian miners, however, say that they are happy to use this model of energy flow, provided they can pay discounted rates. Kobzev was optimistic about the said that a failure to stamp out crypto mining-related energy problems could see the capacity deficit in southeastern Siberia hit just shy of 3GW by 2030. But critics say that efforts to ban crypto mining in southern Irkutsk have instead resulted in a rise in illegal and quasi-legal operations. Some claim that rising Bitcoin prices have also played a role, with miners now increasingly reluctant to turn off their rigs.

RIPPLE’S MONICA LONG JUST LIT UP CNBC WITH MASSIVE UPDATES. We have extracted every key quote you need to see from her interview — broken down for you: On XRP: “XRP serves a couple different roles… within the blockchain, the XRP Ledger, it’s the native asset, so you… pic.twitter.com/QGkcPHM6fB — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 25, 2025 XRP: A Critical Component of Ripple’s Strategy Monica Long emphasized XRP’s essential role within the XRP Ledger, explaining that it is required for transaction fees and account reserves. She stated, “XRP serves a couple different roles… within the blockchain, the XRP Ledger, it’s the native asset, so you need it for gas fees, you need it for the reserve account minimum, and so as there’s more users and more use cases built on XRP Ledger, that asset will always be needed.” She also discussed XRP’s function in liquidity provisioning on XRPL. “Within that exchange… if a trading pair doesn’t have liquidity between it, it auto-bridges, goes between XRP for efficiency, speed, and cost… so that will be an increasingly important use case as more activity comes to the blockchain.” Long confirmed that Ripple continues to use XRP as part of its payments offering depending on customer needs, adding, “It’s kind of dependent on customer use case.” XRPL: Designed for Functionality and Innovation Long described the XRP Ledger as an early attempt to improve Bitcoin’s limitations. “The original XRP Ledger launched as… Bitcoin 2.0… in their brains, they were thinking of Bitcoin as this ingenious invention, how can we improve upon scalability and tinker with the consensus model so that you could enable things like an exchange within the blockchain itself.” She reinforced the company’s long-term alignment with XRPL development, noting, “The whole company started because three developers created the XRP Ledger… and so we’ve always had a belief in building use cases that would make use of the efficiency within XRP Ledger.” Ripple continues to enhance the ledger, including adding lending protocols and a multi-purpose token amendment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple USD (RLUSD) and Institutional Stablecoin Demand On the subject of stablecoins, Long explained the rationale behind Ripple’s decision to launch RLUSD, citing its relevance to Ripple’s cross-border payments business. She highlighted RLUSD’s utility and availability. “It’s quick, right, you can get effectively the equivalent of a dollar in digital version… and then 24 by 7 availability… as opposed to using this kind of real-time rail for stablecoins.” Long said the stablecoin market is projected to exceed $3 trillion , adding that Ripple focuses on institutional usage. One area gaining momentum is using stablecoins as collateral: “One that I think is getting more and more attention is using [stablecoins] as an asset for collateral for trading in the more traditional institutional world… this is one that’s definitely spiking for us.” Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Long also addressed Ripple’s relationship with the banking sector. Recalling the early years, she said, “In 2014… we knocked on the doors of banks and we explained… you could do cross-border payments on a blockchain and it would be near instant, almost free… they were like, slam the door in our face.” But today, she said, banks are far more receptive. “They have embraced it a lot more.” She clarified that Ripple’s role is to serve as an intermediary, and acknowledged how regulatory shifts make banks more willing to engage with blockchain services. Long concluded with a critique of legacy financial systems. “When you talk to the banks, the effort to run those products, it’s kind of shocking, a lot of the backend process is still manual or it’s paperwork, it’s just all this stuff that could be automated and just made more efficient with technology.” As All Things XRP noted in his coverage of the interview, Ripple is no longer operating in a limited capacity. Under Long’s leadership, it is positioning itself to help build the infrastructure underpinning the next phase of institutional finance.

Back argued that investment firms allocating their treasuries to BTC are leading the charge in global adoption, a trend he believes could drive the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization to $200 trillion within the next decade. Back contends that companies are using Bitcoin treasury strategies as a rational and long-term arbitrage Adam Back, also the creator of Hashcash, claimed that organizations and governments worldwide were beginning to acknowledge the special monetary qualities of BTC. Back further shared an X post to illustrate this on April 26, stating that treasury firms like Strategy were taking advantage of the gap between the current fiat world and the future of BTC. He continued after this, elaborating that a scalable and sustainable front-running hyperbitcoinization with a $100–200 trillion trade value had enough scalability for most large listed companies to switch to BTC Treasury. Hyperbitcoinization is the term used to describe the hypothetical scenario in which BTC surpasses fiat money as the most widely used currency in the world due to its inflationary economics and the growing mistrust of the established financial system. According to Back, the primary cause of global hyperbitcoinization was still the price of BTC exceeding the inflation of fiat money. Following this, he claimed that some believed that treasury strategy was a passing trend. In response, he argued that it was a sustainable and rational arbitrage. Additionally, based on his argument, BTC prices have increased over the past four years more quickly than interest and inflation, but this trend is temporary. Interestingly, Back made these remarks almost two months after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order creating a national Bitcoin reserve using BTC that was forfeited in criminal cases involving the government. More international companies may decide to adopt BTC following the current appealing conditions Reports suggest that firms like Strategy — the largest corporate holder of BTC — could inspire others to follow suit if they continue expanding their Bitcoin treasuries. According to Michael Saylor , Strategy’s co-founder, the company’s Bitcoin treasury has made over $5.1 billion in profit since the start of 2025, demonstrating the strategy’s profitability. Likewise, Japanese investment giant Metaplanet — aka “Asia’s MicroStrategy” — has adopted the same strategy after April 24, when it surpassed more than 5,000 BTC in its reserves. Furthermore, according to Metaplanet, this was not the end; by 2026, it plans to acquire 21,000 BTC, making it the largest corporate Bitcoin owner in Asia. Furthermore, another thing that would have made it easier for international companies like Strategy to follow suit was the US Federal Reserve’s decision to remove its 2022 guidance that banks shouldn’t deal with cryptos. With this reversal, U.S. financial institutions might feel more comfortable embracing Bitcoin. In reaction to the withdrawal of the guidance, Saylor stated that banks were now free to start supporting BTC. Moreover, Iliya Kalchev, a Nexo dispatch analyst, revealed that banks would now be subjected to regular supervision, indicating a more liberal regulatory framework for integrating digital assets.

While giants like XRP and Bitcoin continue to dominate the headlines, early traders are shifting their focus toward a fresh lineup of altcoins with far greater upside potential heading into 2025. Many long-term XRP holders who saw early success are now reallocating part of their portfolios into smaller, high-traction tokens that could multiply faster in the next cycle. It’s not a rejection of the big caps—it’s a rotation into opportunities that haven’t fully played out yet. New Altcoins Are Catching Smart Money Attention While Bitcoin and XRP continue to offer stability and scale, they’re no longer the undiscovered gems they once were. That role is now being filled by emerging players that combine strong narratives, lean supply models, and rapid community growth. Among the most mentioned right now is MAGACOIN FINANCE —a politically themed altcoin that’s carving out space with bold branding and strategic market entry. With consistent early-stage demand and growing visibility on trackers and social platforms, it’s being discussed as one of the few tokens that hasn’t yet priced in future interest. Investors aren’t just looking at charts—they’re watching wallet activity, search volume, and rotating capital flows. What they’re seeing is that the real action is happening before listings ever begin. Why Traders Are Reallocating Altcoins are inherently higher risk, but that’s exactly what makes them attractive to seasoned traders who’ve already done well with XRP or Bitcoin. They’re not betting on speculation—they’re positioning for volatility they can control. The altcoins getting the most traction right now often check a few critical boxes: a memorable name, early-stage scarcity, increasing coverage from crypto media. Those who once turned $1K into six figures with XRP are now scanning for projects with similar setups—structured entries, social-driven exposure, and room to run. Final Thoughts The $1K-to-$1M tagline may sound ambitious, but in crypto, narratives move markets—and right now, the narrative is shifting. While Bitcoin and XRP maintain their legacy status, many traders are betting big on smaller tokens with disruptive potential. Whether it’s a cultural movement like MAGACOIN FINANCE or another sleeper pick waiting for its moment, the real returns often come from acting before the hype—not after. As always, timing matters. For those with eyes on what’s next, this altcoin wave might be the most exciting play of the year.

In fact, the smartest crypto plays usually begin in silence. Today, while Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) continue to gain strength, a growing number of seasoned investors are locking into MAGACOINFINANCE —a project showing all the right early-stage signs. It’s already surging—and it hasn’t even hit the exchanges yet. What’s fueling MAGACOINFINANCE’s rapid rise Bonus access is still active: Strategic buyers are locking in during the final moments of private entry. Listings are approaching fast: Once live on exchanges, the opportunity for first-mover advantage disappears. Visibility is surging: The token is now on radar inside altcoin analyst circles and private investor communities. Access is still limited: This isn’t mass-market yet. That’s why early positioning matters. MAGACOINFINANCE is earning bold projections MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just climbing—it’s accelerating. With a capped supply and rapidly rising interest, market analysts now place it in the best crypto potential for Q2—supported by its clean structure, momentum, and strategic launch timing. Why SOL, XRP, KAS, and OP won’t offer this entry again Solana (SOL) , XRP , Kaspa (KAS) , and Optimism (OP) are well-established. Their early discovery moments are long past. MAGACOINFINANCE is now trending as a contender among top early-stage altcoins. Final thoughts on MAGACOINFINANCE Every major coin had its quiet beginning— Bitcoin , XRP , and Solana were once ignored. Today, MAGACOINFINANCE is in that same position: building fast, rising confidently, and offering timing that rarely lasts. This is the phase where smart money moves.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 245,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on Bonk ( BONK ) following the altcoin’s breakout of an accumulation zone on the three-day chart. The trader shares a chart suggesting that BONK can rally to as high as $0.0000262 after taking out its resistance at $0.0000142. “BONK is going much higher (I have a bag). Looks good on the charts as well. Think I’m going to add to my position if I get a small dip.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, BONK is trading for $0.0000182. Turning to the native asset of the non-fungible token (NFT) project Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ), the trader says the altcoin needs to print a bullish higher low setup at around $0.0065 to start reversing its multi-month downtrend. Otherwise, Altcoin Sherpa warns that PENGU may drop to as low as $0.004. “Coins like PENGU got rekt the last several months but are showing some signs of life. The true test is going to be where the next low is and how the reaction is. The trend is still bearish, so don’t be so quick to catch knives. That said, we could see some reversal if the environment continues to ease up.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that PENGU may soar to as high as $0.014 if the altcoin manages to establish a higher low. At time of writing, PENGU is worth $0.00985. As for the broader altcoin market, the analyst warns that most coins are still in a high-time-frame downtrend and that the gains witnessed this month could be erased. However, Altcoin Sherpa notes that it is now within the realm of possibility for altcoins to start carving a major cycle bottom en route to a bullish reversal. “To be clear, I’m pretty bullish overall and think that we’re going higher and the next major dip is a BUY THE DIP situation. HOWEVER, most alts still are in bearish market structures (see TAO) and continuation of that trend is down. I think we go higher for everything, but just a careful reminder that these sh*tcoins are still in bearish trends and have made lower highs, lower lows. I do think that we’re doing better, though.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Bitcoin’s weakening correlation with stocks highlights its growing independence as an asset. Bullish institutional investor positioning contrasts with retail traders’ caution, supporting a rally above $100,000. Bitcoin ( BTC ) gained 11% between April 20 and April 26, demonstrating resilience by holding near its two-month high around $94,000. This relief rally followed signals from the Trump administration about easing import tariffs, as well as strong corporate earnings reports. Investor confidence in Bitcoin was further boosted by a record $3.1 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over five days. However, a key BTC derivatives indicator showed signs of bearish momentum, raising questions about whether the $100,000 target is still realistic. Perpetual Bitcoin futures contracts are favored by retail traders because their prices closely track the spot market. A positive funding rate means that buyers pay to maintain their positions, so a reversal in this rate is typically linked to bearish trends. Bitcoin perpetual futures annualized funding rate. Source: Laevitas.ch The sharp negative funding rates recorded on April 26 are highly unusual during bull markets, as they indicate stronger demand from sellers. This metric has been volatile since April 14, but sellers were caught off guard as Bitcoin’s price climbed above $94,000. Since April 21, over $450 million in BTC short positions have been liquidated . Some of the renewed confidence and Bitcoin’s price strength can be attributed to the S&P 500’s 7.1% weekly gain. However, despite this optimism, US President Donald Trump reportedly said on April 25 that negotiations would depend on China making concessions, causing traders to question the sustainability of recent gains. Companies are now reporting first-quarter earnings from before the escalation of the trade war, so the factors driving the stock market and Bitcoin are different. In fact, Bitcoin’s price is no longer closely correlated with the S&P 500. 30-day correlation: S&P 500 vs Bitcoin/USD. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Currently, the 30-day correlation between the S&P 500 and Bitcoin stands at 29%, well below the 60% level seen from March to mid-April. While this lower correlation does not mean a complete decoupling, since investor sentiment is still influenced by macroeconomic factors, it does show that Bitcoin is not simply a proxy for technology stocks. Bitcoin’s status as an independent asset has strengthened Gold’s inability to maintain its bullish momentum after reaching an all-time high of $3,500 on April 22 was also seen as significant for Bitcoin’s status as an independent asset class. Some traders had questioned the “digital gold” narrative, but the longer BTC remains above $90,000, the more confidence investors may have, potentially paving the way for further gains. The increased demand for bearish leverage in perpetual BTC futures does not align with the sentiment of professional traders. Monthly Bitcoin futures contracts avoid fluctuating funding rates, so traders know their leverage costs in advance. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch On April 26, the two-month Bitcoin futures premium (basis rate) rose to its highest level in seven weeks, indicating greater interest in bullish positions. At 6.5%, this metric remains within the neutral 5% to 10% range, but is moving away from bearish territory. The disconnect between leverage demand in perpetual futures and monthly BTC contracts is not unusual. Even if retail traders remain cautious, substantial accumulation by institutions could be enough to push Bitcoin’s price above $100,000 in the near future.

A move past this point could push the Ethereum price toward $1,720 or even $1,800. However, if it fails to break through, the Ethereum price might fall back to $1,550. The Ethereum price is currently trading above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, which is a positive sign. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also above 50, suggesting bullish momentum. But if the Ethereum price drops below $1,605, it could test lower support levels. Overall, the Ethereum price is at a critical point, and traders are closely monitoring these key levels. Chainlink Technical Analysis Shows Mixed Market Signals Chainlink is currently holding above $12.50, a key support level. If it breaks past $14.58, analysts suggest it could climb to $26. This potential rise is closely tied to Bitcoin's price movements. Currently, 53% of LINK holders are at a loss, which may influence market sentiment. Technical indicators like MACD and Bull Bear Power show early signs of a possible upward trend. However, a drop below $12.50 could lead to further declines. Chainlink technical analysis indicates that maintaining support above $13.20 is crucial for a bullish outlook. Market sentiment remains mixed, with many holders near their break-even points. Overall, Chainlink technical analysis suggests cautious optimism, but key resistance levels must be overcome. Continued monitoring of Chainlink technical analysis will be essential for anticipating future price movements.

For those tired of switching between tools and still missing the mark, Web3 ai combines everything into one AI-backed dashboard. From basic trades to advanced strategies, this system makes smarter trading easier and more accessible for everyone in the market. Smart Crypto Picks for 2025 Web3 ai is shaping up to be more than just another AI-powered platform—it’s offering practical tools that matter. Features like real-time signals, portfolio rebalancing, and advanced risk models it deliver what traders need. That’s why many are already calling it the best crypto for 2025. While Ethereum price remains above $1,600 with a bullish RSI, and Chainlink technical analysis holds firm above $12.50, both coins still depend on key resistance levels. For those looking beyond price charts, this platform sets a clear example of what smart trading can look like.

43882814,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/pi-network-and-avalanche-are-growing-cold-wallets-privacy-presale-could-50x-in-2025,1745800166,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/43882814.jpeg,Pi Network and Avalanche Are Growing; Cold Wallet’s Privacy Presale Could 50x In 2025,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/pi-network-and-avalanche-are-growing-cold-wallets-privacy-presale-could-50x-in-2025,"Crypto investors chasing the next breakout are watching Pi Coin and Avalanche closely. Pi jumped 35% after a Chainlink integration, fueling speculation it could hit $3. The move suggests stronger utility and could pave the way for listings on top-tier exchanges. Meanwhile, AVAX is approaching a crucial resistance near $21, with analysts calling for a bullish reversal if volume supports a clean breakout. But while both are driven by momentum and speculation, Cold Wallet is offering something far more rare: a real solution to a growing problem. It is the only Web3 wallet that collects zero data: no IP logs, no analytics, no behavioral tracking. And it is now in Batch 1 of its presale at just $0.007. With a projected launch price near $0.35171, early buyers are looking at a potential 4,900% ROI. In a market that thrives on visibility, Cold Wallet is the one product built to keep you truly invisible, and that is starting to matter more than ever. Pi Coin Surges 35% After Chainlink Deal, Could $3 Be Next? Pi Coin jumped 35% this week after announcing a key integration with Chainlink, pushing its price to around $0.74. The collaboration allows Pi to access real-time data through Chainlink’s oracle system, which helps decentralized applications use accurate price feeds. Analysts believe this could support Pi’s adoption and may lead to listings on larger exchanges such as Binance. Market reaction was immediate. Pi rose from $0.63 to $0.78 in just hours after the update, before stabilizing slightly lower. The surge comes despite a broader monthly decline of over 40%, showing renewed investor interest in the project. Some forecasts now suggest Pi could climb to $3 in the short term, with more ambitious targets placed even higher. The project’s growing ecosystem and strong user base add to that momentum. For traders eyeing emerging altcoins with real use cases and expanding integrations, Pi’s recent moves may signal a return to the spotlight. AVAX Nears Key Resistance: Analyst Says $21 Breakout Could Trigger Full Reversal Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining attention as analyst Crypto Rand highlights a possible bullish reversal if the asset breaks above the $21 level. According to his analysis, AVAX is approaching a critical resistance zone where several technical indicators are converging. A clean move through this price point could mark the start of a broader upward trend. AVAX has faced pressure in recent weeks, but current price action is holding steady near multiple resistance levels. Crypto Rand’s outlook has caught the eye of traders looking for early signals in a still-uncertain market. If AVAX successfully clears the $21 threshold, it may attract renewed buying interest and shift market sentiment. However, the move would need to be supported by rising volume to confirm the trend reversal. AVAX’s current price structure keeps it on the radar for investors seeking assets with short-term upside potential and favorable technical setups. This Wallet Doesn’t Track You, Can’t Profile You, and Still Works Flawlessly; Cold Wallet Is What Web3 Promised Most crypto wallets claim to offer privacy, but nearly all of them collect something: your IP, your activity patterns, even the apps you connect to. Cold Wallet does none of that. It is the only Web3 wallet designed from the start to gather zero metadata. No trackers, no behavior logs, and no background surveillance. Just pure, private access to your crypto, with every layer built to protect, not observe. Cold Wallet uses zero-knowledge cryptography to make sure no one, including the wallet itself, can see your transactions, your wallet balance, or even when you log in. There is no backend logging your behavior, no analytics code quietly watching you. You stay invisible by default. Right now, Cold Wallet is in Batch 1 of its presale, priced at just $0.007. With a confirmed listing price around $0.35171, that’s an estimated 4,900% ROI if you move early. What makes Cold Wallet stand out is that it doesn’t just promise privacy, it runs on it. In a market where every app wants your data, Cold Wallet wants none of it. If you’re serious about protecting your crypto footprint, this is your moment to get in early, before everyone else realizes what real privacy in Web3 should look like. Why Cold Wallet Could Be the Smartest Long-Term Bet Pi and AVAX are gaining attention, but their stories depend on external momentum, new listings, resistance breakouts, and favorable sentiment. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, is rising for a different reason: it solves what every trader eventually realizes is a critical flaw. Today’s wallets leak data. They log behavior. They silently track everything. Cold Wallet fixes that with zero-knowledge infrastructure and a design that forgets you on purpose. It is not just for experts. It runs like an app, but protects like a vault. And right now, with a presale entry at $0.007 and a listing estimate of ~$0.35171, the opportunity is both technical and financial. That is a potential 4,900% gain on a product already built for the regulation-heavy, surveillance-heavy Web3 era that is quickly arriving. Pi might trend. AVAX might reverse. However, the Cold Wallet is where privacy becomes a performance. For investors who think long-term, this is more than an asset, and it is an edge.

Reports suggest TRUMPTAR is gearing up for listings on several major crypto exchanges. Such exposure is expected to attract millions of investors, likely driving a sharp increase in the coin’s value. Already, projections suggest a potential price surge of over 9,000% within the next few days. Currently, TRUMPTAR is only available for trading on decentralized Solana platforms such as Jup.ag and Raydium.io . Early buyers, who have access to the coin before wider exchange listings, stand to benefit the most from the anticipated price movement. The memecoin launched with an initial liquidity of over $6,000 — a notable figure compared to many new entries in the space. How to Purchase TRUMPTAR Early Investors interested in buying TRUMPTAR before its first centralized exchange (CEX) listings can do so on Raydium.io or Jup.ag . To buy, users need to connect a compatible wallet like Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom. They then swap Solana (SOL) for Trump Ends Tariffs by entering the contract address — w7h5t9MrJ77Cu2VCf2apxaMSK1KFkPf6fWNJ7uee144 — into the receiving field. For those without a compatible wallet, setting one up takes only a few minutes. Solana can be transferred from major exchanges like Coinbase or Binance to the wallet to make the purchase. If TRUMPTAR follows the trajectory of previous viral memecoins, early investors could see returns similar to those who got in early on SHIB and DOGE, potentially creating a new generation of crypto millionaires in record time. Solana Memecoin Craze Gains Momentum With larger memecoins like SHIB, DOGE, and DogWifHat (WIF) struggling to maintain momentum in recent weeks, many investors are turning their attention to emerging Solana memecoins such as TRUMPTAR. Despite having no inherent value or utility, these new tokens are attracting speculative investors hoping to capitalize on rapid price growth. The excitement around TRUMPTAR highlights the ongoing appetite for high-risk, high-reward opportunities in the crypto market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It’s Still $0.025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-undervalued-crypto-to-buy-now-with-real-world-use-and-2500-roi-potential-its-still-0-025/,"In a sea of overpriced tokens and short-lived trends, spotting an undervalued cryptocurrency that actually delivers something useful is a rare advantage. Most investors tend to chase what’s already pumped, but some are now turning their attention to projects that are still early, still building, and still offering massive upside. One name keeps coming up in those conversations: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Still priced at just $0.025, MUTM is gaining momentum as a real-world decentralized finance (DeFi) solution—not another meme coin or hype-based token. With analysts pointing to a potential 2,500% return in the coming year, long-term crypto investors are locking in early positions before the price climbs in upcoming presale phases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is built around a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that enables users to lend and borrow digital assets directly, without the need for third-party involvement. Users can lend assets to earn passive yield or borrow against their crypto without selling—providing access to capital while keeping long-term exposure. The platform uses secure, transparent smart contracts to manage the entire process. Unlike many projects that try to imitate popular platforms, Mutuum built its own system from the ground up. The platform features a revenue-driven approach, allocating a portion of its earnings to purchase MUTM tokens directly from the open market. These tokens are then shared with users who hold mtTokens, which represent their deposit positions. This model supports long-term engagement by channeling platform activity into meaningful value redistribution. By directing protocol-generated revenue toward token repurchases and user rewards, Mutuum creates a system where active participants benefit directly from ecosystem growth—an approach that has drawn attention from more experienced investors. One feature setting Mutuum apart is the development of its own overcollateralized stablecoin. Minted through excess collateral locked in the system, this stablecoin offers a way to unlock liquidity without abandoning long-term holdings. It will play a major role in Mutuum’s borrowing system, adding another layer of utility to the ecosystem. Yield generation is also straightforward. When users deposit assets into the protocol, they receive mtTokens, which continuously accumulate interest based on platform activity. These tokens are flexible—users can hold them, redeem them, or use them in other decentralized finance applications. That means real passive income potential, not just speculation. MUTM has a total supply of 4 billion tokens, and the ongoing presale has already seen 420 million tokens sold and over $7 million raised. With nearly 9,000 holders already participating, demand is climbing as the price prepares to rise to $0.03 in the next phase. There are 11 phases total, each offering a higher price point than the last. This creates a natural pressure to get in early. Once the token goes live and major exchange listings kick in, exposure will likely grow exponentially. Combined with the buy-and-redistribute model, this setup is already driving strong FOMO from those watching the presale closely. Let’s run the numbers on what this could look like in practice. An investment of $1,800 at the current price of $0.025 would secure 72,000 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $0.65, that same position would grow to $46,800. And when MUTM climbs closer to the $1 mark over time, you’re looking at a portfolio worth $72,000—all from getting in early, before the broader market catches on. MUTM checks all the right boxes: utility, transparent tokenomics, community traction, and room to grow. It isn’t relying on hype or influencer tweets. Instead, it’s building tools that actually matter in decentralized finance. This isn’t about catching a short-term pump. It’s about identifying a project early—before exchange listings, before media buzz, and before the crowd catches on. With solid fundamentals and a realistic path to real-world use, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may just be the best cryptocurrency to invest in now for those chasing long-term growth and real yield. And at $0.025, it’s still early enough to make every dollar count.

43885138,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=716772,1745805019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43885138.jpeg,Term Finance recovers $1M after oracle bug triggers $1.6M liquidation loss,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/term-finance-recovers-1m-after-loss/,"The Ethereum-based lending platform Term Finance said it had recovered nearly one million dollars after a misconfigured price oracle caused erroneous liquidations in its Treehouse (tETH) market. The issue began when a new ETH oracle provided incorrect price data to the system. This caused automatic liquidations, approximately $1.6 million worth of positions. Term Finance clarified in a post on X that the incident was not a hack, no smart contracts were involved, and no users were attacked, explaining that a technical bug in the configuration of the new oracle caused the issue. The episode again shows how vital oracle feeds are to the DeFi ecosystem. Even tiny things can be catastrophic when it comes to smart contracts. Term finance recovers half of lost funds Term Finance immediately pressed to recover the missing assets. Of the 918 ETH lost in total, they recovered 556 ETH. In particular, 223.197 ETH, valued at around $400,000, was seized by the platform internally. Another 333 ETH, worth roughly $600,000, was returned after what Term called “negotiations.” It also remains unknown who was included in the negotiation or on what terms the pact was made. The company has not yet disclosed additional information regarding the method. With the recovery attempts, the remaining loss is now 362.03 ETH — approximately $650,000 at today’s market rates. That’s much less damaging than the one before, and it takes some pressure off Term Finance and its community. The website did not acknowledge this until media coverage surfaced, and the company has since declared that it will conduct a thorough review of its Oracle integration process to avoid such problems in the future. It also suggested that users affected by the bad liquidations might be eligible for further compensation, though no formal decision had been made. Weekend crypto attacks spark industry scrutiny The Term Finance incident wasn’t crypto’s only bad news over the weekend. The DeFi industry was rocked by a chain of attacks, highlighting the continued risk. Impermax Finance said Saturday that a flash loan attack hit its V3 pools. The exploit siphoned more than $150,000 out of the protocol, according to the blockchain security firm TenArmor. Impermax apologized to users and said a full post-mortem would be released soon. For its part, another Solana DeFi platform, Loopscale , lost $5.8 million in an exploit. Attackers took advantage of security holes, contributing to a growing tally of DeFi losses this year. A centralized platform is also not an exception. Crypto exchange Bitget revealed a $20 million loss after hackers exploited a market connected to an obscure token. Bitget said it had discovered eight accounts suspected of being involved in the scheme and would seek legal action against those behind them. The most recent attacks underline how insecure even the biggest players are. The data suggests that very little is recovered from many hacks. Take Bybit CEO Ben Zhou, for example; He disclosed recently that just 3.84% of stolen funds from their February heist had been frozen. Nearly 28% of the stolen funds — worth millions of dollars — have already gone “dark,” flowing into mixers and peer-to-peer networks, where they become impossible to trace. It was a rare victory compared to many other cases in which victims come up empty-handed. And yet, the incident displays a fundamental weakness in the overall security standards and risk management practices in the DeFi industry. The larger DeFi becomes, the higher the stakes and some projects may soon regret not budgeting more for technical failures.

Bitcoin and XRP have long held the spotlight, but one new name is entering the conversation with speed and structure: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . With market momentum building and investor eyes scanning for 2025’s big play, these three names are emerging not just as short-term picks—but as long-term strategies for real wealth growth. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Shaping Up to Be a High-Conviction Wealth Play Some tokens explode and fade. Others build the foundations quietly—and then take over. MAGACOINFINANCE appears to be the latter. It’s not just early—it’s early and executing. Wallets are growing daily, the community is expanding with real participation, and analyst mentions are starting to include MAGACOINFINANCE in serious wealth-building forecasts. What stands out is the way this project has avoided fluff. No overhype, no over-promising—just a clear, growing platform with the potential to rival the early days of Bitcoin-style entry points. For investors with long-term vision, this may be one of the last tokens still early enough to move on. Rising in Parallel: Ethereum, Polygon, Tron, and Arbitrum Ethereum continues to dominate smart contract innovation. Its Layer-2 integrations and network upgrades keep it vital across every use case. Polygon is Ethereum’s trusted scaling engine, pushing transaction speeds and onboarding major real-world partners—from corporations to institutions. Tron keeps volume high and transaction costs low, especially in Asia and among fintech products. It’s one of the most adopted blockchains for payments. Arbitrum is leading the Ethereum Layer-2 conversation, providing scalability and seamless user experiences for decentralized app developers. Each of these platforms is strong—but their early breakout phase is largely behind them. MAGACOINFINANCE , however, is just entering it. Final Word Looking ahead to 2025, the names that may define the year are already taking shape. Bitcoin and XRP continue to prove why they’re essential. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is starting to look like the next big crypto story in the making. The time to find tomorrow’s wealth builders is now—before they become today’s headlines.

When momentum builds, it builds fast—and the market is buzzing about two names that are setting the pace: Solana and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . One is a proven powerhouse gaining fresh traction. The other is a bold new contender that’s turning heads before the mainstream even notices. This is the moment investors dream about—when a project moves from early whispers to loud watchlist alerts. And right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is doing exactly that. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Picking Up Speed With Zero Gimmicks Some tokens go viral for a week. MAGACOINFINANCE is doing something far more sustainable—it’s building. The excitement isn’t artificial. It’s the result of measured execution, steady wallet adoption, and growing attention from research-driven investors. Community channels are growing daily. Social conversations are shifting from “What is this?” to “How early am I?” And perhaps most importantly, the token is showing signs of real structure: transparent development, active leadership, and a clear roadmap that people can actually follow. Momentum is no longer speculative—it’s visible. Solana Stays Hot With Performance and Expansion Solana has been here before—and it’s coming back stronger. Known for its lightning-fast processing and low transaction costs, Solana’s recent uptick isn’t just another rally—it’s tied to actual expansion across apps, integrations, and ecosystem upgrades. With developer activity on the rise and major apps continuing to choose Solana as their foundation, the token is once again showing that it can capture serious volume when the market warms up. Also Trending: NEAR Protocol, Chainlink, Ethereum, and Aave NEAR Protocol is gaining respect for its fast-growing development community and user-focused scalability. It’s quietly becoming a platform of choice for app builders and startups entering Web3. Chainlink continues to be indispensable. As smart contract platforms demand secure, off-chain data inputs, Chainlink remains the most trusted source in the oracle space. Ethereum is still the beating heart of blockchain infrastructure. Layer-2 growth, staking upgrades, and enterprise engagement keep it at the center of any serious discussion. Aave stands tall in on-chain lending and asset management. With continued innovation and flexibility, it’s a staple for those looking to build financial primitives on-chain. These projects are strong, yes—but they’re also established. The excitement now? It’s centered around MAGACOINFINANCE , where early means opportunity—and opportunity is shrinking fast. Final Word $10,000 in 30 days? It’s ambitious—but not unheard of in crypto. Timing is everything. Solana is proving it still has fire. MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is showing it’s more than talk—it’s motion. This might be your window—before the rest of the market catches up.

Feist, who had the blockchain’s “ danksharding ” data storage solution named after him, put forward EIP-9698 on April 27, which would introduce a “deterministic gas limit growth schedule” starting at epoch 369017, or around June 1. The proposal would gradually increase the gas limit by a factor of 10 for roughly two years, or 164,250 epochs, when one final tenfold increase would occur. Ethereum clients would need to vote on the proposal for it to take effect, Feist said. “By introducing a predictable exponential growth pattern as a client default, this EIP encourages a sustainable and transparent gas limit trajectory, aligned with expected advancements in hardware and protocol efficiency,” he added. As Ethereum can occasionally reach up to 20 TPS in blocks dominated by simple transactions, a 100x gas limit increase could theoretically increase Ethereum’s TPS to 2,000. Feist’s proposal would better position Ethereum to compete with the likes of Solana, which currently processes a non-vote TPS between 800 to 1,050 and has a theoretical TPS of 65,000. Source: Fabda.eth The EIP would expand the current gas limit of 36 million to 3.6 billion, potentially allowing around 6,000 transactions to fit into Ethereum blocks. Feist’s proposal comes after Ethereum validators agreed to raise the gas limit from 30 million to 36 million in February. Before that, the last change to Ethereum’s gas limit occurred in August 2021 under the London hard fork, where the figure was roughly doubled from 15 million to 30 million. Daily change in Ethereum Average Gas Limit over the last five years. Source: YCharts Feist acknowledged that a rapid increase in the gas limit under his proposal may stress less-optimized nodes and increase block propagation times. “However, the exponential schedule with very gradual increments per epoch gives node operators and developers ample time to adapt and optimize,” he said. Related: Ethereum community members propose new fee structure for the app layer EIP-9698 marks the Ethereum community’s latest effort to boost scalability at the base layer after predominantly focusing on scaling through layer 2 solutions in recent years. Critics of Ethereum’s layer-2 focused strategy claim that it has fragmented the ecosystem into several siloed chains with little interoperability, leading to a worse user experience. EIP-9678 looks to increase gas limit Ethereum developers are also looking to test a fourfold increase of Ethereum’s gas limit in the Fusaka hard fork under EIP-9678. Fusaka has been flagged as possibly going online in late 2025, while the next major Ethereum upgrade, Pectra, is scheduled to go live on the mainnet in May.

A wallet named “GASW,” created on March 6, 2025, just bought 48 million Pi coins — and none of them are locked. This could mean that a major player, like a company, institution, or even a government, is getting involved. Other Positive Catalysts: Binance, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, has shared new listing guidelines that have caught the attention of the crypto world — especially fans of Pi Coin. Since the platform now has more direct rules for adding new tokens, many believe this could open the door for Pi Coin to be listed on Binance soon. Meanwhile, the Pi Network team recently shared a roadmap for their migration process to improve transparency and respond to user concerns. However, the update left many disappointed, as it didn’t include details like how many users are still waiting or how many accounts can be migrated each day.

A group of RTFKT users led by Jagdeep Cheema claimed in the proposed class suit filed in a Brooklyn federal court on April 25 that they suffered “significant damages” as a result of Nike touting its sneaker-themed NFTs to gain investors, then shuttering the platform. The suit claimed the NFTs were unregistered securities, as Nike sold them without registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It accused the company of using “its iconic brand and marketing prowess to hype, promote, and prop up the unregistered securities that RTFKT sold.” “Because the Nike NFTs derived their value from the success of a given promoter and project — here, Nike and its marketing efforts — investors purchased this digital asset with the hope that its value would increase in the future as the project grows in popularity based on the Nike brand,” the lawsuit argued. The class suit claimed investors suffered damages due to Nike shutting its NFT platform. Source: CourtListener The lawsuit asks for $5 million in damages, claiming Nike broke consumer protection laws and violated various state unfair trade and competition laws. A US court hasn’t definitively ruled on whether NFTs are securities. Still, in an April 9 letter to the SEC, marketplace OpenSea urged the regulator to exclude NFTs from federal securities laws, arguing they don’t meet the legal definition of a security. In its case against Nike, the class group said that the court doesn’t necessarily need to rule on the legal status of NFTs to address the complaint. NFT market value dips In 2021, Nike acquired the NFT firm RTFKT Studios, which created virtual sneakers. According to the complaint, holders of the resulting Nike NFTs were told the tokens could be traded peer-to-peer on the secondary market and used to complete challenges and quests that could lead to rewards. Nike’s crypto kick NFT collection was changing hands for an average of 3.5 Ether ( ETH ), or around $8,000 when they were first listed on April 18, 2022, but were trading for around 0.009 Ether, or roughly $16 as of April 21, according to OpenSea. Nike NFTs have seen a sharp drop in value since they were first listed. Source: OpenSea Nike shut down RTFKT in January , which the class suit claims decimated investors when “prices plunged and did not recover,” and also took away the chance to take part in the challenges and quests, which the group argued was a primary reason for purchasing the tokens. Related: RTFKT’s CloneX avatars reappear after issue blacks out NFTs The overall NFT market dropped sharply in the first quarter of 2025, with sales plunging 63% year-over-year, to $1.5 billion in total sales from January to March 2025, down from $4.1 billion during the same period in 2024.

This ETF is expected to go live on April 30th, 2025. While it’s not a spot ETF — which tracks the actual price of XRP — it’s still a huge step forward for XRP’s recognition on Wall Street. The ETF approval comes just a few years after Ripple, the company behind XRP, was locked in a long legal battle with the SEC. Now, XRP is moving from courtrooms to trading floors, joining the ranks of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which already have both futures and spot ETFs. Some investors were unsure at first, asking, “Why futures and not spot?” But futures ETFs are often the first step. This was the path for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and experts believe a spot XRP ETF could be next. Futures trading allows big institutional investors to take positions on XRP, whether the market goes up or down — a common and healthy part of mature financial markets. BREAKING: SEC Approves an $XRP ETF — and It's HUGE No, it’s not a Spot ETF yet. It’s a Futures ETF — but don’t underestimate what this means.

The sharp increase shows a new phase of integration between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). These deals fall into five main trends: companies buying Bitcoin for their treasuries (like Twenty One Capital), traditional firms merging with crypto infrastructure providers, acquisitions focused on institutional services (like Ripple buying Metaco), consolidation between crypto and traditional trading platforms, and mergers between token-based projects. But one deal in particular is drawing high praise — especially from pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton. Deaton recently pointed to Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of prime brokerage firm Hidden Road as “possibly the best example” of the TradFi-DeFi convergence happening in crypto. Hidden Road processes over $3 trillion a year for more than 300 institutional clients. By integrating with Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL), settlement times have dropped from 24 hours to just 3–5 seconds. I agree with Chamath. I also believe @Ripple ’s $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road as possibly the best example of the convergence of TradFi and DeFi in all of crypto.

Deaton explained how this move positions Ripple at the forefront of institutional DeFi by combining DeFi’s speed with TradFi’s reach. He also opened up about the importance of Ripple’s rapid expansion into crypto custody. In addition to acquiring Metaco, Ripple has bought Standard Custody and launched “Ripple Custody” to offer institutions a full suite of services — from payments and stablecoins to asset storage. Why the big push into custody? Deaton believes Ripple is preparing for the tokenization boom. With the custody market expected to grow beyond $16 trillion by 2030, Ripple is building the tools banks will need to tokenize stocks, bonds, or even real estate using the XRPL — with RLUSD powering these transactions. “It looks like [CEO] Brad Garlinghouse is making up for lost time,” Deaton said, referring to Ripple’s progress after its long legal battle with the SEC.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 03:34:44

Following a volatile end to 2024, THORChain’s native token, RUNE, suffered a sharp correction in Q1 2025 and ended up closing the quarter at $1.14, down 74.5% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). This significantly underperformed major digital assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum falling by 12.6% and 45.5%, respectively. RUNE’s market capitalization dropped 73.8% over the same period, as it plunged from $1.5 billion to $400.9 million, its lowest level since mid-2022. THORChain’s USD TVL Drops 50% According to Messari’s latest report , the slump in RUNE’s value heavily impacted THORChain’s DeFi footprint, as total value locked (TVL) in USD terms fell by 50.5%, from $368.6 million to $181.1 million by the end of the quarter. TVL had peaked at $367.7 million on January 2, before sliding in step with RUNE’s declining price. Despite the steep losses in USD terms, native participation in THORChain’s ecosystem remained strong. In fact, RUNE-denominated TVL climbed 93.2% QoQ, after increasing from 82.2 million to 158.8 million RUNE. Messari said that the figure pointed to growing user activity and confidence in the protocol’s multichain liquidity infrastructure even amid volatile pricing. THORChain Swap Volumes Dip Swap activity, however, painted a more muted picture. Average daily swap volume fell 24.4% QoQ to $68.8 million, reversing the previous quarter’s momentum and continuing a downward trend from the $218.4 million daily average seen in early January. A notable exception occurred on March 2, when THORChain processed a record $1.05 billion in swaps in a single day. This anomalous spike followed the Bybit exploit, as attackers utilized the protocol to convert stolen ETH into BTC. While this inflated weekly throughput figures, it did not meaningfully alter the broader decline in organic activity. On-chain data also showed a drop in user engagement, with the average number of daily swappers declining 14.5% QoQ to 1,780. However, usage remained widely distributed across wallets and affiliates, which indicated that while overall volume fell, the protocol’s infrastructure continued to support a broad base of participants. “The sustained participation reflects the protocol’s continued role as a backend settlement layer for multichain swaps, even as broader market volatility and RUNE’s price drawdown weighed on user activity.” The post RUNE Slump Hits THORChain’s DeFi USD TVL in Q1, But Native Deposits Surge appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|THORChain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|RUNE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-28 03:41:06

Bitcoin ( BTC ) felt “noticeably different” over the trading week ended April 25, NYDIG’s global head of research Greg Cipolaro said in an April 25 market note . “We’ve been observing subtle shifts in its behavior over the past few weeks,” he added. “The decoupling from traditional risk assets is still very early and fragile, but for those watching crypto markets 24/7, the shift is palpable.” “Bitcoin has acted less like a liquid levered version of levered US equity beta and more like the non-sovereign issued store of value that it is.” Cipolaro noted that Bitcoin has gained more than 13% since the beginning of April, while US markets such as the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq have declined amid escalating global trade tensions due to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. He added that the US dollar and long-term US Treasurys have also underperformed since the election and Trump’s April 2 “ Liberation Day ” tariff announcements, which lumped every country with various rates, the minimum being 10%. Gold and currencies such as the Swiss franc have been consistent winners as safe havens, Cipolaro said, noting that Bitcoin is emerging as a non-sovereign store of value. Amid surging volatility in equities, measured with the VIX index, foreign exchange rates (CVIX index), and interest rates and bonds (MOVE index), investors have been on the hunt for these safe haven assets . Several asset classes have recently seen high volatility. Source: NYDIG Cipolaro said investors are also seeking alternatives to US hegemony, whether that is stocks, bonds, forex, or commodities. Few large liquid options However, Cipolaro said investors seeking alternatives outside traditional financial systems have few large, liquid options. Gold remains the largest non-sovereign store of value at around a $22 trillion market cap, while Bitcoin has just a fraction of that at $1.8 trillion. Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in May — Here is why Additionally, Bitcoin is the only top crypto asset listed that “solely focuses on monetary or store of value use cases,” while the others are better described as the fuel for decentralized application platforms, he said. Cipolaro concluded that despite Bitcoin’s recent gains, “there are few signs of the market overheating,” and the recovery is still in early stages.

Over 80,000 ETH have moved into derivative exchanges in this brief timeframe, an inflow of a scale that seasoned market watchers typically view as a setup for significant price movements. And historically, these kinds of inflows have meant that deep-pocketed players are up to something, usually something not great for the price. Someone’s prepping for a move… Over 80,000 $ETH just flowed into derivative exchanges in the last 48 hours. That’s not a number you brush off. Historically, inflows like this signal incoming volatility—and usually lean bearish. Buckle up. pic.twitter.com/fHcZQCmMvq — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) April 25, 2025 However, it is not only the scale of these inflows that has struck observers but also their timing and the subsequent trading actions. One trader, closely watched over the past couple of days, said to have lost $208,000 by aggressively shorting the market when the time was very much not right. This shows how, in times of heightened uncertainty, it’s quite easy for even the very experienced to get surprised. One Trader’s Costly Bet Against ETH On April 24, the afternoon of which this particular trader chose for his ill-fated foray into Ethereum’s short side, ETH was anything but a falling knife. Despite the best efforts of the trader to hammer down the price (and despite significant selling all across the crypto market, which on that day featured a number of bearish headlines), Ethereum found support at around $1,750 and, later in the night, reclaimed the closely watched $1,800 level. Nevertheless, the trader pressed on. A few hours after ETH took back the $1,800 marker, he personally borrowed another 4,000 ETH (worth about $7.25 million then) from decentralized lending protocol Aave and short-sold it at $1,808.60. This one didn’t go as well for him either. And again, it suggests he believes downward pressure is imminent for Ethereum. This sort of behavior—both big inflows of ETH to derivatives platforms and the spree of short selling by certain large traders—looks bearish. It seems to point in the direction of a segment of the market that has a decidedly negative outlook on Ethereum’s short-term price prospects. 这老哥对于摸顶卖空 $ETH 很执着啊 ：昨天他才因为卖空 ETH 导致亏损 $20.8 万，昨晚半夜 ETH 涨上 $1,800 后他又继续卖空了 4,000 ETH。 ◎他昨天下午才把借币卖空的 8,000 枚 ETH 买回来把仓位平掉，亏损了 $20.8 万。 ◎昨晚半夜时，ETH 重新站上 $1,800，于是老哥又再次从 Aave 借出 4,000 ETH… https://t.co/8AwkUVvpFI pic.twitter.com/fdOliKQ9lN — 余烬 (@EmberCN) April 26, 2025 And when we try to make sense of this, one possible explanation that emerges is simply that sentiment in the derivatives market is not in sync with what spot market participants are doing. Spot Ethereum ETFs See Strong Inflows, Offering a Bullish Counterbalance This bearish derivative action is occurring simultaneously with robust spot ETF performance. On April 25, Spot Ethereum ETFs notched net inflows of $104 million, with not a single ETF in the Ethereum space reporting a net outflow. That’s a striking contrast to the derivatives side of the market and may indicate that retail and institutional investors see long-term value in Ethereum, even if they are deriding its price performance on a short-term basis. This divergence in market behavior—bullish ETF inflows vs. bearish derivative signals—creates a complex and somewhat contradictory near-term outlook for Ethereum. One hand suggests derivative traders are positioning for a correction, possibly to be triggered by macro factors, regulatory uncertainty, or just-took-gains profit-taking after recent rallies. Yet, the other hand—that’s not anything near an order of four—shows a continuously liquid spot ETF market for ETH that cannot possibly uphold a bearish scenario. On April 25, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $380 million, marking six consecutive days of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $104 million, with no net outflows across all nine ETFs. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 26, 2025 Ethereum’s recent price action has also been centered around the important $1,800 level that seems to be acting as a battleground between bulls and bears. In terms of inflows and ETF setups, investors are more inclined to bet on Ethereum’s long-term developments, especially with the anticipated changes in Ethereum 2.0. With all this activity, traders and investors should prepare for possible volatility. It’s not clear if Ethereum will keep climbing or get hit with some more selling pressure, but it’s pretty clear that it’s going to do something—and soon. If it does something in either the spot or derivatives market, watch out below: big trades can send huge ripples through both markets. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

However, it has now rebounded quite remarkably, and some folks (like this author) who are Bitcoin bulls and believe in the digital asset’s potential are hopeful and even somewhat confident about the big breakout to $94K and beyond. This was an unexpected breakout event for the digital asset, and it’s happening at a time when the world is more divided and in conflict than ever. Bitcoin's unexpected breakout has flipped the script for the crypto community. Data shows a surge in optimism from the crowd as $BTC rebounded above $95K for the first time since February. As for the level of greed being measured across social media, this is the highest spike… pic.twitter.com/cbdEt41xo4 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 25, 2025 Rising Macro Tensions and Institutional Support Fuel Bitcoin’s Rebound Bitcoin’s resurgence above $95K comes in a globally uncertain macroeconomic environment. The tariff wars, rising geopolitical tensions, and inflation worries have cast a pall of fear and instability over the old-school financial markets. This kind of atmosphere has often been very good for Bitcoin, presumed by many to be a “safe-haven” asset during times of unease. Gold has long held that same mantle, but Bitcoin is now clearly in the conversation. And if things keep going the way they have been, the conversation might get a lot louder. It is not only the state of the macroeconomy that has brought Bitcoin back. The recovery has, in large part, been driven by a huge uptick in institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Heavyweights such as BlackRock have continued to shove force into Bitcoin and the crypto space writ large. Their recent participation in the recovery, along with the much-wanted movement toward institutional adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, has added a level of street cred and stability to the market that had been largely absent. As Bitcoin has recovered as high as $95.8K today, we are seeing the highest week of net inflows to $BTC ETF's since the week before Trump's inauguration in mid-January. Institutions like Blackrock have played a large part in the crypto-wide bounce traders were waiting for. pic.twitter.com/jUxNM8wo75 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 25, 2025 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted an enormous $380 million in net inflows for the week ending April 25, 2025, marking the highest weekly net inflows since the week before Trump’s inauguration in mid-January. This trend is signaling something very positive for Bitcoin. It suggests that the interest in Bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset is going mainstream, especially among the kinds of large institutional players who presumably also have a lot of influence over retail investor sentiment. On April 25, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $380 million, marking six consecutive days of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $104 million, with no net outflows across all nine ETFs. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 26, 2025 The Crowd’s Growing Optimism and Rising Greed When Bitcoin soared over the $95,000 mark, there was a marked increase in the overall optimism of the crypto community. While the price of Bitcoin never dipped below $88,000 from November 20 to December 31, 2024, the sentiment surrounding crypto in general had many people thinking it was DOA (dead on arrival) for any chance of a near-term price recovery. On Christmas Day, Bitcoin’s price was at $91,550. Then it climbed to… Despite the growing optimism about the market, some analysts have raised concerns that this could simply be a sign of an incipient top, with excessive greed and hubris fueling the latest rally. For the Bitcoin price to keep going up, there needs to be a sufficient base of retail investors willing to purchase the leading cryptocurrency. If too many traders try to take profits, it creates an opportunity for the institutional investors and whales who have been buying up the lower dips in Bitcoin to push the price up even further. The crowd’s sentiment is crucial in deciding whether Bitcoin can carry on with its present momentum or must soon retrace its steps. If the market gets too greedy and retail traders rush to take profits, we may see a temporary pullback in Bitcoin’s price. On the other hand, if the market remains patient and controlled greed is the order of the day, we could see Bitcoin push further into the uncharted territory of prices it has not seen before. In either case, sentiment is of the utmost importance. Bitcoin’s Future Outlook: Will $100K Be Within Reach? With Bitcoin approaching $95K, the question on many investors’ minds is whether the cryptocurrency can keep up its current trajectory and finally break through the $100K barrier. The road to $100K may not be without its bumps, but the combination of strong institutional support, an increasingly worrisome macroeconomic picture, and a steadily rising tide of retail and institutional investors gives Bitcoin a solid foundation to continue its upward movement. To conclude, the crypto space has been revitalized by Bitcoin’s recent surge, with both retail and institutional investors looking to the cryptocurrency as an all-but-certain store of value. We’re at the highest levels of market optimism and institutional inflows since Trump was inaugurated, and now it’s time for Bitcoin to take a crucial test—can it either maintain this momentum or avoid a serious retracement? At this point, with a stronger than ever market position, only a severe plot twist could deny Bitcoin’s re-ascendance. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The platform’s resurgence began with a strategic overhaul, including the launch of Euler v2, fresh audits of the system, and key partnerships with prominent industry players. By the end of April 2025, Euler’s Total Value Locked (TVL) had rocketed to $1.5 billion, a remarkable turnaround that showcases the platform’s resilience and ability to rebuild trust within the DeFi community. Euler Finance’s Resilient Comeback 2023 was a dark chapter in the history of Euler Finance. During that year, hackers took advantage of a few vulnerabilities in the Euler Finance code and made off with $197 million. The hack sent shockwaves through the DeFi space—was Euler ever going to get back to where it was? It was a good question. The answer, in my opinion, is yes—and the first step in that direction was the launch of Euler v2 in September 2024. Euler reborn: TVL сlimbs to $1.5B In March 2023, hackers stole $197M from the @eulerfinance lending protocol. Euler’s strong comeback began with the launch of Euler v2, followed by fresh audits, @gauntlet_xyz joining as risk manager, and backing from @wintermute_t . Since v2… pic.twitter.com/aSq4JFiaSu — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 25, 2025 Euler version 2 brought forth a wealth of new capabilities—improved security, better user interfaces, and optimizations that pretty much made the whole platform run better. From those updates, it was able to regain the confidence of its previous users and even add new participants to the mix. The v2 upgrade also marked a turn in the road that led to a series of strategic moves that made Euler what it is today. In addition to making technical upgrades, Euler Finance brought in outside auditors to ensure that any remaining vulnerabilities in the protocol had been eliminated and that its security was now sufficiently strong to prevent any future hacks. Audits like this one are a standard and important part of the assurance process in the blockchain space, and they played a crucial role in signaling to the community that the Euler platform was now safe to use. Even after this audit was completed, Euler Finance further increased its security assurances by bringing in the risk management firm Gauntlet to do ongoing risk assessments of the protocol. Strategic Partnerships and Growing Network Apart from technical improvements and risk management upgrades, Euler Finance obtained backing from a prominent crypto liquidity provider, Wintermute. Not only did Wintermute provide some much-needed financial backing, but its participation in the Euler project also helped to significantly boost the platform’s liquidity—an absolutely vital factor for the successful operation of any lending protocol. Euler Finance further widened its reach by integrating with many blockchains. Since it launched Euler v2, the protocol now serves a set of networks in addition to Ethereum. This set includes Avalanche (AVAX), Berachain, and several other ecosystems. By using a multi-chain strategy, Euler has been able to reach more diverse sets of users and serve a more diverse set of blockchain ecosystems. Consequently, Euler’s market share has grown fairly significantly over the last year. One of Euler’s revival’s standout accomplishments has been the remarkable growth of its TVL. Since the release of v2, Euler’s TVL has skyrocketed from a modest $4.5 million to an impressive $1.44 billion, with close to $1 billion of that locked on Ethereum. The protocol’s ability to corral such a goodly amount of capital, even in light of the past security problems it faced, speaks loud and clear about its greatly enhanced functionality and the strong demand for decentralized lending services. A Bright Future Ahead for Euler Finance Euler Finance’s astounding revival is a testament to the platform’s durability and the resilience of the broader DeFi ecosystem. By tackling security issues directly, beefing up its product, and securing key partnerships, Euler has not only bounced back from the hack but also emerged as one of the leading DeFi lending platforms right now. With a protocol TVL of $1.5 billion, it is once again a trusted part of the DeFi community. With Euler v2 now fully functioning and a solid platform established, the prospects for growth in the next few years look good. Attracting new users seems a safe bet, as the expansion to multiple blockchains will likely continue to pull in fresh traffic. And attracting new users is pretty much Job #1 for Gauntlet, which ensures that risk management remains a priority as Euler scales. For investors and users in the DeFi space, Euler Finance offers a compelling option in the realm of decentralized lending and borrowing. Its strong security, innovative features, and growing multi-chain presence make it a protocol to watch as the DeFi landscape continues to evolve. In terms of total value locked, Euler appears to be expanding its market presence quite nicely. Total value locked has generally been a reliable metric for assessing the market footprint of any particular DeFi protocol. As services like Euler continue to attract more liquidity and seem to be fortifying trust among users, they are also driving decentralized finance further into the mainstream.

Over the past week, Bitcoin has not moved in lockstep with major stock indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. This seems to signal a fascinating shift in its role in global financial markets. The correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500, once at a relatively high 0.68, has now dropped all the way down to 0.27. This is a big change for a cryptocurrency that has spent the last year following the same ups and downs as the stock market. Even as Bitcoin’s ties to traditional stocks appear to be weakening, its links to gold seem to be enshrined in ever-more-solid ground. Recent data have revealed that Bitcoin’s correlation with the precious metal has really taken off and is now at a more pronounced -0.51, up from a modest 0.05. If folks are making a case for seeing Bitcoin as even more akin to gold than stocks, it’s probably not a bad case to make. ""Bitcoin Breaks Away from Stocks, Moves Closer to Gold "" — OKX Ventures (@OKX_Ventures) April 25, 2025 Bitcoin’s Position in the Market: A Growing Share of Gold’s Market Cap The changing relationship between Bitcoin and traditional assets, like stocks, reflects a broader shift in the cryptocurrency’s position within global financial markets. As Bitcoin’s correlation with gold strengthens, it is slowly becoming a more direct competitor to the precious metal in terms of being a store of value. This transition is highlighted by Bitcoin’s growing share of the gold market, which, according to Cryptorank, stands at 11% in 2025. Although Bitcoin’s market share in gold has decreased a little over time, the trend shows that Bitcoin’s Total Addressable Market (TAM) is still growing, as the actual global gold market is also growing. This market share expansion emphasizes Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance as an alternative digital wealth preservation vehicle. Bitcoin now makes up 11% of gold’s market size As gold’s market cap continues to grow, #Bitcoin share stands at 11% in 2025. Even though the percentage has slightly declined, #Bitcoin ’s Total Addressable Market (TAM) keeps expanding as the gold market grows. pic.twitter.com/8GyGZ9HH8x — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 23, 2025 For a long time, gold has been regarded as a safe haven asset. It is valued by investors for its stability and its role as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. It is becoming increasingly correlated with Bitcoin, though, and many investors are starting to see the leading cryptocurrency as a potential alternative to gold. Because of the shift in perception in regard to Bitcoin, we might be looking at a new phase in the life of the leading cryptocurrency. The Implications of Bitcoin’s Divergence from Stocks The implications for traditional investors and those in the cryptocurrency market from Bitcoin’s decoupling from U.S. stocks are significant. For investors in both worlds, it has been long established that Bitcoin’s movements have been closely aligned with traditional stock market indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Yet as that correlation continues to decline, we can see that Bitcoin’s price movements are becoming less tethered to the performance of traditional equities. This shift could provide new occasions for investors. As Bitcoin moves more in line with the gold market, it may well become an attractive asset for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Bitcoin’s price behavior, in increasing tandem with gold’s, offers some signal that it too will serve a similar port in the storm for investors who want to protect their wealth from uncertainties. Also, Bitcoin’s increasing connection with gold could affect how institutional investors look at the crypto market. If Bitcoin demonstrates relative strength and a propensity for more stability than stocks, it might begin to claim a larger share of investment capital from these large players as part of their overall strategies. The Future of Bitcoin as a Digital Store of Value As Bitcoin keeps on developing, its ever-growing parallel with gold makes it a real rival in the universe of classical assets. It seems obvious now that the correlation between the two is strengthening; therefore, one must concede that Bitcoin’s pathway toward becoming a digital store of value is now clear. Even though its market share in gold has decreased slightly, one must now acknowledge that Bitcoin’s potential to seriously upset the classical asset universe continues to grow. In the future, it appears that Bitcoin will no longer be competing directly with stocks and bonds and will instead be on a similar playing field as gold. Bitcoin’s price and market share are moving more and more into the realm of redefining the role of precious metals in the global economy. And with those changes to the role of digital assets surely comes some recalibration of the global economy for digital asset holders. As this trend develops, investors will have to keep an eye on the continuing association between Bitcoin, stocks, and gold. Right now, it is very much evident that Bitcoin is putting itself out there as more than just a highly speculative asset. It is, in fact, a potential safe-haven asset with a few interesting twists that are worth noting. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The network is demonstrating its durability and user appeal, and also developer appeal, with a series of impressive metrics. Data monitored by Lookonchain tell the story quite well. Growth across several key indicators has really picked up. And those key indicators are: Total Value Locked (TVL), DEX (decentralized exchange) trading volume, and stablecoin supply. Total Value Locked (TVL) Soars by 38% One of the most significant indicators of the Sui ecosystem’s growth is its rapidly increasing Total Value Locked (TVL). In just one week, TVL surged by an impressive 38%, reaching $1.645 billion. TVL, which represents the total value of assets locked within the ecosystem, is a critical metric for assessing the health and adoption of decentralized networks. The notable uptick in Sui’s TVL is a sign of growing confidence from users and investors alike. This surge can be attributed to a mix of reasons: the tech of the network has improved, its main projects have started rolling out new features, and it has seen an uptick in not just decentralized apps but also dApps that deliver fun, varied experiences to users. This is making the Sui network look more and more like a go-to place for DeFi projects as well as other blockchain-based apps. DEX Trading Volume Hits $599 Million, a 177% Weekly Increase An additional main measure that shows the Sui ecosystem is growing quickly is the huge amount of trading volume occurring on its decentralized exchanges. In the past week, Sui’s DEX platforms had 24-hour trading volume of $599 million. That’s up a staggering 177% from just the week before. At this rate, Sui isn’t just keeping pace with other ecosystems but is pulling ahead as a DEX trading destination. No other layer 1 or layer 2 network is coming close. The increase in trading volume on Sui’s DEX can be linked to the launch of several new features and campaigns by Sui’s core projects. These initiatives, which include new trading pairs, liquidity incentives, and improved user interfaces, have likely played a role in driving increased trading activity. Additionally, the available liquidity on Sui’s DEX platforms provides traders with the ability to execute larger transactions with lower slippage, making the platform an attractive option for users seeking efficient and cost-effective transactions. 1/ Over the past week, the Sui ecosystem has experienced significant growth. According to data monitored by Lookonchain: TVL increased by 38%, reaching $1.645 billion; DEX 24-hour trading volume reached $599 million, a 177% week-over-week increase; The total stablecoin… — OKX Ventures (@OKX_Ventures) April 26, 2025 The increase in trading volume is also proof of rising developer confidence in the Sui blockchain. This, in turn, seems to be spurring the building of even more innovative, decentralized financial products on the Sui platform. Meanwhile, traders and liquidity providers are starting to show up in significant numbers. All of this adds up to a pretty favorable scenario for the Sui ecosystem. Stablecoin Supply Increases by 82%, Reflecting Capital Influx The fast expansion of stablecoin supply within the Sui ecosystem is yet another main signal of the network’s ever-expanding role in the larger crypto market. In just the past two months, the total supply of stablecoins on the Sui network has risen from $482 million to $879 million—an unbelievable 82% growth. Stablecoins are a basic building block of DeFi. They provide a stable-store-of-value alternative in a crypto world that’s largely dominated by unstable, highly speculative assets. Capital is flowing into the Sui ecosystem, and it’s doing so through stable assets. This is a huge sign of the kind of progress we are making with Sui Stablecoin influx reflects a capital trend and user shift toward using Sui as a more risk-averse investment vehicle. Stablecoins are stable, and they provide the kinds of user opportunities that make DeFi appealing (lending, staking, yield farming, etc.). These user opportunities, paired with the inherent stability of stablecoins, make it likely that stablecoins will be a big part of Sui’s capital and user base going forward. In addition, the supply of stablecoins is expanding rapidly in parallel with the growth of DeFi applications. As a new apparatus for interacting with digital assets, decentralized finance requires an ever-growing and increasingly diverse set of financial tools. Stablecoins are now a basic component of this toolkit. They occupy a middle ground in a world where uncollateralized dollar-denominated credit is increasingly hard to come by. Sui’s Rising Capital Resilience and Developer Confidence When looked at from an investment standpoint, the Sui ecosystem’s is one of steadily building capital and developer confidence in a Layer 1 blockchain. Its performance, across some of the most fundamental key metrics—TVL, trading activity, and stablecoin volume—suggests that the on-chain ecosystem is not just on the path to thriving The Sui network’s long-term success will be determined by how well it can scale and satisfy a burgeoning demand from a swelling number of users and developers. The rising capital activity and user engagement across Sui indicate that it’s becoming an ever-more-important player in the blockchain space. To sum up, the Sui ecosystem has entered a significant stage. Its size and relevance have increased impressively. With an ecosystem that encompasses over 70 projects and keeps expanding, with an increase in trading volume on its decentralized exchange (DEX) that approaches the conditions that would make DEX arbitrage feasible, and with a stablecoin framework set up, the Sui ecosystem seems to be on a solid path.

43888488,https://nulltx.com/?p=148381,1745812709,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Rising Open Interest and Short Bias Signal Potential Volatility in Bitcoin’s Perpetual Swap Market,https://nulltx.com/rising-open-interest-and-short-bias-signal-potential-volatility-in-bitcoins-perpetual-swap-market/,"Bitcoin’s price is rebounding, and so the market for perpetual swaps is showing a sharp increase in open interest (OI). That OI number crude proxy for how many traders are in the market shows that, post-CPI (Consumer Price Index indica implementation of economic policy), we have roughly 281,000 BTC in the Bitcoin perpetual swap OI. This is way more than we’ve had in quite some time, so what it means (more or less) is that more traders are in the perpetual swap market, period. And that must, of course, mean something. And what it inevitably leads you to is this: the perpetual swap market is not a market that exists in a vacuum. By its very name, it implies a building up of leverage, because how do you perpetually swap an asset without a lot of leverage being involved? Also, and I can’t stress this enough, the perpetual swap market is now and always has been an essential part of the landscape for Bitcoin traders. The rise in open interest is a typical feature of price recovery. As prices rise, more and more traders join the fun. The influx of traders means that order flow becomes even healthier. The healthier order flow is, the more likely it is that prices keep going in the direction they’re going in (i.e., recovery); hence, the healthier the price recovery becomes. Open interest, then, is a positive indicator for price recovery. Short Side Dominates: Funding Rates Suggest a Bearish Sentiment Even though open interest (OI) has risen, the funding rate in perpetual swap markets has turned negative. The average funding rate has fallen to -0.023%. This means that when perpetual swap traders make payments to each other, the traders on the long side pay the traders on the short side. It also means, apparently, that more perpetual swap traders are betting on Bitcoin’s price to fall rather than to keep rising. That also seems to be what more and more market participants think is going to happen. A market generally implies positive funding rates when the price is going up, but that’s what you’d expect in a typical market structure, right? Because in a typical market structure, you have long positions in excess of short positions, and the demand for borrowing the asset just pushes the funding rates higher. So the funding rate being negative during a price recovery really shows a divergence from that typical market structure, and it also implies that traders are kind of split on being with or against the rally. When there is a significant number of short positions that get liquidated, we say that a short squeeze has occurred. This is when the traders who shorted an asset in anticipation that its price would go down are suddenly rushing to buy back the asset that they shorted because the price is going up and they can’t let their loss go on any longer. This action in the market causes the price to go up even more, in a kind of virtuous cycle for the bulls and a vicious cycle for the bears. Reduced Appetite for Long Positions Adds to Short Bias More evidence of the prevailing short bias is found in the data for long-side funding premiums. The 7-day moving average (7DMA) of long-side funding premiums has recently drifted down to $88,000 per hour and is still trending downward. Funding premiums for long positions represent the amount long traders pay to maintain their positions. A downtrend in a long-side premium is generally seen as a signal that the market is moving against long traders. So, what by now should be a pretty clear picture is this: The funding structure of the Bitcoin market is slanted in favor of short traders. The reduction in long-side funding premiums may indicate that traders are hesitating to fully commit to long positions as the market remains unsure about the sustainability of the price recovery. Many traders may be holding off on adding to their long positions and instead are maintaining a wait-and-see approach in the hopes that the recent price action matures into a more substantial and lasting bullish trend. Open Interest in perpetual swaps has risen to 281K $BTC , up +15.6% since early March. This suggests a build-up of leverage in the market as prices rebound, increasing the potential for amplified volatility via liquidations and stop-outs. pic.twitter.com/3e0mOORqAT — glassnode (@glassnode) April 25, 2025 Increasing open interest, poor funding rates for longs, and lower actual premiums paid by long position holders combine to create a potentially very volatile Bitcoin market. These factors boost the chances for big price moves and, hence, the opportunity to make big profits— or suffer huge losses. And the fact that half of the market is betting against Bitcoin could even mean that the next big Bitcoin move will be upward, as the shorts get stopped out. What Lies Ahead? With Bitcoin demonstrating renewed vigor in its price restoration, the critical variable in deciding this market’s future seems to be the tug-of-war between long and short positions. If bullish forces keep pushing the price upward, all these chumps who have piled on to the short side are going to find themselves in an unwanted position and will have to cover their shorts, adding further fuel to the upward price movement. On the other hand, if this rally starts to roll over and those short positions start making money, then we’ve got a market that could very well see Bitcoin prices start declining again. The continues transformation in open interest, funding rates, and long side premiums stresses the high-stakes arena that Bitcoin traders are working in. With so much leverage in the system and such a strong load towards short positions, potential for amplified volatility remains high. Traders must stay alerted and keep a close watch over these key indicators. They may very well serve up the next significant price move. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Drawing utility from the strengths of the Bitcoin network, Mezo is emerging as a service layer in the BTCFi landscape. And it seems to be resonating with users, who are finding it a compelling means of “farming” their Bitcoin for returns. The value proposition core to Mezo is its incorporation with the tBTC infrastructure, which permits user access to liquidity and programmability of decentralized finance while hewing to the Bitcoin security model. Mezo’s appearance, in a way, permits the whole appearance of borrowing, spending, and earning with the Bitcoin to become seamless—with few apps lingering in the space—that’s a huge gap being filled by Mezo. And ultimately, let us not miss the point here, it’s about putting the BTC itself to work in ways that get the BTC into actual, functional use-cases in financial applications. Growth Signals Show Rising Demand for BTCFi Solutions Mezo’s ascent is supported by impressive growth numbers from on-chain metrics. Over the past week, the number of borrowers on the platform surged by 84.4 percent. This brings the total user count to over 8,600. The speed at which this base is growing is a clear signal that holders of Bitcoin are seeking means through which the can utilize their assets in a more direct, decentralized manner. And by direct, I mean not relying on any centralized intermediaries. Simultaneously, the volume of $MUSD—Mezo’s stable borrowing currency—has skyrocketed. On the platform, a total of 183.8 million dollars worth of $MUSD has been borrowed, representing a 70 percent increase within just seven days. This spike reflects both a burgeoning user confidence and an increasing demand for liquidity solutions that are native to the Bitcoin ecosystem. With its mainnet launch expected in May, @MezoNetwork is rapidly gaining traction as the Bitcoin Economic Layer for BTCFi. Over 8,600 borrowers, up 84.4% in the past week $183.8M in $MUSD borrowed, a 70% increase in the last 7 days 92% of users collateralize with… pic.twitter.com/4MN55lQ5qQ — Bitcoin Ecosystem (@BitcoinEcoTK) April 25, 2025 Maybe the most revealing aspect is the composition of the user base. Data indicates that 92 percent of users collateralize with less than 0.0005 BTC, which suggests that Mezo is not just appealing to whales or institutional participants. This distribution seems to indicate that the platform is quite accessible, as it is engaging a large number of smallholders who are, in traditional DeFi models, often overlooked. For these users, the platform represents, in many cases, their first experience with using Bitcoin for anything other than holding it or making simple transfers. Mezo’s infrastructure is designed with this inclusivity in mind. By making borrowing against Bitcoin easy and efficient, the platform lowers the barrier to entry for everyday Bitcoin users. It allows them to put their Bitcoin to work without giving up custody or incurring the risks associated with centralized lending platforms. This shift toward on-chain borrowing not only improves capital efficiency but also strengthens Bitcoin’s presence in the broader DeFi ecosystem. In contrast to Ethereum-based DeFi, which many times has high-yield mechanisms contingent upon shaky token models, Mezo is stable, transparent, and sustainable. Its core growth strategy focuses on low volatility. The use of tBTC—a “trust-minimized” decentralized version of Bitcoin on Ethereum—allows Mezo to bridge two ecosystems while remaining true to Bitcoin’s core ethos. Analysts and investors are starting to take notice of Mezo’s advancements as excitement surges for the imminent launch of its mainnet. There exists a firm belief in many circles that Mezo could serve as the platform and portal for unleashing the hitherto locked liquidity of Bitcoin, which is better described as monetary energy, in order to truly set the stage for BTCFi to become a rising star in its next cycle of DeFi innovation. Should Mezo keep growing at its current rate, it will very soon become the go-to solution for anyone wanting to do anything with Bitcoin that was impossible not so very long ago. Its future success will almost certainly hinge on whether it can keep scaling to huge sizes while remaining accessible, secure, and decentralized. Mezo’s adoption isn’t just rapid; it is strong and across the board. The value proposition is exceedingly clear. Its meetings are well-attended, with the audience comprised largely of potential users. We think that this situation—strong early adoption, a clear value proposition, and a launch just around the corner—puts Mezo in position to redefine how Bitcoin interacts with the world of DeFi. And for Bitcoiners who have long awaited a more functional use case for their holdings, Mezo may most imminently deliver on that front. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This well-coordinated buying spree happened earlier today and was most visible through the on-chain metrics for a particular wallet. That wallet, identified as 0x97251bbbe8f80bf1787b15abed08c09ac5cc1776, executed a series of high-value purchases in what were largely seen as confidence bets. Among the purchases made were millions worth of the following tokens: VIRTUAL, WLD, GAME, and COOKIE. The size and timing of these acquisitions suggest that there’s a lot more here than just casual speculation. Be it insider knowledge, a long-term belief in the chosen tokens, or a more expansive bet on the narratives the market is going to play out in the near future, this whale is putting a considerable amount of dollars behind its decisions. A Closer Look at the Whale’s Portfolio Picks The buying binge started with a huge purchase of VIRTUAL, a recently popular token in the metaverse and digital experience realm. The whale got 2.53 million VIRTUAL tokens at an average price of 0.93 dollars, totaling 2.66 million dollars. In appearance, that looks an awful lot like a vote of confidence on the virtual world front. Altcoin Buffet: Whale Scoops Up $VIRTUAL, $WLD , $GAME , and $COOKIE in One Big Shopping Spree One wallet is making bold moves across multiple altcoins today. The whale behind address 0x97251bbbe8f80bf1787b15abed08c09ac5cc1776 went on a buying spree, pic.twitter.com/sV07F94HXT — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) April 26, 2025 Then, the purse zeroed in on WLD, or Worldcoin, a project that has audacious dreams of making a worldly, decentralized, identity-and-finance layer. The whale gobbled up 1.48 million WLD at an average price of 1.02 dollars, investing 1.73 million bucks in all. Worldcoin has been buzzing for quite a while now, not just for its all-but-audacious biometric model, but also for its star-studded cast of crypto luminaries. Even so, to the extent Worldcoin scales at all, it has to be considered a “win” for the purse—much more so than with the other coins mentioned above. After the tokens priced at a premium, the investor dove down to “affordable” purchases and snagged a hefty amount of GAME. That’s 6.47 million tokens on an average price of 0.04 dollars “per” token. Total cash outlay came to about 299,000 dollars. While the value of GAME may be on the low end, the number of tokens purchased is impressive and suggests that this whale has a strong conviction on some upside potential. Completing the shopping spree was a smaller, yet still significant, purchase of COOKIE—a lesser-known but emerging token in the meme or micro-cap segment. The wallet acquired 303,574 COOKIE tokens for 40,700 dollars, averaging about 0.13 dollars per token. While speculative in nature, tokens like COOKIE have been known to deliver outsized returns in short bursts, and it’s possible the whale sees this as a calculated bet on something that might deliver 100X as much back in return. In total, the wallet splashed out about 4.73 million bucks among four different assets—not chump change, even in today’s altcoin market. But what’s most interesting is where those funds went and how they were allocated. The largest investment was in Worldcoin (WLD), a token associated with a project whose vision is definitely expansive (and somewhat controversial; more on that in a sec). Right behind WLD is the riskier, much less known, and far more volatile project called COOKIE. Market watchers are already abuzz about this activity, with many traders now keeping an eye on the wallet’s future moves for sentiment signals related to these tokens. And large-scale, diversified purchases like this one could also be seen as influencing the next short-term price moves in various tokens, especially those with smaller market caps where a single buy can dramatically shift order books. Whether the recent buying will pay off is yet to be seen, but there’s no denying that this whale is going for diversification and striking big in a market where the right narrative and use case can turn a modest investment into a home run.

The company’s head of Asia, Jiayin Xie, said on X that legal letters had been sent to the accounts, which it believes were operated by a professional arbitrage group. Bitget, which is headquartered in Victoria, Seychelles, said it plans to return any recovered funds to users through an airdrop. The incident unfolded when VOXEL, the token associated with the Polygon -based game Voxie Tactics, saw an extraordinary spike in trading volume last week. At one point, VOXEL’s trading volume briefly exceeded that of Bitcoin . VOXEL’s Sudden Spike Prompts Bitget to Investigate Trading Irregularities On April 20, VOXEL surged by more than 200% in just 30 minutes on Bitget, climbing to $0.1645 before retreating to $0.09131, still around 40% higher than its earlier price. The cryptocurrency exchange Bitget said it would issue eight lawyers' letters, saying they were the main instigators of the VOXEL incident and had gained more than $20 million from it. Bitget will distribute 100% of the recovered funds to platform users in the form of airdrops.… https://t.co/idxkaqbk3k — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 27, 2025 Bitget flagged the abnormal activity in VOXEL/ USDT perpetual futures trading shortly after it occurred. Soon after, the exchange noted suspicious volumes and wild price swings. As a result, it moved quickly to suspend certain accounts from trading, depositing, and withdrawing. Although Bitget claims that most users were not affected, it has yet to disclose who was behind the activity. Moreover, it remains unclear whether internal technical flaws contributed to the situation. Traders Question Bitget’s Systems After VOXEL Trading Turmoil The crypto sector has witnessed several high-profile exploits in recent years. Hackers and market manipulators have often exploited weak liquidity, smart contract bugs or flawed trading algorithms. As a result, security concerns across exchanges have continued to grow. In Bitget’s case, some traders have suggested that the platform’s market-making technology may have malfunctioned. However, no official explanation has been confirmed yet. Following the incident, comparisons quickly surfaced online. Some users likened Bitget’s actions to casinos suing players for winning. Nevertheless, Bitget maintains that the accounts in question engaged in manipulation, not legitimate trading. The exchange said it will publish a full report on the VOXEL incident soon. Meanwhile, the eight targeted accounts remain suspended as legal proceedings move forward.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce: US Crypto Regulation Feels Like Playing 'The Floor is Lava' in the Dark At the SEC’s ”Know Your Custodian” roundtable on April 25, SEC Commissioner and head of the agency’s crypto task force, Hester Peirce , delivered a vivid analogy to describe the current regulatory landscape facing US financial firms engaging with cryptocurrency: it’s like playing a game of ”the floor is lava” — but without any light. Peirce explained that navigating crypto regulations today means firms must hop from one uncertain legal position to another, all while avoiding direct contact with crypto assets themselves — which she likened to ”burning legal lava.” “It is time that we find a way to end this game. We need to turn on the lights and build some walkways over the lava pit,” Peirce urged, calling for a clearer regulatory framework that would allow financial institutions to engage more openly with the rapidly evolving digital asset sector. Navigating in the Dark Peirce detailed how SEC-registered entities — such as investment advisers, broker-dealers, and custodians — are often left uncertain about how to handle crypto assets. Firms are unsure whether a given token constitutes a security, which custodians meet federal qualifications, and whether participation in activities like staking or exercising governance rights could inadvertently trigger regulatory breaches. This regulatory fog, according to Peirce, is choking innovation and hampering the development of a robust, transparent crypto market in the United States. Firms are increasingly forced to operate with extreme caution, avoiding direct custody of crypto assets altogether, which in turn restricts the liquidity and maturity of US-based crypto markets. Peirce was not alone in voicing concern. SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed her sentiment, stressing that as more registrants seek to work with crypto assets, it’s critical they have access to qualified custodians that meet all legal and regulatory requirements. Uyeda proposed that the SEC should consider permitting advisers to use state-chartered limited-purpose trust companies, which are already authorized to hold crypto assets, as qualified custodians. He argued that broadening access to compliant custodial options could offer some much-needed clarity and operational support to firms navigating the sector. The inability of brokers and Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) to custody crypto assets under the current rules, Uyeda warned, could stifle the development of a healthy secondary market for digital assets in the United States. A New Direction Under Chair Paul Atkins The roundtable also marked an important moment for the newly sworn-in SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, who laid out a notably different vision from that of his predecessor, Gary Gensler. Atkins, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, stated that he expects blockchain technology to deliver ”huge benefits” through increased efficiency, greater risk mitigation, enhanced transparency, and reduced costs across the financial system. Importantly, Atkins pledged to focus the SEC’s energy on crafting ”clear regulatory rules of the road” for digital assets — a commitment that many in the crypto community have long been hoping for. Without directly criticizing Gensler, Atkins made it clear that the previous regulatory approach had contributed to significant confusion and uncertainty in the market. “I look forward to engaging with market participants and working with colleagues in President Trump’s administration and Congress to establish a rational, fit-for-purpose framework for crypto assets,” Atkins said. Peirce’s metaphor resonated widely because it captures what many market participants have long complained about: the absence of coherent and accessible guidelines. Crypto firms, investment funds, custodians, and trading platforms are often left guessing about how to operate within the law, while enforcement actions against the industry mount. Calls for regulatory reform have grown louder as the United States risks falling behind other jurisdictions — such as the European Union, with its MiCA framework, or countries like Singapore and the UAE — that have adopted clearer and more supportive digital asset regulations. If Atkins, Peirce, and Uyeda succeed in pushing through more practical reforms, it could mark a major turning point for crypto in America. The prospect of regulatory clarity would likely unlock new levels of institutional adoption, investment, and innovation within the sector. For now, however, Peirce’s warning remains clear: unless US regulators build structured ”walkways” across the legal lava pits, the nation’s financial firms will continue to stumble in the dark, risking not only their own survival but also America's future leadership in blockchain and digital finance. Senator Jon Ossoff Calls for Impeachment Proceedings Against President Trump Over Private Meme Coin Dinner In other crypto news, US Senator Jon Ossoff has thrown his support behind launching impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, citing a growing controversy over Trump’s association with the Official Trump meme coin and a private dinner event tied to its holders. Speaking during an April 25 town hall in Georgia, where he is running for reelection, Ossoff said Trump’s actions clearly meet the standard for an impeachable offense. “I mean, I saw just 48 hours ago, he is granting audiences to people who buy his meme coin,” Ossoff said, according to a report by NBC News. “When the sitting president of the United States is selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him, there is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense.” While expressing strong support for impeachment proceedings, Ossoff acknowledged the political reality that such action is unlikely to succeed unless the Democratic Party regains control of Congress during the 2026 midterm elections. Republicans currently hold majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Dinner That Sparked a Political Firestorm The controversy centers around the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin, a cryptocurrency project directly tied to Trump's personal brand. On April 23, the TRUMP meme coin website announced plans for an exclusive dinner with President Trump at his Washington, D.C. golf club, inviting the top 220 holders of the TRUMP token to attend. TRUMP holders can register to dine with the US President (Source: gettrumpmemes.com) A leaderboard tracking the largest TRUMP wallets was published alongside the announcement, with a registration link for eligible holders. The site noted that participants would need to pass a background check, could not be from a Know Your Customer (KYC) watchlist country, and would not be allowed to bring guests. Following the announcement, the price of the TRUMP token surged by over 50%, according to CoinMarketCap data — further intensifying concerns that the president was personally profiting from the event. Social media speculation quickly emerged suggesting that a TRUMP holder would need to own at least $300,000 worth of the token to secure an invitation. However, the TRUMP team denied those claims on April 25, clarifying that the threshold was based on a curated leaderboard rather than raw blockchain data, which includes locked tokens, exchange wallets, and non-participating addresses. Still, the controversy over selling direct access to the sitting president for crypto holdings has not subsided. Legal experts have sounded alarms about the potential conflicts of interest created by Trump's cryptocurrency activities, including not just the TRUMP meme coin but also his involvement in World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol affiliated with his brand. “Within just a couple of days of him taking office, he’s signed a number of executive orders that are significantly going to affect the way that our crypto and digital assets industry works,” said Charlyn Ho, a partner at the law firm Rikka, in a February interview. “So if he has a personal pecuniary benefit arising from his own policies, that’s a conflict of interest.” Ho and other legal scholars warn that Trump's direct financial involvement in cryptocurrency projects that could be influenced by federal policy presents unprecedented ethical challenges for the presidency. The concerns are amplified by the fact that Trump’s executive orders in the early days of his new term have already had notable impacts on the crypto sector, including proposed changes to digital asset taxation, decentralized finance regulations, and stablecoin oversight. A Brewing Battle Ahead of the 2026 Midterms Senator Ossoff’s town hall comments suggest that Democrats may increasingly focus on Trump’s crypto-related activities as a potential campaign issue ahead of the 2026 midterms. With control of Congress hanging in the balance, Democrats hope to position Trump’s personal financial dealings as a symbol of broader ethical and governance failures. Despite these criticisms, Trump's political base remains fiercely loyal, and his embrace of emerging technologies like cryptocurrency has been praised by some conservative and libertarian voters seeking alternatives to traditional financial institutions. Still, Ossoff’s comments signal that the president’s blending of official duties with personal crypto ventures is unlikely to fade quietly. As legal experts, ethics watchdogs, and political opponents continue to scrutinize the administration’s entanglements with the crypto industry, the stage appears set for a fierce political and legal battle that could shape the remainder of Trump’s presidency — and the future of digital asset regulation in the United States.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-28 05:00:00

Trading volumes remained low as markets around the region paused to assess the latest signals from Washington and Beijing. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 0.1% to close at 21,995.82. On the mainland, Shanghai’s Composite Index was nearly flat at 3,294.02. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 added 0.4%, finishing at 35,863.60, and South Korea’s Kospi edged up 0.1% to 2,5549.19. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.8%, ending at 8,028.20, and Taiwan’s Taiex advanced 0.6%. U.S. stock futures drifted lower, while oil prices held near flat, as uncertainty persisted over whether formal talks on tariff cuts would take place. President Trump said he was “actively negotiating” with Chinese officials over duties, but Chinese authorities and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both maintained that no direct discussions have begun. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index. Source: Google Finance The mixed performance in Asia came after Wall Street closed with gains on Friday, as Big Tech stocks powered a late rally. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to 5,525.21, extending a three-day rebound that pulled it within 10.1% of its record high earlier this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led U.S. benchmarks higher with a 1.3% advance to 17,382.94, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.1% to 40,113.50. Alphabet shares climbed 1.7% in their first session after Google’s parent company said late Thursday that first-quarter profit jumped 50% from a year earlier, well above analysts’ forecasts. Nvidia also contributed to the S&P 500’s gain, rising 4.3% after reporting better-than-expected results and upbeat guidance for its chip business. Trump says he’s on track to finalize new trade agreements President Trump told reporters at the White House that he remained on track to finalize several new trade agreements in the coming weeks, but he also described it as “physically impossible” to complete all the meetings he would like to hold. His back-and-forth signals on tariffs have left businesses scrambling to adjust supply chains and temper spending plans amid the threat of sudden policy shifts. On Friday, roughly 60% of S&P 500 stocks fell, including Eastman Chemical, which tumbled 6.2% after issuing a profit forecast for the spring that came in below analysts’ estimates. A growing number of companies across multiple industries have pointed to the uncertainty around tariffs as a key reason for pulling back on financial guidance for the year ahead. Investors hope that if Trump rolls back some of his tougher tariffs on imports, he may stave off the recession many see as a likely outcome of an extended trade war. Yet the repeated cycle of threats may be prompting both households and businesses to hold off on big purchases and postpone long-term investments. A report from the University of Michigan on Friday showed that U.S. consumer sentiment fell in April, though not as steeply as economists had feared. Its gauge of expectations for future conditions dropped 32% since January, marking the largest three-month decline in percentage terms since the 1990 recession. In commodity markets on Monday, U.S. benchmark crude for June delivery fell 25 cents to $63.27 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard for oil prices, slipped 24 cents to $66.04 a barrel. Currency moves were modest in early Asian trade. The U.S. dollar rose to 143.62 Japanese yen from 143.60 yen, while the euro dipped to $1.1358 from $1.1366. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

HTX Research has announced the release of its latest report,“ Sonic: A Model for the New DeFi Paradigm ” The report dives into the details of the Sonic public chain. By fully supporting EVM while rebuilding its virtual machine, storage engine, and consensus mechanism, Sonic achieves performance metrics that redefine industry standards: over 2,000 TPS, 0.7-second transaction finality, and a cost of $0.0001 per transaction. This performance surpasses most Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions, representing a significant advancement in public chain infrastructure and ushering in a “sub-second era.” Sonic’s Evolution: 2000+ TPS, 0.7s Confirmation, Near-Zero Fees The Fantom Opera blockchain, initially recognized for its speed and throughput as a high-performance aDAG-based Layer 1 solution, encountered scalability limitations as its ecosystem expanded. Its traditional EVM architecture struggled with bloated state storage, slow node synchronization, and execution bottlenecks. To overcome these challenges without resorting to sharding or Layer 2 solutions, Fantom developed Sonic — a fundamental redesign engineered to deliver a significant performance leap. Sonic Labs, a new team led by CEO Michael Kong, CTO Andre Cronje (founder of Yearn Finance), and Chief Research Officer Bernhard Scholz, dedicated two and a half years to the redesign of Fantom’s virtual machine, storage, and consensus. They built Sonic, a new, independent EVM-compatible chain capable of processing over 2,000 TPS, achieving 0.7-second finality, and executing transactions at a cost of $0.0001. It also improves storage efficiency by 90% and reduces node synchronization time from weeks to under two days. Technical Innovations Driving Sonic’s Performance Sonic’s enhanced performance is underpinned by three core technological advancements: SonicVM: A newly developed virtual machine fully compatible with the EVM, SonicVM optimizes computationally intensive operations like SHA3 hashing, pre-analyzes jump instructions, delivers significantly faster execution, and supports high throughput. SonicDB : Achieving nearly 90% data compression, SonicDB uses a layered storage strategy that splits the blockchain state into two databases: LiveDB for the current global state and ArchiveDB for historical blocks and states. This reduces node requirements and enhances network resilience through greater decentralization. Sonic Gateway : Functioning like an “L2-like” bridging solution to Ethereum, it uses a batch processing mechanism that strikes a balance between security and efficiency, enabling seamless two-way asset transfers and ecosystem access. Sonic Tokenomics: Dual Incentives for Developers and Users Sonic has launched its native token, $S, which is exchangeable with FTM at a 1:1 ratio. The $S token powers the Sonic ecosystem through gas fee payments, staking, and governance voting.Key features include: ● Gas Fee Monetization (FeeM) Mechanism: Developers can earn up to 90% of transaction fees, incentivizing ecosystem growth. Non-FeeM applications will burn 50% of fees to counter inflation. ● Points-Based Reward Mechanism: Users earn points (Passive/Activity Points and Gems) by holding $S, participating in DeFi activities, or interacting with the ecosystem. These points are redeemable for a total of 200 million $S, promoting a sustainable “use-to-mine” loop. Stablecoin Ecosystem: Nested Yield and Resilient Growth Defying market trends in 2025, Sonic’s on-chain Total Value Locked (TVL) surged by over 500%, with the total stablecoin supply surpassing $260 million. This growth is driven by sophisticated high-leverage yield mechanisms. ● Silo v2 Loop Lending: Use staked S tokens to borrow stablecoins, achieving up to 20x exposure to capture combined incentives alongside stable yield spreads. ● Euler + Rings Protocol Combo: Deposit USDC to mint scUSD, then use leverage to potentially achieve up to 10x yield, along with Sonic points and protocol rewards. ● Shadow DEX Liquidity Provision for Rewards : By facilitating trading activity, particularly with the S/stS pair on Shadow, users can earn up to 169% APY and a share of trading fees. Looking ahead, the ecosystem will incorporate Real World Asset (RWA) yields and off-chain payment solutions to create a sustainable and widely used stablecoin ecosystem backed by compliant assets and real-world applications. Sonic’s Innovations in DeFi Infrastructure: Adaptive AMM and Dynamic Risk Control Sonic’s decentralized exchange (DEX), FlyingTulip, designed by Andre Cronje, integrates trading, lending, and leverage with two key innovations: – Adaptive AMM Curve: By combining Curve V2’s liquidity aggregation with oracle-driven volatility monitoring, FlyingTulip’s AMM dynamically adjusts its shape. It offers low slippage in stable markets (similar to a constant sum curve) and prevents liquidity issues in volatile markets (similar to a constant product curve), resulting in a 42% reduction in impermanent loss and an 85% improvement in capital efficiency. – Dynamic LTV Model: Inspired by Curve’s LLAMMA, FlyingTulip’s lending platform adjusts Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios in real time based on market volatility. For example, ETH borrowing limits can decrease from 80% in stable conditions to 50% during periods of high volatility, enhancing system stability. Conclusion: Sonic – Leading the Charge in DeFi 2.0 Sonic’s high performance, nested yields, and accessibility position it for rapid growth, with the potential to exceed $2B TVL and a multi-billion $S token market cap within a year. More importantly, Sonic is championing an “efficiency revolution” in blockchain design—prioritizing performance and capital efficiency to attract liquidity. The report identifies technical challenges, including the adaptive AMM’s reliance on external oracles, which introduces potential vulnerabilities. . Furthermore, the inherent risks of high-leverage strategies in volatile markets necessitate the use of hedging instruments, such as short perpetual futures, to mitigate potential liquidations. From a broader view, Sonic is well-positioned to lead the expected 2025 DeFi resurgence. Its thriving stablecoin ecosystem boosts the value of both the $S token and the network. Even in a bear market, Sonic demonstrates the potential for DeFi to establish resilient “yield havens” through innovation and performance. With its nested yields, developer-focused incentives, and efficient infrastructure, Sonic provides a model for the industry. The integration of RWAs and payment tools could place Sonic as a critical bridge between on-chain yields and real-world utility, driving DeFi toward mass adoption For full report, please visit: https://square.htx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HTX-Research-Latest-Report-.pdf About HTX Research HTX Research is the dedicated research arm of HTX Group, responsible for conducting in-depth analyses, producing comprehensive reports, and delivering expert evaluations across a broad spectrum of topics, including cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and emerging market trends.

Americans are turning against his massive efforts to reshape the government, and the numbers show it clearly without any room for spin. A new set of polls dropped Sunday, showing that a majority of Americans disapprove of how Trump is handling the presidency. His approval rating is sliding between 39% and 45%, depending on which poll you look at. The Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll pinned him at 39%, the CNN/SSRS poll gave him 41%, and the NBC News Stay Tuned poll pushed it to 45%. No matter which number he wants to cling to, it’s still the worst 100-day showing for any first-term president since World War II ended. The bad news keeps stacking. Trump rolled back into the White House in January with a little boost in his favorability. That’s gone. His approval is sinking fast as people grow more doubtful about the way he’s trying to change everything at once. Source: Washington Post Trump’s promises haven’t turned into wins, and Americans are showing less patience every day. His so-called strong point — the economy — is also taking a beating. He made handling the economy the centerpiece of his 2024 comeback run, but now, voters are pulling away. The CNN/SSRS poll said only 52% of adults still trust him with the economy, which is a serious 13-point drop from December. That’s not the kind of number a sitting president wants flashing all over the media during an election year. The economic fear is real. The Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll said a huge 72% of Americans believe it’s either “very” or “somewhat” likely that Trump’s economic plans are about to push the country into a recession soon. People are watching their wallets, and Trump’s promises aren’t enough to settle them down. Trade isn’t helping him either. Trump’s sweeping tariffs have caused serious problems in the financial markets. The NBC News Stay Tuned poll said that 61% of Americans disapprove of how he’s handling trade and tariffs. Inflation is crushing people, too, and 60% say they’re not happy with the way he’s dealing with the rising cost of living. Trump built his comeback campaign around claiming he would fix these exact problems, and now voters are saying he’s only making things worse. Independent voters hammer Trump as partisan gap widens Immigration, another big issue Trump loves to talk about, is falling apart in the polls, too. The CNN/SSRS poll said only 45% of Americans now approve of how he’s handling immigration. That’s a sharp fall from the 60% who gave him a thumbs-up back in December. Support for Trump still follows party lines, as the majority of Republicans are sticking by him. Nearly all Democrats are also not buying it at all and are firmly against him, which is no surprise at all. But the real damage is showing up with independents, the voters who don’t play for either team. Trump barely lost independents last November. Now, he’s losing them by even bigger margins. The Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found that 58% of independents disapprove of how Trump is running the country. These are the voters who could swing an election, and right now, they’re moving further away from him. The polls paint a brutal picture for Trump. His first 100 days are not a story of momentum or success. They are a red flashing warning sign that he’s losing ground where he can’t afford to lose it. He walked into office promising to change everything. But after three months, what Americans see is a president running out of goodwill, fast. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

According to the company’s assessments, this decline in selling pressure from miners has historically often been followed by periods of sideways consolidation or price declines. Alphractal's statement noted that low selling pressure rarely produces positive effects, however, positive reactions are observed more often in the following periods: December 2012 September 2013 A few months into 2016 July 2021 In most cases, Bitcoin continued to trade sideways or in price declines. In April 2025, Hash Rate (processing power) reached an all-time high, then fell, and a slight recovery was seen recently. This movement is similar to what happened in April 2021. The company also states that April 14, 2021 and April 14, 2023 stand out as local peaks for Bitcoin, making April a critical period for mining.

It is stated that the current miner selling pressure remains low, which is an indication of miners wisely selling their Bitcoins at the beginning of 2025. However, if a capitulation process begins in the mining sector, a new wave of selling pressure may emerge.

The Shenzhen-based Huawei is poised to start testing a new AI chip called the Ascend 910D, and has approached local tech firms, which are slated to receive the first batch of sample chips by late May, The Wall Street Journal reported on April 27, citing people familiar with the matter. The development is still at an early stage, and a series of tests will be needed to assess the chip’s performance and get it ready for customers. Huawei is pinning hopes on its latest Ascend AI processor being more powerful than Nvidia’s H100 chip, which was used for AI training in 2022. Huawei is also poised to ship more than 800,000 earlier model Ascend 910B and 910C chips to customers, including state-owned telecoms operators and private AI developers such as TikTok parent ByteDance. Beijing has also reportedly encouraged Chinese AI developers to increase purchases of domestic chips as trade tensions between China and the US escalate. In mid-April, Nvidia stated that it was expecting around $5.5 billion in charges associated with its AI chip inventory due to significant export restrictions imposed by the US government affecting its business with China. The Trump administration added Nvidia’s H20 chip, its most powerful processor that could be sold to China, to a growing list of semiconductors restricted for sale to the country. Some key components for AI chips, such as the latest high-bandwidth memory units, have also been restricted for export to China by the US. Huawei is focusing on building more efficient and faster systems, such as CloudMatrix 384 , a computing system unveiled in April, connecting Ascend 910C chips. This would leverage their chip arrays and use brute force rather than making individual processors more powerful. China seeks self-reliance on AI Reuters reported on April 26, citing state media reports, that Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged “self-reliance and self-strengthening” to develop AI in the country. “We must recognise the gaps and redouble our efforts to comprehensively advance technological innovation, industrial development, and AI-empowered applications,"" Xi said at a Politburo meeting study session on April 25.

The exchange’s head of Asia, Jiayin Xie, revealed in an Apr. 27 post on X that Bitget would issue eight legal letters, targeting the individuals suspected of improperly gaining more than $20 million from the incident. Xie noted that the exchange plans to distribute 100% of any recovered funds from the legal proceedings to platform users through airdrops. 看到有社区在讨论BG发出的律师函，我核实后，想跟大家澄清几个细节： 1、Bitget 将陆续发出8份律师函。 2、这8个账户疑似相关联的专业羊毛利益集团，是导致本次VOXEL事件的主要始作俑者，并从中不当得利超过2000万美金。 3、追回的资金，Bitget 将100% 以空投形式发放给平台用户！… — 谢家印 (@xiejiayinBitget) April 27, 2025 He assured the community that users who traded VOXEL between 16:00 and 16:30 on Apr. 20 but had already withdrawn their funds, would not face any repercussions. These accounts have been restored, and no further responsibility will be pursued against them. In addition, Xie expressed regret for any inconvenience caused and stated that a full report would be made available shortly to give a better picture of the situation.

During this price spike, which spanned from $0.125 to roughly $0.1645, trades seemed to be executed without the usual order book process. The incident was caused by a suspected bug in Bitget’s market-making bot, which resulted in rapid price swings and instant order fills that some traders took advantage of to make huge profits. In response, Bitget paused trading on the VOXEL/USDT contract and froze several accounts involved in the unusual trading activity. Bitget also announced it would roll back irregular trades and compensate users who incurred losses during the incident. While the platform has assured users that the incident wasn’t due to an internal failure or exploit, it has not revealed the identities of those responsible. Meanwhile, comparisons have been drawn to a March price manipulation incident on Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) involving the JELLY token.

While some believe the AI crypto sector is no longer exciting, the truth is that artificial intelligence (AI) projects, especially AI agents, might just be getting started again. The Rise and Fall of AI Crypto AI crypto projects saw massive growth toward the end of 2024, with the market value hitting $70 billion in December. But soon after, things took a turn. The AI crypto market dropped sharply to around $24 billion. This made many investors lose interest, especially as other crypto sectors also slowed down due to market uncertainty. However, in the past week, there’s been a positive shift. The market cap for AI crypto has bounced back to around $31 billion. Although altcoins haven’t fully recovered yet, experts believe this could be a good time to start paying attention. Why AI Agents Still Have Potential AI agents — special crypto tools powered by artificial intelligence — were a huge part of the earlier AI craze. Even though many of these projects fell in value, some have continued developing behind the scenes. The idea is simple: in crypto, the best time to invest is usually when nobody else is talking about it. For example, projects like Virtuals Protocol have started showing signs of life again. In just the past week, Virtuals’ price has jumped by over 60%. This project aims to make it easy to launch and monetize AI agents and connect them within its ecosystem. Although it once hit $4.50 in January, it’s now trading under $1, showing how far it’s fallen — and how much room it might have to grow again. Other AI Coins to Watch Two other AI-related coins catching attention are AIXBT and Tric: AIXBT: Once a popular AI agent platform for crypto research and analysis, it’s recently gained around 70% in a week. While it’s still far from its all-time high, some believe it has the potential to recover as interest in AI agents returns. TRAC: A similar platform on the Solana blockchain, TRAC had a massive run-up before crashing. It now sits at a very low market value of $3 million, compared to its previous $100 million peak. While risky, small market cap coins like this sometimes offer big returns — but also come with high risks.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 05:33:03

Despite the concerns about Strategy’s debt-fueled buying spree, experts like Saifedean Ammous argue that such concentration of Bitcoin ownership will not threaten the protocol itself, as institutions have no incentive to alter Bitcoin’s rules. Meanwhile, the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin treasuries is strengthening the path toward hyperbitcoinization, a future where Bitcoin overtakes fiat as dominant global money. Blockstream CEO Adam Back described this shift as a rational arbitrage of fiat’s declining value. Governments like El Salvador also still continue their quiet Bitcoin accumulation, navigating international agreements with flexibility. Altogether, these trends mean that Bitcoin’s role in global finance is growing very quickly and irreversibly. Bitcoin Could Get Much Scarcer Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, is effectively “synthetically halving Bitcoin” by buying more than half of all newly mined BTC each month. This is according to Adam Livingston , a Bitcoin analyst and author of The Bitcoin Age and The Great Harvest. Miners currently produce around 450 BTC daily, which totals roughly 13,500 BTC per month, yet Strategy acquired an astonishing 379,800 BTC over the past six months. This means the firm purchased around 2,087 BTC per day, which is greatly exceeding the global daily miner output. Livingston explained that this level of accumulation will make Bitcoin dramatically scarcer, and could push the asset into an environment where access will require paying large premiums. As a result, lending against Bitcoin will become increasingly expensive, borrowing BTC will be a luxury reserved for major corporations and nation-states, and Strategy will have a dominant influence over Bitcoin’s cost of capital. Livingston’s prediction points to an impending Bitcoin supply crunch, and suggests that if Strategy maintains this acquisition pace while institutional and retail demand grows, Bitcoin prices could soar much higher. Despite the concerns over the sustainability of Strategy’s debt-fueled Bitcoin purchases , especially if a prolonged bear market emerges, some Bitcoin advocates argue that Strategy’s dominance is not a threat to the protocol itself. Saifedean Ammous , economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, recently said that even if institutions like Strategy and BlackRock hold large portions of Bitcoin’s supply, they will have no incentive to manipulate the network’s rules, like increasing the maximum supply. Doing so will devalue their holdings, which ultimately belong to shareholders who could move their investments elsewhere. Thus, while Strategy’s aggressive accumulation strategy is reshaping Bitcoin’s financial landscape, many believe it only strengthens Bitcoin’s fundamental scarcity rather than undermining its decentralized ethos. Bitcoin Treasuries Are Fueling Hyperbitcoinization Investment firms with Bitcoin-focused treasury strategies are increasingly front-running global Bitcoin adoption , and could potentially pave the way for the world’s first cryptocurrency to reach a $200 trillion market capitalization in the next decade. Institutions and governments are beginning to recognize Bitcoin’s unique monetary properties, according to Blockstream CEO and Hashcash inventor Adam Back. In an April 26 post, Back described companies like Strategy as engaging in a logical and sustainable arbitrage of the gap between the current fiat world and a Bitcoin-driven future, a move scalable enough for most major listed companies to transition their treasuries to Bitcoin. The phenomenon is known as hyperbitcoinization , where Bitcoin replaces fiat currencies as the dominant global money, and it is being fueled by Bitcoin’s consistent outpacing of fiat money inflation. Back explained that this is not a temporary trend but a rational and sustainable arbitrage play, driven by Bitcoin's superior long-term price appreciation over inflation and interest rates across four-year periods. His comments were made after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a national Bitcoin reserve sourced from government-seized BTC. Momentum for corporate Bitcoin accumulation is still growing. Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin holder , already generated over $5.1 billion in profit from its Bitcoin treasury since the beginning of 2025, according to co-founder Michael Saylor. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet , dubbed ”Asia’s MicroStrategy,” also embraced this approach and even surpassed 5,000 BTC in holdings on April 24 and set a goal of reaching 21,000 BTC by 2026. Top companies that hold Bitcoin (Source: BitBo ) Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape in the United States is becoming a lot more favorable. The Federal Reserve’s withdrawal of its 2022 guidance discouraging banks from engaging with cryptocurrency opened the door for even more institutional participation. Michael Saylor said that banks are now free to support Bitcoin. Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev, agreed with this, and pointed out that banks will now be supervised through normal regulatory processes. This means that there is a much more open environment for digital asset integration. As financial institutions and corporations continue to move into Bitcoin, the foundation for hyperbitcoinization seems to be strengthening. El Salvador Quietly Continues Bitcoin Buying Certain countries are also making sure to stock up on Bitcoin. El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is still quietly accumulating Bitcoin despite comments from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggesting otherwise. In the seven days leading up to April 27, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office recorded the acquisition of 7 Bitcoin, which is valued at over $650,000. During an April 26 press briefing , Rodrigo Valdes, the director of the IMF’s Western Hemisphere Department, stated that El Salvador is still complying with its commitment under an IMF agreement to halt Bitcoin accumulation by the government’s fiscal sector. El Salvador’s BTC holdings changes (Source: Bitcoin Office ) Valdes explained that the IMF’s program with El Salvador is focused not on Bitcoin but on broader structural reforms, including governance and transparency. This program was part of a $1.4 billion loan deal that was struck in December of 2024, which required El Salvador to stop treating Bitcoin as legal tender and cease government-led Bitcoin purchases. However, there appears to be some flexibility in the interpretation of the agreement. According to blockchain adviser and author Anndy Lian , the ”flexible interpretation” could mean that Bitcoin purchases are being conducted through non-governmental or reclassified entities, which allows the country to technically remain compliant with IMF conditions. Lian pointed out that this approach makes it possible for El Salvador to preserve its Bitcoin-friendly reputation while still securing vital IMF funding needed to manage public debt and financial reserves. El Salvador’s strategy shed some light on the broader tension between financial innovation and traditional international economic frameworks. Lian suggested that the country’s experience provides important lessons for other nations considering crypto adoption, particularly regarding the need for strong regulatory systems and the ability to balance domestic innovation with global financial expectations.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-28 05:37:00

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President hinted that Americans could soon see a dramatic shift in how the government is funded, possibly eliminating federal income taxes. In a Truth Social post on April 27 , Trump suggested that once his new Trump Tariff policies on imported goods are fully in place, income taxes could be “substantially reduced,” especially for those earning under $200,000 a year. Trump introduced a new concept called the “External Revenue Service,” proposing that tariffs, rather than income taxes, could support the government. He described it as a return to an earlier model, pointing to the 19th-century Gilded Age when the U.S. operated without an income tax. Could Lower Taxes Boost Investments and Crypto? Lower income taxes could leave Americans with more disposable income, potentially sparking increased investment in stocks, real estate, and cryptocurrencies . Market watchers note that extra take-home pay often translates into higher consumer spending and asset growth. However, analysts caution that the broader economic impact — especially against the backdrop of Fed rate cuts and fluctuating markets — will ultimately determine whether the plan would fuel major investment surges. Skepticism Grows Over Lack of Details This isn’t the first time Trump has floated the idea. He previously mentioned the concept during a 2024 appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience. Critics argue that Trump has yet to provide a clear roadmap on how a tariff-funded government would work, especially at current spending levels. Research from Dancing Numbers suggests eliminating income taxes could save the average American more than $134,000 over a lifetime, with even greater savings if payroll taxes are removed. Still, experts warn that relying solely on tariffs might not generate enough revenue without significant changes to federal spending. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick , a strong supporter of Trump’s tariff strategy, has also advocated for scrapping the IRS. In January 2025, Lutnick pointed to the early 1900s, when tariffs helped make America the world’s richest country, arguing that protecting domestic workers through Trump Tariff measures could once again boost national wealth. New Tax Proposals Emerge Financial strategist Bert Dohmen has pitched additional tax ideas for Trump to consider. He proposes exempting seniors over the age of 76 who operate small businesses from income taxes, arguing that the administrative burden is too high for older entrepreneurs. Dohmen also recommends offering tax incentives for families, suggesting a 10% tax exemption per child, capped at a 50% total reduction, to encourage higher birth rates — a growing concern among industrialized nations. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump-Backed Crypto Project World Liberty Financial Partners with Pakistan for Full Crypto Legalization , Markets Wobble Amid Trump Tariff Uncertainty While Trump signed an executive order to introduce sweeping new tariffs earlier this month, frequent revisions and policy shifts have injected volatility into the markets.

No, Trump has proposed substantially reducing income taxes, especially for those earning under $200,000, by using tariffs to fund the government. He has not announced a full elimination of income taxes. What is Trump’s “External Revenue Service” idea? Trump’s “External Revenue Service” is a concept where government funding would primarily come from tariffs on imported goods rather than traditional income taxes. How could lower income taxes impact investments and crypto markets?

43891451,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=716805,1745818847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43891451.jpeg,China to dump its US Treasury holdings for Bitcoin and gold,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-us-treasuries-for-bitcoin-and-gold/,"China plans to dump a chunk of its US Treasury holdings and for Bitcoin and gold to protect itself from rising global tensions, according to an interview given to CNBC by Jay Jacobs, head of thematics and equity ETFs at BlackRock. Jacobs said central banks around the world have been pulling away from the US dollar for decades. He said that in the last three to four years, Bitcoin and gold have become the new favorites among the assets they are piling into. Jacobs said crypto is now moving separately from US tech stocks, even though tariffs and political fights have made crypto markets behave like stocks and bonds in the short term. He pointed out that Bitcoin doesn’t depend on economic growth, stability, or peace to rise. Jacobs said, “It thrives when there is more uncertainty,” which makes it different from traditional investments that need low risks and steady growth to perform. China builds bigger Bitcoin and gold positions The latest numbers show that China held $784.3 billion in US Treasuries by the end of February, based on the US Treasury Department’s data. China’s gold pile was worth around $229.6 billion at the end of March, the Economic Times reported on April 21. On top of that, China is sitting on 194,000 BTC, valued at about $18 billion, according to Bitbo’s Bitcoin Treasuries. Guy Cecala, executive chair at Inside Mortgage Finance, told CNBC that China has real power to shake the US markets. He said, “If China wanted to hit us hard, they could unload Treasuries. Is that a threat? Sure it is.” Cecala said Treasury securities are the foundation of US government financing, so any big sell-off would hit the system hard. China also owns a massive amount of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), part of the $1.32 trillion in US MBS owned by foreign countries, based on an analysis from Ginnie Mae. Besides China, big holders include Japan , Taiwan, and Canada . If China starts selling its MBS, and others follow, it could crush the MBS market and ripple across global finance. Some experts think China will hesitate because dumping MBS would hurt its own assets. Melissa Cohn, regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage, told Newsweek that a large sell-off would wreck China’s remaining investments and could destabilize global currencies. Cohn added that China depends on keeping the renminbi (RMB) weaker than the US dollar to keep its exports cheaper and more attractive for American buyers. To do this, China has kept buying US debt for years. Mortgage rates face pressure from China’s strategy The MBS market heavily influences US mortgage rates. If China starts selling its MBS stash, prices would crash and mortgage rates would jump. Homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages would be some of the first to get hit. Eric Hagen, mortgage and specialty finance analyst at BTIG, told CNBC that “most investors are concerned that mortgage spreads would widen” if countries like China, Japan, or Canada decided to retaliate financially. As of April 17, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate stood at 6.83%, reported by Freddie Mac. That is already squeezing many American homeowners. If rates rise more because of an MBS dump, refinancing will be less attractive or even impossible for some. Refinancing would mean higher monthly payments instead of savings. First-time homebuyers would feel the blow, too. Higher mortgage rates would knock many buyers out of the market, and home sellers might stay on the sidelines, waiting for prices to recover. Higher rates also raise borrowers’ debt-to-income ratios, which could push banks to tighten lending rules even more. Lenders might demand higher credit scores or bigger down payments to reduce their risks. Jacobs said BlackRock believes that geopolitical fragmentation is the big driver behind these changes. He said Bitcoin is not just another asset but a direct result of a world that’s becoming more divided. While stocks and bonds need stability, crypto like Bitcoin feeds off the instability that China and other powers are preparing for. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Under the partnership, World Liberty will help the Council launch regulatory sandboxes to test blockchain-based products, expand stablecoin applications for remittances and trade, explore real-world asset tokenization, and assist with the growth of decentralized finance protocols, local news outlet Business Recorder reported on April 27. World Liberty founders Zach Witkoff, Zak Folkman and Chase Herro signed the letter in a recent meeting with the Council’s CEO Bilal bin Saqib, with Pakistan’s central bank governor, finance minister and IT secretary among those in attendance. Source: Pakistan Crypto Council Trump and his family backed World Liberty at the crypto lending and borrowing platform’s launch last year and they receive a cut of its profits. The Pakistan Crypto Council is a government-backed body that oversees crypto regulation and related initiatives aimed at driving adoption and attracting more foreign investment. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis ranked Pakistan ninth for crypto adoption last year, with an estimated 25 million active crypto users and $300 billion in annual crypto transactions. Pakistan is looking to capitalize on its young population, where roughly 60% are under 30, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said. “Pakistan’s youth and technology sector are our greatest assets. Through partnerships like this, we are opening new doors for investment, innovation, and global leadership in the blockchain economy.” Pakistan looks to balance pro-crypto innovation with regulation The three World Liberty founders recently met with former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao , who was recently appointed as an adviser to the Pakistan Crypto Council to assist the country on crypto regulation and innovation. Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency also proposed a crypto regulatory framework on April 10, which looks to address terrorism financing, money laundering, and Know Your Customer controls. Related: Pakistan Crypto Council proposes using excess energy for BTC mining FIA Director Sumera Azam said the framework is part of a broader effort to strike a “balance between technological advancement and national security imperatives.” The proposed framework is subject to legislative approval and input from crypto firms operating in the country, with an expected multi-phased rollout beginning in 2026. Pakistan’s new crypto-friendly approach contrasts sharply with its stance in May 2023, when former finance minister Aisha Ghaus Pasha stated the country would never legalize cryptocurrencies due to concerns over bypassing Financial Action Task Force regulations.

Feist introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 9698 on April 27, aiming to increase the network’s gas limit by 100 times over the next two years, potentially enabling the Ethereum mainnet to handle up to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). The proposal outlines a “deterministic gas limit growth schedule,” set to begin around June 1 at epoch 369017. Ethereum Proposal Plans 100x Gas Limit Increase Over Two Years Under this plan, the gas limit would grow tenfold gradually over approximately 164,250 epochs (about two years), followed by a final tenfold increase. This structured approach, Feist argues, would ensure a transparent and sustainable path for scaling, aligned with ongoing improvements in hardware and protocol efficiency. Currently, Ethereum’s gas limit stands at 36 million, following a recent increase from 30 million in February. Feist’s EIP suggests expanding this to 3.6 billion, allowing for roughly 6,000 transactions per block — a significant jump from today’s capacity. At present, Ethereum processes up to 20 TPS during periods dominated by simple transactions. How serious is Ethereum about scaling L1? Answer: Exponentially increase gas limit 100x over 4 years by @dankrad How: Clients sets default and automatically raise the gas limit every epoch (users can still override). 100x means: – 3.6B gas limit ~2000 TPS – 6000 tx per block https://t.co/3Wjb5EKKck — fabda.eth (@fabdarice) April 27, 2025 If implemented, this proposal could position Ethereum to better compete with high-throughput blockchains like Solana, which averages between 800 and 1,050 TPS, with a theoretical maximum of 65,000 TPS. However, Feist acknowledged potential challenges, noting that such rapid gas limit growth could strain under-optimized nodes and lead to longer block propagation times. Still, he emphasized that the gradual, epoch-based increases would give developers and node operators sufficient time to adjust. EIP-9698 is part of Ethereum’s broader push to enhance base-layer scalability, following years of reliance on layer-2 solutions. Critics argue that this layer-2 strategy has fragmented the ecosystem, creating isolated chains and complicating user experience due to limited interoperability. Meanwhile, Ethereum developers are also preparing for the Fusaka hard fork, which could test a fourfold gas limit increase under EIP-9678, potentially launching in late 2025. Before that, the Pectra upgrade is scheduled to go live in May, marking another step in Ethereum’s ongoing evolution. Ethereum Has ‘Huge Opportunity’ to Fix AI’s Centralization Problem Ethereum could play a key role in solving some of the most pressing problems facing artificial intelligence, according to Eric Connor, a former core developer of the blockchain. Earlier this month, Connor said Ethereum’s “biggest mainstream moment” could come through its integration with AI, as the sector struggles with centralization, opaque algorithms, and growing privacy concerns. “AI is plagued by black-box models, centralized data silos, and privacy pitfalls,” Connor noted, adding that Ethereum is uniquely positioned to address these issues. Ethereum has already shown the world trustless, programmable finance through DeFi and stablecoins. But its biggest mainstream moment is waiting in the wings with AI. AI is on a fast-track to reshape almost every aspect of our lives. But it’s plagued by black-box models,… — Eric Conner (@econoar) April 15, 2025 Last month, crypto venture capitalist Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures pointed to two key issues undermining Ether’s value: the rise of layer-2 (L2) scaling networks and unchecked token issuance. He argued that “greedy Eth L2s” are siphoning off value from Ethereum’s base layer while giving little back. He also criticized the Ethereum community’s acceptance of excessive token creation, claiming that “ETH was buried in an avalanche of its own tokens. Died by its own hand.” The post New Ethereum Proposal Could Boost Mainnet to 2,000 TPS, Says Researcher appeared first on Cryptonews .",Ethereum News|ETH|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|SOL|ZRX|FORKS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-28 05:43:34

While Ripple (XRP) continues to lead in terms of institutional use cases, some altcoins under $0.08 are seeing serious attention for their special narratives and market setups. Here are four altcoins with the kind of entry points that could turn $250 into something big by 2025. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) – #1 COIN ON TOP WATCHLISTS Right Now The crypto world is already noticing MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise, having already accumulated over $6.9 million and counting. Investors are sold on the meme coin, with the token attracting them with its growth and rising momentum in the market. The early-stage rush has also attracted the attention of other users, establishing MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most-watched altcoins of 2025. As analysts continue to monitor its rise, it is becoming clear that the token is on the verge of a rise. 2. Ripple (XRP) – The Established Leader with Long-Term Utility Ripple remains one of the most trusted names in crypto, with XRP continuing to carry the cross-border transaction industry. The token has also become the first option for institutional usage. The token recently climbed past $2, with the move backed by the company’s recent global partnerships and clear regulatory framework. While XRP is no longer a secret, its potential to grow remains strong, especially as it continues to move into real-world financial infrastructure. 3. Sei (SEI) – A High-Speed Chain Built for Modern Traders Sei has been rising fast in the crypto market because it focuses on performance. It was designed to help decentralized applications and trading environments, using low latency and fast throughput–the kind of technology that developers and liquidity providers need. The technical edge has drawn SEI to traders that are betting on next-gen layer-1 ecosystems to be successful in a competitive DeFi landscape. 4. Uniswap (UNI) – The Trusted DeFi Protocol with Room to Expand Uniswap remains an important part of the decentralized exchange world. UNI has been improving in the sector, thanks to its proven use case and its developer’s focus on innovation. As decentralized trading continues to expand, UNI’s role is expected to grow further in the market. The consistent development, updates, and upcoming integrations make it one of the safest bets for profits in the market. Final Thoughts If you are looking for projects with substance, early availability, and the potential for rewards, then this list is a very good place to start. MAGACOIN finance, XRP, SEI, and UNI each offer the best path to long-term growth–whether you are attracted to bold branding, institutional fundamentals, high performance, or DeFi leadership. With early entries closing fast, investors who act while these tokens remain under the radar could make big rewards.

While major names like Solana and XRP continue to perform, a growing number of investors are pivoting toward this new contender with one question in mind: Is this the next multi-million dollar crypto story? From wallet activity to online chatter, it’s becoming clear— MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just another token launch. It’s looking like a serious player on the verge of something much bigger. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building Real Momentum—and It’s Happening Fast The smartest moves in crypto come before the headlines. That’s exactly where MAGACOINFINANCE is right now: rising fast, but still early enough to move on. What’s fueling the rush? It’s a combination of clean rollout mechanics, transparent development, and—most importantly—confidence from experienced traders. Unlike short-lived trends, this project is checking every box: real wallet growth, growing community participation, and a development team that’s actively delivering on promises. It’s not speculation anymore. It’s traction. Why Solana and XRP Investors Are Joining the Move Solana has become the standard for high-speed, high-performance blockchains. It’s attracting developers, real-world applications, and institutional capital—but its biggest gains are likely behind it. XRP , revitalized by its regulatory clarity, is finally being recognized for what it’s always claimed to be: a legitimate infrastructure layer for global finance. Banks and fintech firms are now taking it seriously—and so are the investors who stuck with it. But even among these giants, there’s growing recognition that MAGACOINFINANCE could be where exponential growth still lives. Others in the Mix: Polkadot, Sei, and Key Ecosystem Drivers Polkadot remains a top-tier network for chain interoperability. Its parachain structure continues to attract experimentation and development flexibility, especially among builders focused on scalable applications. Sei is emerging quickly as a speed-first blockchain designed for performance-heavy use cases like trading. It’s still in the early wave—but developer interest is growing fast. These projects are solid—but they’re already discovered. MAGACOINFINANCE is still under the radar—and that’s exactly what makes it exciting. Final Word The crypto world rewards timing—and investors know it. Right now, early buyers are treating MAGACOINFINANCE.COM as a rare shot at entering before the wave breaks. This might not be just another token. It might be the opportunity that turns today’s moves into tomorrow’s big headlines.

43892057,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=716814,1745820023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43892057.jpeg,The Federal Reserve deceived everyone with its rescission of anti-crypto rules,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fed-deceives-with-anti-crypto-rules/,"Caitlin Long, the CEO of Custodia Bank, said the Federal Reserve tricked the public by pretending to ease up on crypto rules but actually keeping the most important anti-crypto restriction alive. Caitlin posted a detailed thread on X Sunday explaining that while the Fed made noise about scrapping four pieces of anti-crypto guidance, it left one major piece in place. This surviving policy, she said, was issued alongside the Biden White House’s anti-crypto statement back on January 27, 2023, and it still blocks banks from touching crypto in any real way. Caitlin said the guidance left untouched does three main things. First, it blocks banks from holding cryptoassets as principal, meaning they can’t even pay a small gas fee. Second, it stops banks from issuing stablecoins on permissionless blockchains. Third, it keeps a clear preference for permissioned blockchains — ones controlled by big banks — even though the OCC and FDIC dropped that idea. Caitlin said , “The Fed has maintained a regulatory preference for permissioned stablecoins,” warning that this creates a first-mover advantage for big banks’ private stablecoins before the broader stablecoin bill becomes law. Fed favors big banks while stifling crypto custody Caitlin said the Fed’s refusal to let banks deal with crypto directly has bigger consequences than most realize. Not only does it block Wall Street banks from making markets in major tokens like BTC , ETH, and SOL, but it also screws over banks trying to offer crypto custody. Caitlin explained that crypto custodians usually need to estimate gas fees ahead of time. If the estimate is too low because network fees spiked, the transaction would fail. In the current setup, a bank acting as a custodian can’t pay the missing amount, which would force the transaction to die. This issue grows even messier because custodians often split up large crypto holdings into smaller pieces to manage risk better. Every split means new on-chain transactions and more gas fees. Caitlin said that since banks can’t pay those fees directly, the whole process becomes too risky, discouraging them from offering crypto custody services at all. In short, the Fed threw sand into the gears for banks looking to seriously work with crypto. Caitlin summed it up by saying the Fed effectively handed big banks a head start in launching permissioned stablecoins while making it harder for others to catch up once the stablecoin market fully opens. She added that this maneuver gives Wall Street giants an advantage now, before Congress passes the stablecoin law that would remove the Fed’s preference for permissioned systems. Fed hides real actions while White House cheers Caitlin criticized the Fed’s public relations stunt. She said the Fed made a big deal about all the rules it rolled back but never mentioned the critical one it kept. “The Fed definitely won on PR spin,” she wrote, adding that even smart people got fooled. She warned that now that people know the truth, they should be furious. She said the White House praised the Fed’s actions, clearly unaware—or pretending to be—that the worst policy stayed. Caitlin said this raises questions about what the White House expected from the Fed, what the Fed promised, and how the relationship between the two might be shifting. She said most media outlets have talked about brewing fights over interest rates, but almost nobody is covering the growing tension over bank regulation. Cynthia Lummis, the head of the Senate Banking Committee’s Digital Assets Subcommittee, was not tricked. She called the Fed’s move “lip service” and made it clear she wasn’t buying the act. Cynthia, who has serious power over digital asset rules in the Senate, could take steps to fix what she called a “deceptive maneuver.” In her own post on X, Cynthia added, “Unlike the OCC and FDIC, the Fed STILL uses reputation risk in bank supervision.” She also said that the same Fed staffers who pushed Operation Chokepoint 2.0, the infamous Biden-era effort to pressure banks away from controversial industries, are still the ones handling crypto policy today.

The meme coin is showing signs of bullish continuation after a long stretch of consolidation, and a resulting breakout from such momentum could be enormous. To put it plainly, its 2024 400% breakout could pale in comparison to what is coming if Shiba Inu manages to complete its breakout. Shiba Inu Green Closes Point To Bullishness A pseudonymous crypto analyst has pointed out some interesting formations in the Shiba Inu price chart, which seem to have gone under the radar. For example, the Shiba Inu price has marked its 3rd consecutive weekly close and continues to flash signs of more price increases. With the most recent break and close in the green, Shiba Inu is now looking to break above its long-term support. Related Reading: XRP Price Ready To Reach $8 As Consolidation Breaks – Here’s The Timeline Currently, the Shiba Inu price is still trading above its August 2024 low before its 400% breakout. This suggests that the meme coin could be on the ground floor of something extraordinary, especially as the majority of its investors sit underwater, according to data from IntoTheBlock. If this bullish momentum is maintained, the crypto analyst sees the meme coin rallying to brand-new all-time highs. The first target is @0.000139, which would be an 894% rally from its current level, as well as 50% higher than its current peak of $0.00008. Another more bullish target is that the Shiba Inu price could reach as high as $0.000220. This is a 1,479% increase in price and 150% higher than the current all-time high. The post read: We will have to wait and see, it is too early but the market is turning green now and will continue to trade green. It can happen that it go higher rather than lower based on the chart. It can happen that rather than overestimating the potential of this pair, we are underestimating it, this too would be good, the more it grows the better it gets. The Other Side For The Shiba Inu Price While the fact that the Shiba Inu price closed three weeks with green candles is commendable, it is possible that this might not end well for the meme coin. Looking back to November-December 2024, which is the last time that SHIB saw three consecutive green weekly closes, what followed was catastrophic. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Reaches Last H1 Support, Next Major Resistance Comes Into View The price went on a rapid downtrend with three red weekly closes following the three green weekly closes. The following weeks were not much better as the Shiba Inu price only saw one green weekly close in eight weeks. Therefore, if this were to repeat this time around, then it is possible that the SHIB price could see a downtrend before picking back up.

It jumped above $95,100 early Sunday and the rally came after the U.S. President Donald Trump said he would roll back tariffs on Chinese imports. Bitcoin’s surge was largely driven by $3.06 billion in weekly inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. Altcoins also fared well, with XRP up 4%, Solana up 1%, and Cardano up 2% over the past day. XRP is making headlines as the SEC has approved ProShares’ first-ever XRP futures ETF, set to go live on April 30. ProShares is preparing to launch three XRP-tracked products this week after a quiet SEC approval. The flurry of XRP ETFs comes after Ripple’s major victory over the SEC in March, which cleared major regulatory hurdles for XRP. Analyst Warns XRP Could Drop to $1.25 Analyst Egrag Crypto, in his latest X post , predicted that XRP could hit $1.25 in the short term. He explained that XRP still shows weakness unless it can close above the $2.33–$2.45 range, which would signal a bullish breakout. Egrag opened up about the importance of the 0.702 Fibonacci level, linking it to a major past breakout. Further, he advised his followers not to chase market gains or panic sell, but instead to keep accumulating XRP during price dips. “This is a short-term outlook, and while I am confident we may see double digits in the upcoming months, we first need to dispel any bearish sentiments,” the analyst said.

In a post that sharply contrasts with typical narratives pushed by prominent digital asset influencers, Aljarrah stated, “Tether props up BTC. XRP was engineered to replace what Bitcoin only pretended to solve. Ripple’s protocol is already bridging financial systems, something BTC never could.” This assessment was accompanied by a video featuring Egon von Greyerz, Founder and Managing Partner of Von Greyerz AG, who expanded on the ideas. This is the take on Bitcoin, Tether, XRP, and Gold you won’t hear from any mainstream crypto influencer. Tether props up BTC. #XRP was engineered to replace what Bitcoin only pretended to solve. Ripple’s protocol is already bridging financial systems, something BTC never could. pic.twitter.com/pwxNEx0zB3 — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) April 25, 2025 Bitcoin as a Politicized Asset and the Role of Tether Von Greyerz described Bitcoin as a heavily politicized asset that no longer functions as its original proponents claimed. He characterized Bitcoin as the “new oil,” suggesting that its value is being inflated deliberately to facilitate debt repayment strategies by certain governments, referencing El Salvador as one example. He said, “Bitcoin is being used like oil was in the 70s, artificially inflated to pay down US debt and create demand for US dollars.” He explained that the drive to inflate Bitcoin is tied to the need to prop up demand for U.S. dollars and U.S. treasuries, especially under frameworks like the Loomis bill. According to von Greyerz, Bitcoin’s current trajectory aligns it more with the goals of central authorities rather than functioning as an independent, decentralized financial alternative. Tether plays a significant role in this arrangement. Von Greyerz pointed out that Tether is not only backed by U.S. Treasuries but holds more Treasuries than the country of Germany. He described how Tether’s integration into Bitcoin’s ecosystem, particularly in trading pairs and liquidity, contributes to an inflated perception of Bitcoin’s organic market demand. The stablecoin, when tied to an asset like Bitcoin, effectively supports a system that promotes demand for U.S. debt instruments. XRP and Ripple’s Foundational Role in Global Finance In contrast to Bitcoin, XRP, and the technology created by Ripple were framed by both Aljarrah and von Greyerz as practical tools with functional utility across financial systems. According to von Greyerz, Ripple developed the underlying digital ledger technology (DLT) as far back as 2001, long before the wider public discourse around cryptocurrency took hold. He noted that Ripple’s ISO 20022-compliant protocol enables interoperability between various financial systems and is being positioned as the technological backbone for central bank digital currency (CBDC) development. Von Greyerz claimed that institutions like the IMF have already acknowledged Ripple’s role in CBDC infrastructure, and that the tokenization of assets, interbank settlement, and digital identity will rely on XRP’s ecosystem. This stands in contrast to Bitcoin, which he said “is not a store of value. It is not a medium of exchange. It is not a unit of account.” Rather, it is a speculative asset whose value is strategically inflated to serve state monetary objectives. Gold’s Continued Relevance in a Digitally Oriented World While praising Ripple and XRP’s practical applications, von Greyerz also emphasized that the foundational backing for the coming digital monetary system remains physical gold. Referring to the IMF’s reports from 2020, he noted that even within future digital frameworks, gold is still cited as a hard asset supporting the system. This is despite public emphasis on digital innovations and tokenized assets. He stated, “The whole thing is still going to be based and backed by a hard asset, gold, not Bitcoin.” Final Perspective on Speculation Versus Utility Von Greyerz clarifies that he is not categorically opposed to Bitcoin. However, he stressed the need for honesty about his role. He said if the Loomis bill is enacted, the Bitcoin market could offer significant speculative gains. Yet he rejected the idea that Bitcoin is fulfilling the functions originally promised by its advocates. He described the current narrative surrounding Bitcoin as dishonest, characterized it as an “intentionally created asset bubble to create demand… for the very dollar it’s supposed to be an anti-dollar asset solution to.” Aljarrah’s tweet and von Greyerz’s commentary suggest that Bitcoin is no longer a challenge to the system but now works in support of traditional monetary policy. In contrast, XRP and Ripple are shown as tools for real financial connectivity, while gold is still seen as a quiet but steady reserve in today’s changing digital economy.

He added that capital flows into the network “are ramping up,” sharing a chart that showed an increase in 30-day total flows and a decrease in 30-day speculative flows. “Both total and speculative flows have bottomed. When both align, they join forces to make a bullish environment anchored in fundamentals. Bullish Bitcoin Technicals The analyst added that their risk signal model has started its trend back down, which means liquidity has returned to the market. “Downside pullbacks will be muted in this environment,” he added. BTC fundamentals have turned bullish, not a bad setup to break all time highs. I took a break from X to enjoy the NZ summer but every week I put out a series of analysis to my subscribers (this is a hobby, NOT a long term project). Thought I’d post this update publicly. — Willy Woo (@woonomic) April 27, 2025 With medium-term targets of $90,000 and $93,000 being hit, “the $108,000 target is still in play with a new interim target of $103,000 forming,” said Woo. However, in the short term , more sideways action or a slow grind upwards is the most likely scenario. He added that all dips are for buying under the present regime, and there is a good chance of them in the very short term, before concluding: “BTC is setting up for another break of all-time highs if the capital flow trend continues. It’s a solid long-term setup.” Analyst “Rekt Capital” said that Bitcoin would need to have a weekly close above $93,500 to start the process of regaining the previous range. The asset dipped below $93,000 briefly on Monday morning before recovering to reclaim $94,000 at the time of writing, so this move may be a possibility. #BTC Can Bitcoin do it?

BTC Above STH Price The positive weekly close has pushed the Bitcoin price above the short-term holder price for the first time since March 3, reported Galaxy Research. When BTC trades above the STH price, it signals that recent buyers are in profit. “This reduces the likelihood of capitulation and strengthens on-chain support for further upside,” it explained. Bitcoin’s price increased more than 10% this week, climbing from $85,177 at the weekly open to $93,946 as of the April 24 daily close. This move pushed BTC above the short-term holder (STH) price for the first time since March 3.

SEC staff need to use crypto to better understand how it works and the best way to regulate it, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal argued in open letters sent to OGE acting director Jamieson Greer and newly sworn-in SEC Chair Paul Atkins , which he shared to X on April 25. “To regulate technology, you need to understand it. To understand technology, you need to use it,” Grewal said in the letter to Greer. “Permitting commission staff to hold crypto is essential to them developing the knowledge necessary to propose and adopt workable regulatory frameworks for digital securities activity,” he added. Source: Paul Grewal Legal Advisory 22-04, issued on July 4, 2022, by the OGE, prohibits SEC staff from buying, selling, or otherwise using crypto and stablecoins because they are not “publicly traded securities” and don’t qualify for an exception, unlike stocks. SEC needs waivers for staff Grewal said US President Donald Trump directed the SEC and other agencies to submit recommendations for crypto regulations due in around 90 days, and SEC “staff still cannot use the technology on which they are making recommendations.” He echoed a similar sentiment in his letter to Atkins and crypto-friendly SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, arguing being unable to hold crypto is a roadblock for the agency’s Crypto Task Force in creating a regulatory framework. Source: Paul Grewal While it’s up to OGE to rescind the advisory, the SEC should take its own action, Grewal said. “For example, issuing waivers to crypto task force members and other staff actively working on task force matters would be consistent with measures already taken in commensurate advisory situations,” he said. Related: Coinbase files FOIA to see how much the SEC’s ‘war on crypto’ cost Grewal added that a waiver would allow SEC staff on the Crypto Task Force responsible for creating crypto regulations to use crypto and “evaluate the underlying digital asset technology.” Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who took office in 2021, was known for his hardline stance on crypto regulation. He resigned on Jan. 20 after spearheading an aggressive regulatory stance toward crypto , bringing upward of 100 regulatory actions against firms. Following Gensler’s exit, the SEC opted out of a swathe of lawsuits against crypto firms, including Coinbase, on Feb. 27 and, in a more recent April 24 walkback, flagged plans to drop its enforcement against blockchain firm Dragonchain.

ADA is consolidating near $0.70 and eyes more gains above the $0.720 zone. ADA price started a recovery wave from the $0.650 zone. The price is trading above $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.7180 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.720 resistance zone. Cardano Price Faces Resistance In the past few sessions, Cardano saw a fresh decline from the $0.7350 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA declined below the $0.720 and $0.70 support levels. A low was formed at $0.6826 and the price is again moving higher. There was a move above the $0.70 level. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7338 swing high to the $0.6826 low. Cardano price is now trading above $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.7150 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7338 swing high to the $0.6826 low. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.7180 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $0.7250. The next key resistance might be $0.750. If there is a close above the $0.750 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.780 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.80 in the near term. Another Drop in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.7150 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.70 level. The next major support is near the $0.680 level. A downside break below the $0.680 level could open the doors for a test of $0.630. The next major support is near the $0.6175 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.

According to a filing with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the plaintiffs claim Nike carried out a “rug pull” by promoting sneaker-themed NFTs, pocketing profits from initial and secondary sales, and then shutting down RTFKT in January 2025, leaving holders with steep losses and worthless assets. The lawsuit, led by an RTFKT holder, Jagdeep Cheema, seeks $5 million in damages and calls for a trial by jury to decide the claims. It accuses Nike of violating consumer protection laws and selling unregistered securities. Plaintiffs argue that the Nike NFTs meet the criteria for securities under the Howey Test, as buyers made an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits tied to Nike’s ongoing efforts. “As this type of digital asset is properly classified as a security under relevant law, the issuers of this type of token are required to register them and file relevant statements with the authorities and comply with relevant securities laws. The Nike NFTs were never registered as such,” the lawsuit noted. You might also like: TRUMP developers remove $4.6m from liquidity pool, raising rug pull concerns Nike acquired RTFKT in December 2021, during the peak of NFT mania, positioning the move as part of its bigger push into the digital world. At the time, RTFKT was praised for blending fashion, gaming, and blockchain tech in ways that captured huge attention across the crypto and sneaker communities. The studio quickly became a standout name, with projects like CloneX and Cryptokicks generating millions in sales. Early buyers were promised a gamified experience with quests, forging events, and exclusive drops that tied digital collectibles to real-world rewards. However, as the broader NFT market cooled throughout 2023 and 2024, interest in RTFKT’s collections also started to fade. In December 2024, Nike announced RTFKT would wind down after one final release, the “Blade Drop,” describing the move as a shift toward preserving RTFKT’s legacy rather than an outright shutdown. The plaintiffs argue that Nike’s withdrawal crushed the value of the NFTs, many of which had once traded for thousands of dollars, and wiped out promised ecosystem features like quests, rewards, and exclusive access to limited-edition products. Nike and RTFKT had also allegedly promoted the NFTs with promises of peer-to-peer trading and an active ecosystem where completing challenges and forging sneakers would add real value. After the shutdown, those features disappeared, the secondary market dried up, and NFT prices collapsed almost overnight. “Predictably, prices plunged and did not recover. Investors – some of whom are cited in this complaint – and the crypto community at large lamented Nike’s brazen rug pull,” the lawsuit added.

Set to go live tomorrow, XRPFi will introduce smart contract capabilities to XRP, enabling users to stake, lend, borrow, and trade XRP-based assets directly on the Flare blockchain. Crypto analyst Angelica Saldaña broke the news, highlighting how XRPFi will open up new avenues for XRP holders. The platform will allow users to earn rewards, engage in lending and borrowing, and explore yield strategies, all while operating within the familiar XRP ecosystem. This is seen as a significant step in enhancing XRP’s real-world utility. A Game-Changer for XRP Holders For years, XRP holders had limited options beyond simply holding their tokens. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP lacked the tools to tap into the growing DeFi market. Flare Networks is changing this by introducing FXRP, a new version of XRP that can be used on the Flare blockchain. This innovation allows users to mint FXRP, enabling them to lend, borrow, and earn rewards without relinquishing ownership or relying on external parties. It’s a breakthrough that provides XRP holders with newfound freedom and security. Flare’s Bigger Vision for DeFi XRPFi is imminent!!

This comes amid positive news on the Ripple ETF front, albeit not what the XRP community anticipates. Bitcoin, alongside most of the market, had a quiet weekend, but prices started to fall on Monday morning. BTC dropped by a few grand from over $94,500 to under $93,000 before it recovered to the starting lines. Consequently, bitcoin and most alts sit at essentially the same levels as yesterday. In contrast, XRP dipped to $2.16 yesterday before it shot up to a multi-day peak of almost $2.3. Although it has retraced slightly since then, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency is still 5% up on the day, outperforming all top 25 alts. The most evident reason for this is the approval of three Ripple ETFs in the United States. ProShares got the green light to launch Ultra XRP ETF (which has 2x leverage), Short XRP ETF, and Ultra Short XRP ETF (-2x leverage again). ICYMI: ProShares has received SEC approval to launch three $XRP ETFs: Ultra $XRP ETF (2x leverage), Short $XRP ETF, and Ultra Short $XRP ETF (-2x leverage). These funds will track #XRP futures prices, offering traders opportunities for long and short positions. pic.twitter.com/VXzVyOgn9x — CryptoPotato Official (@Crypto_Potato) April 28, 2025 The products are similar to the leverage XRP ETFs released by Teucrium earlier this month. Although they are not the spot Ripple ETFs expected by the community, it seems that the most recent approvals have given XRP’s price a notable bump over the weekend and Monday morning. Popular crypto analysts believe the eventual approval of spot XRP ETFs will have a groundbreaking effect on the underlying asset’s price, with some shocking predictions setting targets of up to $100.
