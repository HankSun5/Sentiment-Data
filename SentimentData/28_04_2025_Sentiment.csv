Between market rallies and wild presale activity, everyone’s got their eye on that next crypto to explode. While some tokens ride the hype, others build tech that solves real-world pain points—and that’s where things get real interesting. Take Qubetics, for example. It’s not just riding the wave. It’s making it. With over 509 million $TICS tokens sold, 25,200+ holders, and more than $16.4 million raised in crypto presale stage 31, this isn’t just hype—it’s traction. At just $0.1902 per $TICS, some folks are loading up for what could be a breakout year. Now, let’s not forget Maker and Binance. Both powerhouses in their own lanes. Maker’s locking horns with real-world asset backing, while Binance keeps expanding its empire across regions and regulations. But Qubetics? It’s rewriting the rulebook. What’s coming next is a look at how each of these three could be the next crypto to explode, where they stand right now, and why one of them might just flip the script on blockchain as to know it. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain Utility in 2025 Qubetics isn’t trying to copy what came before—it’s filling the gaps left wide open. Built for everyday people, business pros, and devs, its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet and Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace put real usability in your hands. Qubetics is rolling out a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, a feature making waves across blockchain forums and crypto Reddit. Why does it matter? Because converting physical or traditional assets (like property deeds, invoices, or contracts) into secure digital tokens is unlocking new economies. Unlike past attempts that lacked user-friendly execution, Qubetics keeps things intuitive. Here’s what sets it apart: Seamless access via its multi-chain wallet Built-in security audits and compliance layers Tools tailored for freelancers, SMBs, and global firms On-chain transparency for legal clarity and dispute resolution Quick asset liquidity with minimal middlemen Beyond its marketplace, Qubetics’ presale stats alone scream traction: Stage: 31 $TICS Token Price: $0.1902 Tokens Sold: 509M+ Holders: 25,200+ Raised: $16.4M+ Some blockchain analysts have weighed in too. With mainnet launch around the corner, $TICS at $1 could yield a 425% ROI, $5 brings 2527%, and if it hits $15—you’re staring at 7783% ROI. But here’s the kicker—Qubetics is focused on function over fanfare. Add in cross-chain compatibility, mobile-ready features, and dev-friendly APIs, and this thing’s not just surviving—it’s building. Maker: Solid, Stable, and All About Real-World Assets Maker’s always played the long game. One of the OGs in decentralized finance (DeFi), MakerDAO’s bread and butter is Dai—the algorithmic stablecoin backed by collateralized assets. But in 2025, Maker’s doing more than keeping things stable—it’s doubling down on Real-World Asset (RWA) integration. Recent reports on MakerDAO’s Endgame Plan reveal the protocol is actively working with fintech partners to onboard traditional assets like bonds, invoices, and real estate-backed instruments into the ecosystem. Still, it’s not without hurdles. Regulatory uncertainties, rising competition in stablecoins, and limited user interface innovation have held it back from being that next crypto to explode. While it’s trustworthy and proven, the lack of everyday user appeal may keep it more niche than mass-market. Yet for those looking at risk-minimized exposure in the blockchain space? Maker’s still a heavyweight. Binance: The CeFi Titan Keeping the Pressure On Binance is like that tech billionaire who just won’t sit down. Love it or hate it, Binance is everywhere. From NFTs to DeFi to its own BNB Chain, it’s more than just an exchange now—it’s infrastructure. And here’s what’s got folks buzzing in 2025: BNB Greenfield, a decentralized storage and data solution that’s gaining traction among Web3 app builders. Binance is pushing to dominate beyond just buying/selling crypto—now it wants to own how data flows across blockchain. But it’s not all smooth sailing. Centralized exchange tokens like BNB are facing pressure from DeFi protocols and regulatory authorities. Questions around asset custody and internal governance transparency still loom. Still, BNB remains a top-5 token by market cap and consistently ranks in high daily trading volumes. If Binance keeps innovating while navigating the legal maze? It might just reclaim the crown as the next crypto to explode. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: Why It Matters One of the hottest topics in 2025? Real-world asset tokenization. Here’s why it’s taking over headlines: Makes global trade frictionless Enables partial ownership of expensive assets (like real estate) Provides transparent, immutable records on-chain Opens access to financing for underserved markets Cuts out middlemen and legal complexity Qubetics is going all-in on this. While others are talking theory, Qubetics has built the pipes. From its cross-chain compatibility to legal-grade smart contracts, it’s turning buzzwords into blueprints. For businesses in Central Asia or small-time operators in Canada? This kind of infrastructure is a game-changer. Real-world tokenization isn’t just a feature—it’s the future of finance. And Qubetics isn’t waiting around. Conclusion Crypto hype comes and goes, but tech that solves actual problems? That’s where the gold’s at. Qubetics is digging into that goldmine with a tokenization platform and tools that actually work. Maker’s playing it smart and secure, and Binance? Well, it’s still the big dog making bold moves. Looking at the facts, traction, and what’s being built—not just talked about—Qubetics might just be the next crypto to explode . Don’t sit on the sidelines watching others scoop up what could be one of blockchain’s biggest plays in 2025. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics Frequently Asked Questions What is Qubetics’ Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace? It’s a platform that turns real-world assets like contracts and property into secure, tradable digital tokens. How does $TICS compare to Maker’s Dai in 2025? $TICS offers growth potential and real-world use cases, while Dai focuses on price stability through collateral. Is Binance still a safe bet after regulatory challenges? Yes, Binance has regained momentum by securing licenses in 15+ countries and launching new Web3 solutions. What’s the current price of Qubetics $TICS token? As of Stage 31, $TICS is priced at $0.1902 with over 509 million tokens sold. Which crypto project is solving real business problems in 2025? Qubetics leads with tools like a multi-chain wallet and asset tokenization for global SMBs.

According to SMQKE, Digital Commodities Capital Corp. (CSE: RIPP), a publicly traded company, has officially confirmed holding XRP in its corporate treasury, marking the first public disclosure of XRP holdings by a listed firm. The company’s announcement revealed that it currently holds 103,000 XRP and is exploring further exposure to Ripple-affiliated assets and technologies. SMQKE noted that this moment signals a shift in how institutional players position XRP.

Digital Commodities… pic.twitter.com/AQzejOTR9g — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 25, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Unlocks Institutional Interest The announcement follows the March 24, 2025, settlement between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which ended a years-long legal dispute. Digital Commodities Capital described the settlement as a pivotal moment that delivered long-awaited regulatory clarity to the digital asset space. According to the company, this clarity enables more balanced engagement between innovators and regulators and strengthens the legal framework for classifying utility-driven tokens like XRP. In this context, SMQKE pointed out that institutions were already preparing for this outcome, even as retail investors grew uncertain during the litigation period. Strategic Long-Term Positioning Around XRP Digital Commodities Capital’s CEO, Brayden Sutton, stated that the company believes in the future of compliant, utility-based digital assets and identified XRP as a prime example. The confirmed holdings are part of a broader strategy to build long-term value through diversified digital assets. Sutton also indicated that the company is actively reviewing further investment opportunities within Ripple’s ecosystem . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SMQKE interpreted this as a clear sign that XRP is being taken seriously by strategic capital allocators, not just as a speculative asset, but as part of long-term institutional investment theses. A Precedent That May Influence Other Institutions SMQKE emphasized that this is more than a single corporate action. It is a precedent that could influence other publicly traded entities to disclose their XRP positions or consider adding the asset to their portfolios. According to the post, XRP is entering a new phase where its role in digital finance is acknowledged not only by early adopters but by formal institutions operating under public market oversight. The researcher concluded that XRP has never lost its value proposition among those who understand long-term fundamentals and that its official recognition by a public company marks the beginning of broader institutional engagement.

Van de Poppe stated that altcoins are showing signs of recovery after a four-year historical bear market. According to the analyst, investor expectations have been seriously shaken over the past 3 months. However, current indicators show that the market is green. Van de Poppe said that many factors that move the markets come from outside the cryptocurrency sector. Van de Poppe stated that the increase in liquidity has a direct upward effect on Bitcoin. He said that as the money supply (M2) expands, the prices of rare assets like Bitcoin are expected to rise. The analyst stated that China has started quantitative easing (QE), Europe has lowered interest rates and the US is preparing to increase the money supply with interest rate cuts, and that these steps create a strong driving force for risky assets. Related News: SEC Approves Highly Anticipated XRP ETF - Price Reacts - Not Yet Approved Spot ETF on the Horizon Now According to Van de Poppe, the peak in gold in the short term and the increase in risk appetite create a positive environment for Bitcoin and altcoins. The analyst stated that Bitcoin is supported by developments such as ETF approval and Donald Trump becoming the US President, and that these factors create a new wave of liquidity. Van de Poppe, who said that gold has outperformed the S&P 500 by 20% since 2022, argued that despite this, the markets are now starting to lose their upward momentum in gold. He predicted that the next 12-18 months could offer a strong performance for risky assets. Van de Poppe stated that the CNH/USD (Chinese Yuan/US Dollar) parity has a decisive effect on the altcoin market. Past data shows that major rallies begin in altcoin markets when the CNH/USD parity bottoms. Recalling the examples of 2016 and 2019, the analyst pointed out that the yuan has bottomed after the sharp declines experienced recently. He claimed that this development could open the door to a new period of rise in the altcoin market. Van de Poppe stated that macroeconomic factors have replaced the traditional four-year market cycle approach, and that liquidity and global economic conditions will now be more at the forefront. He stated that a serious revival could occur in altcoins as the Chinese Yuan strengthens and gold prices correct. *This is not investment advice.

Livingston said miners currently produce around 450 BTC per day or approximately 13,500 BTC per month, but Strategy acquired 379,800 BTC in the last six months. This translates to the firm purchasing roughly 2,087 BTC per day — far in excess of daily miner output. The author added: ""When Bitcoin becomes this scarce, access to Bitcoin will require paying a premium. Lending against Bitcoin will cost more. Borrowing Bitcoin will become a luxury business reserved for nation-states and corporate whales, and Strategy will control the bottleneck."" ""BTC's global cost of capital will no longer be set by 'the market.' It will be set by the gravitational policies of the first Bitcoin superpower: Strategy,"" Livingston continued. The author's prediction of a Bitcoin supply crunch translates into much higher BTC prices if Strategy can continue its pace of BTC acquisitions while market demand for the supply-capped digital asset grows among institutional and retail investors. The Bitcoin miner reserve, a metric tracking the total amount of BTC held in miner wallets, continues to decline.

Critics of the company warn that the debt-based approach to BTC acquisition could sink Strategy financially if a prolonged BTC bear market takes effect and also warn of greater systemic risks to BTC from such a high concentration of the digital currency held by a single entity.

Ammous argued that institutions like BlackRock and Strategy holding high concentrations of BTC could not engineer a hard fork increasing Bitcoin's maximum supply, as it would massively devalue their holdings, which, at the end of the day, belong to shareholders with the power to divest.

Analysts expect Bitcoin to gain an additional 40% by the end of the year Select altcoins are showing a positive bias on improving crypto sentiment. Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose more than 10% this week as buyers made a strong comeback, pushing the price to the overhead resistance at $95,000. Although buyers are struggling to clear the overhead hurdle, a positive sign is that they have not given up much ground to the bears. The sharp up move is backed by solid buying in the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which witnessed inflows of $3.06 billion , according to Farside Investors data. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a post on X that it was really notable to see “HOW FAST the flows can go from 1st gear to 5th gear.” Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360 After Bitcoin’s recovery, 21st Capital co-founder Sina said in a post on X that Bitcoin reclaimed the power-law price. Sina’s Bitcoin Quantile Model projects Bitcoin to reach between $130,000 and $163,000 before the end of 2025. Anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 had an even bigger target of more than $200,000 for Bitcoin in Q4 of this year. Could Bitcoin maintain its momentum and rise above the overhead resistance? Let’s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that look strong in the near term. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the crucial $95,000 level. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($88,619) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone indicate that bulls are in command. A close above $95,000 could propel the BTC/USDT pair to $100,000 and eventually to $107,000. Sellers are expected to aggressively defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA is the critical near-term support to watch out for because a break below it brings the large $95,000 to $73,777 range into play. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 4-hour chart shows the bears are fiercely defending the $95,000 level but are struggling to sink the pair below the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it enhances the prospects of a break above $95,000. The pair could then surge to $100,000. Instead, if the price maintains below the 20-EMA, the pair could tumble to the 50-simple moving average. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it could pull the pair to $86,000. Sui price prediction Sui ( SUI ) has been facing resistance near $3.90, but the shallow pullback suggests that the bulls are in no hurry to dump their positions. SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price stays above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $3.14, the bulls will make another attempt to shove the SUI/USDT pair above $3.90. If they can pull it off, the pair may skyrocket to $4.25 and then to $5. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $3.14, it signals the start of a deeper correction toward the 50% retracement level of $2.94. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $2.94 and the 20-day EMA ($2.69). SUI/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the pair is finding support at the 20-EMA, but the sellers are active at higher levels. The bears will again attempt to sink the pair below the 20-EMA. If they succeed, the pair could slump to $3.14. Buyers will have to swiftly push the price above the $3.81 to $3.90 overhead resistance zone if they want to retain the advantage. If they do that, the pair could start the next leg of the up move to $4.25. Avalanche price prediction Avalanche ( AVAX ) has been range-bound between $23.50 and $15.27 for the past few days. In a range, traders usually buy near the support and sell close to the resistance. AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Although buyers have failed to push the price above $23.50, a positive sign is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That increases the likelihood of a break above $23.50. If that happens, the AVAX/USDT pair will complete a double-bottom pattern, which has a target objective of $31.73. This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. The pair may then remain stuck inside the range for a few more days. AVAX/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has been consolidating in a narrow range between $21.60 and $23.10 for some time. That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher. If buyers propel the price above $23.10, the pair could surge to $25. There is resistance at $23.50, but it is likely to be crossed. Alternatively, a drop below $21.60 signals that the bulls have given up. That may pull the price down to $19.50.

TRUMP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView A rally above $16 is attracting sellers, but a shallow pullback suggests that every minor dip is being purchased. If buyers drive the price above $16, the TRUMP/USDT pair may reach $17.69, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. However, if buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair could skyrocket to $19.60 and then to $22.40. Conversely, a deeper pullback suggests that the short-term bulls are booking profits. The zone between $11.56 and $12.45 is expected to act as a solid support. If the price rebounds off the support zone, the pair may swing between $11.56 and $16 for some time. Selling could accelerate if the pair breaks below the 20-day EMA ($10.73). TRUMP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair turned down from $16 but is finding support near the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. That suggests the bulls are active at lower levels. Buyers will try to push the price above the $16 overhead resistance, starting the next leg of the uptrend. Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-EMA suggests that the bullish momentum has weakened. The pair may then slump to $14 and later to the solid support near $12. Sellers will be back in the driver’s seat on a drop below $11.50. Bittensor price prediction Bittensor ( TAO ) broke and closed above the downtrend line on April 20, suggesting that the bears are losing their grip. TAO/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The up move is facing resistance at $375, but the pullback is expected to find support at the 20-day EMA ($298). A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA signals a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. The bulls will then attempt to drive the TAO/USDT pair above $375. If they succeed, the next stop may be $495. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the downtrend line, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the breakout. The pair then risks falling to $222. TAO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pullback is finding support at the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. Buyers will try to resume the up move by pushing the price above the $375 resistance. If they manage to do that, the pair could reach $425. Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to sink the price below the 20-EMA, opening the doors for a drop to the 50-SMA and later to the downtrend line. A break below the downtrend line tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

That’s exactly where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out. Still priced at just $0.025, this DeFi project is starting to generate serious attention, and analysts are now pointing to a possible 2,000% return as its utility rolls out and adoption scales. With most new tokens offering hype but no real backing, MUTM is doing the opposite—quietly building an ecosystem that makes decentralized finance more accessible, more flexible, and more rewarding for everyone involved. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Low-cap crypto assets often get overlooked—but when utility meets timing, they tend to outperform. Mutuum Finance is still in its presale phase, yet it has already attracted nearly 9,000 participants and raised over $7 million. More than 420 million tokens have been sold to date, and momentum is building fast as the current pricing window begins to narrow. Every new presale phase increases the token price, and many investors are stepping in now to lock in their allocation before the next jump to $0.03. At the heart of Mutuum’s architecture is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Users who deposit crypto assets into the system receive mtTokens, which represent their deposits and grow in value over time by accruing interest. These tokens can be held, transferred, or used within other decentralized applications, making them more than just placeholders—they’re active earning tools. On the borrowing side, the system is designed to protect both users and the protocol itself. Borrowers must provide more collateral than the loan value, following a strict Loan-to-Value (LTV) threshold. This model ensures long-term sustainability and positions Mutuum as a protocol with structure, not guesswork. One of the standout features for long-term holders is the platform’s revenue alignment model. Instead of constantly issuing new tokens to reward users, Mutuum channels a portion of its revenue back into buying MUTM directly from the market. These tokens are then redistributed to ecosystem participants—especially mtToken holders, who are rewarded for their involvement. This system not only avoids the pitfalls of inflationary emissions, but also creates sustained demand over time—a key driver in token appreciation and yield generation. At the current rate of $0.025 per token, a $1,000 investment would grant access to 40,000 MUTM tokens. When forecasts come to fruition and MUTM climbs to $0.50, that position would be worth $20,000—a 20x increase. Stretch that further toward the projected 2,000% growth, and the potential multiplies even more. This isn’t just a numbers game; it’s a strategy. With real utility, strong community growth, and protocol revenue working behind the scenes, this token has ingredients many established cryptocurrencies are still missing. The team behind Mutuum has already announced that a beta version of the platform will be released around the time of token launch, giving users an immediate opportunity to engage with its features. Additionally, the platform’s overcollateralized stablecoin is in development, allowing users to borrow against their assets without needing to sell them—adding another layer of usability and flexibility. Once live, MUTM is expected to be listed on multiple exchanges, opening the door to broader access and significantly increasing its exposure across the crypto market. Mutuum Finance is doing what many low-priced tokens don’t—it’s delivering structure, smart mechanics, and meaningful growth potential. For those looking into the best crypto to invest in for long-term gains, MUTM is emerging as a strong candidate. At just a fraction of a dollar, with strong utility, passive income mechanisms, and a clear path forward, it represents more than just another presale. It’s a project with real legs—and the potential to change portfolios in the months ahead.

While Bitcoin and Solana are prime examples of how small, early investments can multiply into life-changing returns, today’s spotlight is shifting to a new name: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . This token isn’t promising overnight riches—but what it is offering is the combination of timing, structure, and momentum that defined the earliest days of both Bitcoin and Solana. That’s why early adopters are watching closely. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining the Kind of Early-Stage Traction That Matters What makes a project stand out in its first phase? Consistent delivery, growing wallet activity, and conversations that go beyond the hype. That’s exactly what MAGACOINFINANCE is doing—and why it’s earning a spot on investor shortlists across the board. The token isn’t just climbing—it’s gaining credibility. Community channels are growing by the hour. Early holders are sticking around, not selling. And its roadmap is being checked off in real-time. It’s the kind of build-up that looks eerily similar to the patterns Bitcoin and Solana showed before they took off. Notable Competitors Still in the Mix: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin, and Litecoin Uniswap remains dominant in decentralized trading, with unmatched liquidity and smart contract simplicity. But its market cap suggests its biggest run may already be behind it. Polkadot is still pushing boundaries in blockchain interoperability, and its parachain system is driving useful experimentation—but it’s a maturing network. Bitcoin , of course, still leads the market. But at its current stage, it’s a store of value, not a surprise mover. Litecoin continues to be a reliable transactional coin, with low fees and broad integration. However, it’s largely seen as stable rather than explosive. Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE still lives in the discovery zone—and that’s where the most growth often hides. Final Word Can MAGACOINFINANCE.COM turn a small investment into millions? Time will tell—but the elements are all there: strong launch, growing trust, and market timing that feels exactly right. Bitcoin and Solana proved that the early mover gets the biggest reward. The next one could already be here.

Over the course of the year, the IC3 recorded over 140,000 complaints linked to cryptocurrency, which led to staggering financial losses of $9.3 billion. Alarming Trend A significant portion of these losses came from individuals aged 60 and above, who filed roughly 33,000 complaints and suffered a combined total of $2.8 billion in losses. This age group also saw the largest increase in both reported complaints and financial harm. The IC3’s report also noted a dramatic year-over-year increase in losses – 66% higher than in 2023, when total losses amounted to $5.6 billion. Investment scams involving cryptocurrency were the primary source of these losses, but the report also highlighted other schemes such as sextortion, where criminals manipulate personal content to coerce victims into sending money, and fraud involving crypto ATMs. Additionally, ransomware attacks, which had been a recurring issue, showed a 9% rise in 2024, thereby posing a growing threat to critical infrastructure. Overall, fraud and crypto scams were the most significant contributors to the rise in reported cybercrimes, with older individuals particularly vulnerable to these high-stakes digital fraud schemes. On the other hand, pig butchering scams, which were once mainly targeted at older adults, are now increasingly affecting younger individuals, particularly those aged 30 to 49. A recent study by Cyvers examined 150 major crypto platforms, revealing over 200,000 scam incidents and $5.5 billion in losses in 2024. The research focused on Ethereum-based scams and uncovered significant fraud across various platforms, including major exchanges, a crypto-friendly bank, and institutional trading platforms. The scale of impact varied, but the trend is clear: younger people are becoming the prime victims. Operation Level Up ‘Operation Level Up’ was thus initiated with the assistance of FBI agents and the US Secret Service to address the growing issue of cryptocurrency investment fraud. Pig butchering involves fraudsters building online relationships with victims and convincing them to invest in a fraudulent cryptocurrency platform. As a result of this operation, a total of 4,323 individuals affected by cryptocurrency investment fraud were informed of the scam. Of these victims, 76% were unaware they had fallen victim to fraud. The estimated financial savings for these victims amounted to $285.6 million. Additionally, 42 victims were referred to an FBI victim specialist for support regarding potential suicidal thoughts.

Bitwise CEO Drops Jaw-Dropping New Prediction,https://thecoinrise.com/50-trillion-bitcoin-boom-bitwise-ceo-drops-jaw-dropping-new-prediction/,"Hunter Horsley, Bitwise CEO, has dropped a bold prediction concerning Bitcoin (BTC). Horsley says Bitcoin can hit a $50 trillion valuation if it assumes the role of a digital alternative to the U.S fiat. Bitcoin Positioned Beyond Gold as a Global Value Store In an update shared on X, Horsley maintained that BTC’s worth is much more than that of gold, a traditional store of value. He notes that BTC is more like U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar, which, when aggregated, are valued at approximately $50 trillion. Bitcoin is an apolitical, digital monetary asset. The right comparison may be not just Gold (~$23T) — But also Treasuries and USD (~$50T). When people want to digitally store value, the latter is often the way. — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) April 26, 2025 The estimated value of gold is about $23 trillion globally, but Horsley highlights that Bitcoin has more advantages as it exists online. He insists that the coin remains the preferred way investors store “value” in today’s financial world. According to the Bitwise CEO, some features that make Bitcoin appealing are that it is “an apolitical digital monetary asset.” That is, it is not tied to anyone, country, or government. The decentralized feature sets Bitcoin out as an asset. The message behind Horsley’s update is to highlight the possibility of Bitcoin if countries worldwide progressively adopt digital value storage. Bitwise’s Growing BTC Bet Reflects Horsley’s Conviction Horsley has always been bullish about BTC. His stance aligns with the principle of Bitwise. The asset management company under Horsley’s leadership has increased Bitwise’s BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF), BITB, to over 39,000 BTC. Bitwise’s Bitcoin holding has been estimated at approximately $3.67 billion. Hence, Horsley’s stance on the potential of Bitcoin is based on a position of knowledge. Clearly, Bitcoin has grown from competing with gold or chasing technology stocks to positioning itself as a notable force in the financial world . How Bitwise’s CEO’s prediction materializes remains an event to look forward to in the financial world. Bitcoin’s Rising Institutional Adoption Fuels Optimism As of this writing, the coin was trading at $94,118.85 with a market capitalization of $1.86 trillion. This positions it as the leading digital asset in the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin’s appeal has led to growing institutional adoption from firms like Metaplanet, Semler Scientific , and Strategy. Perhaps, BTC might witness more mainstream adoption shortly. The post $50 Trillion Bitcoin Boom?

Catching the right project at the right moment is how legends are made. And now, early investors are wondering whether MAGACOINFINANCE.COM could be that next major play—the kind of early entry that shifts portfolios entirely. There’s no question this token is attracting serious attention. From organic growth to mounting analyst discussions, this isn’t another project trying to go viral overnight. It’s one that’s quietly gaining power—and smart investors are noticing. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Steam While Others Stall Not every token launch is worth watching—but this one is. MAGACOINFINANCE has been steadily building momentum with real traction: growing wallet counts, strong retention rates, and increasing visibility in investor forums. It’s not relying on influencers or hype cycles. Instead, it’s executing with purpose—developing a community-first ecosystem that’s attracting early believers and long-term thinkers alike. There’s a seriousness to its rollout that sets it apart from the typical short-burst memecoins. More importantly, it’s doing this at a moment when the market is hungry for new momentum. With attention shifting toward early-stage entries that could define the next run, MAGACOINFINANCE is standing right in the spotlight. Other Solid Projects—But With Limited Early Entry: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin Uniswap remains a key player in the decentralized exchange space. Its model for token swaps and liquidity pools has changed how people trade—but it’s now a well-known giant, with much of its explosive upside already realized. Polkadot is doing valuable work around interoperability and multi-chain scaling. It’s vital to Web3 innovation—but as a large-cap asset, its growth arc is longer and more gradual. Bitcoin Cash continues to serve those focused on simple, peer-to-peer digital payments. It has strong utility and global adoption—but few would describe it as an “undiscovered” asset. Litecoin is one of the oldest altcoins still standing. It remains relevant, especially for fast, low-cost transactions—but it’s also fully matured in its current form. These projects are dependable—but they’re no longer in their early days. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is just beginning its ascent. Final Thought Can $750 really become $1.2 million? It depends on the project. It depends on timing. And it depends on execution. Right now, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is hitting all three. The structure is there. The interest is growing. And the window is still wide open—for now. If history has taught us anything, it’s that those who move early often move the farthest.

Meme coins require minimal capital investment to build a sizable positions, yet promise explosive initial gains, which continue to attract millions of buyers from all over the world into meme assets to date. One of the up-and-coming contenders within the meme coins market this year is CartelFi . But does this newcomer have what it takes to uncrown some of the more established names within this space like Shiba Inu? Let’s explore. CartelFi vs Shiba Inu: which one offers better utility? Shiba Inu has long been touted as the “Dogecoin killer”. It gained famed as a community-driven meme coin upon launch in 2020. Over the years, it has grown its ecosystem to include ShibaSwap, a decentralised exchange, and other tokens as well like LEASH and BONE. Shiba Inu continues to thrive on a vibrant community and speculative trading, but its utility remains rather limited. CartelFi, on the other hand, is more innovative. It’s fully committed to becoming more than just a meme coin. CartelFi is marketing itself as a platform with a mission. It wants to help the community transform its idle meme coins into yield-generating assets, branding itself as “the ultimate staking cartel.” This means that instead of letting meme coins idle in wallets, they get to put them to work and set up a new source of passive income with CartelFi. It’s a unique approach that bridges the gap between meme culture and decentralised finance (DeFi), offering real utility and value to users. Click here if you’d like to learn more about CartelFi and its native meme coin. CartelFi vs Shiba Inu: which one has better growth potential? CartelFi may be a better pick than Shiba Inu in 2025 also because it’s currently in its early stages only, which makes it a prime opportunity for investors looking to get in on the ground floor. CartelFi presale has attracted massive interest, raising more than $1 million in within a matter of weeks. This momentum indicates strong investor confidence and potential a bright future ahead. Note that meme coins are broadly known to offer explosive initial gains. This narrative makes CartelFi all the more exciting to own than Shiba Inu as the latter has been around for years. So, it’s reasonable to believe that it has already had its moment in the sun. However, CartelFi is yet to realise that explosive growth, indicating building an early position in it today could prove rather lucrative for investors as we proceed through the remainder of 2025. All in all, CartelFi’s innovative approach, strong growth potential, and focus on utility make it a standout in the crowded world of meme coins. For investors looking to merge the fun of meme coins with an added benefit of yield generation, CartelFi is the clear winner.

Amid wild market movements for TRUMP, a Georgia senator has labeled the invitation an impeachable offense. Meanwhile, a shift in sentiment sees investors turn to PepeX , a project looking to revolutionize the memecoin space. Georgia senator slams Trump’s memecoin dinner It’s an impeachable offense, US Senator Jon Ossoff from Georgia said. Ossoff said this as he publicly criticized President Donald Trump’s reported gala dinner for top 220 investors of his $TRUMP memecoin. The lawmaker criticized the move as “selling access,” noting that the event set for May 22 could be grounds for impeachment proceedings against the president. This is the latest controversy around the TRUMP token, which launched in January 2025 amid market euphoria on Trump’s election win and inauguration. Critics point to TRUMP soaring amid the dinner news as a scenario that will only enrich these few whales and insiders. The criticism, which has come from other congressional lawmakers and the crypto circle as well, see the president’s involvement as a conflict of interest and a dangerous precedent. Notably, the token’s creators hold 80% of supply. Memecoin investors buy PepeX While analysts suggest TRUMP memecoin could be worth watching, investors keen on other opportunities are flocking to PepeX. The AI-powered memecoin launchpad, which seeks to challenge Pump.fun and others in the market, has raised over $1.6 million in its presale. PepeX, targeted for multi chain use, eyes a user-friendly platform for memecoins creation. Its main selling point is it’s focus on community rather than token creators and a few top whales. The platform’s AI-powered technology provides a fair token distribution. It caps creators at 5% of supply while allocating 95% to the public. PepeX also includes anti-sniping tech and real-time transparency tools like bubble maps. This means the platform removes the potential for manipulation and rugs, which have dominated Pump.fun launches. Moreover, only 0.04% of Pump.fun participants profitable.

According to the PepeX whitepaper , the planned public launch is in Q3 2025. The roadmap includes key milestones such as decentralized AI launchpad, DEX partnerships and staking. Its presale, with tokens priced at $0.0243, offered early birds up to 332% in presale returns. This has many looking to buy early before the 90-day ICO ends. Overall crypto-friendly environment under President Donald Trump Despite the controversy around TRUMP, the broader crypto landscape is experiencing a notable shift under President Trump’s administration. Since his campaign for election in 2024, Trump has increasingly taken a pro-crypto stance. The industry supported him and other leaders amid the push for clarity in the regulation of digital assets, with the signing executive orders to promote cryptocurrencies among key developments in 2025. On April 25, 2025, new SEC chair Paul Atkins said the agency was ready to work with Trump’s administration and Congress to support efforts for regulatory clarity.

The bank’s indirect Bitcoin exposure via stocks reached $356 million, raising sell pressure risk amid a global trade war and recession concerns. Abu Dhabi’s $437 million spot Bitcoin ETF stake shows sovereign wealth funds see Bitcoin as a hedge. Norges Bank, Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund, reported a $40 billion loss in the first quarter of 2025, with most of the decline caused by a drop in the value of US-listed technology companies. Norges Bank also indirectly owned 3,821 BTC through its stock market investments by the end of 2024, presenting a potential sell pressure risk to Bitcoin, especially when considering the socio-political uncertainty and the risk of an economic recession caused by the global trade war. In such times, could Norges Bank increase its investments in Bitcoin-related companies or even buy spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a way to hedge risk? For now, it seems unlikely that Norway’s investment fund would consider buying a Bitcoin ETF, especially since the fund does not hold any gold. Besides stocks and bonds, Norges Bank invests in real estate, including retail, industrial, renewable energy, and logistics properties worldwide. Norway sold all of the central bank’s gold by early 2004, when gold was trading below $400. Since then, gold has outperformed the S&P 500 by 280%. Equities now make up 71.4% of the fund’s total investments, so if the global trade war continues, significant losses could occur. Gold/USD (orange) vs. S&P 500. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Norges Bank investments generated $222 billion in profits in 2024, and its stock market portfolio dropped by only 1.6% in the first quarter of 2025. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund is “mainly index-driven,” according to CEO Nicolai Tangen, specifically following the FTSE Global All Cap Index. Although this index includes over 7,100 stocks from both developed and emerging markets, it is based on market capitalization, which means 65% of the exposure is to North American companies. But, according to Norges Bank Deputy CEO Trond Grande, there is some flexibility for active investment, and their exposure to US-listed tech stocks has been below the benchmark for the past 18 months. Some of these holdings, such as Strategy, Mara Holdings, Coinbase, and Riot Platforms, hold large amounts of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on their balance sheets. As a result, even if not intentional, the sovereign wealth fund had a $356 million indirect exposure to Bitcoin at the end of 2024. FTSE Global All Cap (purple) vs. FTSE + 10% Bitcoin (green). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Data shows a 5% hypothetical allocation in Bitcoin back in 2018 would have boosted the fund’s equities benchmark performance by 56%. Buying Bitcoin ETFs seems unlikely, but indirect exposure remains possible Technically, it seems unlikely that Norges Bank could buy into the spot Bitcoin ETF without changing the fund’s mandate. However, increasing exposure to companies with significant Bitcoin holdings appears possible. Still, there is no sign of such a move, although Nicolai Tangen stated on April 24 that the fund will increase investments in US stocks.

Similarly, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board held $321 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs, showing the growing use of cryptocurrency as a hedge.

Cardano just rolled out a governance framework update that aims to sharpen its community-led innovation. Meanwhile, Litecoin celebrated its latest halving with a modest uptick in hash rate and community engagement, reminding everyone it’s still swinging in the heavyweight division of payments-focused coins. But amidst the buzz, a new heavyweight contender is emerging: Qubetic s. It isn’t just another blockchain play. With over $16.4 million raised and more than 509 million $TICS tokens sold to over 25,200 holders, this one’s building tools real folks and businesses need—starting with a decentralized VPN. At $0.1902 per token in its 31st presale stage, Qubetics is not just solving blockchain’s old headaches; it’s crafting new paths for the future of digital finance. Let’s dive into what makes Qubetics, Cardano, and Litecoin each worth watching and how one of them could end up being your ticket to the best crypto to get rich. Qubetics ($TICS): A Real-World Blockchain With Utility that Hits Home Here’s the deal. Crypto ain’t just about charts and candle patterns anymore. It’s about solving problems—real ones. And Qubetics is out here treating blockchain like a Swiss Army knife. Whether you’re a professional handling sensitive data or a small business owner dealing with sketchy internet providers, this one hits different. The standout? Its built-in decentralized VPN. Imagine ditching shady VPN services and replacing them with one that’s on-chain, secure, and anonymous by design. It’s not just smart—it’s what the ecosystem’s been crying out for. And it doesn’t stop there. What’s Popping Right Now? Qubetics is in Stage 31 of its crypto presale . $0.1902 per $TICS token. Over 509 million tokens sold. More than 25,200 holders. Over $16.4 million raised. With tech that simplifies cross-border payments, creates secure file transfers, and decentralizes cloud services, Qubetics isn’t following trends. It’s setting them. The QubeQode IDE & Business Simplicity This isn’t just a playground for coders. Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE is designed for devs, professionals, and even non-tech folks who want in on blockchain without wrestling code like a python in the jungle. Add in lower transaction fees and scalable infrastructure, and you’ve got something built for the long haul. The Buzz from Analysts Look, folks in the know are calling out numbers like $1, $5, even $15 post-mainnet. That’s up to a 7783% return. Of course, this ain’t financial advice—it’s simply what’s out there in credible circles. Why It Could Be the Best Crypto to Get Rich When you’re looking for the best crypto to get rich, utility and early entry matter. Qubetics isn’t just a whitepaper dream. It’s a functional, scalable project that’s making tech smoother and privacy tighter. Cardano (ADA): Smart Contracts Meet Real-World Governance Cardano’s been around the block—literally. It was one of the earliest Proof-of-Stake champions and has long pitched itself as an academically serious blockchain. In 2025, Cardano isn’t chasing hype. It’s refining the fundamentals. Cardano just activated an upgrade to its Voltaire governance model, putting more power directly in the hands of ADA holders. Community voting, treasury allocation, and even on-chain proposals are seeing streamlined improvements. That’s real decentralization, not just lip service. With over 1,200 dApps currently built on Cardano and a dev community that’s growing like it’s on Miracle-Gro, ADA keeps climbing the ranks. Its low transaction fees, energy efficiency, and secure Haskell-based coding environment keep it appealing. Education systems, agricultural supply chains, and even digital ID solutions in emerging markets are actively integrating with Cardano tech. This isn’t fantasy—it’s happening. It’s not the fastest mover, but it’s steady and consistent. For those scoping out the best crypto to get rich with a balance of safety and innovation, ADA earns its seat at the table. Litecoin (LTC): The OG Payments Coin Still Holding It Down Don’t let the quiet demeanor fool you—Litecoin’s a beast that’s aged like fine whiskey. It’s got roots going back to 2011, and while many have come and gone, LTC is still here, doing its thing. Litecoin’s August 2024 halving event is already showing its ripple effects. The hash rate is up, miner activity is steady, and LTC has crept back into payment gateway headlines. With transaction speed sitting at around 2.5 minutes per block, it still lives up to its “silver to Bitcoin’s gold” nickname. While newer blockchains chase the shiny DeFi narrative, Litecoin keeps it simple: be fast, cheap, and reliable. Whether it’s cross-border remittance, ecommerce checkout, or ATM withdrawals, LTC is quietly powering real transactions every day. It’s accepted at thousands of merchants globally, from retail stores to online platforms. Payment processors keep integrating it. Litecoin is that old-school friend who never asks for the spotlight but always shows up. If you’re betting on dependability and wide acceptance, Litecoin’s got the goods. It’s not flashy, but it works—and sometimes, that’s exactly what pays off. What’s a Decentralized VPN and Why Should Anyone Care? A decentralized VPN flips the script on traditional ones. No central authority. No single point of failure. Just pure peer-to-peer privacy. Here’s why this matters: Traditional VPNs can be hacked or surveilled. Centralized systems log your data—even if they swear they don’t. Governments can block access or demand logs. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN changes the game: User data isn’t stored—ever. Connections route anonymously through a mesh network. It’s blockchain-backed, meaning secure and transparent without compromising privacy. Great for business use, remote work, or just surfing without big brother peeking in. This isn’t some side project—it’s a core piece of Qubetics’ infrastructure. And that’s what makes it a serious contender when folks talk about the best crypto to get rich. Conclusion: Who’s the Best Bet? Cardano’s playing the long game with governance and academic rigor. Litecoin’s old-school but steady, with widespread real-world usage. But Qubetics? That one’s rewriting the rules—solving the problems that’ve tripped up other chains and doing it with tools people can actually use. The best crypto to get rich in 2025 might not be the loudest one. It’s the one laying down real-world foundations—one decentralized VPN, secure payment system, and developer IDE at a time. Want in before the crowd catches on? This might be your shot.

Earlier this month, the BTC mining hotspot of Irkutsk unveiled the nation’s first-ever year-round ban on crypto mining in the southern part of the oblast. This move came just months after Moscow imposed a wintertime ban on crypto mining in 10 Russian and Russian-controlled regions until 2031. Russian Gas Alternative for Irkutsk Bitcoin Miners? Per the Russian news agency Interfax , the Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev has urged major players in the mining market to join forces with oil and gas companies. A Gazprom Neft oil refinery. (Source: Neftehim [CC BY-SA 3.0]) He said that the parties should unite to build data centers that use “alternative fuel sources.” Kobzev made the comments during an April 25 address on the state of affairs in the region. He claimed that the Irkutsk government was “not against mining as a phenomenon.” However, he reasserted claims that miners need to overcome electricity shortages. And he said his government had a duty to ensure residents and enterprises in the region enjoyed uninterrupted electricity supplies. Kobzev said: “The regional government is ready to act as a platform to coordinate interaction between mining operators and enterprises working in the oil and gas production sector. There are already successful cases of firms building data centers powered by autonomous generation. These firms use associated gas.” Iran, Russia agree on 55 bcm of gas supplies, nuclear plant funding https://t.co/cP4vZjiySE https://t.co/cP4vZjiySE — Reuters (@Reuters) April 25, 2025 Russian oil firms have been working with crypto miners on associated gas-related pilots since the start of the current decade. Some of the nation’s biggest BTC miners and oil firms, including BitRiver and Gazprom Neft, started working together in 2022. Irkutsk’s Governor Igor Kobzev meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2019, in a photograph released by the Kremlin’s press service. Russia Starting to Feel Crypto Mining Boom Downside? Russia has seen one of the world’s biggest booms in Bitcoin and altcoin mining in recent years. With many miners forced out of China, Russian miners have claimed that taxing their industry could bring Moscow hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of revenue. But this growth has taken a toll on many areas’ energy grids. The Ministry of Energy is reportedly mulling issuing three more regional mining bans as networks in some areas begin to suffer. Other parts of the country claim they have surplus power that they can use to power miners’ rigs. But Kobzev appears keen to keep miners in southern Irkutsk away from public grids at all costs. He pledged to support associated gas-powered crypto mining initiatives “in every possible way.” He also said that such a partnership could help improve the Irkutsk environment by reducing flaring. Could BTC Miners Switch to Russian Gas Power? When drilling for crude oil, producers often release pockets of natural (associated) gas. If drillers do not have any infrastructure that lets them capture this gas, they must instead burn it using flare stacks. Many industries are hesitant about using associated gas, as it tends to produce intense but irregular bursts of energy, rather than uninterrupted flows. Russia said it arrested a man suspected in the murder of a senior military official near Moscow and claimed that a car bomb had been activated remotely from Ukraine. https://t.co/Gut35SJH0z — Bloomberg (@business) April 26, 2025 Some Russian miners, however, say that they are happy to use this model of energy flow, provided they can pay discounted rates. Kobzev was optimistic about the said that a failure to stamp out crypto mining-related energy problems could see the capacity deficit in southeastern Siberia hit just shy of 3GW by 2030. But critics say that efforts to ban crypto mining in southern Irkutsk have instead resulted in a rise in illegal and quasi-legal operations. Some claim that rising Bitcoin prices have also played a role, with miners now increasingly reluctant to turn off their rigs.

She stated, “XRP serves a couple different roles… within the blockchain, the XRP Ledger, it’s the native asset, so you need it for gas fees, you need it for the reserve account minimum, and so as there’s more users and more use cases built on XRP Ledger, that asset will always be needed.” She also discussed XRP’s function in liquidity provisioning on XRPL. “Within that exchange… if a trading pair doesn’t have liquidity between it, it auto-bridges, goes between XRP for efficiency, speed, and cost… so that will be an increasingly important use case as more activity comes to the blockchain.” Long confirmed that Ripple continues to use XRP as part of its payments offering depending on customer needs, adding, “It’s kind of dependent on customer use case.” XRPL: Designed for Functionality and Innovation Long described the XRP Ledger as an early attempt to improve Bitcoin’s limitations. “The original XRP Ledger launched as… Bitcoin 2.0… in their brains, they were thinking of Bitcoin as this ingenious invention, how can we improve upon scalability and tinker with the consensus model so that you could enable things like an exchange within the blockchain itself.” She reinforced the company’s long-term alignment with XRPL development, noting, “The whole company started because three developers created the XRP Ledger… and so we’ve always had a belief in building use cases that would make use of the efficiency within XRP Ledger.” Ripple continues to enhance the ledger, including adding lending protocols and a multi-purpose token amendment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple USD (RLUSD) and Institutional Stablecoin Demand On the subject of stablecoins, Long explained the rationale behind Ripple’s decision to launch RLUSD, citing its relevance to Ripple’s cross-border payments business. She highlighted RLUSD’s utility and availability. “It’s quick, right, you can get effectively the equivalent of a dollar in digital version… and then 24 by 7 availability… as opposed to using this kind of real-time rail for stablecoins.” Long said the stablecoin market is projected to exceed $3 trillion , adding that Ripple focuses on institutional usage. One area gaining momentum is using stablecoins as collateral: “One that I think is getting more and more attention is using [stablecoins] as an asset for collateral for trading in the more traditional institutional world… this is one that’s definitely spiking for us.” Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Long also addressed Ripple’s relationship with the banking sector. Recalling the early years, she said, “In 2014… we knocked on the doors of banks and we explained… you could do cross-border payments on a blockchain and it would be near instant, almost free… they were like, slam the door in our face.” But today, she said, banks are far more receptive. “They have embraced it a lot more.” She clarified that Ripple’s role is to serve as an intermediary, and acknowledged how regulatory shifts make banks more willing to engage with blockchain services. Long concluded with a critique of legacy financial systems. “When you talk to the banks, the effort to run those products, it’s kind of shocking, a lot of the backend process is still manual or it’s paperwork, it’s just all this stuff that could be automated and just made more efficient with technology.” As All Things XRP noted in his coverage of the interview, Ripple is no longer operating in a limited capacity. Under Long’s leadership, it is positioning itself to help build the infrastructure underpinning the next phase of institutional finance.

Back argued that investment firms allocating their treasuries to BTC are leading the charge in global adoption, a trend he believes could drive the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization to $200 trillion within the next decade. Back contends that companies are using Bitcoin treasury strategies as a rational and long-term arbitrage Adam Back, also the creator of Hashcash, claimed that organizations and governments worldwide were beginning to acknowledge the special monetary qualities of BTC. Back further shared an X post to illustrate this on April 26, stating that treasury firms like Strategy were taking advantage of the gap between the current fiat world and the future of BTC. He continued after this, elaborating that a scalable and sustainable front-running hyperbitcoinization with a $100–200 trillion trade value had enough scalability for most large listed companies to switch to BTC Treasury. Hyperbitcoinization is the term used to describe the hypothetical scenario in which BTC surpasses fiat money as the most widely used currency in the world due to its inflationary economics and the growing mistrust of the established financial system. According to Back, the primary cause of global hyperbitcoinization was still the price of BTC exceeding the inflation of fiat money. Following this, he claimed that some believed that treasury strategy was a passing trend. In response, he argued that it was a sustainable and rational arbitrage. Additionally, based on his argument, BTC prices have increased over the past four years more quickly than interest and inflation, but this trend is temporary. Interestingly, Back made these remarks almost two months after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order creating a national Bitcoin reserve using BTC that was forfeited in criminal cases involving the government. More international companies may decide to adopt BTC following the current appealing conditions Reports suggest that firms like Strategy — the largest corporate holder of BTC — could inspire others to follow suit if they continue expanding their Bitcoin treasuries. According to Michael Saylor , Strategy’s co-founder, the company’s Bitcoin treasury has made over $5.1 billion in profit since the start of 2025, demonstrating the strategy’s profitability. Likewise, Japanese investment giant Metaplanet — aka “Asia’s MicroStrategy” — has adopted the same strategy after April 24, when it surpassed more than 5,000 BTC in its reserves. Furthermore, according to Metaplanet, this was not the end; by 2026, it plans to acquire 21,000 BTC, making it the largest corporate Bitcoin owner in Asia. Furthermore, another thing that would have made it easier for international companies like Strategy to follow suit was the US Federal Reserve’s decision to remove its 2022 guidance that banks shouldn’t deal with cryptos. With this reversal, U.S. financial institutions might feel more comfortable embracing Bitcoin. In reaction to the withdrawal of the guidance, Saylor stated that banks were now free to start supporting BTC. Moreover, Iliya Kalchev, a Nexo dispatch analyst, revealed that banks would now be subjected to regular supervision, indicating a more liberal regulatory framework for integrating digital assets.

Ripple (XRP) & Bitcoin Traders Are Betting BIG on These Altcoins for Explosive Returns,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/1k-to-1m-ripple-xrp-bitcoin-traders-are-betting-big-on-these-altcoins-for-explosive-returns/,"In the crypto world, it’s not just about the technology—it’s about positioning, timing, and being ahead of the curve. While giants like XRP and Bitcoin continue to dominate the headlines, early traders are shifting their focus toward a fresh lineup of altcoins with far greater upside potential heading into 2025. Many long-term XRP holders who saw early success are now reallocating part of their portfolios into smaller, high-traction tokens that could multiply faster in the next cycle. It’s not a rejection of the big caps—it’s a rotation into opportunities that haven’t fully played out yet. New Altcoins Are Catching Smart Money Attention While Bitcoin and XRP continue to offer stability and scale, they’re no longer the undiscovered gems they once were. That role is now being filled by emerging players that combine strong narratives, lean supply models, and rapid community growth. Among the most mentioned right now is MAGACOIN FINANCE —a politically themed altcoin that’s carving out space with bold branding and strategic market entry. With consistent early-stage demand and growing visibility on trackers and social platforms, it’s being discussed as one of the few tokens that hasn’t yet priced in future interest. Investors aren’t just looking at charts—they’re watching wallet activity, search volume, and rotating capital flows. What they’re seeing is that the real action is happening before listings ever begin. Why Traders Are Reallocating Altcoins are inherently higher risk, but that’s exactly what makes them attractive to seasoned traders who’ve already done well with XRP or Bitcoin. They’re not betting on speculation—they’re positioning for volatility they can control. The altcoins getting the most traction right now often check a few critical boxes: a memorable name, early-stage scarcity, increasing coverage from crypto media. Those who once turned $1K into six figures with XRP are now scanning for projects with similar setups—structured entries, social-driven exposure, and room to run. Final Thoughts The $1K-to-$1M tagline may sound ambitious, but in crypto, narratives move markets—and right now, the narrative is shifting. While Bitcoin and XRP maintain their legacy status, many traders are betting big on smaller tokens with disruptive potential. Whether it’s a cultural movement like MAGACOIN FINANCE or another sleeper pick waiting for its moment, the real returns often come from acting before the hype—not after. As always, timing matters. For those with eyes on what’s next, this altcoin wave might be the most exciting play of the year.

In fact, the smartest crypto plays usually begin in silence. Today, while Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) continue to gain strength, a growing number of seasoned investors are locking into MAGACOINFINANCE —a project showing all the right early-stage signs. It’s already surging—and it hasn’t even hit the exchanges yet. What’s fueling MAGACOINFINANCE’s rapid rise Bonus access is still active: Strategic buyers are locking in during the final moments of private entry. Listings are approaching fast: Once live on exchanges, the opportunity for first-mover advantage disappears. Visibility is surging: The token is now on radar inside altcoin analyst circles and private investor communities. Access is still limited: This isn’t mass-market yet. That’s why early positioning matters. MAGACOINFINANCE is earning bold projections MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just climbing—it’s accelerating. With a capped supply and rapidly rising interest, market analysts now place it in the best crypto potential for Q2—supported by its clean structure, momentum, and strategic launch timing. Why SOL, XRP, KAS, and OP won’t offer this entry again Solana (SOL) , XRP , Kaspa (KAS) , and Optimism (OP) are well-established. Their early discovery moments are long past. MAGACOINFINANCE is now trending as a contender among top early-stage altcoins. Final thoughts on MAGACOINFINANCE Every major coin had its quiet beginning— Bitcoin , XRP , and Solana were once ignored. Today, MAGACOINFINANCE is in that same position: building fast, rising confidently, and offering timing that rarely lasts. This is the phase where smart money moves.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 245,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on Bonk ( BONK ) following the altcoin’s breakout of an accumulation zone on the three-day chart. The trader shares a chart suggesting that BONK can rally to as high as $0.0000262 after taking out its resistance at $0.0000142. “BONK is going much higher (I have a bag). Looks good on the charts as well. Think I’m going to add to my position if I get a small dip.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, BONK is trading for $0.0000182. Turning to the native asset of the non-fungible token (NFT) project Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ), the trader says the altcoin needs to print a bullish higher low setup at around $0.0065 to start reversing its multi-month downtrend. Otherwise, Altcoin Sherpa warns that PENGU may drop to as low as $0.004. “Coins like PENGU got rekt the last several months but are showing some signs of life. The true test is going to be where the next low is and how the reaction is. The trend is still bearish, so don’t be so quick to catch knives. That said, we could see some reversal if the environment continues to ease up.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that PENGU may soar to as high as $0.014 if the altcoin manages to establish a higher low. At time of writing, PENGU is worth $0.00985. As for the broader altcoin market, the analyst warns that most coins are still in a high-time-frame downtrend and that the gains witnessed this month could be erased. However, Altcoin Sherpa notes that it is now within the realm of possibility for altcoins to start carving a major cycle bottom en route to a bullish reversal. “To be clear, I’m pretty bullish overall and think that we’re going higher and the next major dip is a BUY THE DIP situation. HOWEVER, most alts still are in bearish market structures (see TAO) and continuation of that trend is down. I think we go higher for everything, but just a careful reminder that these sh*tcoins are still in bearish trends and have made lower highs, lower lows. I do think that we’re doing better, though.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Bitcoin’s weakening correlation with stocks highlights its growing independence as an asset. Bullish institutional investor positioning contrasts with retail traders’ caution, supporting a rally above $100,000. Bitcoin ( BTC ) gained 11% between April 20 and April 26, demonstrating resilience by holding near its two-month high around $94,000. This relief rally followed signals from the Trump administration about easing import tariffs, as well as strong corporate earnings reports. Investor confidence in Bitcoin was further boosted by a record $3.1 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over five days. However, a key BTC derivatives indicator showed signs of bearish momentum, raising questions about whether the $100,000 target is still realistic. Perpetual Bitcoin futures contracts are favored by retail traders because their prices closely track the spot market. A positive funding rate means that buyers pay to maintain their positions, so a reversal in this rate is typically linked to bearish trends. Bitcoin perpetual futures annualized funding rate. Source: Laevitas.ch The sharp negative funding rates recorded on April 26 are highly unusual during bull markets, as they indicate stronger demand from sellers. This metric has been volatile since April 14, but sellers were caught off guard as Bitcoin’s price climbed above $94,000. Since April 21, over $450 million in BTC short positions have been liquidated . Some of the renewed confidence and Bitcoin’s price strength can be attributed to the S&P 500’s 7.1% weekly gain. However, despite this optimism, US President Donald Trump reportedly said on April 25 that negotiations would depend on China making concessions, causing traders to question the sustainability of recent gains. Companies are now reporting first-quarter earnings from before the escalation of the trade war, so the factors driving the stock market and Bitcoin are different. In fact, Bitcoin’s price is no longer closely correlated with the S&P 500. 30-day correlation: S&P 500 vs Bitcoin/USD. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Currently, the 30-day correlation between the S&P 500 and Bitcoin stands at 29%, well below the 60% level seen from March to mid-April. While this lower correlation does not mean a complete decoupling, since investor sentiment is still influenced by macroeconomic factors, it does show that Bitcoin is not simply a proxy for technology stocks. Bitcoin’s status as an independent asset has strengthened Gold’s inability to maintain its bullish momentum after reaching an all-time high of $3,500 on April 22 was also seen as significant for Bitcoin’s status as an independent asset class. Some traders had questioned the “digital gold” narrative, but the longer BTC remains above $90,000, the more confidence investors may have, potentially paving the way for further gains. The increased demand for bearish leverage in perpetual BTC futures does not align with the sentiment of professional traders. Monthly Bitcoin futures contracts avoid fluctuating funding rates, so traders know their leverage costs in advance. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch On April 26, the two-month Bitcoin futures premium (basis rate) rose to its highest level in seven weeks, indicating greater interest in bullish positions. At 6.5%, this metric remains within the neutral 5% to 10% range, but is moving away from bearish territory. The disconnect between leverage demand in perpetual futures and monthly BTC contracts is not unusual. Even if retail traders remain cautious, substantial accumulation by institutions could be enough to push Bitcoin’s price above $100,000 in the near future.

Ethereum price remains stable above $1,600, backed by positive RSI levels and steady support near $1,605. A move above $1,650 could open the path to higher targets. Chainlink technical analysis shows mixed signals, but holding above $12.50 keeps a bullish case in play, with $14.58 as a key level. The real development comes from Web3 ai presale . With its AI assistant offering live trading signals, portfolio rebalancing, and built-in risk tools, it’s gaining attention as the best crypto for 2025—practical, data-focused, and built for smarter trading decisions. Ethereum Price Stays Bullish on RSI Signal Ethereum is holding above $1,600, with traders watching the $1,650 resistance level. A move past this point could push the Ethereum price toward $1,720 or even $1,800. However, if it fails to break through, the Ethereum price might fall back to $1,550. The Ethereum price is currently trading above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, which is a positive sign. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also above 50, suggesting bullish momentum. But if the Ethereum price drops below $1,605, it could test lower support levels. Overall, the Ethereum price is at a critical point, and traders are closely monitoring these key levels. Chainlink Technical Analysis Shows Mixed Market Signals Chainlink is currently holding above $12.50, a key support level. If it breaks past $14.58, analysts suggest it could climb to $26. This potential rise is closely tied to Bitcoin's price movements. Currently, 53% of LINK holders are at a loss, which may influence market sentiment. Technical indicators like MACD and Bull Bear Power show early signs of a possible upward trend. However, a drop below $12.50 could lead to further declines. Chainlink technical analysis indicates that maintaining support above $13.20 is crucial for a bullish outlook. Market sentiment remains mixed, with many holders near their break-even points. Overall, Chainlink technical analysis suggests cautious optimism, but key resistance levels must be overcome. Continued monitoring of Chainlink technical analysis will be essential for anticipating future price movements.

43882814,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/pi-network-and-avalanche-are-growing-cold-wallets-privacy-presale-could-50x-in-2025,1745800166,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/43882814.jpeg,Pi Network and Avalanche Are Growing; Cold Wallet’s Privacy Presale Could 50x In 2025,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/pi-network-and-avalanche-are-growing-cold-wallets-privacy-presale-could-50x-in-2025,"Crypto investors chasing the next breakout are watching Pi Coin and Avalanche closely. Pi jumped 35% after a Chainlink integration, fueling speculation it could hit $3. The move suggests stronger utility and could pave the way for listings on top-tier exchanges. Meanwhile, AVAX is approaching a crucial resistance near $21, with analysts calling for a bullish reversal if volume supports a clean breakout. But while both are driven by momentum and speculation, Cold Wallet is offering something far more rare: a real solution to a growing problem. It is the only Web3 wallet that collects zero data: no IP logs, no analytics, no behavioral tracking. And it is now in Batch 1 of its presale at just $0.007. With a projected launch price near $0.35171, early buyers are looking at a potential 4,900% ROI. In a market that thrives on visibility, Cold Wallet is the one product built to keep you truly invisible, and that is starting to matter more than ever. Pi Coin Surges 35% After Chainlink Deal, Could $3 Be Next? Pi Coin jumped 35% this week after announcing a key integration with Chainlink, pushing its price to around $0.74. The collaboration allows Pi to access real-time data through Chainlink’s oracle system, which helps decentralized applications use accurate price feeds. Analysts believe this could support Pi’s adoption and may lead to listings on larger exchanges such as Binance. Market reaction was immediate. Pi rose from $0.63 to $0.78 in just hours after the update, before stabilizing slightly lower. The surge comes despite a broader monthly decline of over 40%, showing renewed investor interest in the project. Some forecasts now suggest Pi could climb to $3 in the short term, with more ambitious targets placed even higher. The project’s growing ecosystem and strong user base add to that momentum. For traders eyeing emerging altcoins with real use cases and expanding integrations, Pi’s recent moves may signal a return to the spotlight. AVAX Nears Key Resistance: Analyst Says $21 Breakout Could Trigger Full Reversal Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining attention as analyst Crypto Rand highlights a possible bullish reversal if the asset breaks above the $21 level. According to his analysis, AVAX is approaching a critical resistance zone where several technical indicators are converging. A clean move through this price point could mark the start of a broader upward trend. AVAX has faced pressure in recent weeks, but current price action is holding steady near multiple resistance levels. Crypto Rand’s outlook has caught the eye of traders looking for early signals in a still-uncertain market. If AVAX successfully clears the $21 threshold, it may attract renewed buying interest and shift market sentiment. However, the move would need to be supported by rising volume to confirm the trend reversal. AVAX’s current price structure keeps it on the radar for investors seeking assets with short-term upside potential and favorable technical setups. This Wallet Doesn’t Track You, Can’t Profile You, and Still Works Flawlessly; Cold Wallet Is What Web3 Promised Most crypto wallets claim to offer privacy, but nearly all of them collect something: your IP, your activity patterns, even the apps you connect to. Cold Wallet does none of that. It is the only Web3 wallet designed from the start to gather zero metadata. No trackers, no behavior logs, and no background surveillance. Just pure, private access to your crypto, with every layer built to protect, not observe. Cold Wallet uses zero-knowledge cryptography to make sure no one, including the wallet itself, can see your transactions, your wallet balance, or even when you log in. There is no backend logging your behavior, no analytics code quietly watching you. You stay invisible by default. Right now, Cold Wallet is in Batch 1 of its presale, priced at just $0.007. With a confirmed listing price around $0.35171, that’s an estimated 4,900% ROI if you move early. What makes Cold Wallet stand out is that it doesn’t just promise privacy, it runs on it. In a market where every app wants your data, Cold Wallet wants none of it. If you’re serious about protecting your crypto footprint, this is your moment to get in early, before everyone else realizes what real privacy in Web3 should look like. Why Cold Wallet Could Be the Smartest Long-Term Bet Pi and AVAX are gaining attention, but their stories depend on external momentum, new listings, resistance breakouts, and favorable sentiment. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, is rising for a different reason: it solves what every trader eventually realizes is a critical flaw. Today’s wallets leak data. They log behavior. They silently track everything. Cold Wallet fixes that with zero-knowledge infrastructure and a design that forgets you on purpose. It is not just for experts. It runs like an app, but protects like a vault. And right now, with a presale entry at $0.007 and a listing estimate of ~$0.35171, the opportunity is both technical and financial. That is a potential 4,900% gain on a product already built for the regulation-heavy, surveillance-heavy Web3 era that is quickly arriving. Pi might trend. AVAX might reverse. However, the Cold Wallet is where privacy becomes a performance. For investors who think long-term, this is more than an asset, and it is an edge.

Reports suggest TRUMPTAR is gearing up for listings on several major crypto exchanges. Such exposure is expected to attract millions of investors, likely driving a sharp increase in the coin’s value. Already, projections suggest a potential price surge of over 9,000% within the next few days. Currently, TRUMPTAR is only available for trading on decentralized Solana platforms such as Jup.ag and Raydium.io . Early buyers, who have access to the coin before wider exchange listings, stand to benefit the most from the anticipated price movement. The memecoin launched with an initial liquidity of over $6,000 — a notable figure compared to many new entries in the space. How to Purchase TRUMPTAR Early Investors interested in buying TRUMPTAR before its first centralized exchange (CEX) listings can do so on Raydium.io or Jup.ag . To buy, users need to connect a compatible wallet like Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom. They then swap Solana (SOL) for Trump Ends Tariffs by entering the contract address — w7h5t9MrJ77Cu2VCf2apxaMSK1KFkPf6fWNJ7uee144 — into the receiving field. For those without a compatible wallet, setting one up takes only a few minutes. Solana can be transferred from major exchanges like Coinbase or Binance to the wallet to make the purchase. If TRUMPTAR follows the trajectory of previous viral memecoins, early investors could see returns similar to those who got in early on SHIB and DOGE, potentially creating a new generation of crypto millionaires in record time. Solana Memecoin Craze Gains Momentum With larger memecoins like SHIB, DOGE, and DogWifHat (WIF) struggling to maintain momentum in recent weeks, many investors are turning their attention to emerging Solana memecoins such as TRUMPTAR. Despite having no inherent value or utility, these new tokens are attracting speculative investors hoping to capitalize on rapid price growth. The excitement around TRUMPTAR highlights the ongoing appetite for high-risk, high-reward opportunities in the crypto market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It’s Still $0.025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-undervalued-crypto-to-buy-now-with-real-world-use-and-2500-roi-potential-its-still-0-025/,"In a sea of overpriced tokens and short-lived trends, spotting an undervalued cryptocurrency that actually delivers something useful is a rare advantage. Most investors tend to chase what’s already pumped, but some are now turning their attention to projects that are still early, still building, and still offering massive upside. One name keeps coming up in those conversations: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Still priced at just $0.025, MUTM is gaining momentum as a real-world decentralized finance (DeFi) solution—not another meme coin or hype-based token. With analysts pointing to a potential 2,500% return in the coming year, long-term crypto investors are locking in early positions before the price climbs in upcoming presale phases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is built around a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that enables users to lend and borrow digital assets directly, without the need for third-party involvement. Users can lend assets to earn passive yield or borrow against their crypto without selling—providing access to capital while keeping long-term exposure. The platform uses secure, transparent smart contracts to manage the entire process. Unlike many projects that try to imitate popular platforms, Mutuum built its own system from the ground up. The platform features a revenue-driven approach, allocating a portion of its earnings to purchase MUTM tokens directly from the open market. These tokens are then shared with users who hold mtTokens, which represent their deposit positions. This model supports long-term engagement by channeling platform activity into meaningful value redistribution. By directing protocol-generated revenue toward token repurchases and user rewards, Mutuum creates a system where active participants benefit directly from ecosystem growth—an approach that has drawn attention from more experienced investors. One feature setting Mutuum apart is the development of its own overcollateralized stablecoin. Minted through excess collateral locked in the system, this stablecoin offers a way to unlock liquidity without abandoning long-term holdings. It will play a major role in Mutuum’s borrowing system, adding another layer of utility to the ecosystem. Yield generation is also straightforward. When users deposit assets into the protocol, they receive mtTokens, which continuously accumulate interest based on platform activity. These tokens are flexible—users can hold them, redeem them, or use them in other decentralized finance applications. That means real passive income potential, not just speculation. MUTM has a total supply of 4 billion tokens, and the ongoing presale has already seen 420 million tokens sold and over $7 million raised. With nearly 9,000 holders already participating, demand is climbing as the price prepares to rise to $0.03 in the next phase. There are 11 phases total, each offering a higher price point than the last. This creates a natural pressure to get in early. Once the token goes live and major exchange listings kick in, exposure will likely grow exponentially. Combined with the buy-and-redistribute model, this setup is already driving strong FOMO from those watching the presale closely. Let’s run the numbers on what this could look like in practice. An investment of $1,800 at the current price of $0.025 would secure 72,000 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $0.65, that same position would grow to $46,800. And when MUTM climbs closer to the $1 mark over time, you’re looking at a portfolio worth $72,000—all from getting in early, before the broader market catches on. MUTM checks all the right boxes: utility, transparent tokenomics, community traction, and room to grow. It isn’t relying on hype or influencer tweets. Instead, it’s building tools that actually matter in decentralized finance. This isn’t about catching a short-term pump. It’s about identifying a project early—before exchange listings, before media buzz, and before the crowd catches on. With solid fundamentals and a realistic path to real-world use, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may just be the best cryptocurrency to invest in now for those chasing long-term growth and real yield. And at $0.025, it’s still early enough to make every dollar count.

The issue began when a new ETH oracle provided incorrect price data to the system. This caused automatic liquidations, approximately $1.6 million worth of positions. Term Finance clarified in a post on X that the incident was not a hack, no smart contracts were involved, and no users were attacked, explaining that a technical bug in the configuration of the new oracle caused the issue. The episode again shows how vital oracle feeds are to the DeFi ecosystem. Even tiny things can be catastrophic when it comes to smart contracts. Term finance recovers half of lost funds Term Finance immediately pressed to recover the missing assets. Of the 918 ETH lost in total, they recovered 556 ETH. In particular, 223.197 ETH, valued at around $400,000, was seized by the platform internally. Another 333 ETH, worth roughly $600,000, was returned after what Term called “negotiations.” It also remains unknown who was included in the negotiation or on what terms the pact was made. The company has not yet disclosed additional information regarding the method. With the recovery attempts, the remaining loss is now 362.03 ETH — approximately $650,000 at today’s market rates. That’s much less damaging than the one before, and it takes some pressure off Term Finance and its community. The website did not acknowledge this until media coverage surfaced, and the company has since declared that it will conduct a thorough review of its Oracle integration process to avoid such problems in the future. It also suggested that users affected by the bad liquidations might be eligible for further compensation, though no formal decision had been made. Weekend crypto attacks spark industry scrutiny The Term Finance incident wasn’t crypto’s only bad news over the weekend. The DeFi industry was rocked by a chain of attacks, highlighting the continued risk. Impermax Finance said Saturday that a flash loan attack hit its V3 pools. The exploit siphoned more than $150,000 out of the protocol, according to the blockchain security firm TenArmor. Impermax apologized to users and said a full post-mortem would be released soon. For its part, another Solana DeFi platform, Loopscale , lost $5.8 million in an exploit. Attackers took advantage of security holes, contributing to a growing tally of DeFi losses this year. A centralized platform is also not an exception. Crypto exchange Bitget revealed a $20 million loss after hackers exploited a market connected to an obscure token. Bitget said it had discovered eight accounts suspected of being involved in the scheme and would seek legal action against those behind them. The most recent attacks underline how insecure even the biggest players are. The data suggests that very little is recovered from many hacks. Take Bybit CEO Ben Zhou, for example; He disclosed recently that just 3.84% of stolen funds from their February heist had been frozen. Nearly 28% of the stolen funds — worth millions of dollars — have already gone “dark,” flowing into mixers and peer-to-peer networks, where they become impossible to trace. It was a rare victory compared to many other cases in which victims come up empty-handed. And yet, the incident displays a fundamental weakness in the overall security standards and risk management practices in the DeFi industry. The larger DeFi becomes, the higher the stakes and some projects may soon regret not budgeting more for technical failures.

Bitcoin and XRP have long held the spotlight, but one new name is entering the conversation with speed and structure: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . With market momentum building and investor eyes scanning for 2025’s big play, these three names are emerging not just as short-term picks—but as long-term strategies for real wealth growth. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Shaping Up to Be a High-Conviction Wealth Play Some tokens explode and fade. Others build the foundations quietly—and then take over. MAGACOINFINANCE appears to be the latter. It’s not just early—it’s early and executing. Wallets are growing daily, the community is expanding with real participation, and analyst mentions are starting to include MAGACOINFINANCE in serious wealth-building forecasts. What stands out is the way this project has avoided fluff. No overhype, no over-promising—just a clear, growing platform with the potential to rival the early days of Bitcoin-style entry points. For investors with long-term vision, this may be one of the last tokens still early enough to move on. Rising in Parallel: Ethereum, Polygon, Tron, and Arbitrum Ethereum continues to dominate smart contract innovation. Its Layer-2 integrations and network upgrades keep it vital across every use case. Polygon is Ethereum’s trusted scaling engine, pushing transaction speeds and onboarding major real-world partners—from corporations to institutions. Tron keeps volume high and transaction costs low, especially in Asia and among fintech products. It’s one of the most adopted blockchains for payments. Arbitrum is leading the Ethereum Layer-2 conversation, providing scalability and seamless user experiences for decentralized app developers. Each of these platforms is strong—but their early breakout phase is largely behind them. MAGACOINFINANCE , however, is just entering it. Final Word Looking ahead to 2025, the names that may define the year are already taking shape. Bitcoin and XRP continue to prove why they’re essential. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is starting to look like the next big crypto story in the making. The time to find tomorrow’s wealth builders is now—before they become today’s headlines.

When momentum builds, it builds fast—and the market is buzzing about two names that are setting the pace: Solana and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . One is a proven powerhouse gaining fresh traction. The other is a bold new contender that’s turning heads before the mainstream even notices. This is the moment investors dream about—when a project moves from early whispers to loud watchlist alerts. And right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is doing exactly that. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Picking Up Speed With Zero Gimmicks Some tokens go viral for a week. MAGACOINFINANCE is doing something far more sustainable—it’s building. The excitement isn’t artificial. It’s the result of measured execution, steady wallet adoption, and growing attention from research-driven investors. Community channels are growing daily. Social conversations are shifting from “What is this?” to “How early am I?” And perhaps most importantly, the token is showing signs of real structure: transparent development, active leadership, and a clear roadmap that people can actually follow. Momentum is no longer speculative—it’s visible. Solana Stays Hot With Performance and Expansion Solana has been here before—and it’s coming back stronger. Known for its lightning-fast processing and low transaction costs, Solana’s recent uptick isn’t just another rally—it’s tied to actual expansion across apps, integrations, and ecosystem upgrades. With developer activity on the rise and major apps continuing to choose Solana as their foundation, the token is once again showing that it can capture serious volume when the market warms up. Also Trending: NEAR Protocol, Chainlink, Ethereum, and Aave NEAR Protocol is gaining respect for its fast-growing development community and user-focused scalability. It’s quietly becoming a platform of choice for app builders and startups entering Web3. Chainlink continues to be indispensable. As smart contract platforms demand secure, off-chain data inputs, Chainlink remains the most trusted source in the oracle space. Ethereum is still the beating heart of blockchain infrastructure. Layer-2 growth, staking upgrades, and enterprise engagement keep it at the center of any serious discussion. Aave stands tall in on-chain lending and asset management. With continued innovation and flexibility, it’s a staple for those looking to build financial primitives on-chain. These projects are strong, yes—but they’re also established. The excitement now? It’s centered around MAGACOINFINANCE , where early means opportunity—and opportunity is shrinking fast. Final Word $10,000 in 30 days? It’s ambitious—but not unheard of in crypto. Timing is everything. Solana is proving it still has fire. MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is showing it’s more than talk—it’s motion. This might be your window—before the rest of the market catches up.

Feist, who had the blockchain’s “ danksharding ” data storage solution named after him, put forward EIP-9698 on April 27, which would introduce a “deterministic gas limit growth schedule” starting at epoch 369017, or around June 1. The proposal would gradually increase the gas limit by a factor of 10 for roughly two years, or 164,250 epochs, when one final tenfold increase would occur. Ethereum clients would need to vote on the proposal for it to take effect, Feist said. “By introducing a predictable exponential growth pattern as a client default, this EIP encourages a sustainable and transparent gas limit trajectory, aligned with expected advancements in hardware and protocol efficiency,” he added. As Ethereum can occasionally reach up to 20 TPS in blocks dominated by simple transactions, a 100x gas limit increase could theoretically increase Ethereum’s TPS to 2,000. Feist’s proposal would better position Ethereum to compete with the likes of Solana, which currently processes a non-vote TPS between 800 to 1,050 and has a theoretical TPS of 65,000. Source: Fabda.eth The EIP would expand the current gas limit of 36 million to 3.6 billion, potentially allowing around 6,000 transactions to fit into Ethereum blocks. Feist’s proposal comes after Ethereum validators agreed to raise the gas limit from 30 million to 36 million in February. Before that, the last change to Ethereum’s gas limit occurred in August 2021 under the London hard fork, where the figure was roughly doubled from 15 million to 30 million. Daily change in Ethereum Average Gas Limit over the last five years. Source: YCharts Feist acknowledged that a rapid increase in the gas limit under his proposal may stress less-optimized nodes and increase block propagation times. “However, the exponential schedule with very gradual increments per epoch gives node operators and developers ample time to adapt and optimize,” he said. Related: Ethereum community members propose new fee structure for the app layer EIP-9698 marks the Ethereum community’s latest effort to boost scalability at the base layer after predominantly focusing on scaling through layer 2 solutions in recent years. Critics of Ethereum’s layer-2 focused strategy claim that it has fragmented the ecosystem into several siloed chains with little interoperability, leading to a worse user experience. EIP-9678 looks to increase gas limit Ethereum developers are also looking to test a fourfold increase of Ethereum’s gas limit in the Fusaka hard fork under EIP-9678. Fusaka has been flagged as possibly going online in late 2025, while the next major Ethereum upgrade, Pectra, is scheduled to go live on the mainnet in May.

It’s currently moving sideways, stuck between resistance at $0.68 and support at $0.617. Technical charts, including the Ichimoku Cloud and RSI, show that the market is unsure about its next move. There is a key resistance level at $0.706 — if Pi breaks above that, the price could quickly jump by 10%.

A wallet named “GASW,” created on March 6, 2025, just bought 48 million Pi coins — and none of them are locked. This could mean that a major player, like a company, institution, or even a government, is getting involved. Other Positive Catalysts: Binance, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, has shared new listing guidelines that have caught the attention of the crypto world — especially fans of Pi Coin. Since the platform now has more direct rules for adding new tokens, many believe this could open the door for Pi Coin to be listed on Binance soon. Meanwhile, the Pi Network team recently shared a roadmap for their migration process to improve transparency and respond to user concerns. However, the update left many disappointed, as it didn’t include details like how many users are still waiting or how many accounts can be migrated each day.

A group of RTFKT users led by Jagdeep Cheema claimed in the proposed class suit filed in a Brooklyn federal court on April 25 that they suffered “significant damages” as a result of Nike touting its sneaker-themed NFTs to gain investors, then shuttering the platform. The suit claimed the NFTs were unregistered securities, as Nike sold them without registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It accused the company of using “its iconic brand and marketing prowess to hype, promote, and prop up the unregistered securities that RTFKT sold.” “Because the Nike NFTs derived their value from the success of a given promoter and project — here, Nike and its marketing efforts — investors purchased this digital asset with the hope that its value would increase in the future as the project grows in popularity based on the Nike brand,” the lawsuit argued. The class suit claimed investors suffered damages due to Nike shutting its NFT platform. Source: CourtListener The lawsuit asks for $5 million in damages, claiming Nike broke consumer protection laws and violated various state unfair trade and competition laws. A US court hasn’t definitively ruled on whether NFTs are securities. Still, in an April 9 letter to the SEC, marketplace OpenSea urged the regulator to exclude NFTs from federal securities laws, arguing they don’t meet the legal definition of a security. In its case against Nike, the class group said that the court doesn’t necessarily need to rule on the legal status of NFTs to address the complaint. NFT market value dips In 2021, Nike acquired the NFT firm RTFKT Studios, which created virtual sneakers. According to the complaint, holders of the resulting Nike NFTs were told the tokens could be traded peer-to-peer on the secondary market and used to complete challenges and quests that could lead to rewards. Nike’s crypto kick NFT collection was changing hands for an average of 3.5 Ether ( ETH ), or around $8,000 when they were first listed on April 18, 2022, but were trading for around 0.009 Ether, or roughly $16 as of April 21, according to OpenSea. Nike NFTs have seen a sharp drop in value since they were first listed. Source: OpenSea Nike shut down RTFKT in January , which the class suit claims decimated investors when “prices plunged and did not recover,” and also took away the chance to take part in the challenges and quests, which the group argued was a primary reason for purchasing the tokens. Related: RTFKT’s CloneX avatars reappear after issue blacks out NFTs The overall NFT market dropped sharply in the first quarter of 2025, with sales plunging 63% year-over-year, to $1.5 billion in total sales from January to March 2025, down from $4.1 billion during the same period in 2024.

This ETF is expected to go live on April 30th, 2025. While it’s not a spot ETF — which tracks the actual price of XRP — it’s still a huge step forward for XRP’s recognition on Wall Street. The ETF approval comes just a few years after Ripple, the company behind XRP, was locked in a long legal battle with the SEC. Now, XRP is moving from courtrooms to trading floors, joining the ranks of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which already have both futures and spot ETFs. Some investors were unsure at first, asking, “Why futures and not spot?” But futures ETFs are often the first step. This was the path for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and experts believe a spot XRP ETF could be next. Futures trading allows big institutional investors to take positions on XRP, whether the market goes up or down — a common and healthy part of mature financial markets. BREAKING: SEC Approves an $XRP ETF — and It's HUGE No, it’s not a Spot ETF yet. It’s a Futures ETF — but don’t underestimate what this means.

And the good news doesn’t stop there. In Brazil, the XRP H11 ETF has just launched on the country’s main stock exchange, making it the first XRP-focused ETF in the world. This global momentum suggests XRP is no longer being left behind. Just a few years ago, XRP was under heavy legal scrutiny.

The sharp increase shows a new phase of integration between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). These deals fall into five main trends: companies buying Bitcoin for their treasuries (like Twenty One Capital), traditional firms merging with crypto infrastructure providers, acquisitions focused on institutional services (like Ripple buying Metaco), consolidation between crypto and traditional trading platforms, and mergers between token-based projects. But one deal in particular is drawing high praise — especially from pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton. Deaton recently pointed to Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of prime brokerage firm Hidden Road as “possibly the best example” of the TradFi-DeFi convergence happening in crypto. Hidden Road processes over $3 trillion a year for more than 300 institutional clients. By integrating with Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL), settlement times have dropped from 24 hours to just 3–5 seconds. I agree with Chamath. I also believe @Ripple ’s $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road as possibly the best example of the convergence of TradFi and DeFi in all of crypto.

Deaton explained how this move positions Ripple at the forefront of institutional DeFi by combining DeFi’s speed with TradFi’s reach. He also opened up about the importance of Ripple’s rapid expansion into crypto custody. In addition to acquiring Metaco, Ripple has bought Standard Custody and launched “Ripple Custody” to offer institutions a full suite of services — from payments and stablecoins to asset storage. Why the big push into custody? Deaton believes Ripple is preparing for the tokenization boom. With the custody market expected to grow beyond $16 trillion by 2030, Ripple is building the tools banks will need to tokenize stocks, bonds, or even real estate using the XRPL — with RLUSD powering these transactions. “It looks like [CEO] Brad Garlinghouse is making up for lost time,” Deaton said, referring to Ripple’s progress after its long legal battle with the SEC.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 03:34:44

Following a volatile end to 2024, THORChain’s native token, RUNE, suffered a sharp correction in Q1 2025 and ended up closing the quarter at $1.14, down 74.5% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). This significantly underperformed major digital assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum falling by 12.6% and 45.5%, respectively. RUNE’s market capitalization dropped 73.8% over the same period, as it plunged from $1.5 billion to $400.9 million, its lowest level since mid-2022. THORChain’s USD TVL Drops 50% According to Messari’s latest report , the slump in RUNE’s value heavily impacted THORChain’s DeFi footprint, as total value locked (TVL) in USD terms fell by 50.5%, from $368.6 million to $181.1 million by the end of the quarter. TVL had peaked at $367.7 million on January 2, before sliding in step with RUNE’s declining price. Despite the steep losses in USD terms, native participation in THORChain’s ecosystem remained strong. In fact, RUNE-denominated TVL climbed 93.2% QoQ, after increasing from 82.2 million to 158.8 million RUNE. Messari said that the figure pointed to growing user activity and confidence in the protocol’s multichain liquidity infrastructure even amid volatile pricing. THORChain Swap Volumes Dip Swap activity, however, painted a more muted picture. Average daily swap volume fell 24.4% QoQ to $68.8 million, reversing the previous quarter’s momentum and continuing a downward trend from the $218.4 million daily average seen in early January. A notable exception occurred on March 2, when THORChain processed a record $1.05 billion in swaps in a single day. This anomalous spike followed the Bybit exploit, as attackers utilized the protocol to convert stolen ETH into BTC. While this inflated weekly throughput figures, it did not meaningfully alter the broader decline in organic activity. On-chain data also showed a drop in user engagement, with the average number of daily swappers declining 14.5% QoQ to 1,780. However, usage remained widely distributed across wallets and affiliates, which indicated that while overall volume fell, the protocol’s infrastructure continued to support a broad base of participants. “The sustained participation reflects the protocol’s continued role as a backend settlement layer for multichain swaps, even as broader market volatility and RUNE’s price drawdown weighed on user activity.” The post RUNE Slump Hits THORChain’s DeFi USD TVL in Q1, But Native Deposits Surge appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|THORChain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|RUNE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-28 03:41:06

Bitcoin ( BTC ) felt “noticeably different” over the trading week ended April 25, NYDIG’s global head of research Greg Cipolaro said in an April 25 market note . “We’ve been observing subtle shifts in its behavior over the past few weeks,” he added. “The decoupling from traditional risk assets is still very early and fragile, but for those watching crypto markets 24/7, the shift is palpable.” “Bitcoin has acted less like a liquid levered version of levered US equity beta and more like the non-sovereign issued store of value that it is.” Cipolaro noted that Bitcoin has gained more than 13% since the beginning of April, while US markets such as the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq have declined amid escalating global trade tensions due to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. He added that the US dollar and long-term US Treasurys have also underperformed since the election and Trump’s April 2 “ Liberation Day ” tariff announcements, which lumped every country with various rates, the minimum being 10%. Gold and currencies such as the Swiss franc have been consistent winners as safe havens, Cipolaro said, noting that Bitcoin is emerging as a non-sovereign store of value. Amid surging volatility in equities, measured with the VIX index, foreign exchange rates (CVIX index), and interest rates and bonds (MOVE index), investors have been on the hunt for these safe haven assets . Several asset classes have recently seen high volatility. Source: NYDIG Cipolaro said investors are also seeking alternatives to US hegemony, whether that is stocks, bonds, forex, or commodities. Few large liquid options However, Cipolaro said investors seeking alternatives outside traditional financial systems have few large, liquid options. Gold remains the largest non-sovereign store of value at around a $22 trillion market cap, while Bitcoin has just a fraction of that at $1.8 trillion. Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in May — Here is why Additionally, Bitcoin is the only top crypto asset listed that “solely focuses on monetary or store of value use cases,” while the others are better described as the fuel for decentralized application platforms, he said. Cipolaro concluded that despite Bitcoin’s recent gains, “there are few signs of the market overheating,” and the recovery is still in early stages.

Over 80,000 ETH have moved into derivative exchanges in this brief timeframe, an inflow of a scale that seasoned market watchers typically view as a setup for significant price movements. And historically, these kinds of inflows have meant that deep-pocketed players are up to something, usually something not great for the price. Someone’s prepping for a move… Over 80,000 $ETH just flowed into derivative exchanges in the last 48 hours. That’s not a number you brush off. Historically, inflows like this signal incoming volatility—and usually lean bearish. Buckle up. pic.twitter.com/fHcZQCmMvq — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) April 25, 2025 However, it is not only the scale of these inflows that has struck observers but also their timing and the subsequent trading actions. One trader, closely watched over the past couple of days, said to have lost $208,000 by aggressively shorting the market when the time was very much not right. This shows how, in times of heightened uncertainty, it’s quite easy for even the very experienced to get surprised. One Trader’s Costly Bet Against ETH On April 24, the afternoon of which this particular trader chose for his ill-fated foray into Ethereum’s short side, ETH was anything but a falling knife. Despite the best efforts of the trader to hammer down the price (and despite significant selling all across the crypto market, which on that day featured a number of bearish headlines), Ethereum found support at around $1,750 and, later in the night, reclaimed the closely watched $1,800 level. Nevertheless, the trader pressed on. A few hours after ETH took back the $1,800 marker, he personally borrowed another 4,000 ETH (worth about $7.25 million then) from decentralized lending protocol Aave and short-sold it at $1,808.60. This one didn’t go as well for him either. And again, it suggests he believes downward pressure is imminent for Ethereum. This sort of behavior—both big inflows of ETH to derivatives platforms and the spree of short selling by certain large traders—looks bearish. It seems to point in the direction of a segment of the market that has a decidedly negative outlook on Ethereum’s short-term price prospects. 这老哥对于摸顶卖空 $ETH 很执着啊 ：昨天他才因为卖空 ETH 导致亏损 $20.8 万，昨晚半夜 ETH 涨上 $1,800 后他又继续卖空了 4,000 ETH。 ◎他昨天下午才把借币卖空的 8,000 枚 ETH 买回来把仓位平掉，亏损了 $20.8 万。 ◎昨晚半夜时，ETH 重新站上 $1,800，于是老哥又再次从 Aave 借出 4,000 ETH… https://t.co/8AwkUVvpFI pic.twitter.com/fdOliKQ9lN — 余烬 (@EmberCN) April 26, 2025 And when we try to make sense of this, one possible explanation that emerges is simply that sentiment in the derivatives market is not in sync with what spot market participants are doing. Spot Ethereum ETFs See Strong Inflows, Offering a Bullish Counterbalance This bearish derivative action is occurring simultaneously with robust spot ETF performance. On April 25, Spot Ethereum ETFs notched net inflows of $104 million, with not a single ETF in the Ethereum space reporting a net outflow. That’s a striking contrast to the derivatives side of the market and may indicate that retail and institutional investors see long-term value in Ethereum, even if they are deriding its price performance on a short-term basis. This divergence in market behavior—bullish ETF inflows vs. bearish derivative signals—creates a complex and somewhat contradictory near-term outlook for Ethereum. One hand suggests derivative traders are positioning for a correction, possibly to be triggered by macro factors, regulatory uncertainty, or just-took-gains profit-taking after recent rallies. Yet, the other hand—that’s not anything near an order of four—shows a continuously liquid spot ETF market for ETH that cannot possibly uphold a bearish scenario. On April 25, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $380 million, marking six consecutive days of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $104 million, with no net outflows across all nine ETFs. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 26, 2025 Ethereum’s recent price action has also been centered around the important $1,800 level that seems to be acting as a battleground between bulls and bears. In terms of inflows and ETF setups, investors are more inclined to bet on Ethereum’s long-term developments, especially with the anticipated changes in Ethereum 2.0. With all this activity, traders and investors should prepare for possible volatility. It’s not clear if Ethereum will keep climbing or get hit with some more selling pressure, but it’s pretty clear that it’s going to do something—and soon. If it does something in either the spot or derivatives market, watch out below: big trades can send huge ripples through both markets. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This kind of atmosphere has often been very good for Bitcoin, presumed by many to be a “safe-haven” asset during times of unease. Gold has long held that same mantle, but Bitcoin is now clearly in the conversation. And if things keep going the way they have been, the conversation might get a lot louder. It is not only the state of the macroeconomy that has brought Bitcoin back. The recovery has, in large part, been driven by a huge uptick in institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Heavyweights such as BlackRock have continued to shove force into Bitcoin and the crypto space writ large. Their recent participation in the recovery, along with the much-wanted movement toward institutional adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, has added a level of street cred and stability to the market that had been largely absent. As Bitcoin has recovered as high as $95.8K today, we are seeing the highest week of net inflows to $BTC ETF's since the week before Trump's inauguration in mid-January. Institutions like Blackrock have played a large part in the crypto-wide bounce traders were waiting for. pic.twitter.com/jUxNM8wo75 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 25, 2025 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted an enormous $380 million in net inflows for the week ending April 25, 2025, marking the highest weekly net inflows since the week before Trump’s inauguration in mid-January. This trend is signaling something very positive for Bitcoin. It suggests that the interest in Bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset is going mainstream, especially among the kinds of large institutional players who presumably also have a lot of influence over retail investor sentiment. On April 25, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $380 million, marking six consecutive days of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $104 million, with no net outflows across all nine ETFs. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 26, 2025 The Crowd’s Growing Optimism and Rising Greed When Bitcoin soared over the $95,000 mark, there was a marked increase in the overall optimism of the crypto community. While the price of Bitcoin never dipped below $88,000 from November 20 to December 31, 2024, the sentiment surrounding crypto in general had many people thinking it was DOA (dead on arrival) for any chance of a near-term price recovery. On Christmas Day, Bitcoin’s price was at $91,550. Then it climbed to… Despite the growing optimism about the market, some analysts have raised concerns that this could simply be a sign of an incipient top, with excessive greed and hubris fueling the latest rally. For the Bitcoin price to keep going up, there needs to be a sufficient base of retail investors willing to purchase the leading cryptocurrency. If too many traders try to take profits, it creates an opportunity for the institutional investors and whales who have been buying up the lower dips in Bitcoin to push the price up even further. The crowd’s sentiment is crucial in deciding whether Bitcoin can carry on with its present momentum or must soon retrace its steps. If the market gets too greedy and retail traders rush to take profits, we may see a temporary pullback in Bitcoin’s price. On the other hand, if the market remains patient and controlled greed is the order of the day, we could see Bitcoin push further into the uncharted territory of prices it has not seen before. In either case, sentiment is of the utmost importance. Bitcoin’s Future Outlook: Will $100K Be Within Reach? With Bitcoin approaching $95K, the question on many investors’ minds is whether the cryptocurrency can keep up its current trajectory and finally break through the $100K barrier. The road to $100K may not be without its bumps, but the combination of strong institutional support, an increasingly worrisome macroeconomic picture, and a steadily rising tide of retail and institutional investors gives Bitcoin a solid foundation to continue its upward movement. To conclude, the crypto space has been revitalized by Bitcoin’s recent surge, with both retail and institutional investors looking to the cryptocurrency as an all-but-certain store of value. We’re at the highest levels of market optimism and institutional inflows since Trump was inaugurated, and now it’s time for Bitcoin to take a crucial test—can it either maintain this momentum or avoid a serious retracement? At this point, with a stronger than ever market position, only a severe plot twist could deny Bitcoin’s re-ascendance. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The platform’s resurgence began with a strategic overhaul, including the launch of Euler v2, fresh audits of the system, and key partnerships with prominent industry players. By the end of April 2025, Euler’s Total Value Locked (TVL) had rocketed to $1.5 billion, a remarkable turnaround that showcases the platform’s resilience and ability to rebuild trust within the DeFi community. Euler Finance’s Resilient Comeback 2023 was a dark chapter in the history of Euler Finance. During that year, hackers took advantage of a few vulnerabilities in the Euler Finance code and made off with $197 million. The hack sent shockwaves through the DeFi space—was Euler ever going to get back to where it was? It was a good question. The answer, in my opinion, is yes—and the first step in that direction was the launch of Euler v2 in September 2024. Euler reborn: TVL сlimbs to $1.5B In March 2023, hackers stole $197M from the @eulerfinance lending protocol. Euler’s strong comeback began with the launch of Euler v2, followed by fresh audits, @gauntlet_xyz joining as risk manager, and backing from @wintermute_t . Since v2… pic.twitter.com/aSq4JFiaSu — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 25, 2025 Euler version 2 brought forth a wealth of new capabilities—improved security, better user interfaces, and optimizations that pretty much made the whole platform run better. From those updates, it was able to regain the confidence of its previous users and even add new participants to the mix. The v2 upgrade also marked a turn in the road that led to a series of strategic moves that made Euler what it is today. In addition to making technical upgrades, Euler Finance brought in outside auditors to ensure that any remaining vulnerabilities in the protocol had been eliminated and that its security was now sufficiently strong to prevent any future hacks. Audits like this one are a standard and important part of the assurance process in the blockchain space, and they played a crucial role in signaling to the community that the Euler platform was now safe to use. Even after this audit was completed, Euler Finance further increased its security assurances by bringing in the risk management firm Gauntlet to do ongoing risk assessments of the protocol. Strategic Partnerships and Growing Network Apart from technical improvements and risk management upgrades, Euler Finance obtained backing from a prominent crypto liquidity provider, Wintermute. Not only did Wintermute provide some much-needed financial backing, but its participation in the Euler project also helped to significantly boost the platform’s liquidity—an absolutely vital factor for the successful operation of any lending protocol. Euler Finance further widened its reach by integrating with many blockchains. Since it launched Euler v2, the protocol now serves a set of networks in addition to Ethereum. This set includes Avalanche (AVAX), Berachain, and several other ecosystems. By using a multi-chain strategy, Euler has been able to reach more diverse sets of users and serve a more diverse set of blockchain ecosystems. Consequently, Euler’s market share has grown fairly significantly over the last year. One of Euler’s revival’s standout accomplishments has been the remarkable growth of its TVL. Since the release of v2, Euler’s TVL has skyrocketed from a modest $4.5 million to an impressive $1.44 billion, with close to $1 billion of that locked on Ethereum. The protocol’s ability to corral such a goodly amount of capital, even in light of the past security problems it faced, speaks loud and clear about its greatly enhanced functionality and the strong demand for decentralized lending services. A Bright Future Ahead for Euler Finance Euler Finance’s astounding revival is a testament to the platform’s durability and the resilience of the broader DeFi ecosystem. By tackling security issues directly, beefing up its product, and securing key partnerships, Euler has not only bounced back from the hack but also emerged as one of the leading DeFi lending platforms right now. With a protocol TVL of $1.5 billion, it is once again a trusted part of the DeFi community. With Euler v2 now fully functioning and a solid platform established, the prospects for growth in the next few years look good. Attracting new users seems a safe bet, as the expansion to multiple blockchains will likely continue to pull in fresh traffic. And attracting new users is pretty much Job #1 for Gauntlet, which ensures that risk management remains a priority as Euler scales. For investors and users in the DeFi space, Euler Finance offers a compelling option in the realm of decentralized lending and borrowing. Its strong security, innovative features, and growing multi-chain presence make it a protocol to watch as the DeFi landscape continues to evolve. In terms of total value locked, Euler appears to be expanding its market presence quite nicely. Total value locked has generally been a reliable metric for assessing the market footprint of any particular DeFi protocol. As services like Euler continue to attract more liquidity and seem to be fortifying trust among users, they are also driving decentralized finance further into the mainstream.

Over the past week, Bitcoin has not moved in lockstep with major stock indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. This seems to signal a fascinating shift in its role in global financial markets. The correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500, once at a relatively high 0.68, has now dropped all the way down to 0.27. This is a big change for a cryptocurrency that has spent the last year following the same ups and downs as the stock market. Even as Bitcoin’s ties to traditional stocks appear to be weakening, its links to gold seem to be enshrined in ever-more-solid ground. Recent data have revealed that Bitcoin’s correlation with the precious metal has really taken off and is now at a more pronounced -0.51, up from a modest 0.05. If folks are making a case for seeing Bitcoin as even more akin to gold than stocks, it’s probably not a bad case to make. ""Bitcoin Breaks Away from Stocks, Moves Closer to Gold "" — OKX Ventures (@OKX_Ventures) April 25, 2025 Bitcoin’s Position in the Market: A Growing Share of Gold’s Market Cap The changing relationship between Bitcoin and traditional assets, like stocks, reflects a broader shift in the cryptocurrency’s position within global financial markets. As Bitcoin’s correlation with gold strengthens, it is slowly becoming a more direct competitor to the precious metal in terms of being a store of value. This transition is highlighted by Bitcoin’s growing share of the gold market, which, according to Cryptorank, stands at 11% in 2025. Although Bitcoin’s market share in gold has decreased a little over time, the trend shows that Bitcoin’s Total Addressable Market (TAM) is still growing, as the actual global gold market is also growing. This market share expansion emphasizes Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance as an alternative digital wealth preservation vehicle. Bitcoin now makes up 11% of gold’s market size As gold’s market cap continues to grow, #Bitcoin share stands at 11% in 2025. Even though the percentage has slightly declined, #Bitcoin ’s Total Addressable Market (TAM) keeps expanding as the gold market grows. pic.twitter.com/8GyGZ9HH8x — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 23, 2025 For a long time, gold has been regarded as a safe haven asset. It is valued by investors for its stability and its role as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. It is becoming increasingly correlated with Bitcoin, though, and many investors are starting to see the leading cryptocurrency as a potential alternative to gold. Because of the shift in perception in regard to Bitcoin, we might be looking at a new phase in the life of the leading cryptocurrency. The Implications of Bitcoin’s Divergence from Stocks The implications for traditional investors and those in the cryptocurrency market from Bitcoin’s decoupling from U.S. stocks are significant. For investors in both worlds, it has been long established that Bitcoin’s movements have been closely aligned with traditional stock market indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Yet as that correlation continues to decline, we can see that Bitcoin’s price movements are becoming less tethered to the performance of traditional equities. This shift could provide new occasions for investors. As Bitcoin moves more in line with the gold market, it may well become an attractive asset for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Bitcoin’s price behavior, in increasing tandem with gold’s, offers some signal that it too will serve a similar port in the storm for investors who want to protect their wealth from uncertainties. Also, Bitcoin’s increasing connection with gold could affect how institutional investors look at the crypto market. If Bitcoin demonstrates relative strength and a propensity for more stability than stocks, it might begin to claim a larger share of investment capital from these large players as part of their overall strategies. The Future of Bitcoin as a Digital Store of Value As Bitcoin keeps on developing, its ever-growing parallel with gold makes it a real rival in the universe of classical assets. It seems obvious now that the correlation between the two is strengthening; therefore, one must concede that Bitcoin’s pathway toward becoming a digital store of value is now clear. Even though its market share in gold has decreased slightly, one must now acknowledge that Bitcoin’s potential to seriously upset the classical asset universe continues to grow. In the future, it appears that Bitcoin will no longer be competing directly with stocks and bonds and will instead be on a similar playing field as gold. Bitcoin’s price and market share are moving more and more into the realm of redefining the role of precious metals in the global economy. And with those changes to the role of digital assets surely comes some recalibration of the global economy for digital asset holders. As this trend develops, investors will have to keep an eye on the continuing association between Bitcoin, stocks, and gold. Right now, it is very much evident that Bitcoin is putting itself out there as more than just a highly speculative asset. It is, in fact, a potential safe-haven asset with a few interesting twists that are worth noting. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The network is demonstrating its durability and user appeal, and also developer appeal, with a series of impressive metrics. Data monitored by Lookonchain tell the story quite well. Growth across several key indicators has really picked up. And those key indicators are: Total Value Locked (TVL), DEX (decentralized exchange) trading volume, and stablecoin supply. Total Value Locked (TVL) Soars by 38% One of the most significant indicators of the Sui ecosystem’s growth is its rapidly increasing Total Value Locked (TVL). In just one week, TVL surged by an impressive 38%, reaching $1.645 billion. TVL, which represents the total value of assets locked within the ecosystem, is a critical metric for assessing the health and adoption of decentralized networks. The notable uptick in Sui’s TVL is a sign of growing confidence from users and investors alike. This surge can be attributed to a mix of reasons: the tech of the network has improved, its main projects have started rolling out new features, and it has seen an uptick in not just decentralized apps but also dApps that deliver fun, varied experiences to users. This is making the Sui network look more and more like a go-to place for DeFi projects as well as other blockchain-based apps. DEX Trading Volume Hits $599 Million, a 177% Weekly Increase An additional main measure that shows the Sui ecosystem is growing quickly is the huge amount of trading volume occurring on its decentralized exchanges. In the past week, Sui’s DEX platforms had 24-hour trading volume of $599 million. That’s up a staggering 177% from just the week before. At this rate, Sui isn’t just keeping pace with other ecosystems but is pulling ahead as a DEX trading destination. No other layer 1 or layer 2 network is coming close. The increase in trading volume on Sui’s DEX can be linked to the launch of several new features and campaigns by Sui’s core projects. These initiatives, which include new trading pairs, liquidity incentives, and improved user interfaces, have likely played a role in driving increased trading activity. Additionally, the available liquidity on Sui’s DEX platforms provides traders with the ability to execute larger transactions with lower slippage, making the platform an attractive option for users seeking efficient and cost-effective transactions. 1/ Over the past week, the Sui ecosystem has experienced significant growth. According to data monitored by Lookonchain: TVL increased by 38%, reaching $1.645 billion; DEX 24-hour trading volume reached $599 million, a 177% week-over-week increase; The total stablecoin… — OKX Ventures (@OKX_Ventures) April 26, 2025 The increase in trading volume is also proof of rising developer confidence in the Sui blockchain. This, in turn, seems to be spurring the building of even more innovative, decentralized financial products on the Sui platform. Meanwhile, traders and liquidity providers are starting to show up in significant numbers. All of this adds up to a pretty favorable scenario for the Sui ecosystem. Stablecoin Supply Increases by 82%, Reflecting Capital Influx The fast expansion of stablecoin supply within the Sui ecosystem is yet another main signal of the network’s ever-expanding role in the larger crypto market. In just the past two months, the total supply of stablecoins on the Sui network has risen from $482 million to $879 million—an unbelievable 82% growth. Stablecoins are a basic building block of DeFi. They provide a stable-store-of-value alternative in a crypto world that’s largely dominated by unstable, highly speculative assets. Capital is flowing into the Sui ecosystem, and it’s doing so through stable assets. This is a huge sign of the kind of progress we are making with Sui Stablecoin influx reflects a capital trend and user shift toward using Sui as a more risk-averse investment vehicle. Stablecoins are stable, and they provide the kinds of user opportunities that make DeFi appealing (lending, staking, yield farming, etc.). These user opportunities, paired with the inherent stability of stablecoins, make it likely that stablecoins will be a big part of Sui’s capital and user base going forward. In addition, the supply of stablecoins is expanding rapidly in parallel with the growth of DeFi applications. As a new apparatus for interacting with digital assets, decentralized finance requires an ever-growing and increasingly diverse set of financial tools. Stablecoins are now a basic component of this toolkit. They occupy a middle ground in a world where uncollateralized dollar-denominated credit is increasingly hard to come by. Sui’s Rising Capital Resilience and Developer Confidence When looked at from an investment standpoint, the Sui ecosystem’s is one of steadily building capital and developer confidence in a Layer 1 blockchain. Its performance, across some of the most fundamental key metrics—TVL, trading activity, and stablecoin volume—suggests that the on-chain ecosystem is not just on the path to thriving The Sui network’s long-term success will be determined by how well it can scale and satisfy a burgeoning demand from a swelling number of users and developers. The rising capital activity and user engagement across Sui indicate that it’s becoming an ever-more-important player in the blockchain space. To sum up, the Sui ecosystem has entered a significant stage. Its size and relevance have increased impressively. With an ecosystem that encompasses over 70 projects and keeps expanding, with an increase in trading volume on its decentralized exchange (DEX) that approaches the conditions that would make DEX arbitrage feasible, and with a stablecoin framework set up, the Sui ecosystem seems to be on a solid path.

43888488,https://nulltx.com/?p=148381,1745812709,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Rising Open Interest and Short Bias Signal Potential Volatility in Bitcoin’s Perpetual Swap Market,https://nulltx.com/rising-open-interest-and-short-bias-signal-potential-volatility-in-bitcoins-perpetual-swap-market/,"Bitcoin’s price is rebounding, and so the market for perpetual swaps is showing a sharp increase in open interest (OI). That OI number crude proxy for how many traders are in the market shows that, post-CPI (Consumer Price Index indica implementation of economic policy), we have roughly 281,000 BTC in the Bitcoin perpetual swap OI. This is way more than we’ve had in quite some time, so what it means (more or less) is that more traders are in the perpetual swap market, period. And that must, of course, mean something. And what it inevitably leads you to is this: the perpetual swap market is not a market that exists in a vacuum. By its very name, it implies a building up of leverage, because how do you perpetually swap an asset without a lot of leverage being involved? Also, and I can’t stress this enough, the perpetual swap market is now and always has been an essential part of the landscape for Bitcoin traders. The rise in open interest is a typical feature of price recovery. As prices rise, more and more traders join the fun. The influx of traders means that order flow becomes even healthier. The healthier order flow is, the more likely it is that prices keep going in the direction they’re going in (i.e., recovery); hence, the healthier the price recovery becomes. Open interest, then, is a positive indicator for price recovery. Short Side Dominates: Funding Rates Suggest a Bearish Sentiment Even though open interest (OI) has risen, the funding rate in perpetual swap markets has turned negative. The average funding rate has fallen to -0.023%. This means that when perpetual swap traders make payments to each other, the traders on the long side pay the traders on the short side. It also means, apparently, that more perpetual swap traders are betting on Bitcoin’s price to fall rather than to keep rising. That also seems to be what more and more market participants think is going to happen. A market generally implies positive funding rates when the price is going up, but that’s what you’d expect in a typical market structure, right? Because in a typical market structure, you have long positions in excess of short positions, and the demand for borrowing the asset just pushes the funding rates higher. So the funding rate being negative during a price recovery really shows a divergence from that typical market structure, and it also implies that traders are kind of split on being with or against the rally. When there is a significant number of short positions that get liquidated, we say that a short squeeze has occurred. This is when the traders who shorted an asset in anticipation that its price would go down are suddenly rushing to buy back the asset that they shorted because the price is going up and they can’t let their loss go on any longer. This action in the market causes the price to go up even more, in a kind of virtuous cycle for the bulls and a vicious cycle for the bears. Reduced Appetite for Long Positions Adds to Short Bias More evidence of the prevailing short bias is found in the data for long-side funding premiums. The 7-day moving average (7DMA) of long-side funding premiums has recently drifted down to $88,000 per hour and is still trending downward. Funding premiums for long positions represent the amount long traders pay to maintain their positions. A downtrend in a long-side premium is generally seen as a signal that the market is moving against long traders. So, what by now should be a pretty clear picture is this: The funding structure of the Bitcoin market is slanted in favor of short traders. The reduction in long-side funding premiums may indicate that traders are hesitating to fully commit to long positions as the market remains unsure about the sustainability of the price recovery. Many traders may be holding off on adding to their long positions and instead are maintaining a wait-and-see approach in the hopes that the recent price action matures into a more substantial and lasting bullish trend. Open Interest in perpetual swaps has risen to 281K $BTC , up +15.6% since early March. This suggests a build-up of leverage in the market as prices rebound, increasing the potential for amplified volatility via liquidations and stop-outs. pic.twitter.com/3e0mOORqAT — glassnode (@glassnode) April 25, 2025 Increasing open interest, poor funding rates for longs, and lower actual premiums paid by long position holders combine to create a potentially very volatile Bitcoin market. These factors boost the chances for big price moves and, hence, the opportunity to make big profits— or suffer huge losses. And the fact that half of the market is betting against Bitcoin could even mean that the next big Bitcoin move will be upward, as the shorts get stopped out. What Lies Ahead? With Bitcoin demonstrating renewed vigor in its price restoration, the critical variable in deciding this market’s future seems to be the tug-of-war between long and short positions. If bullish forces keep pushing the price upward, all these chumps who have piled on to the short side are going to find themselves in an unwanted position and will have to cover their shorts, adding further fuel to the upward price movement. On the other hand, if this rally starts to roll over and those short positions start making money, then we’ve got a market that could very well see Bitcoin prices start declining again. The continues transformation in open interest, funding rates, and long side premiums stresses the high-stakes arena that Bitcoin traders are working in. With so much leverage in the system and such a strong load towards short positions, potential for amplified volatility remains high. Traders must stay alerted and keep a close watch over these key indicators. They may very well serve up the next significant price move. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The value proposition core to Mezo is its incorporation with the tBTC infrastructure, which permits user access to liquidity and programmability of decentralized finance while hewing to the Bitcoin security model. Mezo’s appearance, in a way, permits the whole appearance of borrowing, spending, and earning with the Bitcoin to become seamless—with few apps lingering in the space—that’s a huge gap being filled by Mezo. And ultimately, let us not miss the point here, it’s about putting the BTC itself to work in ways that get the BTC into actual, functional use-cases in financial applications. Growth Signals Show Rising Demand for BTCFi Solutions Mezo’s ascent is supported by impressive growth numbers from on-chain metrics. Over the past week, the number of borrowers on the platform surged by 84.4 percent. This brings the total user count to over 8,600. The speed at which this base is growing is a clear signal that holders of Bitcoin are seeking means through which the can utilize their assets in a more direct, decentralized manner. And by direct, I mean not relying on any centralized intermediaries. Simultaneously, the volume of $MUSD—Mezo’s stable borrowing currency—has skyrocketed. On the platform, a total of 183.8 million dollars worth of $MUSD has been borrowed, representing a 70 percent increase within just seven days. This spike reflects both a burgeoning user confidence and an increasing demand for liquidity solutions that are native to the Bitcoin ecosystem. With its mainnet launch expected in May, @MezoNetwork is rapidly gaining traction as the Bitcoin Economic Layer for BTCFi. Over 8,600 borrowers, up 84.4% in the past week $183.8M in $MUSD borrowed, a 70% increase in the last 7 days 92% of users collateralize with… pic.twitter.com/4MN55lQ5qQ — Bitcoin Ecosystem (@BitcoinEcoTK) April 25, 2025 Maybe the most revealing aspect is the composition of the user base. Data indicates that 92 percent of users collateralize with less than 0.0005 BTC, which suggests that Mezo is not just appealing to whales or institutional participants. This distribution seems to indicate that the platform is quite accessible, as it is engaging a large number of smallholders who are, in traditional DeFi models, often overlooked. For these users, the platform represents, in many cases, their first experience with using Bitcoin for anything other than holding it or making simple transfers. Mezo’s infrastructure is designed with this inclusivity in mind. By making borrowing against Bitcoin easy and efficient, the platform lowers the barrier to entry for everyday Bitcoin users. It allows them to put their Bitcoin to work without giving up custody or incurring the risks associated with centralized lending platforms. This shift toward on-chain borrowing not only improves capital efficiency but also strengthens Bitcoin’s presence in the broader DeFi ecosystem. In contrast to Ethereum-based DeFi, which many times has high-yield mechanisms contingent upon shaky token models, Mezo is stable, transparent, and sustainable. Its core growth strategy focuses on low volatility. The use of tBTC—a “trust-minimized” decentralized version of Bitcoin on Ethereum—allows Mezo to bridge two ecosystems while remaining true to Bitcoin’s core ethos. Analysts and investors are starting to take notice of Mezo’s advancements as excitement surges for the imminent launch of its mainnet. There exists a firm belief in many circles that Mezo could serve as the platform and portal for unleashing the hitherto locked liquidity of Bitcoin, which is better described as monetary energy, in order to truly set the stage for BTCFi to become a rising star in its next cycle of DeFi innovation. Should Mezo keep growing at its current rate, it will very soon become the go-to solution for anyone wanting to do anything with Bitcoin that was impossible not so very long ago. Its future success will almost certainly hinge on whether it can keep scaling to huge sizes while remaining accessible, secure, and decentralized. Mezo’s adoption isn’t just rapid; it is strong and across the board. The value proposition is exceedingly clear. Its meetings are well-attended, with the audience comprised largely of potential users. We think that this situation—strong early adoption, a clear value proposition, and a launch just around the corner—puts Mezo in position to redefine how Bitcoin interacts with the world of DeFi. And for Bitcoiners who have long awaited a more functional use case for their holdings, Mezo may most imminently deliver on that front. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This well-coordinated buying spree happened earlier today and was most visible through the on-chain metrics for a particular wallet. That wallet, identified as 0x97251bbbe8f80bf1787b15abed08c09ac5cc1776, executed a series of high-value purchases in what were largely seen as confidence bets. Among the purchases made were millions worth of the following tokens: VIRTUAL, WLD, GAME, and COOKIE. The size and timing of these acquisitions suggest that there’s a lot more here than just casual speculation. Be it insider knowledge, a long-term belief in the chosen tokens, or a more expansive bet on the narratives the market is going to play out in the near future, this whale is putting a considerable amount of dollars behind its decisions. A Closer Look at the Whale’s Portfolio Picks The buying binge started with a huge purchase of VIRTUAL, a recently popular token in the metaverse and digital experience realm. The whale got 2.53 million VIRTUAL tokens at an average price of 0.93 dollars, totaling 2.66 million dollars. In appearance, that looks an awful lot like a vote of confidence on the virtual world front. Altcoin Buffet: Whale Scoops Up $VIRTUAL, $WLD , $GAME , and $COOKIE in One Big Shopping Spree One wallet is making bold moves across multiple altcoins today. The whale behind address 0x97251bbbe8f80bf1787b15abed08c09ac5cc1776 went on a buying spree, pic.twitter.com/sV07F94HXT — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) April 26, 2025 Then, the purse zeroed in on WLD, or Worldcoin, a project that has audacious dreams of making a worldly, decentralized, identity-and-finance layer. The whale gobbled up 1.48 million WLD at an average price of 1.02 dollars, investing 1.73 million bucks in all. Worldcoin has been buzzing for quite a while now, not just for its all-but-audacious biometric model, but also for its star-studded cast of crypto luminaries. Even so, to the extent Worldcoin scales at all, it has to be considered a “win” for the purse—much more so than with the other coins mentioned above. After the tokens priced at a premium, the investor dove down to “affordable” purchases and snagged a hefty amount of GAME. That’s 6.47 million tokens on an average price of 0.04 dollars “per” token. Total cash outlay came to about 299,000 dollars. While the value of GAME may be on the low end, the number of tokens purchased is impressive and suggests that this whale has a strong conviction on some upside potential. Completing the shopping spree was a smaller, yet still significant, purchase of COOKIE—a lesser-known but emerging token in the meme or micro-cap segment. The wallet acquired 303,574 COOKIE tokens for 40,700 dollars, averaging about 0.13 dollars per token. While speculative in nature, tokens like COOKIE have been known to deliver outsized returns in short bursts, and it’s possible the whale sees this as a calculated bet on something that might deliver 100X as much back in return. In total, the wallet splashed out about 4.73 million bucks among four different assets—not chump change, even in today’s altcoin market. But what’s most interesting is where those funds went and how they were allocated. The largest investment was in Worldcoin (WLD), a token associated with a project whose vision is definitely expansive (and somewhat controversial; more on that in a sec). Right behind WLD is the riskier, much less known, and far more volatile project called COOKIE. Market watchers are already abuzz about this activity, with many traders now keeping an eye on the wallet’s future moves for sentiment signals related to these tokens. And large-scale, diversified purchases like this one could also be seen as influencing the next short-term price moves in various tokens, especially those with smaller market caps where a single buy can dramatically shift order books. Whether the recent buying will pay off is yet to be seen, but there’s no denying that this whale is going for diversification and striking big in a market where the right narrative and use case can turn a modest investment into a home run.

The company’s head of Asia, Jiayin Xie, said on X that legal letters had been sent to the accounts, which it believes were operated by a professional arbitrage group. Bitget, which is headquartered in Victoria, Seychelles, said it plans to return any recovered funds to users through an airdrop. The incident unfolded when VOXEL, the token associated with the Polygon -based game Voxie Tactics, saw an extraordinary spike in trading volume last week. At one point, VOXEL’s trading volume briefly exceeded that of Bitcoin . VOXEL’s Sudden Spike Prompts Bitget to Investigate Trading Irregularities On April 20, VOXEL surged by more than 200% in just 30 minutes on Bitget, climbing to $0.1645 before retreating to $0.09131, still around 40% higher than its earlier price. The cryptocurrency exchange Bitget said it would issue eight lawyers' letters, saying they were the main instigators of the VOXEL incident and had gained more than $20 million from it. Bitget will distribute 100% of the recovered funds to platform users in the form of airdrops.… https://t.co/idxkaqbk3k — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 27, 2025 Bitget flagged the abnormal activity in VOXEL/ USDT perpetual futures trading shortly after it occurred. Soon after, the exchange noted suspicious volumes and wild price swings. As a result, it moved quickly to suspend certain accounts from trading, depositing, and withdrawing. Although Bitget claims that most users were not affected, it has yet to disclose who was behind the activity. Moreover, it remains unclear whether internal technical flaws contributed to the situation. Traders Question Bitget’s Systems After VOXEL Trading Turmoil The crypto sector has witnessed several high-profile exploits in recent years. Hackers and market manipulators have often exploited weak liquidity, smart contract bugs or flawed trading algorithms. As a result, security concerns across exchanges have continued to grow. In Bitget’s case, some traders have suggested that the platform’s market-making technology may have malfunctioned. However, no official explanation has been confirmed yet. Following the incident, comparisons quickly surfaced online. Some users likened Bitget’s actions to casinos suing players for winning. Nevertheless, Bitget maintains that the accounts in question engaged in manipulation, not legitimate trading. The exchange said it will publish a full report on the VOXEL incident soon. Meanwhile, the eight targeted accounts remain suspended as legal proceedings move forward.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce: US Crypto Regulation Feels Like Playing 'The Floor is Lava' in the Dark At the SEC’s ”Know Your Custodian” roundtable on April 25, SEC Commissioner and head of the agency’s crypto task force, Hester Peirce , delivered a vivid analogy to describe the current regulatory landscape facing US financial firms engaging with cryptocurrency: it’s like playing a game of ”the floor is lava” — but without any light. Peirce explained that navigating crypto regulations today means firms must hop from one uncertain legal position to another, all while avoiding direct contact with crypto assets themselves — which she likened to ”burning legal lava.” “It is time that we find a way to end this game. We need to turn on the lights and build some walkways over the lava pit,” Peirce urged, calling for a clearer regulatory framework that would allow financial institutions to engage more openly with the rapidly evolving digital asset sector. Navigating in the Dark Peirce detailed how SEC-registered entities — such as investment advisers, broker-dealers, and custodians — are often left uncertain about how to handle crypto assets. Firms are unsure whether a given token constitutes a security, which custodians meet federal qualifications, and whether participation in activities like staking or exercising governance rights could inadvertently trigger regulatory breaches. This regulatory fog, according to Peirce, is choking innovation and hampering the development of a robust, transparent crypto market in the United States. Firms are increasingly forced to operate with extreme caution, avoiding direct custody of crypto assets altogether, which in turn restricts the liquidity and maturity of US-based crypto markets. Peirce was not alone in voicing concern. SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed her sentiment, stressing that as more registrants seek to work with crypto assets, it’s critical they have access to qualified custodians that meet all legal and regulatory requirements. Uyeda proposed that the SEC should consider permitting advisers to use state-chartered limited-purpose trust companies, which are already authorized to hold crypto assets, as qualified custodians. He argued that broadening access to compliant custodial options could offer some much-needed clarity and operational support to firms navigating the sector. The inability of brokers and Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) to custody crypto assets under the current rules, Uyeda warned, could stifle the development of a healthy secondary market for digital assets in the United States. A New Direction Under Chair Paul Atkins The roundtable also marked an important moment for the newly sworn-in SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, who laid out a notably different vision from that of his predecessor, Gary Gensler. Atkins, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, stated that he expects blockchain technology to deliver ”huge benefits” through increased efficiency, greater risk mitigation, enhanced transparency, and reduced costs across the financial system. Importantly, Atkins pledged to focus the SEC’s energy on crafting ”clear regulatory rules of the road” for digital assets — a commitment that many in the crypto community have long been hoping for. Without directly criticizing Gensler, Atkins made it clear that the previous regulatory approach had contributed to significant confusion and uncertainty in the market. “I look forward to engaging with market participants and working with colleagues in President Trump’s administration and Congress to establish a rational, fit-for-purpose framework for crypto assets,” Atkins said. Peirce’s metaphor resonated widely because it captures what many market participants have long complained about: the absence of coherent and accessible guidelines. Crypto firms, investment funds, custodians, and trading platforms are often left guessing about how to operate within the law, while enforcement actions against the industry mount. Calls for regulatory reform have grown louder as the United States risks falling behind other jurisdictions — such as the European Union, with its MiCA framework, or countries like Singapore and the UAE — that have adopted clearer and more supportive digital asset regulations. If Atkins, Peirce, and Uyeda succeed in pushing through more practical reforms, it could mark a major turning point for crypto in America. The prospect of regulatory clarity would likely unlock new levels of institutional adoption, investment, and innovation within the sector. For now, however, Peirce’s warning remains clear: unless US regulators build structured ”walkways” across the legal lava pits, the nation’s financial firms will continue to stumble in the dark, risking not only their own survival but also America's future leadership in blockchain and digital finance. Senator Jon Ossoff Calls for Impeachment Proceedings Against President Trump Over Private Meme Coin Dinner In other crypto news, US Senator Jon Ossoff has thrown his support behind launching impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, citing a growing controversy over Trump’s association with the Official Trump meme coin and a private dinner event tied to its holders. Speaking during an April 25 town hall in Georgia, where he is running for reelection, Ossoff said Trump’s actions clearly meet the standard for an impeachable offense. “I mean, I saw just 48 hours ago, he is granting audiences to people who buy his meme coin,” Ossoff said, according to a report by NBC News. “When the sitting president of the United States is selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him, there is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense.” While expressing strong support for impeachment proceedings, Ossoff acknowledged the political reality that such action is unlikely to succeed unless the Democratic Party regains control of Congress during the 2026 midterm elections. Republicans currently hold majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Dinner That Sparked a Political Firestorm The controversy centers around the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin, a cryptocurrency project directly tied to Trump's personal brand. On April 23, the TRUMP meme coin website announced plans for an exclusive dinner with President Trump at his Washington, D.C. golf club, inviting the top 220 holders of the TRUMP token to attend. TRUMP holders can register to dine with the US President (Source: gettrumpmemes.com) A leaderboard tracking the largest TRUMP wallets was published alongside the announcement, with a registration link for eligible holders. The site noted that participants would need to pass a background check, could not be from a Know Your Customer (KYC) watchlist country, and would not be allowed to bring guests. Following the announcement, the price of the TRUMP token surged by over 50%, according to CoinMarketCap data — further intensifying concerns that the president was personally profiting from the event. Social media speculation quickly emerged suggesting that a TRUMP holder would need to own at least $300,000 worth of the token to secure an invitation. However, the TRUMP team denied those claims on April 25, clarifying that the threshold was based on a curated leaderboard rather than raw blockchain data, which includes locked tokens, exchange wallets, and non-participating addresses. Still, the controversy over selling direct access to the sitting president for crypto holdings has not subsided. Legal experts have sounded alarms about the potential conflicts of interest created by Trump's cryptocurrency activities, including not just the TRUMP meme coin but also his involvement in World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol affiliated with his brand. “Within just a couple of days of him taking office, he’s signed a number of executive orders that are significantly going to affect the way that our crypto and digital assets industry works,” said Charlyn Ho, a partner at the law firm Rikka, in a February interview. “So if he has a personal pecuniary benefit arising from his own policies, that’s a conflict of interest.” Ho and other legal scholars warn that Trump's direct financial involvement in cryptocurrency projects that could be influenced by federal policy presents unprecedented ethical challenges for the presidency. The concerns are amplified by the fact that Trump’s executive orders in the early days of his new term have already had notable impacts on the crypto sector, including proposed changes to digital asset taxation, decentralized finance regulations, and stablecoin oversight. A Brewing Battle Ahead of the 2026 Midterms Senator Ossoff’s town hall comments suggest that Democrats may increasingly focus on Trump’s crypto-related activities as a potential campaign issue ahead of the 2026 midterms. With control of Congress hanging in the balance, Democrats hope to position Trump’s personal financial dealings as a symbol of broader ethical and governance failures. Despite these criticisms, Trump's political base remains fiercely loyal, and his embrace of emerging technologies like cryptocurrency has been praised by some conservative and libertarian voters seeking alternatives to traditional financial institutions. Still, Ossoff’s comments signal that the president’s blending of official duties with personal crypto ventures is unlikely to fade quietly. As legal experts, ethics watchdogs, and political opponents continue to scrutinize the administration’s entanglements with the crypto industry, the stage appears set for a fierce political and legal battle that could shape the remainder of Trump’s presidency — and the future of digital asset regulation in the United States.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-28 05:00:00

U.S. stock futures drifted lower, while oil prices held near flat, as uncertainty persisted over whether formal talks on tariff cuts would take place. President Trump said he was “actively negotiating” with Chinese officials over duties, but Chinese authorities and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both maintained that no direct discussions have begun. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index. Source: Google Finance The mixed performance in Asia came after Wall Street closed with gains on Friday, as Big Tech stocks powered a late rally. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to 5,525.21, extending a three-day rebound that pulled it within 10.1% of its record high earlier this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led U.S. benchmarks higher with a 1.3% advance to 17,382.94, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.1% to 40,113.50. Alphabet shares climbed 1.7% in their first session after Google’s parent company said late Thursday that first-quarter profit jumped 50% from a year earlier, well above analysts’ forecasts. Nvidia also contributed to the S&P 500’s gain, rising 4.3% after reporting better-than-expected results and upbeat guidance for its chip business. Trump says he’s on track to finalize new trade agreements President Trump told reporters at the White House that he remained on track to finalize several new trade agreements in the coming weeks, but he also described it as “physically impossible” to complete all the meetings he would like to hold. His back-and-forth signals on tariffs have left businesses scrambling to adjust supply chains and temper spending plans amid the threat of sudden policy shifts. On Friday, roughly 60% of S&P 500 stocks fell, including Eastman Chemical, which tumbled 6.2% after issuing a profit forecast for the spring that came in below analysts’ estimates. A growing number of companies across multiple industries have pointed to the uncertainty around tariffs as a key reason for pulling back on financial guidance for the year ahead. Investors hope that if Trump rolls back some of his tougher tariffs on imports, he may stave off the recession many see as a likely outcome of an extended trade war. Yet the repeated cycle of threats may be prompting both households and businesses to hold off on big purchases and postpone long-term investments. A report from the University of Michigan on Friday showed that U.S. consumer sentiment fell in April, though not as steeply as economists had feared. Its gauge of expectations for future conditions dropped 32% since January, marking the largest three-month decline in percentage terms since the 1990 recession. In commodity markets on Monday, U.S. benchmark crude for June delivery fell 25 cents to $63.27 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard for oil prices, slipped 24 cents to $66.04 a barrel. Currency moves were modest in early Asian trade. The U.S. dollar rose to 143.62 Japanese yen from 143.60 yen, while the euro dipped to $1.1358 from $1.1366. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

HTX Research has announced the release of its latest report,“ Sonic: A Model for the New DeFi Paradigm ” The report dives into the details of the Sonic public chain. By fully supporting EVM while rebuilding its virtual machine, storage engine, and consensus mechanism, Sonic achieves performance metrics that redefine industry standards: over 2,000 TPS, 0.7-second transaction finality, and a cost of $0.0001 per transaction. This performance surpasses most Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions, representing a significant advancement in public chain infrastructure and ushering in a “sub-second era.” Sonic’s Evolution: 2000+ TPS, 0.7s Confirmation, Near-Zero Fees The Fantom Opera blockchain, initially recognized for its speed and throughput as a high-performance aDAG-based Layer 1 solution, encountered scalability limitations as its ecosystem expanded. Its traditional EVM architecture struggled with bloated state storage, slow node synchronization, and execution bottlenecks. To overcome these challenges without resorting to sharding or Layer 2 solutions, Fantom developed Sonic — a fundamental redesign engineered to deliver a significant performance leap. Sonic Labs, a new team led by CEO Michael Kong, CTO Andre Cronje (founder of Yearn Finance), and Chief Research Officer Bernhard Scholz, dedicated two and a half years to the redesign of Fantom’s virtual machine, storage, and consensus. They built Sonic, a new, independent EVM-compatible chain capable of processing over 2,000 TPS, achieving 0.7-second finality, and executing transactions at a cost of $0.0001. It also improves storage efficiency by 90% and reduces node synchronization time from weeks to under two days. Technical Innovations Driving Sonic’s Performance Sonic’s enhanced performance is underpinned by three core technological advancements: SonicVM: A newly developed virtual machine fully compatible with the EVM, SonicVM optimizes computationally intensive operations like SHA3 hashing, pre-analyzes jump instructions, delivers significantly faster execution, and supports high throughput. SonicDB : Achieving nearly 90% data compression, SonicDB uses a layered storage strategy that splits the blockchain state into two databases: LiveDB for the current global state and ArchiveDB for historical blocks and states. This reduces node requirements and enhances network resilience through greater decentralization. Sonic Gateway : Functioning like an “L2-like” bridging solution to Ethereum, it uses a batch processing mechanism that strikes a balance between security and efficiency, enabling seamless two-way asset transfers and ecosystem access. Sonic Tokenomics: Dual Incentives for Developers and Users Sonic has launched its native token, $S, which is exchangeable with FTM at a 1:1 ratio. The $S token powers the Sonic ecosystem through gas fee payments, staking, and governance voting.Key features include: ● Gas Fee Monetization (FeeM) Mechanism: Developers can earn up to 90% of transaction fees, incentivizing ecosystem growth. Non-FeeM applications will burn 50% of fees to counter inflation. ● Points-Based Reward Mechanism: Users earn points (Passive/Activity Points and Gems) by holding $S, participating in DeFi activities, or interacting with the ecosystem. These points are redeemable for a total of 200 million $S, promoting a sustainable “use-to-mine” loop. Stablecoin Ecosystem: Nested Yield and Resilient Growth Defying market trends in 2025, Sonic’s on-chain Total Value Locked (TVL) surged by over 500%, with the total stablecoin supply surpassing $260 million. This growth is driven by sophisticated high-leverage yield mechanisms. ● Silo v2 Loop Lending: Use staked S tokens to borrow stablecoins, achieving up to 20x exposure to capture combined incentives alongside stable yield spreads. ● Euler + Rings Protocol Combo: Deposit USDC to mint scUSD, then use leverage to potentially achieve up to 10x yield, along with Sonic points and protocol rewards. ● Shadow DEX Liquidity Provision for Rewards : By facilitating trading activity, particularly with the S/stS pair on Shadow, users can earn up to 169% APY and a share of trading fees. Looking ahead, the ecosystem will incorporate Real World Asset (RWA) yields and off-chain payment solutions to create a sustainable and widely used stablecoin ecosystem backed by compliant assets and real-world applications. Sonic’s Innovations in DeFi Infrastructure: Adaptive AMM and Dynamic Risk Control Sonic’s decentralized exchange (DEX), FlyingTulip, designed by Andre Cronje, integrates trading, lending, and leverage with two key innovations: – Adaptive AMM Curve: By combining Curve V2’s liquidity aggregation with oracle-driven volatility monitoring, FlyingTulip’s AMM dynamically adjusts its shape. It offers low slippage in stable markets (similar to a constant sum curve) and prevents liquidity issues in volatile markets (similar to a constant product curve), resulting in a 42% reduction in impermanent loss and an 85% improvement in capital efficiency. – Dynamic LTV Model: Inspired by Curve’s LLAMMA, FlyingTulip’s lending platform adjusts Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios in real time based on market volatility. For example, ETH borrowing limits can decrease from 80% in stable conditions to 50% during periods of high volatility, enhancing system stability. Conclusion: Sonic – Leading the Charge in DeFi 2.0 Sonic’s high performance, nested yields, and accessibility position it for rapid growth, with the potential to exceed $2B TVL and a multi-billion $S token market cap within a year. More importantly, Sonic is championing an “efficiency revolution” in blockchain design—prioritizing performance and capital efficiency to attract liquidity. The report identifies technical challenges, including the adaptive AMM’s reliance on external oracles, which introduces potential vulnerabilities. . Furthermore, the inherent risks of high-leverage strategies in volatile markets necessitate the use of hedging instruments, such as short perpetual futures, to mitigate potential liquidations. From a broader view, Sonic is well-positioned to lead the expected 2025 DeFi resurgence. Its thriving stablecoin ecosystem boosts the value of both the $S token and the network. Even in a bear market, Sonic demonstrates the potential for DeFi to establish resilient “yield havens” through innovation and performance. With its nested yields, developer-focused incentives, and efficient infrastructure, Sonic provides a model for the industry. The integration of RWAs and payment tools could place Sonic as a critical bridge between on-chain yields and real-world utility, driving DeFi toward mass adoption For full report, please visit: https://square.htx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HTX-Research-Latest-Report-.pdf About HTX Research HTX Research is the dedicated research arm of HTX Group, responsible for conducting in-depth analyses, producing comprehensive reports, and delivering expert evaluations across a broad spectrum of topics, including cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and emerging market trends.

Americans are turning against his massive efforts to reshape the government, and the numbers show it clearly without any room for spin. A new set of polls dropped Sunday, showing that a majority of Americans disapprove of how Trump is handling the presidency. His approval rating is sliding between 39% and 45%, depending on which poll you look at. The Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll pinned him at 39%, the CNN/SSRS poll gave him 41%, and the NBC News Stay Tuned poll pushed it to 45%. No matter which number he wants to cling to, it’s still the worst 100-day showing for any first-term president since World War II ended. The bad news keeps stacking. Trump rolled back into the White House in January with a little boost in his favorability. That’s gone. His approval is sinking fast as people grow more doubtful about the way he’s trying to change everything at once. Source: Washington Post Trump’s promises haven’t turned into wins, and Americans are showing less patience every day. His so-called strong point — the economy — is also taking a beating. He made handling the economy the centerpiece of his 2024 comeback run, but now, voters are pulling away. The CNN/SSRS poll said only 52% of adults still trust him with the economy, which is a serious 13-point drop from December. That’s not the kind of number a sitting president wants flashing all over the media during an election year. The economic fear is real. The Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll said a huge 72% of Americans believe it’s either “very” or “somewhat” likely that Trump’s economic plans are about to push the country into a recession soon. People are watching their wallets, and Trump’s promises aren’t enough to settle them down. Trade isn’t helping him either. Trump’s sweeping tariffs have caused serious problems in the financial markets. The NBC News Stay Tuned poll said that 61% of Americans disapprove of how he’s handling trade and tariffs. Inflation is crushing people, too, and 60% say they’re not happy with the way he’s dealing with the rising cost of living. Trump built his comeback campaign around claiming he would fix these exact problems, and now voters are saying he’s only making things worse. Independent voters hammer Trump as partisan gap widens Immigration, another big issue Trump loves to talk about, is falling apart in the polls, too. The CNN/SSRS poll said only 45% of Americans now approve of how he’s handling immigration. That’s a sharp fall from the 60% who gave him a thumbs-up back in December. Support for Trump still follows party lines, as the majority of Republicans are sticking by him. Nearly all Democrats are also not buying it at all and are firmly against him, which is no surprise at all. But the real damage is showing up with independents, the voters who don’t play for either team. Trump barely lost independents last November. Now, he’s losing them by even bigger margins. The Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found that 58% of independents disapprove of how Trump is running the country. These are the voters who could swing an election, and right now, they’re moving further away from him. The polls paint a brutal picture for Trump. His first 100 days are not a story of momentum or success. They are a red flashing warning sign that he’s losing ground where he can’t afford to lose it. He walked into office promising to change everything. But after three months, what Americans see is a president running out of goodwill, fast. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

According to the company’s assessments, this decline in selling pressure from miners has historically often been followed by periods of sideways consolidation or price declines. Alphractal's statement noted that low selling pressure rarely produces positive effects, however, positive reactions are observed more often in the following periods: December 2012 September 2013 A few months into 2016 July 2021 In most cases, Bitcoin continued to trade sideways or in price declines. In April 2025, Hash Rate (processing power) reached an all-time high, then fell, and a slight recovery was seen recently. This movement is similar to what happened in April 2021. The company also states that April 14, 2021 and April 14, 2023 stand out as local peaks for Bitcoin, making April a critical period for mining.

It is stated that the current miner selling pressure remains low, which is an indication of miners wisely selling their Bitcoins at the beginning of 2025. However, if a capitulation process begins in the mining sector, a new wave of selling pressure may emerge.

The Shenzhen-based Huawei is poised to start testing a new AI chip called the Ascend 910D, and has approached local tech firms, which are slated to receive the first batch of sample chips by late May, The Wall Street Journal reported on April 27, citing people familiar with the matter. The development is still at an early stage, and a series of tests will be needed to assess the chip’s performance and get it ready for customers. Huawei is pinning hopes on its latest Ascend AI processor being more powerful than Nvidia’s H100 chip, which was used for AI training in 2022. Huawei is also poised to ship more than 800,000 earlier model Ascend 910B and 910C chips to customers, including state-owned telecoms operators and private AI developers such as TikTok parent ByteDance. Beijing has also reportedly encouraged Chinese AI developers to increase purchases of domestic chips as trade tensions between China and the US escalate. In mid-April, Nvidia stated that it was expecting around $5.5 billion in charges associated with its AI chip inventory due to significant export restrictions imposed by the US government affecting its business with China. The Trump administration added Nvidia’s H20 chip, its most powerful processor that could be sold to China, to a growing list of semiconductors restricted for sale to the country. Some key components for AI chips, such as the latest high-bandwidth memory units, have also been restricted for export to China by the US. Huawei is focusing on building more efficient and faster systems, such as CloudMatrix 384 , a computing system unveiled in April, connecting Ascend 910C chips. This would leverage their chip arrays and use brute force rather than making individual processors more powerful. China seeks self-reliance on AI Reuters reported on April 26, citing state media reports, that Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged “self-reliance and self-strengthening” to develop AI in the country. “We must recognise the gaps and redouble our efforts to comprehensively advance technological innovation, industrial development, and AI-empowered applications,"" Xi said at a Politburo meeting study session on April 25.

US President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged Xi to contact him for discussions about a potential trade deal after his administration imposed 145% tariffs on most Chinese goods.

Xie noted that the exchange plans to distribute 100% of any recovered funds from the legal proceedings to platform users through airdrops. 看到有社区在讨论BG发出的律师函，我核实后，想跟大家澄清几个细节： 1、Bitget 将陆续发出8份律师函。 2、这8个账户疑似相关联的专业羊毛利益集团，是导致本次VOXEL事件的主要始作俑者，并从中不当得利超过2000万美金。 3、追回的资金，Bitget 将100% 以空投形式发放给平台用户！… — 谢家印 (@xiejiayinBitget) April 27, 2025 He assured the community that users who traded VOXEL between 16:00 and 16:30 on Apr. 20 but had already withdrawn their funds, would not face any repercussions. These accounts have been restored, and no further responsibility will be pursued against them. In addition, Xie expressed regret for any inconvenience caused and stated that a full report would be made available shortly to give a better picture of the situation.

During this price spike, which spanned from $0.125 to roughly $0.1645, trades seemed to be executed without the usual order book process. The incident was caused by a suspected bug in Bitget’s market-making bot, which resulted in rapid price swings and instant order fills that some traders took advantage of to make huge profits. In response, Bitget paused trading on the VOXEL/USDT contract and froze several accounts involved in the unusual trading activity. Bitget also announced it would roll back irregular trades and compensate users who incurred losses during the incident. While the platform has assured users that the incident wasn’t due to an internal failure or exploit, it has not revealed the identities of those responsible. Meanwhile, comparisons have been drawn to a March price manipulation incident on Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) involving the JELLY token. Bitget’s chief executive officer Gracy Chen criticized Hyperliquid’s response. Following the VOXEL scandal, critics have called her out for perceived hypocrisy.

While some believe the AI crypto sector is no longer exciting, the truth is that artificial intelligence (AI) projects, especially AI agents, might just be getting started again. The Rise and Fall of AI Crypto AI crypto projects saw massive growth toward the end of 2024, with the market value hitting $70 billion in December. But soon after, things took a turn. The AI crypto market dropped sharply to around $24 billion. This made many investors lose interest, especially as other crypto sectors also slowed down due to market uncertainty. However, in the past week, there’s been a positive shift. The market cap for AI crypto has bounced back to around $31 billion. Although altcoins haven’t fully recovered yet, experts believe this could be a good time to start paying attention. Why AI Agents Still Have Potential AI agents — special crypto tools powered by artificial intelligence — were a huge part of the earlier AI craze. Even though many of these projects fell in value, some have continued developing behind the scenes. The idea is simple: in crypto, the best time to invest is usually when nobody else is talking about it. For example, projects like Virtuals Protocol have started showing signs of life again. In just the past week, Virtuals’ price has jumped by over 60%. This project aims to make it easy to launch and monetize AI agents and connect them within its ecosystem. Although it once hit $4.50 in January, it’s now trading under $1, showing how far it’s fallen — and how much room it might have to grow again. Other AI Coins to Watch Two other AI-related coins catching attention are AIXBT and Tric: AIXBT: Once a popular AI agent platform for crypto research and analysis, it’s recently gained around 70% in a week. While it’s still far from its all-time high, some believe it has the potential to recover as interest in AI agents returns. TRAC: A similar platform on the Solana blockchain, TRAC had a massive run-up before crashing. It now sits at a very low market value of $3 million, compared to its previous $100 million peak. While risky, small market cap coins like this sometimes offer big returns — but also come with high risks.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 05:33:03

Despite the concerns about Strategy’s debt-fueled buying spree, experts like Saifedean Ammous argue that such concentration of Bitcoin ownership will not threaten the protocol itself, as institutions have no incentive to alter Bitcoin’s rules. Meanwhile, the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin treasuries is strengthening the path toward hyperbitcoinization, a future where Bitcoin overtakes fiat as dominant global money. Blockstream CEO Adam Back described this shift as a rational arbitrage of fiat’s declining value. Governments like El Salvador also still continue their quiet Bitcoin accumulation, navigating international agreements with flexibility. Altogether, these trends mean that Bitcoin’s role in global finance is growing very quickly and irreversibly. Bitcoin Could Get Much Scarcer Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, is effectively “synthetically halving Bitcoin” by buying more than half of all newly mined BTC each month. This is according to Adam Livingston , a Bitcoin analyst and author of The Bitcoin Age and The Great Harvest. Miners currently produce around 450 BTC daily, which totals roughly 13,500 BTC per month, yet Strategy acquired an astonishing 379,800 BTC over the past six months. This means the firm purchased around 2,087 BTC per day, which is greatly exceeding the global daily miner output. Livingston explained that this level of accumulation will make Bitcoin dramatically scarcer, and could push the asset into an environment where access will require paying large premiums. As a result, lending against Bitcoin will become increasingly expensive, borrowing BTC will be a luxury reserved for major corporations and nation-states, and Strategy will have a dominant influence over Bitcoin’s cost of capital. Livingston’s prediction points to an impending Bitcoin supply crunch, and suggests that if Strategy maintains this acquisition pace while institutional and retail demand grows, Bitcoin prices could soar much higher. Despite the concerns over the sustainability of Strategy’s debt-fueled Bitcoin purchases , especially if a prolonged bear market emerges, some Bitcoin advocates argue that Strategy’s dominance is not a threat to the protocol itself. Saifedean Ammous , economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, recently said that even if institutions like Strategy and BlackRock hold large portions of Bitcoin’s supply, they will have no incentive to manipulate the network’s rules, like increasing the maximum supply. Doing so will devalue their holdings, which ultimately belong to shareholders who could move their investments elsewhere. Thus, while Strategy’s aggressive accumulation strategy is reshaping Bitcoin’s financial landscape, many believe it only strengthens Bitcoin’s fundamental scarcity rather than undermining its decentralized ethos. Bitcoin Treasuries Are Fueling Hyperbitcoinization Investment firms with Bitcoin-focused treasury strategies are increasingly front-running global Bitcoin adoption , and could potentially pave the way for the world’s first cryptocurrency to reach a $200 trillion market capitalization in the next decade. Institutions and governments are beginning to recognize Bitcoin’s unique monetary properties, according to Blockstream CEO and Hashcash inventor Adam Back. In an April 26 post, Back described companies like Strategy as engaging in a logical and sustainable arbitrage of the gap between the current fiat world and a Bitcoin-driven future, a move scalable enough for most major listed companies to transition their treasuries to Bitcoin. The phenomenon is known as hyperbitcoinization , where Bitcoin replaces fiat currencies as the dominant global money, and it is being fueled by Bitcoin’s consistent outpacing of fiat money inflation. Back explained that this is not a temporary trend but a rational and sustainable arbitrage play, driven by Bitcoin's superior long-term price appreciation over inflation and interest rates across four-year periods. His comments were made after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a national Bitcoin reserve sourced from government-seized BTC. Momentum for corporate Bitcoin accumulation is still growing. Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin holder , already generated over $5.1 billion in profit from its Bitcoin treasury since the beginning of 2025, according to co-founder Michael Saylor. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet , dubbed ”Asia’s MicroStrategy,” also embraced this approach and even surpassed 5,000 BTC in holdings on April 24 and set a goal of reaching 21,000 BTC by 2026. Top companies that hold Bitcoin (Source: BitBo ) Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape in the United States is becoming a lot more favorable. The Federal Reserve’s withdrawal of its 2022 guidance discouraging banks from engaging with cryptocurrency opened the door for even more institutional participation. Michael Saylor said that banks are now free to support Bitcoin. Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev, agreed with this, and pointed out that banks will now be supervised through normal regulatory processes. This means that there is a much more open environment for digital asset integration. As financial institutions and corporations continue to move into Bitcoin, the foundation for hyperbitcoinization seems to be strengthening. El Salvador Quietly Continues Bitcoin Buying Certain countries are also making sure to stock up on Bitcoin. El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is still quietly accumulating Bitcoin despite comments from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggesting otherwise. In the seven days leading up to April 27, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office recorded the acquisition of 7 Bitcoin, which is valued at over $650,000. During an April 26 press briefing , Rodrigo Valdes, the director of the IMF’s Western Hemisphere Department, stated that El Salvador is still complying with its commitment under an IMF agreement to halt Bitcoin accumulation by the government’s fiscal sector. El Salvador’s BTC holdings changes (Source: Bitcoin Office ) Valdes explained that the IMF’s program with El Salvador is focused not on Bitcoin but on broader structural reforms, including governance and transparency. This program was part of a $1.4 billion loan deal that was struck in December of 2024, which required El Salvador to stop treating Bitcoin as legal tender and cease government-led Bitcoin purchases. However, there appears to be some flexibility in the interpretation of the agreement. According to blockchain adviser and author Anndy Lian , the ”flexible interpretation” could mean that Bitcoin purchases are being conducted through non-governmental or reclassified entities, which allows the country to technically remain compliant with IMF conditions. Lian pointed out that this approach makes it possible for El Salvador to preserve its Bitcoin-friendly reputation while still securing vital IMF funding needed to manage public debt and financial reserves. El Salvador’s strategy shed some light on the broader tension between financial innovation and traditional international economic frameworks. Lian suggested that the country’s experience provides important lessons for other nations considering crypto adoption, particularly regarding the need for strong regulatory systems and the ability to balance domestic innovation with global financial expectations.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-28 05:37:00

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President hinted that Americans could soon see a dramatic shift in how the government is funded, possibly eliminating federal income taxes. In a Truth Social post on April 27 , Trump suggested that once his new Trump Tariff policies on imported goods are fully in place, income taxes could be “substantially reduced,” especially for those earning under $200,000 a year. Trump introduced a new concept called the “External Revenue Service,” proposing that tariffs, rather than income taxes, could support the government. He described it as a return to an earlier model, pointing to the 19th-century Gilded Age when the U.S. operated without an income tax. Could Lower Taxes Boost Investments and Crypto? Lower income taxes could leave Americans with more disposable income, potentially sparking increased investment in stocks, real estate, and cryptocurrencies . Market watchers note that extra take-home pay often translates into higher consumer spending and asset growth. However, analysts caution that the broader economic impact — especially against the backdrop of Fed rate cuts and fluctuating markets — will ultimately determine whether the plan would fuel major investment surges. Skepticism Grows Over Lack of Details This isn’t the first time Trump has floated the idea. He previously mentioned the concept during a 2024 appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience. Critics argue that Trump has yet to provide a clear roadmap on how a tariff-funded government would work, especially at current spending levels. Research from Dancing Numbers suggests eliminating income taxes could save the average American more than $134,000 over a lifetime, with even greater savings if payroll taxes are removed. Still, experts warn that relying solely on tariffs might not generate enough revenue without significant changes to federal spending. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick , a strong supporter of Trump’s tariff strategy, has also advocated for scrapping the IRS. In January 2025, Lutnick pointed to the early 1900s, when tariffs helped make America the world’s richest country, arguing that protecting domestic workers through Trump Tariff measures could once again boost national wealth. New Tax Proposals Emerge Financial strategist Bert Dohmen has pitched additional tax ideas for Trump to consider. He proposes exempting seniors over the age of 76 who operate small businesses from income taxes, arguing that the administrative burden is too high for older entrepreneurs. Dohmen also recommends offering tax incentives for families, suggesting a 10% tax exemption per child, capped at a 50% total reduction, to encourage higher birth rates — a growing concern among industrialized nations. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump-Backed Crypto Project World Liberty Financial Partners with Pakistan for Full Crypto Legalization , Markets Wobble Amid Trump Tariff Uncertainty While Trump signed an executive order to introduce sweeping new tariffs earlier this month, frequent revisions and policy shifts have injected volatility into the markets.

The instability comes at a critical time when markets are already bracing for the impact of potential Fed rate cuts later this year. Investors will closely watch how Trump’s tariff-driven vision and the Fed’s monetary policy intersect to shape the economic landscape ahead of the 2026 election season. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

No, Trump has proposed substantially reducing income taxes, especially for those earning under $200,000, by using tariffs to fund the government. He has not announced a full elimination of income taxes. What is Trump’s “External Revenue Service” idea? Trump’s “External Revenue Service” is a concept where government funding would primarily come from tariffs on imported goods rather than traditional income taxes. How could lower income taxes impact investments and crypto markets?

Jacobs said central banks around the world have been pulling away from the US dollar for decades. He said that in the last three to four years, Bitcoin and gold have become the new favorites among the assets they are piling into. Jacobs said crypto is now moving separately from US tech stocks, even though tariffs and political fights have made crypto markets behave like stocks and bonds in the short term. He pointed out that Bitcoin doesn’t depend on economic growth, stability, or peace to rise. Jacobs said, “It thrives when there is more uncertainty,” which makes it different from traditional investments that need low risks and steady growth to perform. China builds bigger Bitcoin and gold positions The latest numbers show that China held $784.3 billion in US Treasuries by the end of February, based on the US Treasury Department’s data. China’s gold pile was worth around $229.6 billion at the end of March, the Economic Times reported on April 21. On top of that, China is sitting on 194,000 BTC, valued at about $18 billion, according to Bitbo’s Bitcoin Treasuries. Guy Cecala, executive chair at Inside Mortgage Finance, told CNBC that China has real power to shake the US markets. He said, “If China wanted to hit us hard, they could unload Treasuries. Is that a threat? Sure it is.” Cecala said Treasury securities are the foundation of US government financing, so any big sell-off would hit the system hard. China also owns a massive amount of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), part of the $1.32 trillion in US MBS owned by foreign countries, based on an analysis from Ginnie Mae. Besides China, big holders include Japan , Taiwan, and Canada . If China starts selling its MBS, and others follow, it could crush the MBS market and ripple across global finance. Some experts think China will hesitate because dumping MBS would hurt its own assets. Melissa Cohn, regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage, told Newsweek that a large sell-off would wreck China’s remaining investments and could destabilize global currencies. Cohn added that China depends on keeping the renminbi (RMB) weaker than the US dollar to keep its exports cheaper and more attractive for American buyers. To do this, China has kept buying US debt for years. Mortgage rates face pressure from China’s strategy The MBS market heavily influences US mortgage rates. If China starts selling its MBS stash, prices would crash and mortgage rates would jump. Homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages would be some of the first to get hit. Eric Hagen, mortgage and specialty finance analyst at BTIG, told CNBC that “most investors are concerned that mortgage spreads would widen” if countries like China, Japan, or Canada decided to retaliate financially. As of April 17, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate stood at 6.83%, reported by Freddie Mac. That is already squeezing many American homeowners. If rates rise more because of an MBS dump, refinancing will be less attractive or even impossible for some. Refinancing would mean higher monthly payments instead of savings. First-time homebuyers would feel the blow, too. Higher mortgage rates would knock many buyers out of the market, and home sellers might stay on the sidelines, waiting for prices to recover. Higher rates also raise borrowers’ debt-to-income ratios, which could push banks to tighten lending rules even more. Lenders might demand higher credit scores or bigger down payments to reduce their risks. Jacobs said BlackRock believes that geopolitical fragmentation is the big driver behind these changes. He said Bitcoin is not just another asset but a direct result of a world that’s becoming more divided. While stocks and bonds need stability, crypto like Bitcoin feeds off the instability that China and other powers are preparing for. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Under the partnership, World Liberty will help the Council launch regulatory sandboxes to test blockchain-based products, expand stablecoin applications for remittances and trade, explore real-world asset tokenization, and assist with the growth of decentralized finance protocols, local news outlet Business Recorder reported on April 27. World Liberty founders Zach Witkoff, Zak Folkman and Chase Herro signed the letter in a recent meeting with the Council’s CEO Bilal bin Saqib, with Pakistan’s central bank governor, finance minister and IT secretary among those in attendance. Source: Pakistan Crypto Council Trump and his family backed World Liberty at the crypto lending and borrowing platform’s launch last year and they receive a cut of its profits. The Pakistan Crypto Council is a government-backed body that oversees crypto regulation and related initiatives aimed at driving adoption and attracting more foreign investment. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis ranked Pakistan ninth for crypto adoption last year, with an estimated 25 million active crypto users and $300 billion in annual crypto transactions. Pakistan is looking to capitalize on its young population, where roughly 60% are under 30, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said. “Pakistan’s youth and technology sector are our greatest assets. Through partnerships like this, we are opening new doors for investment, innovation, and global leadership in the blockchain economy.” Pakistan looks to balance pro-crypto innovation with regulation The three World Liberty founders recently met with former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao , who was recently appointed as an adviser to the Pakistan Crypto Council to assist the country on crypto regulation and innovation. Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency also proposed a crypto regulatory framework on April 10, which looks to address terrorism financing, money laundering, and Know Your Customer controls. Related: Pakistan Crypto Council proposes using excess energy for BTC mining FIA Director Sumera Azam said the framework is part of a broader effort to strike a “balance between technological advancement and national security imperatives.” The proposed framework is subject to legislative approval and input from crypto firms operating in the country, with an expected multi-phased rollout beginning in 2026. Pakistan’s new crypto-friendly approach contrasts sharply with its stance in May 2023, when former finance minister Aisha Ghaus Pasha stated the country would never legalize cryptocurrencies due to concerns over bypassing Financial Action Task Force regulations.

Feist introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 9698 on April 27, aiming to increase the network’s gas limit by 100 times over the next two years, potentially enabling the Ethereum mainnet to handle up to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). The proposal outlines a “deterministic gas limit growth schedule,” set to begin around June 1 at epoch 369017. Ethereum Proposal Plans 100x Gas Limit Increase Over Two Years Under this plan, the gas limit would grow tenfold gradually over approximately 164,250 epochs (about two years), followed by a final tenfold increase. This structured approach, Feist argues, would ensure a transparent and sustainable path for scaling, aligned with ongoing improvements in hardware and protocol efficiency. Currently, Ethereum’s gas limit stands at 36 million, following a recent increase from 30 million in February. Feist’s EIP suggests expanding this to 3.6 billion, allowing for roughly 6,000 transactions per block — a significant jump from today’s capacity. At present, Ethereum processes up to 20 TPS during periods dominated by simple transactions. How serious is Ethereum about scaling L1? Answer: Exponentially increase gas limit 100x over 4 years by @dankrad How: Clients sets default and automatically raise the gas limit every epoch (users can still override). 100x means: – 3.6B gas limit ~2000 TPS – 6000 tx per block https://t.co/3Wjb5EKKck — fabda.eth (@fabdarice) April 27, 2025 If implemented, this proposal could position Ethereum to better compete with high-throughput blockchains like Solana, which averages between 800 and 1,050 TPS, with a theoretical maximum of 65,000 TPS. However, Feist acknowledged potential challenges, noting that such rapid gas limit growth could strain under-optimized nodes and lead to longer block propagation times. Still, he emphasized that the gradual, epoch-based increases would give developers and node operators sufficient time to adjust. EIP-9698 is part of Ethereum’s broader push to enhance base-layer scalability, following years of reliance on layer-2 solutions. Critics argue that this layer-2 strategy has fragmented the ecosystem, creating isolated chains and complicating user experience due to limited interoperability. Meanwhile, Ethereum developers are also preparing for the Fusaka hard fork, which could test a fourfold gas limit increase under EIP-9678, potentially launching in late 2025. Before that, the Pectra upgrade is scheduled to go live in May, marking another step in Ethereum’s ongoing evolution. Ethereum Has ‘Huge Opportunity’ to Fix AI’s Centralization Problem Ethereum could play a key role in solving some of the most pressing problems facing artificial intelligence, according to Eric Connor, a former core developer of the blockchain. Earlier this month, Connor said Ethereum’s “biggest mainstream moment” could come through its integration with AI, as the sector struggles with centralization, opaque algorithms, and growing privacy concerns. “AI is plagued by black-box models, centralized data silos, and privacy pitfalls,” Connor noted, adding that Ethereum is uniquely positioned to address these issues. Ethereum has already shown the world trustless, programmable finance through DeFi and stablecoins. But its biggest mainstream moment is waiting in the wings with AI. AI is on a fast-track to reshape almost every aspect of our lives. But it’s plagued by black-box models,… — Eric Conner (@econoar) April 15, 2025 Last month, crypto venture capitalist Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures pointed to two key issues undermining Ether’s value: the rise of layer-2 (L2) scaling networks and unchecked token issuance. He argued that “greedy Eth L2s” are siphoning off value from Ethereum’s base layer while giving little back. He also criticized the Ethereum community’s acceptance of excessive token creation, claiming that “ETH was buried in an avalanche of its own tokens. Died by its own hand.” The post New Ethereum Proposal Could Boost Mainnet to 2,000 TPS, Says Researcher appeared first on Cryptonews .",Ethereum News|ETH|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|SOL|ZRX|FORKS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-28 05:43:34

While major names like Solana and XRP continue to perform, a growing number of investors are pivoting toward this new contender with one question in mind: Is this the next multi-million dollar crypto story? From wallet activity to online chatter, it’s becoming clear— MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just another token launch. It’s looking like a serious player on the verge of something much bigger. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building Real Momentum—and It’s Happening Fast The smartest moves in crypto come before the headlines. That’s exactly where MAGACOINFINANCE is right now: rising fast, but still early enough to move on. What’s fueling the rush? It’s a combination of clean rollout mechanics, transparent development, and—most importantly—confidence from experienced traders. Unlike short-lived trends, this project is checking every box: real wallet growth, growing community participation, and a development team that’s actively delivering on promises. It’s not speculation anymore. It’s traction. Why Solana and XRP Investors Are Joining the Move Solana has become the standard for high-speed, high-performance blockchains. It’s attracting developers, real-world applications, and institutional capital—but its biggest gains are likely behind it. XRP , revitalized by its regulatory clarity, is finally being recognized for what it’s always claimed to be: a legitimate infrastructure layer for global finance. Banks and fintech firms are now taking it seriously—and so are the investors who stuck with it. But even among these giants, there’s growing recognition that MAGACOINFINANCE could be where exponential growth still lives. Others in the Mix: Polkadot, Sei, and Key Ecosystem Drivers Polkadot remains a top-tier network for chain interoperability. Its parachain structure continues to attract experimentation and development flexibility, especially among builders focused on scalable applications. Sei is emerging quickly as a speed-first blockchain designed for performance-heavy use cases like trading. It’s still in the early wave—but developer interest is growing fast. These projects are solid—but they’re already discovered. MAGACOINFINANCE is still under the radar—and that’s exactly what makes it exciting. Final Word The crypto world rewards timing—and investors know it. Right now, early buyers are treating MAGACOINFINANCE.COM as a rare shot at entering before the wave breaks. This might not be just another token. It might be the opportunity that turns today’s moves into tomorrow’s big headlines.

43892057,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=716814,1745820023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43892057.jpeg,The Federal Reserve deceived everyone with its rescission of anti-crypto rules,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fed-deceives-with-anti-crypto-rules/,"Caitlin Long, the CEO of Custodia Bank, said the Federal Reserve tricked the public by pretending to ease up on crypto rules but actually keeping the most important anti-crypto restriction alive. Caitlin posted a detailed thread on X Sunday explaining that while the Fed made noise about scrapping four pieces of anti-crypto guidance, it left one major piece in place. This surviving policy, she said, was issued alongside the Biden White House’s anti-crypto statement back on January 27, 2023, and it still blocks banks from touching crypto in any real way. Caitlin said the guidance left untouched does three main things. First, it blocks banks from holding cryptoassets as principal, meaning they can’t even pay a small gas fee. Second, it stops banks from issuing stablecoins on permissionless blockchains. Third, it keeps a clear preference for permissioned blockchains — ones controlled by big banks — even though the OCC and FDIC dropped that idea. Caitlin said , “The Fed has maintained a regulatory preference for permissioned stablecoins,” warning that this creates a first-mover advantage for big banks’ private stablecoins before the broader stablecoin bill becomes law. Fed favors big banks while stifling crypto custody Caitlin said the Fed’s refusal to let banks deal with crypto directly has bigger consequences than most realize. Not only does it block Wall Street banks from making markets in major tokens like BTC , ETH, and SOL, but it also screws over banks trying to offer crypto custody. Caitlin explained that crypto custodians usually need to estimate gas fees ahead of time. If the estimate is too low because network fees spiked, the transaction would fail. In the current setup, a bank acting as a custodian can’t pay the missing amount, which would force the transaction to die. This issue grows even messier because custodians often split up large crypto holdings into smaller pieces to manage risk better. Every split means new on-chain transactions and more gas fees. Caitlin said that since banks can’t pay those fees directly, the whole process becomes too risky, discouraging them from offering crypto custody services at all. In short, the Fed threw sand into the gears for banks looking to seriously work with crypto. Caitlin summed it up by saying the Fed effectively handed big banks a head start in launching permissioned stablecoins while making it harder for others to catch up once the stablecoin market fully opens. She added that this maneuver gives Wall Street giants an advantage now, before Congress passes the stablecoin law that would remove the Fed’s preference for permissioned systems. Fed hides real actions while White House cheers Caitlin criticized the Fed’s public relations stunt. She said the Fed made a big deal about all the rules it rolled back but never mentioned the critical one it kept. “The Fed definitely won on PR spin,” she wrote, adding that even smart people got fooled. She warned that now that people know the truth, they should be furious. She said the White House praised the Fed’s actions, clearly unaware—or pretending to be—that the worst policy stayed. Caitlin said this raises questions about what the White House expected from the Fed, what the Fed promised, and how the relationship between the two might be shifting. She said most media outlets have talked about brewing fights over interest rates, but almost nobody is covering the growing tension over bank regulation. Cynthia Lummis, the head of the Senate Banking Committee’s Digital Assets Subcommittee, was not tricked. She called the Fed’s move “lip service” and made it clear she wasn’t buying the act. Cynthia, who has serious power over digital asset rules in the Senate, could take steps to fix what she called a “deceptive maneuver.” In her own post on X, Cynthia added, “Unlike the OCC and FDIC, the Fed STILL uses reputation risk in bank supervision.” She also said that the same Fed staffers who pushed Operation Chokepoint 2.0, the infamous Biden-era effort to pressure banks away from controversial industries, are still the ones handling crypto policy today.

The meme coin is showing signs of bullish continuation after a long stretch of consolidation, and a resulting breakout from such momentum could be enormous. To put it plainly, its 2024 400% breakout could pale in comparison to what is coming if Shiba Inu manages to complete its breakout. Shiba Inu Green Closes Point To Bullishness A pseudonymous crypto analyst has pointed out some interesting formations in the Shiba Inu price chart, which seem to have gone under the radar. For example, the Shiba Inu price has marked its 3rd consecutive weekly close and continues to flash signs of more price increases. With the most recent break and close in the green, Shiba Inu is now looking to break above its long-term support. Related Reading: XRP Price Ready To Reach $8 As Consolidation Breaks – Here’s The Timeline Currently, the Shiba Inu price is still trading above its August 2024 low before its 400% breakout. This suggests that the meme coin could be on the ground floor of something extraordinary, especially as the majority of its investors sit underwater, according to data from IntoTheBlock. If this bullish momentum is maintained, the crypto analyst sees the meme coin rallying to brand-new all-time highs. The first target is @0.000139, which would be an 894% rally from its current level, as well as 50% higher than its current peak of $0.00008. Another more bullish target is that the Shiba Inu price could reach as high as $0.000220. This is a 1,479% increase in price and 150% higher than the current all-time high. The post read: We will have to wait and see, it is too early but the market is turning green now and will continue to trade green. It can happen that it go higher rather than lower based on the chart. It can happen that rather than overestimating the potential of this pair, we are underestimating it, this too would be good, the more it grows the better it gets. The Other Side For The Shiba Inu Price While the fact that the Shiba Inu price closed three weeks with green candles is commendable, it is possible that this might not end well for the meme coin. Looking back to November-December 2024, which is the last time that SHIB saw three consecutive green weekly closes, what followed was catastrophic. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Reaches Last H1 Support, Next Major Resistance Comes Into View The price went on a rapid downtrend with three red weekly closes following the three green weekly closes. The following weeks were not much better as the Shiba Inu price only saw one green weekly close in eight weeks. Therefore, if this were to repeat this time around, then it is possible that the SHIB price could see a downtrend before picking back up.

It jumped above $95,100 early Sunday and the rally came after the U.S. President Donald Trump said he would roll back tariffs on Chinese imports. Bitcoin’s surge was largely driven by $3.06 billion in weekly inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. Altcoins also fared well, with XRP up 4%, Solana up 1%, and Cardano up 2% over the past day. XRP is making headlines as the SEC has approved ProShares’ first-ever XRP futures ETF, set to go live on April 30. ProShares is preparing to launch three XRP-tracked products this week after a quiet SEC approval. The flurry of XRP ETFs comes after Ripple’s major victory over the SEC in March, which cleared major regulatory hurdles for XRP. Analyst Warns XRP Could Drop to $1.25 Analyst Egrag Crypto, in his latest X post , predicted that XRP could hit $1.25 in the short term. He explained that XRP still shows weakness unless it can close above the $2.33–$2.45 range, which would signal a bullish breakout. Egrag opened up about the importance of the 0.702 Fibonacci level, linking it to a major past breakout. Further, he advised his followers not to chase market gains or panic sell, but instead to keep accumulating XRP during price dips. “This is a short-term outlook, and while I am confident we may see double digits in the upcoming months, we first need to dispel any bearish sentiments,” the analyst said.

In a post that sharply contrasts with typical narratives pushed by prominent digital asset influencers, Aljarrah stated, “Tether props up BTC. XRP was engineered to replace what Bitcoin only pretended to solve. Ripple’s protocol is already bridging financial systems, something BTC never could.” This assessment was accompanied by a video featuring Egon von Greyerz, Founder and Managing Partner of Von Greyerz AG, who expanded on the ideas. This is the take on Bitcoin, Tether, XRP, and Gold you won’t hear from any mainstream crypto influencer. Tether props up BTC. #XRP was engineered to replace what Bitcoin only pretended to solve. Ripple’s protocol is already bridging financial systems, something BTC never could. pic.twitter.com/pwxNEx0zB3 — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) April 25, 2025 Bitcoin as a Politicized Asset and the Role of Tether Von Greyerz described Bitcoin as a heavily politicized asset that no longer functions as its original proponents claimed. He characterized Bitcoin as the “new oil,” suggesting that its value is being inflated deliberately to facilitate debt repayment strategies by certain governments, referencing El Salvador as one example. He said, “Bitcoin is being used like oil was in the 70s, artificially inflated to pay down US debt and create demand for US dollars.” He explained that the drive to inflate Bitcoin is tied to the need to prop up demand for U.S. dollars and U.S. treasuries, especially under frameworks like the Loomis bill. According to von Greyerz, Bitcoin’s current trajectory aligns it more with the goals of central authorities rather than functioning as an independent, decentralized financial alternative. Tether plays a significant role in this arrangement. Von Greyerz pointed out that Tether is not only backed by U.S. Treasuries but holds more Treasuries than the country of Germany. He described how Tether’s integration into Bitcoin’s ecosystem, particularly in trading pairs and liquidity, contributes to an inflated perception of Bitcoin’s organic market demand. The stablecoin, when tied to an asset like Bitcoin, effectively supports a system that promotes demand for U.S. debt instruments. XRP and Ripple’s Foundational Role in Global Finance In contrast to Bitcoin, XRP, and the technology created by Ripple were framed by both Aljarrah and von Greyerz as practical tools with functional utility across financial systems. According to von Greyerz, Ripple developed the underlying digital ledger technology (DLT) as far back as 2001, long before the wider public discourse around cryptocurrency took hold. He noted that Ripple’s ISO 20022-compliant protocol enables interoperability between various financial systems and is being positioned as the technological backbone for central bank digital currency (CBDC) development. Von Greyerz claimed that institutions like the IMF have already acknowledged Ripple’s role in CBDC infrastructure, and that the tokenization of assets, interbank settlement, and digital identity will rely on XRP’s ecosystem. This stands in contrast to Bitcoin, which he said “is not a store of value. It is not a medium of exchange. It is not a unit of account.” Rather, it is a speculative asset whose value is strategically inflated to serve state monetary objectives. Gold’s Continued Relevance in a Digitally Oriented World While praising Ripple and XRP’s practical applications, von Greyerz also emphasized that the foundational backing for the coming digital monetary system remains physical gold. Referring to the IMF’s reports from 2020, he noted that even within future digital frameworks, gold is still cited as a hard asset supporting the system. This is despite public emphasis on digital innovations and tokenized assets. He stated, “The whole thing is still going to be based and backed by a hard asset, gold, not Bitcoin.” Final Perspective on Speculation Versus Utility Von Greyerz clarifies that he is not categorically opposed to Bitcoin. However, he stressed the need for honesty about his role. He said if the Loomis bill is enacted, the Bitcoin market could offer significant speculative gains. Yet he rejected the idea that Bitcoin is fulfilling the functions originally promised by its advocates. He described the current narrative surrounding Bitcoin as dishonest, characterized it as an “intentionally created asset bubble to create demand… for the very dollar it’s supposed to be an anti-dollar asset solution to.” Aljarrah’s tweet and von Greyerz’s commentary suggest that Bitcoin is no longer a challenge to the system but now works in support of traditional monetary policy. In contrast, XRP and Ripple are shown as tools for real financial connectivity, while gold is still seen as a quiet but steady reserve in today’s changing digital economy.

When both align, they join forces to make a bullish environment anchored in fundamentals. Bullish Bitcoin Technicals The analyst added that their risk signal model has started its trend back down, which means liquidity has returned to the market. “Downside pullbacks will be muted in this environment,” he added. BTC fundamentals have turned bullish, not a bad setup to break all time highs. I took a break from X to enjoy the NZ summer but every week I put out a series of analysis to my subscribers (this is a hobby, NOT a long term project). Thought I’d post this update publicly. — Willy Woo (@woonomic) April 27, 2025 With medium-term targets of $90,000 and $93,000 being hit, “the $108,000 target is still in play with a new interim target of $103,000 forming,” said Woo. However, in the short term , more sideways action or a slow grind upwards is the most likely scenario. He added that all dips are for buying under the present regime, and there is a good chance of them in the very short term, before concluding: “BTC is setting up for another break of all-time highs if the capital flow trend continues. It’s a solid long-term setup.” Analyst “Rekt Capital” said that Bitcoin would need to have a weekly close above $93,500 to start the process of regaining the previous range. The asset dipped below $93,000 briefly on Monday morning before recovering to reclaim $94,000 at the time of writing, so this move may be a possibility. #BTC Can Bitcoin do it?

BTC Above STH Price The positive weekly close has pushed the Bitcoin price above the short-term holder price for the first time since March 3, reported Galaxy Research. When BTC trades above the STH price, it signals that recent buyers are in profit. “This reduces the likelihood of capitulation and strengthens on-chain support for further upside,” it explained. Bitcoin’s price increased more than 10% this week, climbing from $85,177 at the weekly open to $93,946 as of the April 24 daily close. This move pushed BTC above the short-term holder (STH) price for the first time since March 3. Why it matters pic.twitter.com/3vtZctksPR — Galaxy (@galaxyhq) April 27, 2025 On-chain metrics suggest a stronger footing with more BTC holders back in profit and fewer incentives to sell into weakness, researchers concluded. BTC was trading just over $94,000 at the time of writing, having held around this level for the past five days.

SEC staff need to use crypto to better understand how it works and the best way to regulate it, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal argued in open letters sent to OGE acting director Jamieson Greer and newly sworn-in SEC Chair Paul Atkins , which he shared to X on April 25. “To regulate technology, you need to understand it. To understand technology, you need to use it,” Grewal said in the letter to Greer. “Permitting commission staff to hold crypto is essential to them developing the knowledge necessary to propose and adopt workable regulatory frameworks for digital securities activity,” he added. Source: Paul Grewal Legal Advisory 22-04, issued on July 4, 2022, by the OGE, prohibits SEC staff from buying, selling, or otherwise using crypto and stablecoins because they are not “publicly traded securities” and don’t qualify for an exception, unlike stocks. SEC needs waivers for staff Grewal said US President Donald Trump directed the SEC and other agencies to submit recommendations for crypto regulations due in around 90 days, and SEC “staff still cannot use the technology on which they are making recommendations.” He echoed a similar sentiment in his letter to Atkins and crypto-friendly SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, arguing being unable to hold crypto is a roadblock for the agency’s Crypto Task Force in creating a regulatory framework. Source: Paul Grewal While it’s up to OGE to rescind the advisory, the SEC should take its own action, Grewal said. “For example, issuing waivers to crypto task force members and other staff actively working on task force matters would be consistent with measures already taken in commensurate advisory situations,” he said. Related: Coinbase files FOIA to see how much the SEC’s ‘war on crypto’ cost Grewal added that a waiver would allow SEC staff on the Crypto Task Force responsible for creating crypto regulations to use crypto and “evaluate the underlying digital asset technology.” Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who took office in 2021, was known for his hardline stance on crypto regulation. He resigned on Jan. 20 after spearheading an aggressive regulatory stance toward crypto , bringing upward of 100 regulatory actions against firms. Following Gensler’s exit, the SEC opted out of a swathe of lawsuits against crypto firms, including Coinbase, on Feb. 27 and, in a more recent April 24 walkback, flagged plans to drop its enforcement against blockchain firm Dragonchain.

ADA is consolidating near $0.70 and eyes more gains above the $0.720 zone. ADA price started a recovery wave from the $0.650 zone. The price is trading above $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.7180 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.720 resistance zone. Cardano Price Faces Resistance In the past few sessions, Cardano saw a fresh decline from the $0.7350 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA declined below the $0.720 and $0.70 support levels. A low was formed at $0.6826 and the price is again moving higher. There was a move above the $0.70 level. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7338 swing high to the $0.6826 low. Cardano price is now trading above $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.7150 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7338 swing high to the $0.6826 low. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.7180 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $0.7250. The next key resistance might be $0.750. If there is a close above the $0.750 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.780 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.80 in the near term. Another Drop in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.7150 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.70 level. The next major support is near the $0.680 level. A downside break below the $0.680 level could open the doors for a test of $0.630.

According to a filing with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the plaintiffs claim Nike carried out a “rug pull” by promoting sneaker-themed NFTs, pocketing profits from initial and secondary sales, and then shutting down RTFKT in January 2025, leaving holders with steep losses and worthless assets. The lawsuit, led by an RTFKT holder, Jagdeep Cheema, seeks $5 million in damages and calls for a trial by jury to decide the claims. It accuses Nike of violating consumer protection laws and selling unregistered securities. Plaintiffs argue that the Nike NFTs meet the criteria for securities under the Howey Test, as buyers made an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits tied to Nike’s ongoing efforts. “As this type of digital asset is properly classified as a security under relevant law, the issuers of this type of token are required to register them and file relevant statements with the authorities and comply with relevant securities laws. The Nike NFTs were never registered as such,” the lawsuit noted. You might also like: TRUMP developers remove $4.6m from liquidity pool, raising rug pull concerns Nike acquired RTFKT in December 2021, during the peak of NFT mania, positioning the move as part of its bigger push into the digital world. At the time, RTFKT was praised for blending fashion, gaming, and blockchain tech in ways that captured huge attention across the crypto and sneaker communities. The studio quickly became a standout name, with projects like CloneX and Cryptokicks generating millions in sales. Early buyers were promised a gamified experience with quests, forging events, and exclusive drops that tied digital collectibles to real-world rewards. However, as the broader NFT market cooled throughout 2023 and 2024, interest in RTFKT’s collections also started to fade. In December 2024, Nike announced RTFKT would wind down after one final release, the “Blade Drop,” describing the move as a shift toward preserving RTFKT’s legacy rather than an outright shutdown. The plaintiffs argue that Nike’s withdrawal crushed the value of the NFTs, many of which had once traded for thousands of dollars, and wiped out promised ecosystem features like quests, rewards, and exclusive access to limited-edition products. Nike and RTFKT had also allegedly promoted the NFTs with promises of peer-to-peer trading and an active ecosystem where completing challenges and forging sneakers would add real value. After the shutdown, those features disappeared, the secondary market dried up, and NFT prices collapsed almost overnight. “Predictably, prices plunged and did not recover. Investors – some of whom are cited in this complaint – and the crypto community at large lamented Nike’s brazen rug pull,” the lawsuit added.

Set to go live tomorrow, XRPFi will introduce smart contract capabilities to XRP, enabling users to stake, lend, borrow, and trade XRP-based assets directly on the Flare blockchain. Crypto analyst Angelica Saldaña broke the news, highlighting how XRPFi will open up new avenues for XRP holders. The platform will allow users to earn rewards, engage in lending and borrowing, and explore yield strategies, all while operating within the familiar XRP ecosystem. This is seen as a significant step in enhancing XRP’s real-world utility. A Game-Changer for XRP Holders For years, XRP holders had limited options beyond simply holding their tokens. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP lacked the tools to tap into the growing DeFi market. Flare Networks is changing this by introducing FXRP, a new version of XRP that can be used on the Flare blockchain. This innovation allows users to mint FXRP, enabling them to lend, borrow, and earn rewards without relinquishing ownership or relying on external parties. It’s a breakthrough that provides XRP holders with newfound freedom and security. Flare’s Bigger Vision for DeFi XRPFi is imminent!!

This comes amid positive news on the Ripple ETF front, albeit not what the XRP community anticipates. Bitcoin, alongside most of the market, had a quiet weekend, but prices started to fall on Monday morning. BTC dropped by a few grand from over $94,500 to under $93,000 before it recovered to the starting lines. Consequently, bitcoin and most alts sit at essentially the same levels as yesterday. In contrast, XRP dipped to $2.16 yesterday before it shot up to a multi-day peak of almost $2.3. Although it has retraced slightly since then, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency is still 5% up on the day, outperforming all top 25 alts. The most evident reason for this is the approval of three Ripple ETFs in the United States. ProShares got the green light to launch Ultra XRP ETF (which has 2x leverage), Short XRP ETF, and Ultra Short XRP ETF (-2x leverage again). ICYMI: ProShares has received SEC approval to launch three $XRP ETFs: Ultra $XRP ETF (2x leverage), Short $XRP ETF, and Ultra Short $XRP ETF (-2x leverage). These funds will track #XRP futures prices, offering traders opportunities for long and short positions. pic.twitter.com/VXzVyOgn9x — CryptoPotato Official (@Crypto_Potato) April 28, 2025 The products are similar to the leverage XRP ETFs released by Teucrium earlier this month. Although they are not the spot Ripple ETFs expected by the community, it seems that the most recent approvals have given XRP’s price a notable bump over the weekend and Monday morning. Popular crypto analysts believe the eventual approval of spot XRP ETFs will have a groundbreaking effect on the underlying asset’s price, with some shocking predictions setting targets of up to $100.

In a statement posted on X , Term Finance detailed the recovery efforts, noting that 223.197 ETH (approximately $400,000) was recaptured internally, while an additional 333 ETH (around $600,000) was secured through negotiations. The outstanding loss now stands at 362.03 ETH, valued at roughly $650,000 — a significant reduction from the initial impact of 918 ETH.

Just days earlier, Solana-based platform Loopscale suffered a $5.8 million exploit , while crypto exchange Bitget reported a $20 million loss after coordinated manipulation of a lesser-known token market. Bitget has announced legal action against eight accounts linked to the incident. Additionally, Impermax Finance fell victim to a flash loan attack over the weekend, resulting in losses exceeding $150,000, according to security firm TenArmor. The protocol confirmed the breach, promising a detailed post-mortem once investigations conclude. Recoveries in such cases remain inconsistent across the industry. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou recently disclosed that following a $1.4 billion hack in February, nearly 28% of the stolen funds had become untraceable after being laundered through mixers and peer-to-peer platforms. Only a fraction (3.84%) has been successfully frozen. Crypto Lost $1.6 Billion to Hacks in Q1 In the first three months of 2025, the crypto ecosystem lost a whopping $1,635,933,800 across 39 incidents, according to the blockchain security platform Immunefi . The report claimed, “Q1 2025 marks the worst quarter for hacks in the history of the crypto ecosystem.” Most of that was the result of only two hacks of two centralized exchanges. Phemex suffered a $69.1 million loss in January, while Bybit lost $1.46 billion in February. Subsequently, the total number of losses in the first quarter marks a 4.7x increase compared to Q1 2024 . At that time, hackers and fraudsters stole $348,251,217. Notably, experts assume that the infamous North Korean Lazarus Group is behind the two largest attacks. They stole $1.52 billion, which is 94% of total losses.

Sonic’s Evolution: 2000+ TPS, 0.7s Confirmation, Near-Zero Fees The Fantom Opera blockchain, initially recognized for its speed and throughput as a high-performance aDAG-based Layer 1 solution, encountered scalability limitations as its ecosystem expanded. Its traditional EVM architecture struggled with bloated state storage, slow node synchronization, and execution bottlenecks. To overcome these challenges without resorting to sharding or Layer 2 solutions, Fantom developed Sonic — a fundamental redesign engineered to deliver a significant performance leap. Sonic Labs, a new team led by CEO Michael Kong , CTO Andre Cronje (founder of Yearn Finance), and Chief Research Officer Bernhard Scholz , dedicated two and a half years to the redesign of Fantom’s virtual machine, storage, and consensus. They built Sonic, a new, independent EVM-compatible chain capable of processing over 2,000 TPS, achieving 0.7-second finality, and executing transactions at a cost of $0.0001 . It also improves storage efficiency by 90% and reduces node synchronization time from weeks to under two days. Technical Innovations Driving Sonic’s Performance Sonic’s enhanced performance is underpinned by three core technological advancements: SonicVM: A newly developed virtual machine fully compatible with the EVM, SonicVM optimizes computationally intensive operations like SHA3 hashing, pre-analyzes jump instructions, delivers significantly faster execution, and supports high throughput. SonicDB : Achieving nearly 90% data compression, SonicDB uses a layered storage strategy that splits the blockchain state into two databases: LiveDB for the current global state and ArchiveDB for historical blocks and states. This reduces node requirements and enhances network resilience through greater decentralization. Sonic Gateway : Functioning like an “L2-like” bridging solution to Ethereum, it uses a batch processing mechanism that strikes a balance between security and efficiency, enabling seamless two-way asset transfers and ecosystem access. Stablecoin Ecosystem: Nested Yield and Resilient Growth Defying market trends in 2025, Sonic’s on-chain Total Value Locked (TVL) surged by over 500%, with the total stablecoin supply surpassing $260 million . This growth is driven by sophisticated high-leverage yield mechanisms. Silo v2 Loop Lending: Use staked S tokens to borrow stablecoins, achieving up to 20x exposure to capture combined incentives alongside stable yield spreads. Euler + Rings Protocol Combo: Deposit USDC to mint scUSD, then use leverage to potentially achieve up to 10x yield, along with Sonic points and protocol rewards. Shadow DEX Liquidity Provision for Rewards : By facilitating trading activity, particularly with the S/stS pair on Shadow, users can earn up to 169% APY and a share of trading fees. Looking ahead, the ecosystem will incorporate Real World Asset (RWA) yields and off-chain payment solutions to create a sustainable and widely used stablecoin ecosystem backed by compliant assets and real-world applications. Conclusion: Sonic – Leading the Charge in DeFi 2.0 Sonic’s high performance, nested yields, and accessibility position it for rapid growth, with the potential to exceed $2B TVL and a multi-billion $S token market cap within a year. More importantly, Sonic is championing an “efficiency revolution” in blockchain design—prioritizing performance and capital efficiency to attract liquidity. The report identifies technical challenges, including the adaptive AMM’s reliance on external oracles, which introduces potential vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the inherent risks of high-leverage strategies in volatile markets necessitate the use of hedging instruments, such as short perpetual futures, to mitigate potential liquidations. From a broader view, Sonic is well-positioned to lead the expected 2025 DeFi resurgence. Its thriving stablecoin ecosystem boosts the value of both the $S token and the network. Even in a bear market, Sonic demonstrates the potential for DeFi to establish resilient “yield havens” through innovation and performance. With its nested yields, developer-focused incentives, and efficient infrastructure, Sonic provides a model for the industry. The integration of RWAs and payment tools could place Sonic as a critical bridge between on-chain yields and real-world utility, driving DeFi toward mass adoption For full report, please visit: https://square.htx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HTX-Research-Latest-Report-1-1.pdf About HTX Research HTX Research is the dedicated research arm of HTX Group, responsible for conducting in-depth analyses, producing comprehensive reports, and delivering expert evaluations across a broad spectrum of topics, including cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and emerging market trends.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-04-28 07:37:08

The hack, which resulted in the theft of Rs. 2,000 crore worth of crypto , left over 4.4 million users locked out of their accounts. This incident, and the court’s rejection of the petition, has highlighted the glaring gaps in India’s crypto regulations , leaving users vulnerable and raising questions about the country’s ability to protect digital asset holders. The WazirX Hack: A Blow to 4.4 Million Users On July 18, 2024, WazirX, one of India’s largest crypto exchanges , was targeted in a massive hack that saw a significant portion of user funds stolen. Despite the exchange’s promise to restore 85% of users’ funds by May 2025, many affected users are dissatisfied with the compensation plan. This led 54 users to file a petition with the Supreme Court, seeking intervention in the ongoing restructuring process happening in Singapore, and requesting a thorough investigation into the exchange’s fund mismanagement. Supreme Court’s Decision: A Setback for Users The Supreme Court, led by Justice B R Gavai and Justice Augustine Masih, dismissed the petition, citing the absence of clear crypto regulations in India . The ruling underscored the limitations of the current legal framework, leaving victims of crypto hacks, such as the WazirX incident, with little recourse in the Indian legal system. WazirX’s Restructuring Plan: Fund Recovery on the Horizon In response to the hack, WazirX management proposed a restructuring plan to the Singapore Court, promising to restore 85% of affected user funds by May 2025. The remaining 15% will be returned over the following 2-3 years, depending on the exchange’s recovery and future profits. While the restructuring plan has received user support, the Singapore court’s approval is still pending. WazirX Users Vote in Favor of the Recovery Plan Despite the legal hurdles, WazirX claims that more than 93% of users support the exchange’s restructuring proposal, following a vote conducted in partnership with legal firm Kroll. The Call for Crypto Regulation in India The WazirX case serves as a wake-up call for India, highlighting the urgent need for a clear and robust cryptocurrency regulatory framework. While countries like the U.S. have embraced pro-crypto policies , India’s regulatory stance remains largely outdated. The WazirX hack exposes how India’s failure to adopt progressive crypto laws leaves users at risk, preventing the sector from reaching its full potential. As the global crypto landscape continues to evolve, India risks falling behind if it does not address its regulatory shortcomings. The WazirX saga illustrates the challenges faced by users in a legal vacuum, emphasizing the need for stronger regulations to protect the growing crypto community in India. FAQs How does WazirX’s restructuring plan work for affected users? WazirX’s restructuring plan aims to restore 85% of the crypto portfolios for affected WazirX users by May 2025. The remaining 15% of the funds will be returned over the next 2-3 years, depending on the exchange’s recovery and future profits. This plan is part of the ongoing restructuring process being presented in the Singapore court. While WazirX claims over 93% of users support this proposal, the plan still awaits court approval. What steps are WazirX users required to take to benefit from the proposed 85% fund recovery in the restructuring plan? WazirX users need to stay updated on the restructuring process, accept the plan, and possibly verify their accounts to claim their share of the 85% fund recovery. Why is WazirX promising to restore only 85% of the users’ funds, and what happens to the remaining 15%? WazirX is restoring 85% due to financial constraints after the hack. The remaining 15% will be returned over 2-3 years, depending on the exchange’s future profits and recovery. How does WazirX plan to recover the remaining 15% of funds over the next 2-3 years for users affected by the hack? WazirX plans to recover the remaining 15% through future profits and successful financial recovery, returning the funds once the exchange is in a better financial position.",News|Exchange News,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 07:41:39

On May 1, approximately 74 million Sui ( SUI ) tokens, or 2.28% of the circulating supply, will be unlocked, according to data from Tokenomist. The pending release adds fresh selling pressure at a moment when demand has been heating up. So far, only 33% of the total SUI supply is unlocked. Meanwhile, Sui’s on-chain fundamentals have been strengthening . Total value locked on Sui-based protocols climbed 40% since the beginning of April, now sitting at $1.73 billion, as per DeFiLlama data . Stablecoin market cap on the network also jumped from $630 million to $880 million over the same period, while daily decentralized exchange volume has been hovering around $500 million. The network has handled over $3.6 billion in trading over the last seven days, lifting its monthly volume past $11 billion. With fresh supply about to hit the market, some traders may take profits after last week’s gains. However, others see the growing DeFi metrics as signs that Sui can absorb the new tokens without a downturn. You might also like: SUI or SEI: Which one will dominate the 2025 bull market?

With a relative strength index of 78, the asset appears to be overbought, signaling potential exhaustion in the short term. Momentum indicators are still in favor of buyers, and the moving average convergence/divergence is still in positive territory. Sui price analysis. Credit: crypto.news In addition, all estimated moving averages indicate a buy. If buying pressure holds and SUI stays above $3.60, it could attempt a move toward $4.00, a psychological level that may attract more momentum traders. On the negative side, SUI might retest support at $3.30 if selling pressure from the May 1 unlock starts to build. A deeper pullback might find further support around the $3.00 area, near the 10-day EMA. If the market smoothly absorbs the unlock, SUI may settle between $3.30 and $3.60 before establishing a new trend.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With crypto adoption at an all-time high, more investors are turning to crypto-backed loans to unlock liquidity without selling their assets. Table of Contents 1. Rocko 2. Aave 3. Unchained 4. Ledn 5. Nexo Conclusion As global crypto adoption accelerates, investors are increasingly seeking ways to access liquidity without selling their assets. Crypto-backed loans have surged in popularity, allowing crypto owners to use their crypto holdings as collateral to borrow funds. This approach enables investors to retain ownership of their crypto and avoid taxable events like selling while accessing liquidity for new investments, business expenses, major purchases, and more. To service the demand for crypto loans, an entire industry has emerged. Today, there are a variety of crypto loan platform offerings, each with different models, rates, and value propositions, complicating the decision process for many prospective borrowers. To simplify choosing the best crypto lending platform, here are the five top options for 2025. 1. Rocko Rocko is a simple-to-use, crypto-loan marketplace that aggregates the best rates and protocols across DeFi, offering a one-stop solution for securing competitive crypto-backed loans. Users can compare interest rates and easily borrow from top DeFi protocols like Aave and Morpho. Rocko’s design is simple to use for crypto users of all levels, ensuring anyone can get a loan in minutes and immediately receive the funds to their preferred exchange account. Rocko also offers helpful loan management tools such as alerts to monitor collateral value and a refinancing tool which allows borrowers to refinance their loan in one click. Rocko supports many major cryptos as collateral including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana , and more. Pros: Compare and access a variety of competitive interest rates. Non-custodial platform so borrowers keep control of their crypto. Compatible with any Ethereum wallet and accounts at centralized exchanges like Coinbase. No monthly minimum payments and no required repayment date. Cons: No fixed-rate loan options. Few tools for implementing highly levered strategies. 2. Aave Aave is one of the earliest DeFi lending protocols and remains one of the most established with many years of being battle tested. Aave allows for the supply and borrowing of a variety of crypto assets across many Ethereum-based networks. The protocol’s flexibility and significant depth of liquidity make it a popular platform for those with more technical familiarity and DeFi experience. Pros: Fully decentralized and open-source. Broad asset and network support. Features like flash loans and efficiency-mode borrowing. Cons: Difficult to use for less experienced users. Interest rates can fluctuate wildly. 3. Unchained Unchained focuses solely on Bitcoin financial services including Bitcoin-backed loans. While it’s a centralized lending platform, its multi-key structure sets it apart, requiring multiple parties to authorize any movement of collateral. This collaborative custody model appeals to those prioritizing control and transparency over BTC loan arrangements. Pros: Bitcoin-collateralized loans without rehypothecation. 2-of-3 multisig model can increase security. Collaborative custody for added transparency. Cons: No support for other crypto besides Bitcoin. Primarily tailored to institutional clients. Interest rates can be high relative to decentralized options. 4. Ledn Ledn is a crypto financial services firm that offers loans against Bitcoin and Ethereum using a third–party custodian, BitGo. Borrowers can choose whether their collateral is rehypothecated, which can reduce the interest rate they pay. Ledn is one of the first centralized crypto companies to complete a Proof-of-Reserves attestation which can provide some assurance to potential users. They also offer a Bitcoin-loan product that automatically purchases more Bitcoin with the proceeds, which may be appealing to Bitcoin owners looking to increase their exposure. Pros: Choice over rehypothecation of collateral. Completed Proof-of-Reserves attestation. Loan product that automatically purchases more Bitcoin. Cons: Interest rates can be high relative to decentralized options. High admin fees. 5. Nexo Nexo offers a broad custodial lending platform supporting a wide range of crypto assets. Loans are typically approved quickly, with no credit checks, appealing to those seeking immediate access to fiat or stablecoin liquidity. The platform emphasizes convenience but with the tradeoff of custodial trust and rehypothecation risk. Pros: Fast approval process. No credit score required. Wide selection of supported crypto assets. Cons: Collateral may be rehypothecated, increasing risk for borrowers. Service not available in certain jurisdictions such as the U.S. Conclusion While the crypto lending landscape is constantly evolving, these five crypto loan platforms top the list for the best crypto loan platforms of 2025. Each offers a different model and value proposition to borrowers and we encourage prospective users to research the options themselves and choose what makes most sense for them. Whether borrowers want a simple-to-use platform with access to many competitive rates, such as Rocko , or a centralized option with multi-sig institutional custody, such as Unchained, there’s an option for everyone.

According to an official Form N-1A filing , the new XRP ( XRP ) ETFs include ProShares’ Short XRP ETF, Ultra XRP ETF, and UltraShort XRP ETF . Each product comes with a different leverage, which lets traders choose between the three XRP-backed futures set to begin trading on April 30. The Ultra XRP ETF offers 2x leverage, while the Ultra Short XRP ETF boasts an inverse leverage of -2x. Lastly, the firm’s Short XRP ETF will also provide an inverse leverage of -1x. Future-based ETF products gives traders exposure to futures contracts that track the price movements of XRP through an index. Unlike a spot ETF which requires traders to buy XRP tokens, a futures XRP ETF would allow them to place bets on the price of XRP without having to directly hold the asset. Meanwhile, ProShares also has a separate filing to spot XRP ETFs that is still awaiting review from the SEC .

Earlier this month, on April 8, ETF issuer Teucrium became the first firm to receive U.S. SEC approval to bring their XRP ETF to the New York Stock Exchange. At press time, XRP has gone up by 4.86% in the past 24 hours of trading. Ripple’s token is currently trading hands at a price of $2.28 with a market cap of more than $133 billion. In the past day, the daily trading volume for XRP has gone up by 67.9% to $4.2 billion, indicating a rise in market activity. So far, the SEC has only granted approval for Teucrium and ProShares’ XRP ETF applications. Last month, the financial agency decided to postpone the decision on Grayscale’s XRP ETF application, stating they need more time to review the proposal. Institutional interest towards XRP ETFs has been growing rapidly in recent months. in large part due to the token’s inclusion in the Trump administration’s crypto reserve. Aside from Grayscale, other asset managers like Franklin Templeton, Canary Capital, WisdomTree, Bitwise, CoinShares, and 21Shares have also applied for institutional investment products associated with XRP.

Gold price has surged to a record high, while the top three US indices like the Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100, and S&P 500 are in the red. European equities have trounced their American rivals this year, with the Euro Stoxx 50 Index has jumped by 14%. This article examines where to invest $10,000 today for superior returns over the next few years. Bitcoin and BTC ETFs The first key area to invest and generate superior returns in the next few years is in the crypto market. While the Bitcoin price has dropped by 13% from its January high , it has performed better than stocks following the Liberation Day tariffs . Furthermore, spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net inflows of over $3 billion last week, indicating that the cryptocurrency is becoming a safe-haven asset. Furthermore, Bitcoin has a strong track record of outperforming the stock market. Besides, it has jumped from less than $1 in 2009 to $94,000 today. These gains have not been linear and the coin has experienced substantial drawdowns in this period. For example, it tumbled by over 33% from its highest point in March to its lowest level in August last year and then bounced back. Analysts are bullish on Bitcoin. Just last week, Ark Invest predicted that Bitcoin price will surge to $2.4 million by 2030. That would be a 2,426% surge from the current level, The most cost-effective and straightforward way to invest in Bitcoin is to purchase it directly from an exchange like Coinbase or Kraken. Still, when considering spot Bitcoin ETFs, the Grayscale Mini Bitcoin ETF (BTC) is the best one to invest in as it has a low expense ratio of 0.25%. China EV companies Last week, Tesla reported weak financial results. The numbers showed that its total sales dropped by 9% to $21.3 billion last quarter. Its adjusted EBITDA fell by 17% to $3.3 billion, while its net income plunged by 71%. These numbers showed that the company’s business was struggling as its deliveries in the United States, Europe, and China dived. Therefore, one area to invest $ 1,000 right now is in Chinese electric vehicle companies, as these firms are experiencing more growth this year. This includes companies like Nio, Li Auto, BYD, and XPeng. For example, Li Auto delivered 92,864 vehicles in the first quarter, representing a 15% annual growth. XPeng, a company that is also building flying cars , delivered 94,000 vehicles, a 330% annual increase. Nio delivered 42,094 vehicles in the first quarter, up by 40% from a year earlier. Other firms like BYD and Zeekr have also boosted their sales. China EVs are more innovative than their American counterparts. For example, BYD and CATL have just unveiled batteries that can charge in less than 5 minutes. Nasdaq 100 index The other contrarian area to invest $10,000 this year is in technology companies, especially through the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index. This is a contrarian call since the index remains in a correction after falling by over 10% from the highest level this year. There are also concerns that the artificial intelligence bubble has burst this year. However, history shows that the Nasdaq 100 index typically rebounds whenever it enters a correction. It recovered from the dot-com bubble, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) dip. The index is expected to rebound due to upcoming trade talks between the US and other countries, as well as potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This recovery will also boost other American indices like the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones. It also makes investing in the JEPQ ETF worthwhile, as it tracks the Nasdaq 100 index and offers superior returns.

Cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb earned more than 140 billion won (nearly $97.6 million) in extra fees by using unclear processes that misled users, The Maeil Business Newspaper reports , citing a South Korean lawmaker. Kim Jae-sup, a member of the People’s Power party, revealed that Bithumb earned 672.79 billion won in total fees between February 2023 and February 2024, referring to data submitted by the Financial Supervisory Service. During the period, Bithumb advertised a “lowest commission in Korea” of 0.04%. In reality, however, the average commission rate charged to actual users was 0.051%, Kim added. As a result, consumers faced an additional fee of about 140.91 billion won, the lawmaker emphasized. You might also like: Crypto exchange Bithumb to spin off investment arm ahead of potential Nasdaq listing Kim explained that Bithumb failed to properly notify users that they needed to register a coupon to receive the minimum fee rate. The South Korean lawmaker suggested that such a practice seems to be a typical dark pattern , a deceptive scheme where a user interface is carefully crafted to trick users into doing things they didn’t mean to. The lawmaker also highlighted that the extra fee burden was heavier on older users. “The damage to the middle-aged who may have difficulty recognizing or carrying out the coupon registration process is even more serious,” Kim said. The lawmaker urged regulators to step in, saying the Financial Services Commission and the Fair Trade Commission should take strong action to stop this kind of consumer deception. Bithumb successfully returned to profitability in 2024, with revenue increasing by 265.4% year-over-year. Per data from the Financial Supervisory Service’s electronic disclosure system, Bithumb posted an operating profit of 130.7 billion won (around $90.1 million) last year, marking a turnaround from losses as the exchange had recorded an operating loss of 14.8 billion won in 2023. Net profit for 2024 surged 565.8% year-over-year to 161.8 billion won (nearly $111.2 million).

According to a well-known venture capitalist, Chamath Palihapitiya , crypto acquisitions and public listings in the U.S. have already reached $8.2 billion across 88 transactions, tripling the total value seen in all of 2024. He has also highlighted five key trends driving this rapid growth. Companies Are Turning Treasuries Into Bitcoin Investments First, we’re seeing a wave of Bitcoin treasury moves. Companies like Twenty One Capital are following in the footsteps of MicroStrategy by turning their corporate treasuries into Bitcoin investment vehicles. Their business model is simple, buy Bitcoin, hold it, and ride the wave of crypto appreciation. Wall Street Firms Moving Into Crypto Second, traditional finance firms are making serious moves into crypto infrastructure. A major example is DTCC’s acquisition of Securrency. This deal allows Wall Street firms to offer crypto services alongside traditional assets, giving investors the best of both worlds on a single platform. Institutions Are Building Secure Platforms Third, institutions are stepping up their crypto game. Ripple’s purchase of Metaco shows the push to build platforms that can securely manage digital assets while meeting the strict compliance needs of big players like banks and asset managers. Crypto Exchanges Merge for Growth Fourth, crypto exchanges are consolidating. Kraken’s $1.5 billion purchase of futures broker NinjaTrader is a major step in blending digital and traditional trading. It’s all about making it easy for users to move between Bitcoin, stocks, and more without the usual hassle. Finally, even blockchain projects are merging. Projects like Fetch, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET are combining forces to speed up growth, expand their communities, and boost the power of their tokens. However, all of these moves together are building a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance. If this trend continues, 2025 might be the year crypto truly becomes part of the everyday financial world. Crypto Market Outlook After struggling for two months, the crypto market is finally showing some strength. The total market cap is now around $3.03 trillion . Leading the way, Bitcoin has just hit $95,000 after a long period of consolidation. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also moving up, trading at $1,809 with a 10% gain over the week. Other altcoins like XRP, Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin have also gone up by 8% to 15% this week. What is driving the $8.2 billion in crypto acquisitions? The rapid growth of Bitcoin treasury investments, Wall Street firms entering crypto, and major mergers in crypto exchanges and blockchain projects are driving the surge in acquisitions. How are companies turning their treasuries into Bitcoin investments? Companies like Twenty One Capital are following MicroStrategy’s model by buying Bitcoin and holding it as part of their corporate treasury to ride the wave of crypto appreciation.",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 07:55:13

He called the prohibition “particularly egregious” as the vast majority of crypto activity does not involve securities. In a letter to the acting director of the US Office of Government Ethics (OGE), Grewal stressed that SEC staff need to use crypto and understand the technology before making recommendations for regulatory proposals. He noted that “potential conflicts” in removing the ban can easily be managed. I never understood why @SECGov employees are barred from holding or using digital assets. Any potential conflicts can easily be managed. So I wrote to ask that @OfficeGovEthics rescind and update Legal Advisory 22-04 and for the Crypto Task Force to issue waivers—now. pic.twitter.com/vdG9veuqPY — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) April 25, 2025 “To regulate technology, you need to understand it. To understand technology, you need to use it,” he wrote. In January, President Trump signed an executive order to “establish regulatory clarity for digital financial technology.” He had ordered a Working Group, comprising key leads, including the SEC staff, to submit a report within 180 days, recommending crypto regulatory and legislative proposals . Coinbase’s Grewal noted that almost half of the given time is already over. Further, he emphasized the need for the SEC staff to use the technology, on which they are making recommendations. Grewal Writes to Newly Sworn-In SEC Chair Paul Atkins Additionally, in a separate letter to the new Securities and Exchange Commission chair , Paul Atkins, he said that the ban on SEC employees from holding crypto is an “impediment to the Task Force’s ability” to aid in the right crypto regulatory recommendations. “This needs to be corrected immediately,” he wrote in the letter . Grewal added that Coinbase has pressed the OGE to rescind and update Legal Advisory 22-04. The Legal Advisory , released in 2022, states, “an SEC employee who holds any amount of a cryptocurrency or stablecoin may not participate in a particular matter.” He also said that this rule is “misguided and damaging to [crypto] regulatory progress.” In the letter, Grewal told Atkins that the Commission should clarify that certain crypto holdings would not have “a direct and predictable effect on the value of their crypto or stablecoins.” Most Crypto Activities are Not Securities: Coinbase CLO Further, he added that the Commission must continuously adapt and build new expertise, given the rapid rise in crypto. Besides, he noted that most crypto activities are not securities, highlighting the recent SEC reversals on crypto enforcement actions. “The technology itself is not a security, and securities regulators’ engagements with the technology does not inherently entail conflicts or concerns.” The post Coinbase CLO Urges to Rescind Prohibition on SEC Staff Holding Crypto appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Coinbase|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-28 07:55:43

CSPR, the native token of the Casper Network, shot up to an intraday high of $0.023 on April 28, its highest point since Dec. 9 last year. From its lowest level this year, the token has now surged more than 180%. Its market cap climbed to around $215 million, while daily trading volume exploded by nearly 2,500% from the previous day, hovering around $115 million. The surge coincided with a sharp increase in futures open interest, which hit a 5-month high of $6.64 million, way up from about $836k just a month ago, per data from CoinGlass. The simultaneous rise in price and open interest typically signals strengthening bullish sentiment. Funding rates have also stayed positive for the last six days, meaning traders going long are paying less than those betting against the token, a clear bullish signal. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows more holders are moving their tokens off exchanges. In just the past two days, over $1.7 million worth of CSPR left trading platforms. Exchange outflows are typically a bullish sign, as they suggest investors are moving their tokens into self-custody wallets, reducing immediate sell pressure. You might also like: Bitcoin dips below $94,000 as ETFs record $3b weekly inflow CSPR’s gains today can be primarily attributed to a surge in investor interest ahead of its Casper 2.0 upgrade, scheduled for May 6. This update aims to boost the network’s speed, security, and developer experience. The team called it “a leap forward for the Casper Network and a defining step toward bridging the real-world economy with Web3” in an April 22 post on X. Moreover, community sentiment has been buoyed by broader changes within the project’s leadership . According to a community member, Nick, the team associated with past delays and unmet promises has been replaced. He believes that the network is under stronger management, with renewed focus and execution, following positive impressions from interviews conducted late last year. The crypto community appears bullish on CSPR, with CoinMarketCap’s social sentiment metric showing 92% of traders expecting short-term gains while its social sentiment has flipped positive. Growing traction among investors has also pushed the altcoin to trend on Google. CSPR price analysis On the 1-day USDT chart, CSPR recently broke out of a descending parallel channel it had been stuck in for the past five months. Breaking out of a pattern like this usually signals a trend reversal, and a fresh move higher could be in the cards. CSPR price, MACD and Aroon chart — April 28 | Source: cry p to.news The MACD lines have also turned upward, showing growing bullish momentum. On top of that, the Aroon Up is at 100% while the Aroon Down sits at 0%, showing clear dominance by buyers. Hence, CSPR looks poised to rally toward $0.024, its December high and a key resistance it failed to break twice in the second half of 2024. The target is about 45% above its current price. CSPR RSI chart — April 28 | Source: crypto.news However, the RSI has stayed in overbought territory for the past two days, suggesting the token could be due for a short-term cooling period before its next leg higher. At press time, Casper Network ( CSPR ) was trading at $0.016 per coin.

Dogecoin Targets $10 Cycle Peak Potts’ chart is anchored by a rising, two-point regression channel whose lower rail began at Dogecoin’s 2015–2016 base near $0.0001 and now sits just under $0.12. The upper rail, which has acted as resistance in every prior mania phase, currently extrapolates to roughly $69.42 by late 2025—the level highlighted in red where Potts places the next speculative blow-off. Inside that corridor, price action forms three successive rounded bottoms, each capped by a descending yellow resistance line and undergirded by a red basing arc. The geometry alone implies mounting compression: the present triangle apex, lying at $0.17, is almost exactly where DOGE has been coiling for months. Related Reading: Before Dogecoin Hits $1, This Needs To Happen — Analyst Explains The engine driving the forecast is a proprietary dual-wave oscillator rendered as a thicker turquoise wave and a swifter yellow counterpart. Potts explains that “cycle tops have historically printed in two ways: an early top when the yellow wave dips below the green, and a late top when the yellow wave plunges under the horizontal red line at –0.00013.” Vertical purple bars mark every such event on the price chart. According to his archival reconstruction, the oscillator flashed a late top in February 2014, painted twin peaks in the 2017–2018 run, and signalled only an early top in May 2021 when DOGE notched its record $0.739 high. The early-cycle signal appeared on March 6 this year—leaving an expected late-cycle breach still on the table. “If this pattern holds,” Potts writes, “a cycle top is likely around the week of October 27th,” a moment the chart underscores with a final purple bar and a white arrow labelled “LATE TOP.” Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $3? Analyst Weighs In That date dovetails with the oscillator’s predicted descent below the red threshold (–0.00013) and with the upper channel, which will then hover in the $60–70 range. Potts, however, grounds expectations by flagging $10 as a psychologically resonant milestone—the first round number one logarithmic order higher than the 2021 summit. Historical symmetry strengthens the call. In both earlier cycles, Dogecoin’s break of the yellow down-sloping lid unleashed vertical rallies that did not culminate until the upper white boundary was tagged. The geometry implies a similar stair-step may be at hand: a weekly close above the current yellow resistance, now parked just below $0.20, would enable a decisive push towards the upper rail. Potts remarks that “each cycle has touched the upper white curved trendline,” pointing to the channel’s remarkable predictive persistence. Whether the meme coin can repeat its parabolic history will depend on extrinsic factors—Bitcoin’s own halving cadence, global liquidity, and social-media-driven hype—but the oscillator’s track record is unblemished. As Potts puts it, “this indicator has accurately identified all cycle tops for DOGECOIN,” and until it proves otherwise traders will be watching the –0.00013 trigger and the integrity of the channel’s lower rail for confirmation of the next explosive rally for Dogecoin price. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.18.

Today, that token may be MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . As more traders and investors scan the market for the next serious opportunity, this emerging project is capturing the attention of Bitcoin and Solana holders alike. Why? Because the structure, sentiment, and timing are aligning. The upside looks real—and the window to act may be narrow. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Turning Heads at the Right Moment This project didn’t rise on hype. It rose on traction. MAGACOINFINANCE has shown what early-stage execution is supposed to look like: consistent rollouts, measurable growth in user wallets, and social momentum that isn’t paid for—it’s earned. The pre-sale excitement isn’t manufactured. It’s happening because traders are seeing the same indicators repeat: wallet tracking spikes, developer consistency, and organic mentions increasing across top investor forums. And now, the big question is echoing everywhere: Is this the one everyone will wish they bought early?

The asset is attracting smart money and whales, following the rapid price recovery in the past week. Official Trump (TRUMP) is becoming a leader among meme tokens, by attracting higher smart money inflows. Based on Nansen wallet data, TRUMP attracted $684K in netflows from smart money wallets. TRUMP is going through its most active trading period since January 20, right after the token’s launch. In the past week, trading volumes recovered between $1.5B and $3B in 24 hours. After renewed trader interest, TRUMP returned to $14.64, briefly peaking above $15.50. TRUMP leads meme token recovery TRUMP became the fourth-largest meme token by market capitalization, also becoming the top Solana meme. In the past week, the token rallied by more than 84%, after the invitation for a Trump dinner dedicated to token holders. The competition to acquire more TRUMP still drives whale buying and accumulation in privately held wallets. One whale withdrew 190,987 TRUMP from a Binance hot wallet, presumably to improve their position on the owners’ leaderboard. Another large-scale holder withdrew 92.46K TRUMP in the past day, adding it to a portfolio of Solana assets. The whale is also a holder of Jupiter JLP tokens, signaling deeper involvement with the Solana ecosystem. A newly registered HTX cold wallet is also part of the TRUMP owners leaderboard. In the past day, the wallet added another 150K TRUMP. The wallet has been tagged as belonging to Justin Sun, the founder of TRON and supporter of Trump’s crypto projects. Other whales have been competing to climb the unofficial leaderboard. Most of the TRUMP buyers include prominent influencers and Solana ecosystem participants. The cutoff ownership is at 109,409.199 TRUMP. Recently, one TRUMP whale sold $300K in FARTCOIN to increase their leaderboard influence. The whale, known as boop, has already taken up to $1.75M in profits from TRUMP, and is now holding the remainder for leaderboard advantage and future rallies. Some of the recent buyers will probably not be eligible to attend the Trump dinner, even after buying more coins. The acquisition may be a form of speculation, driven by the token’s hype. In the past days, TRUMP has been highly active, increasing interactions with the Robinhood wallet, and ranking #6 based on Bubblemaps data. Traders start discounting TRUMP rally TRUMP remains highly active, but there are signs traders are preparing to discount the rally. The top TRUMP trader has been selling to realize more profits from the recent rally. One of the top TRUMP whales sold into the rally, realizing additional gains. | Source: DexScreener The token’s price action managed to compensate the start of team unlocks, with enough buyers to absorb the newly unlocked tokens. Other whales are making riskier bets that TRUMP will break down from its local highs. One whale is shorting TRUMP on the perpetual DEX Hyperliquid, with a liquidation price of $20.57 . The wallet started shorting TRUMP with 2X leverage at $14.73, and is still holding the position. On centralized exchanges, TRUMP still sees a domination of long positions, as traders are cautious about shorting a volatile asset. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The Layer-2s will drain all the value, and users will migrate elsewhere, eventually getting eclipsed by Bitcoin,” said Charles Hoskinson. Vitalik Buterin’s Layer-Zero Update Buterin responded directly to Hoskinson’s comments, which predicted Ethereum’s collapse within 15 years if it continued relying heavily on Layer-2 solutions. In a bid to address these scalability challenges, Buterin unveiled an exciting Layer-Zero upgrade. This proposal suggests transitioning Ethereum from the traditional Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to a more efficient zkVM system, based on RISC-V standards. The upgrade promises major improvements, including up to 832 times fewer cycles than the current EVM and a 95.7% reduction in proving cycles. These advancements are expected to increase throughput by 30 times through GPU acceleration, significantly improving the network’s efficiency. Plus, proof compression could shrink from 346MB to just 1.5MB, creating a much more streamlined system. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Charles Hoskinson Confirms XRP Integration and Midnight Airdrop for Holders , A Path to Ethereum’s Long-Term Growth However, this Layer-Zero update could potentially reshape Ethereum’s scalability, offering a new path forward that doesn’t rely on Layer-2 solutions.

The Layer-Zero upgrade is a proposal to transition Ethereum’s base layer to a zkVM system, improving scalability and reducing transaction costs by enhancing the Ethereum Virtual Machine’s efficiency. Why does Charles Hoskinson believe Ethereum will not survive in the next 10-15 years? Hoskinson argues that Ethereum’s reliance on Layer-2 solutions will drain its value, causing users to migrate to other platforms, ultimately resulting in Ethereum being eclipsed by Bitcoin. What is the difference between Layer-2 solutions and the Layer-Zero upgrade proposed by Buterin? Layer-2 solutions operate off Ethereum’s base layer to enhance scalability, while Layer-Zero aims to improve Ethereum’s base layer itself, offering greater efficiency and reducing dependence on external solutions.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|FORKS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 08:08:28
43895321,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65367,1745827868,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Says XRP Big Breakout Is Coming Soon,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-xrp-big-breakout-is-coming-soon/,"Cryptocurrency analyst and influencer Amonyx has once again emphasized his bullish stance on XRP, sharing a detailed technical chart on the social media platform X. The chart highlights strong similarities between XRP’s previous historical breakout and its current market structure, suggesting another significant upward movement may be approaching. The big breakout is coming soon. #XRP pic.twitter.com/HVWSio2rVQ — Amonyx (@amonbuy) April 25, 2025 Historical Accumulation Zone Mirrors Current Price Action In a prior statement reported by Times Tabloid , Amonyx posted, “The big breakout is coming soon. #XRP.” His latest analysis builds on this perspective by providing a visual representation of XRP’s market cycles. The chart he shared displays a triangular consolidation pattern that formed before XRP’s past explosive rally. Amonyx annotated the earlier accumulation zone with a yellow circle, noting the price compression that ultimately led to a breakout. He compared this historical structure directly to XRP’s current chart, implying that the same technical pattern is unfolding again. “Buying Under $20 Is a Blessing” — Amonyx Amonyx further emphasized the opportunity he believes investors have, stating, “Buying $XRP under $20 is a blessing from above.” This comment underscores his view that XRP remains undervalued at present levels and that its price may significantly increase. On the chart, XRP is trading just above $2, well below the $20 threshold he referenced. The setup indicates a gradual narrowing of the price range within a triangle formation, typically viewed by technical analysts as a precursor to a breakout when accompanied by historical precedent. Long-Term Targets Highlighted on Chart The technical chart presented by Amonyx shows key support and resistance levels, with a target zone drawn above the $20 range and potentially even higher, near $34.7850. This level is marked at the top of the chart as a possible long-term target, reinforcing the scale of the bullish movement he anticipates. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, the chart visually tracks a massive historical decline of approximately 90% after the previous peak, highlighting the cyclical nature of XRP’s price movements and suggesting that another positive cycle could be underway. Important dates are also highlighted on the chart, including long-term projections into 2028 and beyond, indicating that Amonyx views XRP’s potential breakout not just as a short-term event but as part of a broader and extended market cycle. The timeline suggests that while the breakout could happen soon, the full extent of XRP’s appreciation may unfold over several years. Technical Evidence Reinforces Market Expectations Amonyx’s analysis adds to the ongoing sentiment among XRP supporters who argue that XRP’s historical patterns support the case for an eventual strong price recovery.

Market watchers are now focused on whether these gains will persist or fade. This article delves into the factors driving their recent performance and examines whether these coins are poised for further growth or at risk of cooling off. FET Price Trends: Short-Term Surge Amid Long-Term Setbacks FET gained 42.91% in a week and 44.99% over the month, yet it faced a 37.76% drop over the past six months. The recent upswing shows renewed investor interest and momentum, but the half-year decline points to caution amid volatility. Price movements indicate energetic buying in the short term, while longer-term bearish concerns persist. Strong rallies can occur, but previous significant drops highlight underlying issues. Current prices range between $0.32 and $0.68, with support near $0.19 and resistance around $0.91. Bulls are active within these levels, but an overbought RSI of nearly 79 suggests caution. Trading ideas involve watching for a bounce at support and a potential breakout above $0.91, while remaining alert to bear reversals if prices move lower. Toncoin Price Volatility: Mixed Trends and Key Support Zones Toncoin price dropped 18.33% in the last month and fell 34.08% over six months, with an 11.35% surge over the past week indicating brief recoveries amid overall declines. Recent moves highlight a volatile market experience characterized by sharp dips followed by short-lived rallies that offer little sign of sustained momentum. Current trading ranges sit between $2.92 and $4.73, with a nearby support level at $1.73 and resistance at $5.35, while $7.16 poses a secondary resistance. Bulls and bears both hold sway, with no clear trend in place. Trading within these levels may offer opportunities for cautious entry or exit based on movements around the key support and resistance areas. Conclusion FET and TON have shown significant gains recently. Both coins have strong backing and potential for growth. Their continued uptrend depends on market conditions and investor sentiment. If the positive momentum continues, FET and TON could see further price increases. However, if interest wanes, they might lose steam. Observing market trends and news will be key to understanding their future performance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While ETH is trying to find a way to rise after a series of difficult days, a new offer has arrived for Etheruem. The new Ethereum proposal proposes a dynamic structure to balance application revenue and fair fee extraction. Two members of the Ethereum community, Kevin Owocki and Devansh Mehta, have proposed a new Ethereum fee structure that aims to balance revenue and fee generation for application developers. The proposal suggests using a square root formula that proportionally reduces the percentage of fees as the fund capital allocated to a particular project grows. Owocki and Metha noted that if a particular app’s funding pool exceeds the $10 million level, fees will be capped at 1%. The duo added that this method will allow small app developers to develop decentralized applications without paying excessive fees, and that fees will be limited as developers scale their applications, encouraging project and fund growth. Owocki and Mehta’s proposal to strike a balance between revenue generation and profitability among Ethereum application developers comes at a time when Ethereum is lagging behind rivals like Solana (SOL). According to analytics platform Santiment, Ethereum fees fell to a five-year low in April 2025 due to low activity on the Ethereum base layer, resulting from reduced demand for smart contract transactions such as decentralized finance. The Solana network also had more developers than the Ethereum network in 2024. According to the data, SOL added 7,625 new developers compared to Ethereum’s 6,456 new developers. *This is not investment advice.

Recent developments—including El Salvador’s continued Bitcoin accumulation, Grayscale’s ETF push, and Michael Saylor hinting at a major new purchase—are reinforcing optimism across the market. Coupled with nearly $3 billion in fresh U.S. Bitcoin ETF inflows last week, Bitcoin appears well-positioned for a breakout. El Salvador Adds Bitcoin Despite IMF Constraints In a development boosting Bitcoin sentiment, El Salvador quietly added seven more Bitcoin worth over $650,000, according to its Bitcoin Office. This move comes despite the nation’s $1.4 billion IMF loan deal, which technically restricts further official BTC purchases. Experts suggest the government may be acquiring Bitcoin indirectly to navigate IMF terms while maintaining its crypto-friendly stance.

Though the push focuses on ETH, broader acceptance of crypto financial products would likely spill over positively into Bitcoin, enhancing institutional credibility. Adding to the bullish momentum, Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, hinted at another massive Bitcoin buy —potentially between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion. Big news in the crypto world! Michael Saylor hints at another major $BTC purchase as whales stack aggressively. With large institutions leading the charge, it looks like Bitcoin's momentum is building! #Bitcoin #CryptoNews #Mercex #MercexNews — Mercex (@mercex_io) April 27, 2025 MicroStrategy already holds over 538,200 BTC (valued around $50.5 billion). April also saw whale wallets holding over $1 million in Bitcoin surge from 124,000 to 137,600, reflecting aggressive accumulation below $100K. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs further reinforced the trend, recording nearly $3 billion in net inflows last week—the second-highest since launch. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Bulls Target $95,848 Breakout Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is rebounding sharply after defending critical support at $92,863, with the 50 EMA ($93,623) acting as dynamic support. MACD indicators are nearing a bullish crossover, suggesting buyers are regaining control. For beginners, this pattern is called a “trendline defense”—where price respects rising support, often leading to higher moves. If Bitcoin breaks above $95,848, it could clear a path toward $97,569 and possibly $99,420. Conversely, slipping below $93,600 could expose Bitcoin to a retest of $92,863. Trade Setup: Buy breakout: Above $95,848 Targets: $97,569 and $99,420 Support levels: $93,623 and $92,863 Stop-loss: Below $92,800 Patience remains crucial—waiting for a confirmed breakout can help avoid getting caught in false moves. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5M Milestone as 81% Yield Boosts Staking Demand Investor momentum behind BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) remains strong, with the Ethereum-based project officially surpassing the $5 million mark in its ongoing presale. As of today, $5.05 million has been raised out of a $5.74 million target, signaling rising urgency among buyers as the next price jump approaches. The current token price stands at $0.00248, offering a limited window before another repricing. High-Yield Staking with Flexible Access BTCBULL continues to set itself apart from typical meme assets by focusing on sustainable utility. The project’s staking program offers an estimated 81% annual yield, complemented by Bitcoin-backed distribution rewards. Crucially, users retain full liquidity with the ability to unstake anytime—no mandatory lockup periods or penalties. Latest Staking Snapshot: Total Tokens Staked: 1,293,025,857 BTCBULL Estimated Annual Yield: 81% APY Unstaking: Available at any time This flexible structure appeals to both yield hunters and investors seeking upside potential without giving up liquidity. Presale Snapshot: Final Stretch Before Repricing With less than $683,000 left before the next price adjustment, BTCBULL’s presale is rapidly entering its final stages at the current rate. Investors are securing positions before the project’s valuation steps higher. Presale Metrics (Updated): Token Price: $0.00248 USDT Raised: $5,058,002.58 out of $5,741,234 target BTCBULL combines an aggressive yield model with meme-token upside, carving out a niche for investors looking for more than just speculative trading. As the remaining funding gap narrows, the next price increase could arrive imminently—rewarding early movers in the process.

At the same time, Cardano (ADA) seems poised for a significant price jump towards $1. This article dives into whether these coins are primed for growth, sparking curiosity about potential opportunities for keen investors. XRP Price Trends: Weekly Gains Amid Six-Month Surge The past month XRP shows a drop of 5.27% following a robust six-month surge of 331.66%, indicating a volatile yet resilient performance. Weekly gains of 8.08% contribute to a mixed chart, with the coin experiencing minor retracements amid broader upward momentum. Price fluctuations have been significant, marking notable changes over differing timeframes. The current price sits between $1.66 and $2.77, with resistance levels at $3.45 and $4.56 and support near $1.23 and $0.11. The RSI at 56.16 indicates mild bullish strength, while low oscillators suggest neither bears nor bulls firmly dominate. Trading within these key levels could favor short-term buys on breakouts and positions near support levels. Cardano ADA Positioned for Bullish Momentum with Key Support Levels Strong performance over the past half-year with a 114.41% gain contrasts with a steady month where there was no change. The numbers portray Cardano as having been gaining momentum over a longer period while holding relatively stable in the shorter term. Recent data indicates solid 6-month strength alongside modest short-term consolidation. Current trading shows price oscillating between $0.47 and $1.02, with immediate support at $0.27 and resistance at $1.37. There is no clear trend dominance yet, with slight bullish signals from momentum indicators. Traders might consider buying near support and monitoring resistance levels for further direction. Conclusion XRP shows signs of breaking higher due to a wedge pattern and increasing volume. ADA also appears poised for a significant increase, targeting the $1 mark. Both cryptocurrencies present opportunities for growth. Factors like established patterns and rising interest suggest that these assets may perform well in the near future. An informed decision could involve considering a long position on XRP and ADA as the market trends appear favorable. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

There is a list of use cases, growing daily, that show where Web3 technology is uniquely capable of solving problems that were considered impossible just a few years ago. Whether it is transparency, secure communications, distributed systems, or a community-driven governance, Web3 can accomplish more and more as the sea of developers and creatives uncover new uses and bring them to market. All of this is very optimistic and exciting, but it only happens if the Web3 infrastructure is solid. And one of the more critical areas to make or break the Web3 infrastructure is RPC functionality. RPC (Remote Procedure Call) nodes are a specialized asset within the Web3 ecosystem, acting as a server that takes in client requests and successfully executes them on a blockchain. They handle that crucial connection between dApps and the underlying blockchain, and the RPC infrastructure quality is an indication of the entire system’s quality. Unless you are in the RPC industry it’s not something you focus on, except when the system breaks down, can’t scale, or creates unacceptable errors/delays. Think of it like your neighborhood water or electricity. If you aren’t thinking about it, things are probably working well. If things are broken, it’s probably all you can think about. Within the industry are many different node providers, but because it is infrastructure focused, the larger players have traditionally had an edge as they can gain efficiencies that small and mid-sized node providers can’t. Web3 continues to upend traditional models, however, and by developing incredibly scalable and efficient digital infrastructure, the dominant advantage doesn’t always have to be which competitor has the most capital or reach. dRPC has gained more and more attention among Web3 players with its PAYG RPC platform, which is now considered an industry benchmark and is being replicated by some of the major blockchain players. The reason this model is so potent is that it creates scalability advantages for node providers no matter their size or reach, and based on the current roadmap has plans to unveil even more capabilities that providers will be able to use to level the playing field. Let’s focus on a few of these features from the perspective of small to mid-sized node providers to see just how much leverage the “little guy” can gain through these Web3 infrastructure innovations. Visibility and “Time to Correct Action” For any business, Web3 or otherwise, there is one metric that should be focused on as much as profit, speed, or quality. Summed up, this metric is “time to correct action.” This means that a given business, whether a single person operation or a global leader, should be working to reduce the time it takes to identify a needed action, bring that issue to the attention of the person who needs to know, interprets what the issue is into the action needed to solve it, and communicates that action to the person who can accomplish it. This is both a simple and obvious thing to do, but it often gets lost in the thousands of details happening within a business. Successful businesses seek to have an almost god-like awareness of their operations, know if anything goes wrong (ideally, they can predict before something goes wrong), and understand which action, lever, button, knob, etc. to adjust to solve the problem. For both physical businesses and digital platforms, the ability to have this god-like knowledge is more efficiently presented in dashboard format. The term “dashboard” is incredibly broad because it can represent a whiteboard that is manually updated once a day, or it can represent the innermost workings of a complex system, leading users efficiently to that minimum “time to correct action” metric that is so crucial for success. On the Web3 side, dRPC’s success with clients big and small focuses on leveling the playing field by understanding what information is needed and how clients can interact with it. Effectively, it allows a small team with this god-like knowledge of their node service to understand exactly what is happening, what might happen, and what to do about it. Called NodeHaus, the comprehensive dashboard provides in-depth visibility, control, and scalability for multi-provider RPC infrastructure. What maximizes the “time to correct action”, however, is an intuitive UX, actionable insights, and the robust analytics that can lead a user from problem to solution in minimum time. dRPC clients have had very positive reactions to the dashboard and are clamoring for more. This type of leverage represents the new standard, where those who are successful make the most of it, and those who fail didn’t adopt it quickly enough. It won’t be long before competitors are working to imitate the dashboard the way they have attempted to replicate the larger PAYG RPC model. Leveraging the Power of AI Along with visibility, insight, and “time to correct action”, is the ability to move from reactive to preventative measures. Monitoring your processes and acting quickly is important, and with unexpected issues this is the ideal strategy. However, the natural progression from process monitoring is process control. In other words, those god-like powers of observing what is happening start to extend outward to the near future. By having a clear picture of what is likely to happen, you can effectively change the future and prevent issues before they begin. While likely not the only player doing this, dRPC is also working to empower the small and mid-size providers through this type of “crystal ball” prediction. Instead of mystic powers, however, the best practice is employing AI predictive capabilities, combined with intelligent responses. This is upcoming for dRPC and will very probably see imitations as well from other players in the market. However, the ability to pull the right data and understand it makes a huge difference, and the architecture needed for a strong dashboard is undoubtedly going to be used here as well. The AI platform will act as an intuitive load balancer, preventing many of the issues before they have a chance to cause issues. dRPC has announced that the balancer will be open-source, and will allow users to scale their RPC infrastructure autonomously, on their infrastructure, for free. The ability to eliminate a single point of failure that would occur on a third-party is huge, especially for those small and mid-size providers. Optimizing your RPC infra just got easier. ✅We’ve rolled out updated pricing + a new calculator to estimate your potential savings with dRPC.Run the numbers ➡️ https://t.co/6ZZ8iZQQ4i pic.twitter.com/aqRekMYrVw — dRPC // All data from any blockchain in one place (@dRPCorg) March 28, 2025 Looking Ahead While technology continues to barrel forward, Web3 seems to have a unique ability to move fast and innovate with incredible results. Using very efficient development and service infrastructure, Web3’s leading platforms like dRPC have not just created new products, they have effectively supercharged players big and small across the industry. It’s these types of innovations that will continue to accelerate Web3’s progress faster than any other industry before it. At this rate, it should be very exciting to see what Web3 is capable of even a year or two from now. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

One area that’s been gaining significant traction is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), particularly Tokenized U.S. Treasurys . While this market is still relatively young, recent data highlights a striking concentration: just six funds currently hold a staggering 88% of the total assets in this burgeoning sector. This isn’t just a statistic; it reveals a lot about the current landscape and the major players shaping the future of finance. Understanding the Rise of Tokenized U.S. Treasurys Before diving into who holds the lion’s share, let’s quickly touch upon what Tokenized U.S. Treasurys are. Essentially, they are digital tokens issued on a blockchain that represent ownership or a claim on traditional U.S. Treasury bonds or bills. This process leverages blockchain technology to bring the benefits of traditional, stable assets into the digital asset ecosystem. Think of it as bridging the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). The appeal is clear: investors in the digital asset space can access the safety and yield typically associated with U.S. government debt, often considered one of the safest investments globally, without necessarily leaving the blockchain environment. This opens up new possibilities for portfolio diversification and yield generation within the digital asset landscape. Who Holds the Majority? The Dominant Players in Tokenized Assets According to data from RWA.xyz, as cited by Cointelegraph, the concentration in this market is undeniable. Six specific funds stand out, controlling the vast majority of Tokenized U.S. Treasurys . This level of concentration isn’t necessarily unusual for a nascent market, especially one involving large financial institutions, but it’s certainly noteworthy. Here are the key players leading the charge: BlackRock’s BUIDL: Leading the pack by a significant margin, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund holds approximately $2.5 billion in assets. BlackRock’s entry into this space signals a major endorsement from a traditional finance giant, attracting significant capital and attention. Franklin Templeton’s BENJI: Another major asset manager, Franklin Templeton, is a key player with its BENJI fund, holding around $707 million. Superstate’s USTB: Superstate also holds a substantial position with its USTB fund, accounting for roughly $661 million. Ondo’s USDY: Ondo Finance is a prominent name in the RWA space, and their USDY tokenized note holds about $586 million. Circle’s USYC: Known primarily for its USDC stablecoin, Circle also offers a tokenized Treasury product, USYC, with assets around $487 million. Ondo’s OUSG: Ondo appears again with its OUSG fund, holding approximately $424 million, further cementing its position in the tokenized RWA market. Combined, these six funds represent a significant portion of the total market capitalization for Tokenized U.S. Treasurys , illustrating that while the market is growing, it is currently dominated by a few key issuers. Why This Concentration in the RWA Market? The high concentration among a few funds can be attributed to several factors: Institutional First Movers: Large financial institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have the brand recognition, infrastructure, and capital to launch such products at scale, attracting significant initial investment. Regulatory Navigation: Tokenizing securities involves navigating complex regulatory landscapes. Larger, established players are often better equipped to handle these challenges. Liquidity Aggregation: Centralizing assets within larger funds can potentially offer better liquidity for investors compared to a highly fragmented market. Investor Trust: Investors, especially institutions exploring Digital Assets , may initially prefer to allocate capital to products offered by well-known and trusted financial brands. This concentration suggests that the initial phase of growth in Tokenized Assets representing traditional securities is being led by established financial entities, bridging their existing client base and expertise with blockchain technology. What are the Benefits of Tokenizing Treasurys? Despite the concentration, the underlying technology and asset class offer compelling advantages: Increased Accessibility: Tokenization can lower the minimum investment threshold for accessing Treasurys, potentially opening them up to a wider range of investors globally. Improved Liquidity: While still developing, the goal is to enable peer-to-peer transfers and potentially faster settlement times on-chain compared to traditional markets. Transparency: Transactions recorded on a public or permissioned blockchain can offer a level of transparency not always present in traditional finance. Programmability: Tokenized assets can potentially be integrated into DeFi protocols, enabling new financial applications like using them as collateral for loans. Faster Settlement: Blockchain settlements can occur in minutes, compared to the T+2 (trade date plus two days) settlement cycle common in traditional bond markets. These benefits are driving interest and adoption, even if the market is currently top-heavy. Are There Challenges to Widespread Adoption? Absolutely. The path to widespread adoption of Tokenized Assets , including Treasurys, isn’t without hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory treatment of tokenized securities varies across jurisdictions and is still evolving, creating uncertainty for issuers and investors. Interoperability: Ensuring these tokens can seamlessly interact across different blockchains and traditional financial systems is crucial. Custody Solutions: Secure and reliable custody solutions for tokenized securities are still developing. Market Education: Educating traditional investors about the benefits and risks of digital assets and tokenization is necessary for broader adoption. Liquidity Development: While potential for improved liquidity exists, the market needs to mature significantly to rival the deep liquidity of traditional Treasury markets. Overcoming these challenges will be key to expanding the market beyond the current dominant players and attracting a more diverse range of participants. What’s Next for Tokenized Assets and RWA? The current concentration, led by initiatives like BlackRock’s BUIDL , could be seen as a stepping stone. As the market matures, we might see increased competition, more diverse offerings, and potentially a broader distribution of assets across more funds and individual investors. The trend of bringing RWA onto the blockchain is likely to continue, extending beyond Treasurys to other asset classes like real estate, private equity, and more. The infrastructure being built now by these early movers is paving the way for potentially significant shifts in how traditional assets are owned, traded, and managed in the future. Actionable Insights for Investors If you’re interested in the Tokenized U.S. Treasurys space, here are a few points to consider: Research the Issuers: Understand the fund manager, their track record, and the specific structure of the tokenized product (e.g., yield mechanism, underlying assets, blockchain used). Understand the Risks: Tokenization introduces new risks related to smart contracts, blockchain security, and regulatory changes, in addition to the market risks of the underlying asset. Evaluate Accessibility: Check which platforms or exchanges list these tokens and ensure they are accessible from your location. Consider Your Portfolio: Assess how tokenized Treasurys fit into your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. This market is dynamic, and staying informed about developments, particularly concerning key players and regulatory shifts, is essential. Compelling Summary: A Concentrated Beginning for Tokenized Treasurys The data showing six funds holding 88% of Tokenized U.S. Treasurys highlights the early-stage nature and institutional dominance of this market. Led by giants like BlackRock with its BUIDL fund, this concentration is a natural phase as large players leverage their resources and trust to build initial infrastructure and attract capital. While challenges related to regulation, liquidity, and education remain, the underlying benefits of tokenization – increased accessibility, transparency, and potential for integration with Digital Assets – suggest a promising future. The RWA market is clearly gaining momentum, and while currently concentrated, it represents a significant step towards bridging traditional finance with the innovative world of blockchain.

Cardano Holds Steady At $0.70 Levels Cardano is currently trading at $0.7241, up over 3% in the past day. Cardano has managed to hold steady at the $0.70 level. If ADA manages to stay above $0.70, it could target the next resistance at $0.764, potentially aiming for $1. However, if it drops below $0.70, the next support levels are $0.674 and $0.60.

ZETA’s price stood at $0.26 at the time of writing. While this performance reflects broader market dynamics, ZETA is gaining amid significant ecosystem developments, including a major integration with Avalanche (AVAX). ZetaChain price bounces amid integration with Avalanche A key driver behind ZETA’s recent price activity is ZetaChain’s integration with Avalanche , announced on April 24, 2025. Per the platforms, Avalanche, known for its high-throughput and near-instant transaction finality, joined ZetaChain’s Universal Blockchain ecosystem. This has allowed it to enable native cross-chain functionality with major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. ZetaChain 🟩 @zetablockchain · Follow Replying to @zetablockchain 3/ With Universal Apps, devs can build once and reach every major chain, natively — BTC, ETH, SOL, and now AVAX — all from a single contract. 8:30 pm · 24 Apr 2025 5 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply With the integration, developers can now deploy a single smart contract to access these chains without bridges or wrapping, fostering seamless Universal Apps. The integration aligns with industry trends toward streamlined cross-chain functionalities. ZetaChain offers the first Universal Blockchain, allowing for native access to any chain. As noted above, this includes non-smart chains like the world’s most popular blockchain network, Bitcoin. The support for Avalanche on mainnet unlocks further cross-chain user experience for users, including the more than 1.4 million active users on Avalanche. “By connecting Avalanche to the ZetaChain ecosystem, we future-proof your apps: whether Avalanche develops new architectures, novel DeFi projects, or new token standards, ZetaChain can incorporate them without requiring each dApp to rebuild bridging logic from scratch,” the ZetaChain team wrote in a blog . Gains for ZETA have come amid a bullish reaction from the community. ZETA’s price has bounced from lows of $0.24 and could eye $0.30, a key level over the past month. What could curtail the ZETA price in the short term? Despite the bullish momentum, ZETA faces potential headwinds due to an upcoming token unlock event. ZETA chart by CoinMarketCap Data from the token unlock tracking site Tokenomist shows ZetaChain is set to unlock 44.26 million ZETA tokens on May 1, 2025. The unlock value is around $11 million and will account for about 5.67% of the altcoin’s circulating supply. While ZetaChain’s integration with Avalanche has driven optimism, investors may throw in some caution due to the unlock. An influx of new tokens will likely temper ZETA’s recent gains, impacting short-term sentiment. If price dips, bears may target $0.19. On the upside, buyers will eye $0.50 and potentially $1 in the coming months.

That’s something smart investors know, and they’re already looking for the best altcoins for high ROI in 2025. Now, if you’re one of them, experts believe Solana (SOL), FXGuys ($FXG), and SUI have the most profit potential. Among these top altcoins to watch, the FXGuys crypto presale coin is a special case thanks to its features that traders can actually relate to. For example, you get access to up to $500,000 in trading capital if you want to trade big without risking your own money. This Trader Funding Program is just one of the many features designed for common traders. But the main question is, can Solana, FXGuys, and SUI live up to the hype? Continue reading to get the answer! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Solana Crosses $150 After Securing $500 Million in Investment After getting rocked by the April dip, Solana is showing signs of life again. SOL has popped back over the $150 mark after a 14% price climb in the past week, thanks to a fresh $500 million investment. For context, SOL Strategies just secured a massive deal with ATW Partners to stake SOL tokens through their validator operations. And this kind of cash injection is a promising development for Solana. This move from SOL Strategies has apparently reignited confidence in the Solana camp. Analyst CryptoBull_360 says SOL could rally all the way up to $270. That’s nearly an 80% jump from where it’s sitting now at $151. Still, if you’re hunting for the best altcoins for high ROI in 2025, SOL isn’t the only option. FXGuys is the underdog-turned-fan-favorite in the crypto presale world. With a predicted 100x pump post-launch, it’s easily one of the altcoins to watch. Even SUI holders are interested! Secure a 100x ROI in 2025 With the FXGuys Crypto Presale You might’ve heard the noise around Solana, but if you’re after the best altcoins for high ROI in 2025, FXGuys might be your golden ticket to 100x gains. With a growing ecosystem and a token that’s still early, the $FXG crypto presale is where smart investors are moving. And a major reason driving this trend is that FXGuys is solving traders’ issues. Let’s start with the big issue. Most traders don’t have enough capital to go big. FXGuys gets that, and that’s why it’s offering up to $500,000 in trading capital through its Trader Funding Program. You can finally trade big. But what if you’re trading all day and still not seeing much? FXGuys brings you its Trade2Earn model. Every trade earns you $FXG tokens even on your bad days. Trading actively can come with incentives, only on the FXGuys platform. And if you’re more into passive income, join the FX Guys’ staking rewards program. You can get up to a 20% APY just for staking $FXG tokens. That’s the best thing you can do in any market, bull or bear. With these features on your side, profits will flow in every day. When you do make profits, you get to keep more of them thanks to the 80/20 profit split and zero trading tax. It just sounds too good to be true. And FXGuys understands that, which is why it has launched its BETA trading platform. You can try the core features before the big launch! Analyst Sets $11 as the Next Target for SUI: One of the Altcoins to Watch? SUI is slowly crawling back after taking a hit in the last market dump. It started 2025 strong, crossing $5 in January. But things got rough, and it dipped below $2 in March. Now, in Late April, SUI is back at $2.97 after a promising 44% price climb over the past week. This price recovery is not bad for a token trying to get its momentum back. Crypto analyst Bitcoinsensus thinks this might just be the beginning. He pointed out that SUI has broken a long-term resistance on the RSI chart and could hit $11.50 next. That’s a bold SUI price prediction! But anything’s possible in crypto. Still, when it comes to the best altcoins for high ROI in 2025, FXGuys tops the list every time. It’s rising in fame due to its crypto presale, with predictions of 100x gains post-launch. So, $FXG is definitely one of the top altcoins to watch before it takes off. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE $FXG, SOL, and SUI: The Best Altcoins For High ROI in 2025 Now, don’t get this wrong. Solana and SUI are promising altcoins to watch. But if you’re chasing massive ROI, $FXG is the one people are whispering could rise 100x in price or more in 2025. Right now, $FXG has a token value of just $0.05 in Stage 3 of its crypto presale. And it’s targeting a launch price of $0.10. What that means is you can secure a 100% profit by joining the presale now. Over 93% of Stage 3 tokens are already sold, with more than $5.7 million raised. Additionally, SolidProof and Soken have audited the FXGuys smart contract and declared it safe. If you’re serious about finding the best altcoins for high ROI in 2025, don’t miss FXGuys. $FXG is moving fast. And your shot at under-$0.06 entry won’t last much longer!

According to Livingston, Saylor’s firm, Strategy, is buying half or more of the newly minted Bitcoin from miners each month, effectively tightening the available supply at an unprecedented rate. Currently, Bitcoin miners produce around 450 BTC per day, amounting to roughly 13,500 BTC per month. However, in the last six months alone, Strategy has accumulated approximately 379,800 BTC . This figure translates to about 2,087 BTC purchased daily—far surpassing the amount miners bring to the market each day. Livingston warns that as Bitcoin becomes scarcer, accessing it will require paying a premium. Lending against Bitcoin will become more expensive, and borrowing Bitcoin may eventually be a privilege reserved for nation-states and corporate giants. “BTC’s global cost of capital will no longer be set by ‘the market.’ It will be set by the gravitational policies of the first Bitcoin superpower: Strategy,” Livingston stated. Higher Prices and Growing Institutional Demand Livingston’s analysis suggests that Strategy’s aggressive buying could cause a severe Bitcoin supply crunch, leading to much higher prices if institutional and retail demand continues to rise. Supporting this view, Cypherpunk and Blockstream CEO Adam Back recently predicted that Strategy, along with other firms adopting Bitcoin corporate treasury strategies, could help drive Bitcoin’s total market capitalization to an astounding $200 trillion. Back described these firms as capitalizing on the gap between Bitcoin’s future value and today’s fiat economy, suggesting that their continued accumulation will have a major impact on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. As Bitcoin remains supply-capped, the aggressive strategies of these institutions could redefine the dynamics of the market in the coming years. Debate Around Risk and Centralization Despite the optimism, Strategy’s debt-fueled Bitcoin acquisition plan has drawn criticism. Skeptics warn that if Bitcoin enters a prolonged bear market, the company could face severe financial consequences, potentially introducing new systemic risks for the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Moreover, concerns about centralization are rising, given the sheer volume of Bitcoin now controlled by a single entity. However, Bitcoin advocate and author Saifedean Ammous has dismissed fears that the firm could manipulate the Bitcoin protocol. Ammous argued that major holders like BlackRock and Strategy would never support changes like increasing Bitcoin’s maximum supply, as it would severely harm their own financial interests—and their shareholders would likely push back against any such moves.

Is dYdX a good investment? The rising institutional demand for dYdX makes it a good investment option. However, dYdX has a short investment history filled with very volatile phases. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX up today? Following the overall buying demand in the market, dYdX witnessed a surge in buying pressure. As a result, buyers are aiming for a hold above $0.66. Will dYdX Recover? If buyers hold above $0.65 level strongly, we might see a strong recovery in the coming hours. What is the dYdX price prediction for 2025?

Depending on market sentiment, dYdX might hit the $10 mark by the end of 2027. However, any bearish news might weaken this prediction. Will the dYdX price reach $100? $100 will be a significant milestone for dYdX. However, it is achievable if dYdX continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is dYdX a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate dYdX and it faces a rise in global recognition, dYdX has a solid long-term future.

One of these forces is a menace, and has certainly affected each of us in a negative, predatory way. The other is an unsung hero, meant to be helpful overall, but actually has exactly what is needed to conquer the menace. What are these two forces and how do they affect you directly? Let’s dive in and explore. If The Service Is Free, Then You Are The Product There is a saying that has evolved in the world of free online services: “If the service is free, then you are the product.” It’s a little disturbing to hear it, but it’s absolutely true. Have you ever wondered why these modern miracles of the internet age are completely free? Search engines, email, social media, photo storage, AI chatbots, all of them free to use. How do these companies make any money? It’s not like they are charities, and if you pay attention you can easily see that the founders are the new billionaire tycoons of the modern age. The reason they make so much money is because they sell you, or at least your data. Data brokers and advertisers pay big money, and with tools like AI they can learn more about you than you probably know about yourself. They can and do use this data to manipulate you, advertise to you, and get you to spend money. The services themselves are free, but you pay for them at a price much higher than you realize. This is our world now, and because this business model has been so successful, we haven’t even tried to stop it until recently, and even then we are at an extreme disadvantage. It’s not like these services are easy to give up. We have made them an essential part of our lives, and to give them up would put you at a severe disadvantage socially, for your job, for your education, and for most things you need to accomplish during the day. So what can be done about this menace? Web3 Is The Unlikely Hero Web3 has been evolving for a number of reasons, but a key reason is a response against the control of your data. There is a growing community that wants to get rid of these companies who have their claws in our personal data, harvesting it without our consent, profiting from it without sharing, and using that data to further manipulate us. The decentralized nature of Web3 is perfect for this, and so is the ability to have control over your own data. Being able to turn data into a digital asset is more powerful than you might realize, because it actually solves two problems at once. Imagine that your personal data is like your house. Right now you have strangers living with you, taking your food, sleeping in your bed, doing pretty much whatever you want because you don’t have doors or locks on the house. Web3 allows you to put those doors and locks on when done right, keeping the inside of your house (your data) safe. However, it does something equally amazing. By having this control and being able to package up your assets, you could actually let certain parties in if they follow your rules and pay you. Instead of having squatters in your house who are stealing all your things, you have paid renters who have to follow the rules. How does Web3 do this? Let’s take iExec as an example, as they have been developing very interesting ways to monetize your digital assets using Web3. The first use of this is with messaging and privacy. Combining the two elements of keeping data safe and monetizing it, iExec has developed an interesting feature leveraging Web3 to accomplish both. Users can use their messaging apps like Telegram or even email , locking in their handle/address on their iExec Data Protector tool. This allows a layer of separation between the info and the recipients, allowing them to choose who can contact them. They utilize their Ethereum address to manage communication, so that you can send a message to someone’s email or Telegram without ever gaining knowledge of the address/handle. What benefit is this? First, this prevents the onslaught of spam and other unwelcome messages we are currently buried with, along with the risk of data/identity theft. Second, it allows the user, if they choose, to allow certain individuals and even brands to send them information, but with Web3 they can charge for the access. Instead of receiving spam each day that benefits everyone but you, you can have a curated list of messages that each come with your blessing and a reward. What a difference between the two mindsets, and this is a shining example of where Web3 can both create privacy and allow for monetization to reward users when they are willing to share certain access and info. The second example falls into the category of being rewarded for unused resources. Also with iExec, the Worker Pass NFT allows a holder to join a workerpool and start earning RLC tokens by providing computing power on the iExec Marketplace. Unused computing power, with your specific permission, can be used by others through the trusted third party in a way that pays rewards. This too is a major benefit of Web3, providing the infrastructure necessary to not just decentralize and protect, but to gather decentralized resources and create marketplaces. AI firms profit off your data without consent. Let's take back control. https://t.co/o57bGuNujd — iExec RLC (@iEx_ec) March 3, 2025 What’s Next? These examples are just the beginning, and there are many other platforms in the Web3 industry working to either safeguard privacy, enable monetization directly to those who own the assets (data, computing power, etc.), or both. This is one of those areas that will only grow stronger and more in demand as the goliath data brokers and megacompanies take your data and privacy itself, using it for their own benefit and leaving you with nothing but targeted spam. This, more than token speculation or digitized art NFTs, will drive Web3 into common usage as the larger population begins to understand that there is hope against the abuse of data.",Information,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 10:10:07
43898536,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153192,1745835037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Shift: Crypto Fear and Greed Index Enters Neutral Zone,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-neutral-11/,"Ever feel the pulse of the crypto market? It’s often driven by two powerful emotions: fear and greed. Understanding this collective sentiment is crucial, and that’s where the Crypto Fear and Greed Index comes in. Recently, this widely-watched indicator made a significant move, shifting from the ‘Greed’ zone into ‘Neutral’. What does this change signal for traders and investors? Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, is designed to quantify the dominant emotions influencing the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a barometer for market psychology. It operates on a simple principle: when the market is surging, participants tend to become greedy, potentially leading to irrational exuberance. Conversely, when prices plummet, fear can take hold, pushing people to sell irrationally. The index uses a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Indicates investors are very worried, potentially a sign of undervaluation or a buying opportunity for contrarians. 25-49: Fear – Sentiment is cautious or negative. 50-50: Neutral – The market is balanced, with no strong directional sentiment dominating. 51-74: Greed – Investors are becoming optimistic or greedy, potentially signaling overvaluation. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Indicates excessive optimism and potentially irrational behavior, often seen near market tops. As of April 28th, the index registered 54, a drop of seven points from the previous day. This specific movement pushed it out of the ‘Greed’ territory (which starts at 55) and firmly into the ‘Neutral’ zone. This wasn’t just a small fluctuation; it represented a noticeable cooling of market sentiment. What Caused the Shift in Crypto Market Sentiment? A seven-point drop in a single day is notable and suggests that the overall crypto market sentiment experienced a rapid change. While the index’s daily report doesn’t pinpoint exact causes, such shifts are typically triggered by a combination of factors influencing investor confidence. These can include: Significant price drops in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Negative news headlines (regulatory concerns, exchange issues, macroeconomic data). Sudden increases in market volatility. Changes in trading volume and momentum. Shifts in social media buzz or Google search trends related to crypto. The move from ‘Greed’ to ‘Neutral’ doesn’t necessarily mean the market is bearish, but it indicates that the previous bullish enthusiasm has moderated. It suggests investors are adopting a more cautious, wait-and-see approach rather than aggressively buying based on upward momentum. Decoding the Factors: Beyond Cryptocurrency Volatility It’s important to remember that the index isn’t based on just one metric. It’s a composite index, taking into account six different data sources to provide a holistic view of crypto market sentiment . Let’s break down these components and their weighting: The index weighs different factors to arrive at its score: Factor Weighting What it Measures Cryptocurrency Volatility 25% Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average values over 30 and 90 days. High volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and market momentum compared to average values. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greed, while high selling volume suggests fear. Social Media 15% Scans Twitter for specific hashtags and analyzes the speed and number of posts. A high rate of interaction and positive sentiment can indicate greed. Surveys 15% Includes weekly polls conducted by Alternative.me, asking participants about their market outlook. (Note: This factor is currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. An increasing dominance can indicate fear (as investors flee riskier altcoins to Bitcoin), while decreasing dominance can signal greed (as altcoins rally). Google Trends crypto 10% Analyzes search query trends related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google. A surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” might suggest fear, while terms like “buy crypto now” could indicate greed. As you can see, it’s a blend of price action, trading activity, social buzz, and public interest captured through searches. A significant drop in the index suggests that several of these factors likely moved in a direction indicating increasing caution or fear among market participants. How Does Bitcoin Dominance Play a Role? The Bitcoin dominance factor (10% of the index) is particularly interesting. Bitcoin is often seen as the ‘safe haven’ asset within the volatile crypto space. When fear rises, investors sometimes sell off their altcoins and consolidate their holdings into Bitcoin, causing its market dominance percentage to increase. Conversely, during periods of high greed and bullishness, altcoins often experience parabolic rallies, causing Bitcoin’s dominance to decrease as money flows into smaller, riskier cap assets. Therefore, an increase in Bitcoin dominance can contribute to the index moving towards ‘Fear’, while a decrease can push it towards ‘Greed’. This component adds another layer of insight into where market participants are allocating their capital based on their risk appetite. Leveraging Google Trends Crypto and Other Data The inclusion of Google Trends crypto data (10%) highlights how mainstream interest and public curiosity influence sentiment. Spikes in searches for generic terms like “Bitcoin” or “cryptocurrency” during a bull run can signal retail investor FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), contributing to the ‘Greed’ score. Conversely, a sudden surge in searches for negative terms or explanations during a crash can indicate panic and contribute to ‘Fear’. Combined with cryptocurrency volatility , market momentum, and social media sentiment, these factors paint a picture of the market’s emotional state. While volatility and momentum are direct reflections of price action, social media and Google Trends offer a glimpse into the collective mindset of the broader public and crypto community. Using the Index: Benefits and Limitations The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, but like any indicator, it has benefits and limitations. Benefits: Quick Sentiment Check: Provides a fast, easy-to-understand snapshot of overall market mood. Contrarian Indicator: Some traders use it as a contrarian signal – buying during ‘Extreme Fear’ and selling during ‘Extreme Greed’. As the saying goes, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” Historical Context: Comparing the current level to historical values can offer perspective on the market’s position in a potential cycle. Limitations: Not a Perfect Predictor: It indicates current sentiment, not future price movements. A market can remain fearful or greedy for extended periods. Simplified View: It aggregates many factors into a single number, potentially oversimplifying complex market dynamics. Bitcoin-Centric: While it includes other factors, its components are heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance and dominance, which might not always perfectly reflect the entire altcoin market. Data Source Reliability: The accuracy depends on the reliability and interpretation of the underlying data sources. Therefore, the index should be used as one tool among many in an investor’s arsenal, complementing technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and risk management strategies. What’s Next? Navigating the Neutral Zone The move into the ‘Neutral’ zone (50-50) suggests a period of equilibrium. Neither fear nor greed has a strong upper hand. This can precede periods of consolidation, sideways price action, or increased uncertainty as the market waits for a new catalyst. For investors, the ‘Neutral’ zone might call for a more cautious approach, potentially waiting for a clearer signal before making significant moves. A sustained period in the ‘Neutral’ zone could mean the market is taking a breather, digesting recent price action, and waiting for fresh news or economic data to dictate the next trend. Alternatively, it could be a brief pause before sentiment quickly shifts back towards fear or greed based on upcoming events. Summary: Reading the Market’s Emotional Pulse The recent seven-point drop in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , pushing it into the ‘Neutral’ zone at 54, is a clear signal that the market’s collective mood has moderated from its previous state of ‘Greed’. This index, which considers factors like cryptocurrency volatility , market momentum, social media, Bitcoin dominance , and Google Trends crypto , provides valuable insight into investor psychology. While not a crystal ball, understanding this shift in crypto market sentiment from ‘Greed’ to ‘Neutral’ helps investors gauge the prevailing emotions, potentially identify contrarian opportunities, and inform their overall strategy in the dynamic world of digital assets. Staying informed about these sentiment indicators is key to navigating the market effectively.

43898623,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-projects-prepare-battle-privacy-switzerland,1745835166,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Crypto projects prepare to battle for privacy in Switzerland,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-projects-prepare-battle-privacy-switzerland?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Switzerland has long been seen as a beacon of privacy where companies, organizations and wealthy people put down roots in an effort to avoid the prying eyes of the rest of the world. Joining this cohort are many Web3 projects, which also appreciate the Swiss government’s generally positive stance toward blockchain and digital assets. The country’s reputation as a privacy haven has resulted in Switzerland becoming a hub for privacy projects establishing their foundations or development entities there, including Nym, Session and Hopr — joining traditional privacy software companies such as Proton and Threema. Now, a proposed change to a Swiss surveillance ordinance is worrying these same projects, as it would spell a marked increase in the government’s user monitoring requirements. But the decentralized nature of crypto may offer a solution for those wishing to preserve their privacy in a climate of increasing surveillance. Switzerland is a privacy haven — or maybe not Switzerland has long been considered by many to have some of the world’s strongest privacy protections. As Proton, the company behind the encrypted Proton Mail email service, argued in a 2014 blog post titled “Why Switzerland?”, the Central European country offers several advantages: Companies are outside of the jurisdiction of the US and EU, the country is politically neutral, there are strong constitutional privacy protections, and there is established infrastructure. Kee Jeffries, technical co-founder of decentralized private messaging app Session, recently told Cointelegraph’s The Agenda podcast that it was important to establish the foundation “in a country which has a long history of preserving people’s personal privacy and freedom of speech.” However, all governments must ultimately balance citizen privacy and national security concerns. In Switzerland, surveillance is governed by the Ordinance on the Surveillance of Correspondence by Post and Telecommunications (OSCPT). In January, the Swiss Federal Council proposed a revision to the OSCPT that would increase user monitoring requirements for telecommunications service providers and widen the definition of who meets these requirements to include services such as VPNs, social networks and messaging apps. In short, as they are currently written, the changes would require service providers that serve at least 5,000 users to identify all users and willfully decrypt all communications that are not end-to-end encrypted. Privacy projects fight back against surveillance The move has been met with widespread backlash from the privacy community. Proton CEO Andy Yen has threatened to fight the government in court and potentially pull the company out of the country. Decentralized VPN provider Nym issued a public call to action for Swiss citizens to contact their representatives and oppose the action. Source: Andy Yen In a statement, Nym’s chief operating officer, Alexis Roussel, said the ordinance by the Federal Council “is destroying an entire sector,” adding: “This ordinance directly endangers the people who use these services.” Sebastian Bürgel, vice president of technology at Gnosis and founder of decentralized mixnet Hopr, echoed the concerns of Yen and Roussel, telling Cointelegraph the move would likely backfire. “If the intent is to limit the privacy and anonymity that services such as Proton Mail, Proton VPN and Threema are providing, that will not change much because those entities will potentially leave Switzerland if that were to happen,” he said. “But again, the consequences will be borne by everyone out there and everyone who’s actually in Switzerland.” Related: Keeping crypto cypherpunk protects users from censorship and corporatism — Gnosis VP Meanwhile, Ronald Kogens, a legal partner at Swiss law firm MME who focuses on Web3 and fintech, told Cointelegraph that it’s unclear whether the Swiss Federal Council even has the authority to implement such changes. “In an ordinance, you cannot include any heavy rights or obligations which have a strong impact on individuals in Switzerland,” he shared, saying that the Federal Council is essentially an executive body and that laws must pass through parliament. “One question you could ask is, does the Federal Council have the power, based on the laws where it stated that they can enact an ordinance, the power to do this, what they’re doing now?” Are Swiss crypto projects at risk? The move by the Swiss Federal Council is damaging Switzerland’s privacy reputation, but decentralized technologies like blockchain networks may offer a lifeline. According to Kogens, truly decentralized projects should be exempt from the new surveillance requirements. “In my opinion, most Web3 activities are not affected because [...] the pure offering of software without running any infrastructure for the whole messaging or communication system is not covered by this,” he told Cointelegraph. “You have to have specific servers or clients that you operate that are an essential part of the communication or messaging service.” Either way, the more decentralized a project is, the less any government can influence its operations. Take, for example, Tornado Cash, which has continued chugging along for years despite multiple developers being arrested and the US sanctioning its smart contracts at one point. Nym CEO Harry Halpin told Cointelegraph in March that “in theory, we should be able to get run over with a car, and the network would keep operating.” “Hopr, as an example of Web3 infrastructure, does not operate infrastructure, right?” said Bürgel. “Hopr Association is involved in software development and research and development, but we are not an operator of a network.” The fact that the Hopr network is fully decentralized and anonymous means the Hopr Association could not actually give any information about its users to Switzerland, even if it were legally compelled. “Individual node runners which are participating in it, or other third parties, cannot tell who is using the Hopr network to access any kind of web service. That is the explicit goal of what we are undertaking.” The future of privacy in Switzerland The Swiss Federal Council’s proposed changes to the OSCPT are still in the consultation phase, with the public encouraged to offer feedback on the proposal through May 6. Kogens told Cointelegraph that the council will review the feedback, create a final report, and decide whether to adjust the proposal. “That happens quite a lot,” he said, “because in the end, it’s not in the interest of Switzerland to do something which harms the industry, as long as they still can fulfill their goal, which they have with this surveillance act.” Source: Nym But even if the changes go through as written, there could be some positive knock-on effects for the crypto space. “It may be that the silver lining is that it will drive users to decentralized and privacy-facilitating solutions instead,” said Bürgel. “It is clear to everyone that more surveillance is bad,” he added. “Every single individual understands that.” “Taming the surveillance machinery is a goal of Web3. It’s not just about magic internet money. And yeah, I think we need more people working towards that.” Magazine: UK’s Orwellian AI murder prediction system, AI will take your job Document has no content",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|OTHER|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-28 10:12:46

With tariffs stirring global tensions and markets thrashing in response, the search for stability looked unusually uncertain. Yet amid the turmoil, Bitcoin quietly stepped into a role many had long debated it could fill. Recent performance data points to a shift: Bitcoin behaving less like a high-risk tech stock and more like the store of value its earliest believers envisioned. And if this trend deepens, it could have wide-reaching effects across the crypto market. Bitcoin's Growing Role as a Store of Value Could Reshape Crypto's Trajectory Recent market behavior indicates that Bitcoin is beginning to mature into the asset its early supporters envisioned. During a month marked by extreme volatility, where traditional safe havens like the Swiss Franc, gold, and even US Treasuries wavered under pressure, Bitcoin demonstrated an unusual level of resilience. NYDIG’s research highlights a noteworthy change in its behavior. Bitcoin appeared less correlated to traditional equities and more aligned with the attributes of a non-sovereign store of value. This shift carries important implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. When Bitcoin starts behaving in a way that mirrors gold's historical performance during times of uncertainty, it signals a potential transformation in investor psychology. Confidence in Bitcoin's stability could spill over into other parts of the crypto ecosystem, encouraging more capital inflows not only into Bitcoin itself but also into projects that offer complementary value propositions. Sectors that emphasize decentralization, censorship resistance, and financial autonomy could see amplified interest. Tokens tied to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, decentralized finance innovations, or projects that align with political or economic hedge narratives may benefit the most. As traditional financial systems show signs of stress, the migration toward digital alternatives could accelerate, creating a favorable environment for selective growth across the crypto space. The projects most attuned to this evolving market preference are likely to be the ones that outperform. Best Crypto to Buy Now With Crypto’s Increasing Influence Solaxy - SOLX As global confidence in traditional finance falters, blockchain projects that strengthen interoperability are becoming essential infrastructure. Solaxy steps directly into this emerging need by offering a Layer 2 network designed to facilitate transactions across both Solana and Ethereum. At its core, Solaxy aims to erase the friction that often divides blockchain ecosystems, enabling users to transfer assets swiftly and at reduced cost without sacrificing security. The project’s value becomes even more pronounced when considering Bitcoin’s growing reputation as a non-sovereign store of value. As investors deepen their exploration into decentralized systems, they will demand smooth movement of assets across chains—a need that Solaxy is strategically positioned to meet. Beyond bridging transactions, Solaxy also offers staking opportunities with attractive yields, catering to users who seek passive income streams within trusted ecosystems. Its dual-chain focus is particularly relevant given the rising interest in both Solana and Ethereum for decentralized finance applications. If crypto adoption accelerates in the aftermath of financial uncertainty, infrastructures like Solaxy that facilitate cross-chain liquidity could see rapid user growth. With technical efficiency, relevant utility, and a clear problem-solving orientation, Solaxy is more than a facilitator—it is an enabler of the multi-chain future the crypto world increasingly gravitates toward. SUBBD - SUBBD SUBBD is more than a token; it is a challenge to the traditional platforms that have long dictated how creators interact with their audiences. Built with the specific aim of empowering creators through decentralization, SUBBD introduces a new standard where ownership, autonomy, and fair monetization converge. The platform offers creators the ability to tokenize their work, build direct relationships with supporters, and control how their content is distributed and monetized—all without interference from corporate gatekeepers. In a world increasingly skeptical of centralized control, SUBBD’s mission gains critical relevance. If Bitcoin’s rise as a store of value highlights the global appetite for decentralization, then SUBBD reflects that appetite within the creator economy. It turns creative output into digital assets with measurable, tradeable value, enabling artists, influencers, and thinkers to finally own their audiences and earnings. The utility behind SUBBD’s token is layered. Beyond acting as a medium of exchange within its marketplace, $SUBBD fuels governance decisions, meaning users have a real voice in shaping platform evolution. The project, covered by many content creators, has received much traction already, with top names like 99Bitcoins also covering it as a high-potential initiative. As the traditional content economy faces mounting criticism for exploitation and control, platforms like SUBBD could represent the natural migration point for both creators and audiences seeking fairness and transparency. Projects empowering individual sovereignty stand to thrive in the new financial paradigm, and SUBBD’s alignment with this ethos positions it well for future growth. Fantasy Pepe - FEPE Fantasy Pepe delivers an ambitious blend of meme culture, artificial intelligence, and fantasy sports—three of the most resilient entertainment trends of the digital era. It is an AI-powered fantasy football platform where players create teams, strategize, and earn rewards, all wrapped within the humorous and viral aesthetic of the Pepe meme. However, beneath the playful branding lies serious technology and a clear use case. The platform’s AI capabilities help optimize fantasy team decisions, offering players real data-driven advantages instead of leaving outcomes entirely to chance. This intersection of artificial intelligence and gaming introduces a new standard for fairness and competitiveness within fantasy sports. Furthermore, staking options for Fantasy Pepe's native token create avenues for passive rewards, linking entertainment with earning potential. Fantasy Pepe’s design becomes particularly important in an environment where the financial world is redefining its understanding of value and ownership. As more individuals look to decentralized systems for security and growth, gamified ecosystems with transparent reward mechanisms become appealing alternative outlets. Fantasy Pepe captures attention through memes but retains engagement through utility and continuous incentives. In a market shifting toward both decentralization and entertainment-driven applications, Fantasy Pepe fits neatly into the narrative. It is not merely another memecoin; it is a gamified platform with embedded intelligence, offering an experience that matches both the cultural and technological expectations of the next generation of crypto adopters. BTC Bull - BTCBULL BTC Bull is a project built with a sharp understanding of what drives long-term relevance in crypto: a strong cultural connection paired with a meaningful ideological foundation. Rooted in the philosophy that Bitcoin is not merely an asset but a movement toward financial independence, BTC Bull embraces this vision while adding a fresh layer of community-driven energy through its meme coin framework. However, developers believe that BTC Bull is more than symbolic. The project ties itself closely to Bitcoin's core narrative of decentralization and sovereignty, channeling those values into an ecosystem that rewards participation, engagement, and belief in the future of decentralized finance. Its presale design, community incentives, and transparent operational structure reflect a genuine effort to create a token that stands for something larger than speculation. This positioning is especially timely. As Bitcoin shows early signs of achieving the ""store of value"" status that its architects hoped for, the broader appetite for projects that reinforce Bitcoin’s ideals is likely to expand. BTC Bull offers investors a dual proposition: participation in a cultural phenomenon and alignment with the original ethos of cryptocurrency. By merging identity, belief, and community action, BTC Bull taps into a trend that goes beyond short-term gains. In a financial world increasingly questioning traditional systems, crypto assets that resonate both emotionally and ideologically could become pivotal pillars of the next growth wave. BTC Bull seems well-prepared to seize that opportunity. Conclusion The changing perception of Bitcoin as a true store of value signals more than just a shift in asset preference. It reflects a deeper realignment in how individuals approach security, autonomy, and opportunity in an increasingly uncertain world. As trust in traditional systems shows signs of strain, the migration toward decentralized solutions may only accelerate. For investors watching these developments closely, the path forward favors projects that boast innovation, resilience, and concepts built with the future in mind.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has approved ProShares' application to launch the XRP Futures ETF on April 30. According to the proposal, ProShares, a company that already offers Bitcoin ETFs, now seeks to provide three XRP-linked ETFs. The first is the Ultra XRP ETF with 2x leverage, the Short XRP ETF with inverse leverage, and the Ultra Short XRP ETF with inverse (-2x) leverage. This approval has led to a parabolic increase in the XRP price, as the token is registering over a 4% increase in the last 24 hours. As market conditions grow bullish, it also indicates that the time is right to find the best crypto to buy now. What Does XRP ETF Approval Mean for Investors? The first thing that the community needs to know is that these aren't the first XRP-linked ETFs. The first XRP Futures ETFs went live for trading on the New York Stock Exchange on April 8th. Furthermore, ProShares has also opted for XRP Spot ETFs, which are yet to be approved. A similar product known as Hashdex was approved in Brazil last week . But being first is not the core USP here; it is the race to get more adoption for crypto within the regulatory framework, and it seems like the community is winning. Trading around the $2.28 level at the time of writing, XRP has a market cap of $133 billion. The current traction that XRP has been getting is outshining the likes of Ethereum, leading analysts like Geoffrey Kendrick to believe that XRP will overtake Ethereum soon to become the world's biggest altcoin by market capitalization. Furthermore, the US XRP ETF push can potentially drive the XRP price above the $3.5 mark, based on the current technical analysis. The technicals are based on the premise that the XRP approval on Wednesday could raise the price to higher highs due to the current market conditions. An ascending triangle has already formed, after which the next resistance will be around the $2.5 level. After that, the $3.0 mark will be tested, and then the goal will be to topple the previous all-time high level: $3.4. As the market conditions grow bullish, the focus should be on finding the best crypto to buy now, since XRP's consequent growth will likely permeate through the entire cryptocurrency space. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Top 4 List Listed below are the best cryptocurrencies that could profit from XRP gaining momentum. SUBBD While SUBBD is not in the same playing field as XRP, XRP's focus on ultra-fast transactions and ease of payment is what makes SUBBD one of the best contenders as a leading crypto to buy into. Powering a content creation platform of the same name, SUBBD is an AI-driven ecosystem giving creators a chance to upsell their content and sell it through a decentralized platform. The AI tools available on the website allow creators to get paid quickly and perform administrative tasks without much hassle. Creative tools such as an AI Influencer will also be added within the SUBBD domain to provide creators with better ways to offer content. Fans of these creators will be able to leverage the SUBBD token to access exclusive content and collaborate with their favorite creators. There are staking rewards as well as gamification models to make the ecosystem worthwhile.

Just copy, paste, and slay in our Telegram app:“Ultra-realistic photo of a stunning woman sitting on the hood of a red sports car at… pic.twitter.com/Bzb1npCh1L — SUBBD (@SUBBDofficial) April 27, 2025 SUBBD is also a very social platform, offering unique prompts for users to try out. A combination of these perks gives SUBBD a positive vibe, potentially making it one of the leading assets that could gain from XRP’s bullish momentum. BTC Bull XRP's massive growth is not a feat that Ripple achieved on its own; Bitcoin's growth is also a great factor. However, while Bitcoin's growth impact on XRP was passive, BTC Bull creates an ecosystem where this impact is more active. Described as a meme coin and a social movement of bulls behind Bitcoin, BTC Bull is a meme coin project whose identity is tied to Bitcoin. Its total supply of 21 billion vaguely mirrors Bitcoin, and its core mechanics rely on Bitcoin's growth. These mechanics — token burns and Bitcoin airdrops — unlock whenever Bitcoin reaches a new high. The first target is $125K, and these mechanics will continue to unlock until Bitcoin reaches the $225K mark. When BTC reaches $250K, BTC Bull will launch a BTCBULL airdrop. The long mechanic of BTC Bull plays on the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market. And it's that honesty that has allowed the cryptocurrency to raise upwards of $5 million to date. The simplified approach may likely help the token's value go up even further in due time. Fantasy Pepe Blending the quirky themes of Pepe with the futuristic style of AI is Fantasy Pepe. Modeled after the concepts of Fantasy Football, Fantasy Pepe breaks the norm of traditional betting platforms to provide an ecosystem that blends narratives and use cases flawlessly. The teams it has created are inspired by several memes, and the managers of these teams are the key players. There is ChatGPT on one side, bringing its stylistic approach into the mix, and on the other, there is DeepSeek, bringing its inquisitiveness to the forefront. Refereeing the game is Grok, an X-based AI model that has made immense waves recently. As token holders, players will be able to wager on 60-second matches that will also feature radio-style live commentary. Winners will gain additional tokens as well as NFT rewards. These digital rewards may soon turn into real-life perks as Fantasy Pepe is also planning to collaborate with leading football teams. Over $230K has been raised by this project already, and more people are getting attracted to it. Multiple YouTubers, including Stock Investor, have covered this project. The YouTuber has highlighted that this meme coin could leverage Pepe's popularity and the AI narrative to gain a major boost in 2025, potentially becoming one of the biggest meme coins on the market. Similar to XRP, Fantasy Pepe also has a narrative that it gains strength from, and that strength will likely turn it into a 10x project after release, on the condition that the market remains bullish. Summary The approval of XRP ETFs shows the rise in efforts from those on the regulatory front to make crypto mainstream. The surge happening right now will likely create better market conditions, allowing crypto ICOs to explode upon listing. Some of these ICOs have been added to this ""best crypto to buy now"" list. All of them provide a unique style and narrative, both of which could give them a short-term boost. Furthermore, these projects have unique use cases as well that could help them gain more traction in the market. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

The RSI at 58.6 signals strengthening upside without overbought risk. Price structure suggests a potential breakout if the neckline resistance near $2.40–$2.50 is cleared. Consolidation post-downtrend adds credibility to reversal signals. XRP Price Prediction April 2025 High Price : $2.50 (key resistance level) Low Price : $1.85 (recent low before breakout) Average Price : $2.0 (current consolidation level) XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, JP Morgan Chase has approved XRP for use within its banking payment framework. If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain in a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89.

There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The altcoin might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The long-term XRP price prediction depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market.

Ready to navigate the potentially choppy waters of the market this week? While cryptocurrency charts grab most of our attention, smart traders and investors know that the broader economic landscape plays a huge role in market movements. This week is packed with significant economic events that could send ripples across global financial markets, including our beloved crypto space. Ignoring these signals could mean missing key opportunities or being caught off guard by volatility. Understanding How Macroeconomic Data Affects the Crypto Market You might wonder, “Why should I care about jobs numbers or inflation data when I’m trading Bitcoin or Ethereum?” Great question! The answer lies in the intricate relationship between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset world. Major macroeconomic data releases provide insights into the health of economies, central bank policy intentions (like interest rates), and overall investor sentiment. These factors directly influence risk appetite. When the economic outlook is uncertain or central banks signal tighter monetary policy (like raising interest rates), investors often become more risk-averse, potentially pulling capital from assets perceived as riskier, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, positive data or signals of looser policy can increase confidence and risk appetite. Think of it this way: economic data acts like a barometer for the global financial climate. Changes in that climate can affect the winds blowing through the crypto market impact , influencing price trends and volatility. Key Economic Events Shaping the Week Ahead Here’s a look at the crucial economic events on the calendar this week. Remember, all times listed are in UTC, so adjust for your local time zone! Wednesday, April 30th: A busy day with multiple significant releases. Thursday, May 1st: Holidays in major Asian economies and a key central bank decision. Friday, May 2nd: The week concludes with one of the most anticipated U.S. reports. Let’s break down some of the most impactful ones: Diving into Key GDP Data Releases Wednesday, April 30th brings important updates on economic growth. At 09:00 UTC , we get the EU GDP (Q1) data. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the broadest measure of economic activity. It represents the total value of goods and services produced. For the EU, this data gives us a pulse on the economic health of the Eurozone. Stronger-than-expected GDP could signal economic resilience, while weaker data might point to headwinds. While not as direct as U.S. data for the predominantly USD-denominated crypto market, the health of major global economies still contributes to overall market sentiment. Later, at 12:30 UTC , the focus shifts to the U.S. GDP (QoQ) (Q1) . This is arguably the most critical GDP release of the week. The U.S. economy is the world’s largest, and its performance heavily influences global markets. Quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) GDP measures the change in the total value of goods and services produced compared to the previous quarter. A robust GDP reading suggests a strong economy, which could lead the Federal Reserve to maintain a tighter monetary policy stance to prevent overheating. Conversely, a weak reading might increase expectations for interest rate cuts or other stimulus measures. Both scenarios can significantly impact risk asset valuations, including crypto. Pay close attention to whether the actual numbers beat, meet, or miss analyst expectations. Surprises are what typically move markets. Understanding PCE Inflation and Its Potential Effects Inflation data remains paramount for central banks and markets, and Wednesday, April 30th at 14:00 UTC brings the U.S. PCE Price Index (March) . The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index is the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation. Unlike the more commonly cited Consumer Price Index (CPI), PCE accounts for shifts in consumer spending habits and has different weighting. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is particularly watched by the Fed for underlying inflation trends. Why is this crucial for the crypto market impact ? High and persistent inflation puts pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates higher for longer or even raise them further. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing and make traditional, safer investments like bonds more attractive relative to risk assets like stocks and crypto. If the PCE data shows inflation is cooling faster than expected, it could reinforce hopes for future rate cuts, which is generally seen as positive for risk assets. If it shows inflation remaining sticky or reaccelerating, it could dampen market sentiment. This report provides vital clues about the Fed’s potential next moves regarding monetary policy. The Anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls Report Saving one of the biggest market movers for last, Friday, May 2nd at 12:30 UTC features the highly anticipated U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls (April) report. This report measures the number of people employed in the U.S. during the previous month, excluding farm workers and some government/non-profit employees. It’s a key indicator of the health of the U.S. labor market. Alongside the headline number (how many jobs were added), markets also scrutinize the unemployment rate and average hourly earnings (wage growth). A strong Nonfarm Payrolls report (many jobs added, low unemployment, rising wages) indicates a tight labor market and a strong economy. Like strong GDP or sticky inflation, this can signal the Fed may need to maintain tighter policy to cool things down, potentially negatively impacting risk assets. Conversely, a weak report (fewer jobs added, rising unemployment, slowing wage growth) suggests the economy is slowing, which might prompt the Fed to consider easing monetary policy sooner. This could be viewed positively for assets like crypto. The Nonfarm Payrolls report often causes significant volatility across all financial markets immediately upon release, including crypto. Other Notable Events This Week While GDP, PCE, and NFP are major highlights, other events are also on the radar: Wednesday, April 30th, 12:15 UTC: U.S. ADP Nonfarm Employment Change (April) – This is a private-sector payrolls report released before the official NFP data. While not always perfectly correlated, it can provide a preview of the labor market’s strength and sometimes cause preliminary market reactions. Thursday, May 1st: Holidays in China and S. Korea (Labor Day) – Be aware that markets in these significant Asian economies will be closed, potentially affecting liquidity and trading volumes during those hours. Thursday, May 1st, 03:00 UTC: Japan BoJ Interest Rate Decision – While focused on Japan, decisions by major central banks like the Bank of Japan can influence global currency markets and overall sentiment. Thursday, May 1st, 12:30 UTC: U.S. Initial Jobless Claims – This weekly report tracks the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time. It’s a timely indicator of the labor market’s health, though less impactful than NFP unless there’s a significant surprise. Navigating Crypto Market Impact: Actionable Insights So, how can you use this information to navigate the potential crypto market impact this week? Stay Informed: Know when these key reports are scheduled and be aware of consensus expectations beforehand. Expect Volatility: Major data releases often precede price swings. If you’re trading, be prepared for potential sharp moves. Consider adjusting position sizes or using stop-losses. Look for Surprises: Markets tend to react most strongly when the actual data deviates significantly from what economists expected. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just look at the numbers. Understand what a ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ number implies for the economy and, crucially, for central bank policy. Consider the Bigger Picture: No single data point tells the whole story. These reports add pieces to the larger economic puzzle. Risk Management is Key: Given the potential for volatility, ensure your risk management strategy is solid. Don’t overextend yourself based on a single report. Conclusion This week presents a packed schedule of significant economic events that have the potential to influence financial markets globally, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. From crucial GDP data and the Fed’s preferred PCE inflation gauge to the highly anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls report, these releases offer vital insights into the health of major economies and the likely path of monetary policy. Understanding these indicators is not just for traditional finance players; it’s increasingly essential for anyone looking to navigate the crypto market impact effectively. By staying informed and understanding the potential implications of this week’s data, you can be better prepared for potential market movements and make more informed decisions.

According to ZachXBT's post, a hacker converted the stolen $330.7 million worth of Bitcoin into XMR, and the XMR price jumped. ZachXBT noted that around nine hours ago, an address starting with “bc1qcr” was hacked and 3,520 BTC (worth $330.7 million) was stolen. The hacker then laundered the stolen funds across more than six exchanges and converted them into Monero (XMR), which caused a significant increase in XMR prices. “A hacker made a suspicious transfer of 3520 BTC (worth $330.7 million) from an address nine hours ago.

With the DeFi protocol on the Solana blockchain gaining over the past week at +21%, what are likely catalysts for further price gains? Could KMNO however face downward pressure in the short term? Two bullish catalysts for Kamino price Kamino is emerging as a significant player in the Solana ecosystem and overall crypto space. After introducing Kamino Meta-Swap to deliver the best price execution for token swaps on Solana earlier this month, the protocol has made another major announcement — the release of its v2 upgrade is imminent. Lending V2 is billed as Kamino’s biggest upcoming update, with the platform eyeing a total reshaping of lending on Solana. This release, with the protocol’s growth over the past year could be key to another leg up for KMNO amid demand. “KaminoFinance is in total growth mode. The lending platform keeps breaking ATHs in supply and borrows since early 2024. The Multiply feature’s max leverage increased from 5x to 7.5x, which is attracting more liquidity ahead,” Syndica wrote . KMNO may also gain a massive upside flip from the overall crypto market push. The token is up more than 20% in the past week and has been trending up. The trendline offers a key support base that means a break above $0.065 will bring $0.10 and $0.15 into bulls’ view. An analyst on X suggests KMNO price may see a significant surge by end of the year. “Fundamental catalysts include TVL continuing to grow, which will be further accelerated once RWAs enter the scene,” said Rendoshi Takamoto. Rendoshi Tokamoto ⭕️ @Rendoshi1 · Follow $KMNO starting a new uptrend here.With my $SOL base case being new ATH by EOY, I think $KMNO can 10x by EOY.Fundamental catalysts include TVL continuing to grow, which will be further accelerated once RWAs enter the scene. 11:19 am · 25 Apr 2025 8 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply Kamino price: bears eye $14 million token unlock However, apart from the bullish v2 release and overall SOL tokens gains, Kamino price may face short term bearish pressure due to an upcoming KMNO unlock. Per Tokenomist , Kamino Finance is scheduled for a significant “cliff” token unlock on April 30, 2025. The unlock will release 229.17 million KMNO tokens. At current prices, that’s valued at $14.30 million, accounting for 13% of its circulating supply. Such a large percentage of the circulating supply being unlocked is something to watch. Massive selling at once might negatively impact KMNO’s price in the short term. However, the overall bullish outlook means a rebound from key support levels could propel KMNO to its recently hit all-time high.

Decentralization is often idealized in crypto, but its real impact depends on how well it scales and solves real-world problems. It’s about empowering people, not just creating something that sounds good on paper. In decentralized physical infr astructure networks, decentralization encourages global participation and rewards real contributions. But the question remains, who takes responsibility when something breaks, when no single entity is in charge? You might also like: For AI that serves people, data curation DePINs hold the key | Opinion While decentralization promises financial freedom, today’s cryptocurrency markets remain anything but stable or decentralized. Amidst the supposed cryptocurrency ‘Bull Run’, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have logged their worst quarterly performance since the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic—a volatility that extends to crypto as financial and governmental institutions become increasingly entangled. Fiat’s crisis of confidence is crypto’s opportunity This unstable market reminds me of what Satoshi Nakamoto warned about years ago, in the Bitcoin ( BTC ) whitepaper: “ The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust .” We’ve since then taken the core principle of decentralization and applied it far beyond—into self-sovereign IDs, DeFi, DAOs, DePIN, and DeSci. But while we’ve been quick to add “De-” to every industry, we haven’t always added the same rigor to questions of responsibility, reliability, and repair. The less glamorous but essential parts of building systems that actually work. Crypto can remove the need for trust, but can it handle responsibility Decentralization empowers, but it also raises a critical question: In a world without central authority, who is accountable? When no single entity is in control, holding individuals or groups responsible becomes significantly harder. If monetary policies go awry, there currently remains a clear centralised entity responsible for addressing the situation. How do we ensure the same accountability when a blockchain node goes awry or network decisions need to be made swiftly? The DAO incident of 2016 exemplifies this challenge. The DAO was one of the first major projects to focus on decentralized autonomy and was built on Ethereum, raising $150 million to function as a venture capital fund without centralized control. A vulnerability in its smart contract was exploited, however, leading to a hack that drained about a third of its funds. Since The DAO was decentralized, there was no clear authority to step in and fix the issue swiftly. The Ethereum community had to debate for weeks on whether to intervene, eventually leading to a controversial hard fork that created Ethereum ( ETH ) and Ethereum Classic ( ETC ). This case highlights the decentralization accountability dilemma, especially in times of crisis. When there’s no central authority, collective action becomes slower and more complex, and thus must be paired with mechanisms for accountability. Null Island and the GPS data dilemma DePIN and AI systems struggle the most with accountability. They are fuelled by oceans of data, and the constant incentive is to gather more data—not ensure its authenticity. In many DePIN projects, the race to scale often puts data quantity ahead of quality. Since incentives are usually based on how much data is contributed, there’s little accountability for whether that data is actually useful or reliable. Over time, some networks end up rewarding noise over signal. For example, some DePIN projects have dozens of nodes off the coast of West Africa, at latitude and longitude 0°N 0°; An empty ocean that has been coined ‘ Null Island ’ since its prevalence, occurring when location data errors arise in geopositioning, instead replacing the coordinates with “null, null”. Even when GPS location data is used accurately, it has significant vulnerabilities that are often exploited, such as location spoofing and GPS drift. There’s even an entire subreddit on spoofing your Pokémon Go location to get the best Pikachu without the effort of walking. Location spoofing —malicious manipulation of GPS data into false location data. GPS drift —when a device’s recorded location is slightly off from the device’s actual position. It can also display as movement even when a device is at a standstill. It can be caused by factors such as signal interference, satellite positioning, or even atmospheric conditions. This isn’t just a hypothetical issue—faulty location data has real-world consequences. More value is flowing into location data, from tracking real-world assets to powering smart cities. As more physical assets get connected, the integrity of that data starts to matter more. What if it’s spoofed? Think of drones delivering packages, or vehicles navigating dense urban networks. What happens when that data is wrong, delayed, or manipulated? The cost isn’t always catastrophic, but it adds up—lost time, misrouted goods, inefficiencies, and more. These are the stakes when data is unverified. The need for data verification in decentralized networks Decentralized networks must do more than just eliminate trust in centralized entities; they must replace it with accountability in the form of verifiable, high-quality data. This is exactly where Proof-of-Location technology steps in, adding an essential layer of real-time verification. Data is not only generated but also validated, ensuring it reflects actual conditions rather than manipulated inputs. For DePINs to be reliable, accountability must be built into the system. If a service fails, the network shouldn’t collapse—it should adapt. This is where redundancy plays a crucial role. Smaller DePIN networks with limited nodes often struggle with this, but established projects have a different approach. With millions of nodes across 150+ countries and battle-tested slashing mechanisms, we ensure the integrity and continuity of geospatial data even when individual nodes fail. Bad data is an existential threat to DePINs. Without verification, networks become vulnerable to spoofing, fraud, and failure. The future of decentralization hinges not just on removing central authority, but on proving that the data we rely on is accurate and consistently accessible.

43899093,https://coinpaper.com/8734/bitget-and-term-finance-respond-to-security-breaches-and-recovery-efforts,1745836200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Bitget and Term Finance Respond to Security Breaches and Recovery Efforts,https://coinpaper.com/8734/bitget-and-term-finance-respond-to-security-breaches-and-recovery-efforts,"Crypto platforms Bitget and Term Finance are working to stabilize operations after facing unrelated incidents that caused significant losses. Bitget is pursuing legal action against eight accounts allegedly responsible for manipulating the market of a low-volume token, while Term Finance has managed to recover a substantial portion of user funds following an oracle misconfiguration that led to faulty liquidations. Bitget Pursues Legal Action After Suspected $20 Million VOXEL Market Manipulation On April 20, Bitget’s VOXEL market — which supports the native token of Polygon-based RPG game Voxie Tactics — experienced an unusual explosion in trading volume and price activity. The token’s price sharply increased, gaining more than fivefold compared to its levels just two days earlier. The sudden spike quickly triggered alarms inside Bitget, leading the exchange to suspend trading in the token and initiate a rollback of trades that occurred during the window of suspected manipulation. At the time, Bitget issued a statement noting the occurrence of ”abnormal trading activity” without providing full details. The investigation has since advanced, with Bitget identifying eight accounts suspected of being linked to what the exchange described as a ”professional arbitrage” operation. In a post on X, Bitget’s Head of Asia, Xie Jiayin, confirmed that the company will send legal letters to the accused parties — a move typically seen as a precursor to full-scale legal proceedings. “All funds that are recovered will be returned to platform users 100 percent, via an airdrop,” Xie added, according to a translated version of the post. “We will release a full incident report on the VOXEL matter as soon as possible to present the complete facts.” The $20 million VOXEL manipulation incident adds to a string of recent security and trading breaches plaguing the broader crypto sector. Just weeks prior, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Loopscale, operating on Solana, suffered a $5.8 million exploit only two weeks after its launch. Additionally, Infini, a stablecoin neobank, reported a $49 million loss following a sophisticated breach of its systems. Bitget’s Reputation and Response Strategy Bitget has generally positioned itself as a relatively proactive exchange when it comes to security measures, and its fast-moving response to the VOXEL incident may help limit reputational damage. Rolling back trades is a controversial move in crypto trading, but it is often seen as a necessary intervention when market fairness is at risk. Legal action also signals Bitget’s intent to deter future attempts at market manipulation by demonstrating a willingness to pursue bad actors across jurisdictions. However, enforcement in such cases is notoriously complex, particularly when potential perpetrators operate across international borders and use pseudonymous accounts. While Bitget has pledged to release a full post-mortem report, several critical questions remain unanswered. Chief among them are: What loopholes or vulnerabilities allowed the abnormal trading to happen? Was it an issue of low liquidity, poor market surveillance, or deeper systemic risk? Were any internal or third-party systems compromised? What new safeguards will be introduced to prevent similar incidents in the future? The answers to these questions will likely determine whether Bitget can reinforce confidence among its users — or whether this will spark further scrutiny over the platform's risk management protocols. As the crypto industry continues to mature, exchanges are facing growing expectations to adopt security and compliance standards comparable to those of traditional financial institutions. Moreover, the speed with which a small group of coordinated traders can allegedly move markets and extract massive profits shows the continuing need for better monitoring, automated alerts, and rapid incident response strategies across the industry. Term Finance Recovers $1 Million After Oracle Bug Causes $1.6 Million Loss in Treehouse Market Meanwhile, in a detailed update posted to X, the Term Finance team explained that 223.197 ETH (roughly $400,000) was captured internally, while another 333 ETH (approximately $600,000) was successfully recovered through negotiations with affected parties. The remaining loss stands at 362.03 ETH, a significant improvement from the initial impact of 918 ETH. “Of the original loss: 223.197 ETH was captured internally, 333 ETH was successfully negotiated for return,” Term stated. ”The total outstanding loss is now 362.03 ETH — significantly reduced from the original 918 ETH impact.” An Oracle Misconfiguration, Not a Hack While the crypto community initially raised alarms over another potential DeFi security breach, Term Finance was quick to clarify that the issue stemmed from an internal bug, not a malicious attack. The team attributed the losses to an error involving an updated Ethereum (ETH) price oracle, which incorrectly fed data to the platform's liquidation engine and triggered widespread liquidations of collateralized positions. ”This was not a hack. No smart contracts were exploited, and user funds were not directly targeted,” Term Finance emphasized in its statement. Despite the reassurances, Term has not yet provided full transparency regarding the negotiation process that led to the recovery of a portion of the lost funds. It remains unclear whether these negotiations involved settlements, incentives, or pressure from the community and industry partners. The Difficulty of Recovering Crypto Funds Recoveries following hacks and bugs vary dramatically in the crypto space. Even when attackers are identified or vulnerabilities are patched, retrieving stolen or lost funds remains a major challenge due to the decentralized and often anonymous nature of blockchain transactions. Ben Zhou, CEO of crypto exchange Bybit, recently highlighted this difficulty. Following a massive $1.4 billion exploit against Bybit in February — the industry’s largest attack to date — Zhou said only a fraction of the stolen assets had been recovered. Nearly 28% of the missing funds had ”gone dark,” becoming untraceable after being moved across blockchain mixers, peer-to-peer networks, and over-the-counter markets. Meanwhile, just 3.84% of Bybit’s lost assets had been frozen. Term Finance’s relative success in recovering more than $1 million offers a rare optimistic example, though it also serves as a reminder of the vulnerabilities even top DeFi protocols can face. As DeFi platforms continue to innovate at breakneck speed, incidents like the Treehouse oracle bug underscore the critical need for rigorous testing, third-party audits, and real-time monitoring tools for core infrastructure components such as price oracles. Term Finance has yet to outline any specific measures it will take to prevent similar incidents in the future. However, it is widely expected that the platform — and others across the DeFi sector — will re-evaluate their integration and upgrade processes for external data feeds and liquidation protocols. In the meantime, users across the crypto ecosystem are once again reminded of the inherent risks of interacting with decentralized platforms. Despite the vision of decentralized finance offering greater transparency and fairness, vulnerabilities — whether technical bugs or security exploits — continue to threaten user funds in a rapidly evolving market.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-28 10:30:00

That kind of speculation isn’t thrown around lightly. But when early metrics, community strength, and market interest align, it becomes a question worth asking—especially when the token in question is MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . Bitcoin may have paved the path. But what if MAGACOINFINANCE is the one that knows how to sprint? MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Ground Without Flash—Just Fundamentals While many new tokens fight for visibility with theatrics, MAGACOINFINANCE is rising the way serious assets do: through structure.

It’s also becoming clear that this token isn’t just riding sentiment. It’s building an ecosystem. And in crypto, that’s the foundation from which real momentum grows. Bitcoin Set the Standard—But the Market’s Still Evolving No token in history has had the impact of Bitcoin . As the first and most secure digital asset, it’s earned its status through decentralization, scarcity, and first-mover dominance. Institutional interest continues to grow, and many believe it’s still only halfway through its long-term arc. MAGACOINFINANCE may not be aiming to replace Bitcoin—but it’s clearly built to join the conversation. Elsewhere in the Market: XRP, Ethereum, Tron, and Sei XRP remains a favorite among institutional adopters. Its focus on financial systems and compliance continues to push its relevance far beyond retail speculation. Ethereum dominates as the go-to platform for decentralized application deployment. Its modular ecosystem and continued upgrades keep it central to blockchain infrastructure. Tron is one of the most widely used chains for transactional volume, thanks to its fast throughput and strong presence in global payment ecosystems. Sei is emerging as a performance-first platform for traders and applications that need high-speed execution. Though early, its architecture has drawn attention from developers and funds alike. These projects are all impressive—but none are in MAGACOINFINANCE’s phase of pure potential. And that’s the difference. Final Word Could MAGACOINFINANCE.COM surpass Bitcoin’s $1.5 million milestone? Only time will tell. But the conditions that led Bitcoin to its crown—early adoption, market fit, and unwavering conviction—are beginning to show in this rising project. If there’s one token worth watching before the next big shift, it’s this one.

Bitcoin Solaris Offers Second Chance at Crypto Wealth on Solana’s Lightning-Fast Network,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/bitcoin-solaris-offers-second-chance-at-crypto-wealth-on-solanas-lightning-fast-network/,"The post Miss Bitcoin’s Early Days? Bitcoin Solaris Offers Second Chance at Crypto Wealth on Solana’s Lightning-Fast Network appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Back in 2010, buying Bitcoin for a few cents seemed silly. By 2017, it made early buyers millionaires. If you missed that boat, you’re not alone. But now, a new opportunity is catching attention. It’s called Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) — a powerful, next-generation cryptocurrency that could offer a second chance at crypto wealth. And this time, it runs on Solana’s lightning-fast network, making it easier, faster, and more accessible than ever. Bitcoin’s Legacy, Solana’s Speed Bitcoin laid the foundation for decentralized finance. Its fixed supply and security model created digital scarcity, turning it into a store of value like gold. But as Bitcoin grew, so did its issues. Transactions became slow, expensive, and energy-hungry. It wasn’t built for speed or scale. On the other hand, Solana became known for its blazing-fast transaction speeds (up to 65,000 TPS) and low fees. It brought blockchain to games, finance, and apps, but sacrificed some decentralization to do so. Bitcoin Solaris brings the best of both: Bitcoin’s trust and scarcity + Solana’s speed and modern design. Introducing Bitcoin Solaris: Built for the Future Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just a new coin — it’s a full ecosystem that fixes crypto’s biggest problems. Here’s what makes it stand out: Fixed Supply: Just like Bitcoin, BTC-S has a hard cap of 21 million tokens. No more will ever be created. Solana-Powered Speed: BTC-S handles up to 10,000 transactions per second, with confirmations in 2 seconds. Energy Efficiency: Uses 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin mining, thanks to a smarter dual-consensus design. Hybrid Architecture: Combines Proof-of-Work (PoW) for security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for performance. Smart Contract Ready: Full DeFi support through the Helios system, which powers lending, yield farming, DEXs, and cross-chain apps. BTC-S Isn’t Just Another Coin—It’s a New Chapter in Bitcoin This tech combo makes BTC-S a strong candidate for real-world use, not just something to hold and hope. Mining and Staking for Everyone Forget the old days of mining with huge rigs and massive electricity bills. With Bitcoin Solaris, anyone can mine — even with a phone. Solaris Nova App: Downloadable on Android, iOS, and desktop. Lets users mine BTC-S using their device’s full or partial power. Smart Optimization: The app adjusts based on your device, saving battery and preventing overheating. Cross-Platform: Works on phones, laptops, mining rigs — even web browsers. And for those who want passive income: Liquid Staking: Stake your BTC-S and get sBTC-S tokens (1:1), which can be traded, held, or used in DeFi — all while still earning rewards. No Lockups: You stay liquid. Your money stays usable. This makes BTC-S incredibly beginner-friendly and perfect for everyday users. Security, Audits, and Long-Term Vision Unlike many new projects, Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t skip on safety. It has: Ongoing smart contract audits Bug bounty programs to spot issues early Strict validator criteria for staking security On-chain governance, letting users vote on upgrades and protocol changes Join the Presale: Get In Early Bitcoin Solaris is currently in its presale phase, open to early believers who want to get in before full exchange listings and market hype. Start Date: April 28, 2025 Platform: Solana Round 1 Supply: 323,076 BTC-S tokens Bonus: 15% for early participants Redemption: 1:1 swap for native tokens once the BTC-S blockchain is live New Token, Familiar Strength—Meet BTC-S Today It’s the kind of moment crypto history is built on. A small step now could turn into major rewards later. Conclusion Bitcoin changed the world once, but not everyone caught it in time. Bitcoin Solaris gives you that rare second chance. With its powerful mix of Solana’s speed, mobile mining, flexible staking, and long-term vision, BTC-S is more than a token — it’s an ecosystem ready to grow. If you’ve been watching from the sidelines, wondering when the next big thing will come, this could be it. The tools are ready, the tech is solid, and the entry point is wide open. Don’t just watch the next Bitcoin happen — be part of it.

43899131,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153194,1745836243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,South Korea Payments: Danal and BC Card Forge Powerful Infrastructure Alliance,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korea-payment-partnership/,"Get ready for a significant shift in South Korea’s digital payment landscape! A major collaboration has just been announced that promises to streamline and expand prepaid electronic payment options across the nation. This move involves two key players in the South Korean financial technology (fintech) sector: Danal, a prominent integrated payment solutions provider, and BC Card, one of the country’s leading credit card processing companies. Their strategic partnership is set to integrate critical payment infrastructure , paving the way for enhanced services and wider adoption of prepaid solutions. Understanding the South Korea Payments Landscape South Korea has long been at the forefront of digital payments and technological adoption. The country boasts high internet penetration and a population eager to embrace convenient, cashless transactions. Mobile payments, credit cards, and various digital wallets are widely used, creating a dynamic and competitive environment for financial service providers. Companies like Danal have played a crucial role in this ecosystem, offering diverse payment methods and venturing into innovative areas like blockchain-based payments with initiatives like Paycoin. Meanwhile, BC Card holds a strong position in the traditional card processing market, serving a vast network of merchants and financial institutions. Their robust infrastructure is a backbone for countless transactions daily. The convergence of a forward-thinking payment integrator like Danal and a traditional giant like BC Card signals a strategic move to bridge the gap between established payment systems and emerging digital models, particularly in the prepaid sector. What Does This Fintech Partnership Entail? The core of this announced collaboration is the full integration of BC Card’s extensive payment processing infrastructure into Danal’s existing prepaid electronic payment model. This isn’t just a simple handshake; it’s a technical and operational merging designed to leverage the strengths of both entities. Announced on April 28, this partnership aims to significantly boost Danal’s integrated prepaid business. Here’s a breakdown of what this integration likely means: Expanded Merchant Network: Danal’s prepaid solutions could gain access to BC Card’s vast network of affiliated merchants, dramatically increasing the places where users can spend their prepaid balances. Improved Processing Efficiency: Utilizing BC Card’s established and high-capacity infrastructure can lead to faster, more reliable transaction processing for Danal’s prepaid users. Enhanced Security Features: Integration with a major card processor often brings enhanced security protocols and fraud prevention measures. Potential for New Services: The combined capabilities could enable the development of new prepaid products or features, potentially linking traditional card benefits with digital prepaid flexibility. This strategic alignment is a clear indicator of how companies are seeking to create seamless payment experiences for consumers in South Korea payments , combining the reach and reliability of traditional systems with the innovation of fintech solutions. Why is This Development Significant for Danal and BC Card? For Danal , this partnership represents a significant scaling opportunity. Access to BC Card’s infrastructure immediately expands their potential reach and operational capacity for prepaid services without needing to build the entire network from scratch. It allows them to focus on product development and user acquisition while relying on a proven processing backbone. This could solidify their position in the competitive prepaid market. For BC Card , collaborating with Danal allows them to tap into the growing digital prepaid segment and potentially integrate with Danal’s other innovative services, including those related to digital assets or unique payment methods. It’s a way for a traditional financial giant to stay relevant and engaged with the evolving digital payment landscape and participate directly in the growth of prepaid solutions. The broader impact of this fintech partnership lies in its potential to accelerate the shift towards digital transactions in South Korea. By making prepaid options more accessible and widely accepted, it encourages more consumers and businesses to adopt cashless methods. This contributes to the overall advancement of the digital economy. Potential Benefits and Challenges The benefits for users are clear: more places to use prepaid balances, potentially smoother transactions, and perhaps more integrated financial management tools. For businesses, it means potentially accepting another popular payment method via their existing BC Card terminals or integrations. However, challenges exist. Integrating complex systems requires careful planning and execution. Ensuring interoperability, maintaining security across platforms, and navigating regulatory considerations in the South Korea payments market are crucial tasks. Both companies will need to work closely to ensure a smooth transition and rollout of integrated services. Looking Ahead: The Future of Payment Infrastructure in South Korea This collaboration between Danal and BC Card is more than just a business deal; it’s a signal about the future direction of payment infrastructure . We are likely to see more such partnerships where fintech innovators team up with established financial institutions to create hybrid models that offer the best of both worlds: innovation, speed, and reach combined with stability, trust, and extensive networks. As digital assets and other new payment forms continue to emerge, the underlying infrastructure needs to be flexible and robust enough to support them. This partnership is a step towards building that future-ready foundation in South Korea. Summary: A Powerful Alliance for Digital Payments In conclusion, the strategic partnership between Danal and BC Card marks a significant development in the South Korean fintech scene. By integrating BC Card’s extensive payment processing infrastructure with Danal’s prepaid electronic payment model, the alliance is set to enhance the reach, efficiency, and usability of prepaid solutions across the country. This move benefits both companies by expanding their market presence and capabilities, while also promising a more seamless and widely accepted digital payment experience for consumers and businesses in South Korea. It underscores the growing trend of collaboration between traditional finance and innovative fintech firms to shape the future of payments.

Global crypto ETPs collectively posted $3.4 billion of inflows in the trading week of April 21–25, marking the highest level since December 2024, CoinShares reported on April 28. The inflows were just 13% below the all-time high of $3.85 billion seen in the trading week of Dec. 2–6, 2024, CoinShares previously reported . Renewed investment interest in crypto ETPs came as Bitcoin ( BTC ) broke back above $90,000 last week for the first time since briefly retesting the price mark in early March, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin ETFs lead as price consolidates above $90,000 Bitcoin was the primary winner among crypto ETPs last week, with investors pouring as much as $3.18 billion into BTC ETPs.

Reasons for the spike The latest inflows mark a notable trend reversal in crypto ETPs as the majority of issuers were seeing massive YTD inflows in the previous week, following a series of outflows in 2025. According to CoinShares’ James Butterfill, the new inflows likely came from concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings as well as a notable weakening of the US dollar , fueling demand for safe-haven assets . The inflows also came as gold prices saw a notable decline last week after breaking new highs at nearly $3,500 on April 22, dropping to as low as $3,275 on April 23, according to TradingView.

A small investment back then could have changed your life today. But what if another opportunity is knocking — one that combines the proven value of scarcity with the latest technology in speed, efficiency, and accessibility? That opportunity might be here with Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), the next-generation cryptocurrency launched on the Solana blockchain. The Bitcoin Boom: What We Learned Bitcoin’s rise from pennies to tens of thousands of dollars showed the world how powerful blockchain and scarcity could be. But along with its success came some limitations: Slow transaction speeds High energy consumption Centralized mining dominated by large players As newer chains emerged to solve these issues, many lost what made Bitcoin special — its security, scarcity, and decentralization. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris steps in. It keeps what made Bitcoin great and upgrades the rest with cutting-edge features built for modern users. Bitcoin Solaris: The Modern Answer to Old Problems Bitcoin Solaris combines Bitcoin’s proven model with the advanced performance of Solana’s high-speed infrastructure. BTC-S is not just a coin — it’s a full ecosystem ready for mass adoption.

In his April 28 post on X, Ethereum Foundation Co-executive Director Tomasz K. Stańczak said that the upcoming Pectra upgrade , slated for May 7, does not include EOF, stating: “The Pectra upgrade does not include EOF, nor [is it] intended to include EOF. Everything on Pectra is going as planned for the May 7th release.” EOF, which stands for Object Format, is a major overhaul of Ethereum’s execution engine intended to optimize and modularize the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The EOF proposal has sparked intense debate among Ethereum developers in recent months, with many criticizing it for its unnecessary complexity. Source: @velvetkeyboard Despite this, Ethereum leadership decided to go ahead with implementing Full EOF — but only with the next network upgrade, Fusaka, which is now tentatively slated for Q3/Q4 this year. Tim Beiko, who runs Ethereum’s core protocol meetings, told participants during Thursday’s All Core Developers call, “We can’t choose not to do something just because it’s complex.” You might also like: Vitalik Buterin responds to security concerns over new Pectra upgrade Pectra, the upgrade set for May 7, is aimed at improving Ethereum’s validator UX, making it possible for users to pay transaction fees in USD Coin ( USDC ) instead of ETH, increasing validator staking limit from, and more . Fusaka, the following upgrade, is more ambitious. Besides restructuring how smart contracts are written and executed through EOF, it aims to make Ethereum network more efficient and scalable. This is meant to improve the performance of Ethereum’s base layer, which has been steadily declining, leading several major players to sharply reduce their Ether holdings. According to Lookonchain, Galaxy Digital recently deposited 65,600 ETH (worth $105.5 million) to Binance and then withdrew 752,240 Solana ( SOL ), suggesting it sold its ETH to buy SOL. Paradigm has also recently cut its ETH exposure by selling 5,500 ETH ($8.66M) to an institutional brokerage platform Anchorage, according to EmberCN . “While institutional investors initially bought into the ‘ultra-sound money’ narrative, they’re now facing a reality where decreasing protocol revenue and weakening tokenomics create legitimate concerns,” Jayendra Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs, told Cointelegraph.

In a recent post , the former CEO of Binance teased the content of his latest interview with Turkish crypto advocate and blockchain game Pow Ahoy founder Erhan Ünal. When asked what the Bitcoin ( BTC ) creator’s true identity could be, CZ said he has no idea, but posits that there are strange theories floating around the crypto space. One theory that he mentioned was the possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto could be a time-travelling software that has returned to the past to invent Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto was an AI from the future. I was just asked ""who I think Satoshi might be"" in a live (still on-going) interview from Turkey. I tweet during meetings all the time. 😆 — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) April 27, 2025 “Satoshi Nakamoto was an AI from the future. I was just asked “who I think Satoshi might be” in a live (still on-going) interview from Turkey,” wrote CZ in his post. In his interview with Ünal and Uygar Taze, CZ stated that he has never had any interactions with the mysterious Bitcoin founder. Though, he admitted to knowing people who have had email exchanges with him. “I know people who have, in the early days. They had email exchanges, there’s maybe less than 10 people. So I don’t know who he is, but I think it’s good that we don’t [know who he is],” said CZ. You might also like: CZ mulls over letting the crypto community make his dog a meme coin Moreover, he is uncertain whether Satoshi Nakamoto is a single individual or a group of people. CZ acknowledged that whoever is behind Satoshi “covered his tracks really well,” since there were never any traces of an IP address or other definite indicators of who it could be. Hence, leading to the creation of more outlandish theories about Satoshi. “There are other sort of stranger answers. Where they might be a software coming back through time, all of these possibilities. It’s hard to imagine now but could be possible. But regardless, I don’t know who he is,” said CZ. The debate surrounding the identity behind Satoshi Nakamoto has been going on for years. It recently resurfaced in October 2024 when an HBO documentary titled “Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery” vowed to uncover the true identity of Bitcoin’s anonymous creator. In the end, the HBO identified Canadian cryptographer and developer Peter Todd as Satoshi Nakamoto. However, Todd has since denied claims that he is Satoshi and was ultimately forced into hiding due to safety concerns.

However, he does not believe gold is an equal match for Bitcoin. “Humans also have a tendency to not always use something old to estimate something new. We do not estimate the potential of Tesla using digital cars. We do no estimate the future of what Bitcoin can do based on what gold can do,” said CZ. “So Bitcoin will be way bigger than gold. I’m very convinced on that, it just takes time. I just don’t know when it will happen. But it will happen,” he continued.

Southeast Asian countries, which suffered the effects of Trump’s levies, are joining hands to increase intra-regional trade and diversify their export destinations. Trump’s “America First” ideology, which prioritizes the domestic over the international, depends on the assumption that the world needs America more than it needs the world. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argued that the “America First” ideology is a call for deeper collaboration and mutual respect among trade partners. Asia takes the lead in making deals to avoid Trump tariffs The president’s team has drafted a framework to handle negotiations with about 18 countries, including a template that indicates common areas of concern to guide the discussions. Bessent said on ABC News’ This Week with George Stephanopoulos that there are 18 important U.S. trading partners, including China, which is undergoing a “special negotiation.” He argued that the U.S. has a process in place, over the next 90 days, to negotiate with the other 17 nations. “Some of those are moving along very well, especially with the Asian countries,” he added. Bessent also mentioned last week that the U.S. and South Korea could reach an “agreement of understanding” on trade as soon as this week. The country’s officials said they see early July as the initial deadline for any negotiations to at least get tariff exemptions. The UK was slapped with 10% tariffs, and the Exchequer Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told reporters in Washington last week that “a deal can be done” but “we’re not going to rush.” Canada, whose levies aren’t affected by the 90-day reprieve, also wishes to take its time. The country’s Prime Minister, Mark Carney, argued that Canada doesn’t have to make a deal in the short term. Carney told reporters Thursday while campaigning in British Columbia ahead of the April 28 election that “ my government will do the right deal.” Switzerland, facing 31% tariffs on goods, said it’s one of 15 countries that will get “somewhat preferential treatment” after agreeing to tariff negotiations with the Trump administration. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter maintained that the tariffs will be held at 10% during the process, even if they extend beyond Trump’s 90-day tariff pause. Bloomberg reported that Japan plans to retaliate against any U.S. efforts to bring it into an economic bloc against China because of the importance of Tokyo’s trade ties with Beijing. Southeast Asia treads carefully between China and the U.S. China’s President Xi Jinping spent the third week of April visiting Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia in the wake of the actions of U.S. President Donald Trump . On April 2, the President imposed 49% tariffs on products from Cambodia, 46% on goods from Vietnam, and between 20%-30% on most other Southeast Asian countries. Xi Jinping wrote in Vietnam’s Nhan Dan newspaper that countries should work to advance a comprehensive and inclusive economic globalization. He also noted a need to protect the multilateral trading system, sustain the stability of global production and supply chains, and maintain an open and cooperative international environment. “China will persist in high-level openness, creating more opportunities for the world and also contributing to shared development with other countries through its own high-quality development.” -Xi Jinping, President of China. Jinping met with Malaysia’s King Sultan Ibrahim in Kuala Lumpur and touted a “new golden era ” of Chinese-Malaysian relations. The king also revealed new cooperation with China in various fields, including artificial intelligence. The country, which is the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc, was hit with a tariff of 24%. China’s President also met Cambodia’s Prime Minister, Hun Manet, in Phnom Penh and acknowledged that Beijing needs to bolster regional trade to offset the effect of steep U.S. levies. Though the country is trying to negotiate a reduction in tariffs, Jinping reportedly reminded them that both states were friends and Cambodia should not want to cut any deals at Beijing’s expense.

I upgrade ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) to a buy due to its strong recovery and positive crypto trends. ARKF, with a 13.4% EPS growth rate, benefits from bullish seasonal trends and a supportive technical chart. The ETF's portfolio is heavily weighted in growth sectors, with significant exposure to crypto, enhancing its long-term growth potential. Don’t count the bitcoin bull market out. While the world’s largest cryptocurrency fell from near $110,000 to below $80,000 from January through the April nadir, the relative chart of bitcoin to the S&P 500 is very close to all-time highs. A series of higher lows and higher highs dates back to late 2022. All the while, crypto-related fintech stocks have been volatile, but generally positive. I had a hold rating on the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) in the second quarter of 2024 . Shares have soared 30% since then, but it has been a wild ride. The Cathie Wood fund struggled through the fall but then took off when President Trump won re-election. Price action since Inauguration Day has been less stellar, with ARKF plunging from near $45 to below $28. But the ETF has rallied hard since mid-April, up 30% in a few weeks. Actually, it’s entire gain since my last analysis has come just April 7. I am upgrading the fund to a buy. Bitcoin vs SPX: Nearing New All-Time Highs Stockcharts.com According to the issuer , ARKF is an actively managed ETF that seeks long-term growth of capital. It aims to achieve this investment objective by investing under normal circumstances primarily in domestic and foreign equity securities of companies that are engaged in the fund’s investment theme of financial technology innovation. ARKF is a small ETF with just $905 million in assets under management as of April 25, 2025. Its annual expense ratio is moderate to high at 75 basis points, and the product does not have a trailing 12-month dividend yield . Share-price momentum is rated exceptionally strong by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system, but volatility is very high. Hence, the ETF Risk Grade is poor at a D- due to the elevated standard deviation and ARKF’s concentrated portfolio. Finally, liquidity is decent, given average daily volume of more than 400,000 shares, and the ETF’s median 30-day bid/ask spread is moderate at 9 basis points, per ARK Invest. For an update on the portfolio, the 1-star ETF by Morningstar plots on the far right side of the style box, indicating its bent toward the growth style. Much depends on how crypto performs and with industry-specific fundamental trends, such as Robinhood’s (HOOD) foray into attracting higher-net-worth investors. I concede that the valuation at more than 28 times earnings is not cheap, but ARKF’s long-term EPS growth rate is above that of the broader market at 13.4%. With bitcoin creeping higher and key momentum themes recovering, I assert that there is more left in the tank for the fund. ARKF: Portfolio & Factor Profiles Morningstar ARKF is a fintech ETF—more than 60% of the allocation is invested in the Information Technology and Financials sectors. Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary—a pair of growth corners of the market—round out ARKF’s portfolio. Of course, there’s a crypto play here since the product owns ARK’s bitcoin product. ARKF: Heavy on Growth with Bitcoin ETF Exposure Seeking Alpha Seasonally, we are entering a particularly bullish stretch. Over the past five years, returns have been strongest from May through August. So, if historical trends play out, the calendar will favor ARKF. ARKF: Bullish May-August Trends Seeking Alpha The Technical Take With a fair valuation given the earnings growth story, ARKF’s chart is encouraging. Notice in the graph below that shares retreated to a key long-term support line in the upper $20s. The long-term 200-day moving average remains upward sloping with price above that key trend-indicator line—something that can’t be said for the S&P 500. ARKF encountered selling pressure, however, right at the mid-2021 pullback-low of $44 back in Q1, so it was natural to expect a significant correction. But take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the chart that there was a minor bullish RSI divergence, which may portend a protracted recovery. Before that, a bearish divergence played out, leading to the steep retreat. For now, the mid-$40s remains resistance, while $28 is support. ARKF: Shares Hit Mid-$40 Resistance, Attract Buyers at Trendline Support Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on ARKF. The hard Q1-Q2 correction likely washed out weak hands, and I expect a further upswing given crypto price trends and seasonal/technical momentum.",BTC-USD|ARKF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-28 10:40:01
43899426,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153195,1745836825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,WLFI Leaders Meet Binance CZ: A Breakthrough Moment for Global Crypto Expansion?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wlfi-binance-cz-meeting/,"In a move that has piqued significant interest across the cryptocurrency world, leaders from World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto project notably linked to the Trump family, recently held a high-profile meeting with Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the co-founder of Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The meeting, announced by WLFI founders Zach Witkoff, Zak Folkman, and Chase Herro on the social media platform X, centered on pivotal discussions regarding the future trajectory of the digital asset space. The agenda reportedly included strategies for boosting global adoption of cryptocurrencies, establishing robust new industry standards, and driving the next wave of crypto innovation. What Did WLFI Leaders Discuss with Binance CZ? The core of the discussion between the WLFI leadership and Binance CZ revolved around accelerating the growth and acceptance of cryptocurrencies on a worldwide scale. This isn’t just about getting more people to buy crypto; it’s about building the infrastructure, understanding, and regulatory frameworks necessary for digital assets to become truly integrated into the global economy. For a project like WLFI, connecting with a figure as influential as CZ and a platform as dominant as Binance signals serious ambition. Key topics reportedly included: Strategies for Global Reach: How to overcome geographical and cultural barriers to make crypto accessible everywhere. Setting Industry Benchmarks: The importance of clear, reliable standards for security, compliance, and user protection to build trust. Fostering Innovation: Exploring new technologies and use cases beyond simple trading, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and blockchain applications. The meeting highlights the growing interconnectedness within the crypto ecosystem, where projects, even relatively new ones, seek collaboration with established giants to navigate the complex path towards mainstream success. Driving Global Crypto Expansion: Opportunities and Challenges The vision of Global Crypto Expansion is ambitious and faces a multitude of factors. On one hand, the potential is immense: reaching underserved populations, facilitating faster and cheaper cross-border transactions, and creating new economic opportunities. On the other hand, significant hurdles remain: Regulatory Uncertainty: Different countries have vastly different approaches to crypto regulation, creating fragmentation and complexity. Education and Awareness: Many people still lack understanding of how crypto works and its potential benefits, leading to hesitation and skepticism. Infrastructure Gaps: Access to reliable internet, smartphones, and financial services varies globally. Security Concerns: Protecting users from scams, hacks, and fraud is paramount for building trust. Discussions between WLFI and Binance CZ likely touched upon how collaboration and shared knowledge can help address some of these challenges, leveraging Binance’s vast experience in operating across diverse regulatory environments. Boosting Crypto Adoption: The Path to the Mainstream Achieving widespread Crypto Adoption requires more than just technological innovation; it demands usability, trust, and regulatory clarity. Projects and platforms must work together to simplify the user experience, enhance security measures, and engage with regulators proactively. The meeting between WLFI and CZ suggests a focus on these aspects. Binance, with its massive user base and diverse product offerings, has been at the forefront of onboarding new users globally. Learning from their strategies and potentially collaborating on initiatives could be invaluable for WLFI’s own growth plans. Furthermore, the involvement of a project with ties to a prominent political family, like the Trump family crypto connection via WLFI, could potentially influence public perception and even regulatory discussions, although this remains to be seen. Why Industry Standards Matter for Sustainable Growth Establishing clear and robust Industry Standards is non-negotiable for the long-term health and growth of the crypto ecosystem. Standards build trust, facilitate interoperability, and provide a framework for responsible innovation. Topics likely discussed include: Best practices for security protocols. Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. Guidelines for decentralized governance and transparency. Interoperability standards between different blockchains and protocols. Binance has played a significant role in shaping some industry practices through its sheer scale and influence. Discussions with WLFI leaders on this topic underscore a shared recognition that a more standardized and compliant industry is better positioned for mainstream acceptance and sustainable expansion. The Trump Family Crypto Connection: What Does WLFI’s Association Mean? The description of WLFI as a “ Trump Family Crypto project” adds a unique layer of interest and potential implications. While the exact nature of the family’s involvement isn’t detailed in the announcement, such an association can bring significant attention and potentially influence. It could: Increase visibility and public profile for WLFI. Potentially open doors to specific networks or influence spheres. Subject the project to increased scrutiny from media, regulators, and the public. The meeting with CZ, a figure who has also navigated complex regulatory landscapes and public attention, could offer WLFI valuable insights on managing the unique challenges and opportunities that come with a high-profile association. Looking Ahead: Implications of the Meeting While the details shared publicly are brief, the meeting between WLFI leaders and Binance CZ is noteworthy. It signifies that even prominent figures like CZ are engaging with newer projects, particularly those with potentially influential backing. It underscores a shared interest in overcoming hurdles to achieve wider crypto adoption and global expansion. Whether this meeting leads to concrete collaborations, partnerships, or simply serves as a high-level exchange of ideas remains to be seen. However, it certainly puts WLFI on the radar of many within the crypto community and beyond, highlighting the project’s ambition and its potential connections at the highest levels of the industry. The path to mass crypto adoption and truly global expansion is complex, requiring collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to building trust and establishing clear standards. Meetings like this, bringing together different players in the ecosystem, are crucial steps in that journey.

While some initially speculated that the increase was tied to positive developments in the privacy coin’s adoption or technology, new evidence suggests the spike may actually be linked to a large money laundering operation. A suspicious transaction involving 3,520 Bitcoin ( BTC ), valued at approximately $330 million, was flagged by pseudonymous blockchain sleuth ZachXBT, who revealed in an X post on Monday that the stolen funds were quickly laundered through multiple crypto exchanges, with XMR being one of the key assets involved.

While some mistakenly linked the price surge to Monero’s proposed upgrade that could make it more compliance-friendly, the rally quickly faded after the money laundering news surfaced, raising doubts about the jump’s sustainability.

In an announcement on April 25, crypto exchange Binance said it will list SIGN on April 28, 2025, at 11:00 UTC, with trading pairs against USDT, USDC, BNB, FDUSD, and TRY. The tokens will be available across Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Base networks. The TGE for SIGN is scheduled an hour earlier, at 10:00 UTC on the same day. During the event, SIGN tokens will be minted on Ethereum and bridged to other supported networks, officially kicking off the launch of Sign Protocol’s mainnet. Before spot trading starts, SIGN will be featured on Binance Alpha , Binance’s early-stage project platform, starting at 10:00 UTC. Binance will also airdrop 1,500 SIGN tokens to users who have at least 65 Alpha Points, with tokens set to arrive in Alpha accounts within 10 minutes after trading goes live. Alpha Points are a system Binance uses to reward user activity within the Binance Wallet and Alpha ecosystem. Separately, Binance will airdrop 200 million SIGN tokens to BNB holders who subscribed to Simple Earn or On-Chain Yields between April 15 and April 19, 2025.

At launch, about 1.2 billion tokens, or roughly 12% of the supply, will be in circulation. Out of the total supply, 40% is allocated to the community, with 10% or 1 billion tokens set aside for TGE airdrops and the rest for future rewards and ecosystem growth. 20% is reserved for early backers, 10% for the founding team, 10% for the foundation, and another 10% to support the broader ecosystem, with vesting schedules in place for team and investor allocations. Besides Binance, other exchanges like Bybit, Bitget, Gate.io, and MEXC have also announced plans to list SIGN on the same day. What is Sign Protocol? Sign Protocol started back in 2020 under the name EthSign, before rebranding as it expanded into omni-chain attestations. It’s a protocol that helps decentralized applications verify and attest information across different blockchains. It lets users easily create, store, and access verified attestations, aiming to make cross-chain verification more efficient, secure, and developer-friendly. The network is powered by the SIGN token, which covers attestation fees, rewards participants who help maintain and secure the protocol, and gives the community a say in future upgrades and protocol changes. In January 2025, the project raised $16 million from a group of major investors, including YZi Labs (formerly Binance Labs), Hack VC, Amber Group, and Altos Ventures, showing strong backing for its vision of building Web3 trust infrastructure. The project is also backed by Sequoia Capital and Circle Ventures, in an earlier $12 million seed funding round in March 2022.

Speaking at a town hall near Atlanta on Friday, Ossoff said Trump’s decision to offer exclusive access to top investors in his personal cryptocurrency was a clear case of “selling access” to the presidency. “I mean, I saw just 48 hours ago, he is granting audiences to people who buy his meme coin There is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense,” the senator said. Ossoff, who is running for re-election in Georgia this year, has been a consistent critic of Trump’s conduct in office. He previously voted to convict Trump during the former president’s second impeachment trial in 2021, though he was not yet in Congress for the first. The latest controversy centres on an event announced last week, where the top 220 holders of Trump’s personal memecoin, TRUMP, are invited to a private dinner at Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C. The gathering is scheduled for May 22 and also promises a VIP reception for the top 25 wallets. The Official Trump Memecoin website currently displays a leaderboard tracking eligible wallets.

Separately, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff have called for a formal ethics investigation, urging the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to review Trump’s involvement with the memecoin dinner event. In a letter sent the same day, they warned that selling exclusive access to the president in connection with a personal financial asset could breach ethics laws , bribery statutes, and the U.S. Constitution’s emoluments clause. “The American people deserve the unwavering assurance that access to the presidency is not being offered for sale to the highest bidder,” Warren and Schiff wrote, describing the situation as a “grave” threat to public trust. As previously reported by crypto.news, TRUMP rallied over 70% after news broke that the president was offering a private dinner to top memecoin holders. In their letter, the senators said such actions raise concerns that the president “may be engaging in ‘pay to play’ corruption.” “This new scheme is demonstrative of President Trump’s continued and concerning efforts to use his own name and likeness as President, as well as those of his family and the presidential office, for personal financial gain,” they added. As of April 28, the TRUMP leaderboard shows that Tron founder Justin Sun holds the top spot after registering his HTX cold storage wallet for the exclusive dinner. According to blockchain data, Sun’s wallet currently holds around $18.91 million worth of TRUMP tokens. Other top wallets include one linked to MemeCore, a project known for developing meme-focused crypto assets, listed as MeCo, and another registered under Wintermute, a major algorithmic trading firm, listed as CASE. In related news, the team behind the Official Trump Memecoin recently denied rumours that investors need to hold at least $300,000 worth of TRUMP to qualify for the dinner event.

Last week, the digital asset market recorded its highest amount of inflows since mid-December 2024 and the third-largest weekly inflow of all-time. Digital asset investment products saw $3.4 billion in inflows coming in from all providers. BlackRock’s iShares ETFs contributed the largest share by product, with weekly inflows amounting to $1.5 billion. Other digital asset investment products that saw large inflows include ARK ;s 21Shares with $621 million and Fidelity Wise Origin with $574 million. CoinShares head of research James Butterfill believes the influx of capital into digital asset investment products may be due to investors flocking to safe haven assets as a hedge against the economic uncertainty posed by more conventional assets. “We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the U.S. dollar are the reasons investors have turned towards digital assets,” wrote Butterfill.

Ethereum ( ETH ) investment products also saw $183 million inflows last week, effectively breaking the asset’s previous 8-week streak of outflows. On the other hand, Solana ( SOL ) became the only altcoin with outflows last week, reaching $5.7 million. Other altcoins saw little to no activity, with the exception of SUI ( SUI ) and XRP ( XRP ) which saw inflows amounting to $20.7 million and $31.6 million respectively. CoinShares’ latest report also noted that U.S. investors have been adding to their positions, contributing the largest share of inflows by region. Last week, U.S. saw inflows reaching $3.3 billion. Not only that, Germany and Switzerland also saw inflows of $51.5 million and $41.4 million respectively. This reflects the positive market sentiment present in the broader global landscape, with only Brazil and Canada experiencing outflows.

While early days, it was a similar surge in inflows during October and November that fueled the previous aggressive rally.” Matrixport You might also like: Nasdaq soars 6% for the week as Bitcoin eyes $100k retest The analysts say traders should “closely monitor” stablecoin capitalization data as a “notable uptick is now emerging.” At the same time, Markus Thielen’s 10x Research reported that two of its reversal indicators had turned bearish and that the stochastics oscillator had risen to 95%, further suggesting short-term downside risk. However, the firm noted that this could represent a “consolidation phase before a potential breakout above $100,000,” and added that “this consolidation phase will be short.” As of press time, Bitcoin is trading at $94,830, up 8.54% on a weekly timeframe.

DeepBook Protocol ( DEEP ) price is up over 35% in the past 24 hours, currently trading around $0.23 with volume surging almost 400%. Today’s surge extends the explosive rally that began on April 22, when DEEP price broke out of the consolidation range between $0.05 and $0.10, where it had been trading for about a month. The catalyst behind the breakout was Binance ’s launch of a USD-margined perpetual contract for DEEP tokens with up to 50x leverage. This sent the price soaring from an opening level of $0.08984 to an intraday high of $0.1849 on April 22, marking 105% pump in a single day. Momentum continued the next day, April 23, after DEEP was listed on the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit , sending the price to a new new intraday high of $0.2315 before it entered a brief consolidation phase. After a few days of sideways movement, DeepBook exploded again on April 27 and is continuing to climb.

A descending trendline, connecting the lower highs from February through mid-April, was decisively breached around April 18–19. Currently, DeepBook is trading around $0.23 with strong bullish momentum, as reflected not only in price action but also in technical indicators. The MACD continues to show a strong bullish crossover with an expanding histogram, indicating that bulls are in control. Bollinger Bands on the daily chart are expanding sharply, signaling increased volatility. RSI is deep in overbought territory above 84, suggesting that while momentum is firmly bullish, a pullback is coming. From a structural perspective, the price is now approaching resistance around the $0.25-$0.26 zone, where it peaked briefly in early February. If the momentum continues, the next key target lies between $0.28 and $0.30, corresponding to the first lower high touching the descending trendline. On the downside, immediate support can be found around $0.18 -$0.19, the former breakout zone from April 22. When DEEP price experiences an pullback, holding this support would be crucial to maintain the current bullish structure. A deeper retracement could find support around the $0.15, where the price briefly consolidated before its latest leg higher.

At one point, Pi’s price soared to $3, sparking excitement among its 60 million-strong user base. The community, known as “Pioneers,” is rallying behind an ambitious Pi Ambassador campaign, aimed at creating a global movement to boost the coin’s valuation. But while the campaign generates buzz, experts remain skeptical. Can hype and social media chatter replace real-world value and utility? What is the Pi Ambassador Campaign? Pi Ambassadors are tasked with promoting the Pi Network’s vision of achieving the “Global Consensus Value” (GCV), a target set at $314,159, derived from Pi’s mathematical value. With representatives appointed in various countries, their role is to organize events and engage in online activism to strengthen the Pi community.

Global GCV Core Team April… pic.twitter.com/JrdjbJqNkw — JoJo-π (@jojo102102) April 13, 2025 Why Experts Are Skeptical Despite the global campaign’s enthusiasm, experts caution that a lofty price target alone won’t create long-term value. For Pi to succeed, it must prove real-world utility and functionality—something many believe the project lacks at this stage. Pi Network’s Criticisms: Is It a Ponzi Scheme? Critics argue that the Pi Ambassador campaign resembles a multi-level marketing (MLM) or Ponzi scheme, focusing more on growing a network of supporters than on building a functioning, valuable product. They stress that community hype won’t create liquidity, demand, or the necessary use cases for the coin’s success. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Coin Price Drops 4% as New Whale Buys 48 Million Tokens: What It Means for Investors , Pi Coin Price Action: What’s Happened So Far? Pi saw impressive price jumps following the mainnet launch. On February 20, its price spiked from $0.113 to $2.20—a 2,692.85% surge. However, the excitement was short-lived. By February 27, the price had dropped by 78.05%, and in the last 30 days, it fell 24.9%. The price has continued its decline, slipping by 2.5% in the last seven days and 3.1% in the past 24 hours. The Road Ahead for Pi Network While Pi Ambassadors continue to rally the community, the future of Pi Network hinges on more than just buzz. Without exchange listings, liquidity, and real use cases, Pi risks fading into obscurity. The Pi Ambassador campaign may keep the community engaged, but it’s the project’s real-world adoption and market fundamentals that will determine its future success. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ready to navigate the week ahead? One of the key events to keep an eye on in the digital asset space is the scheduled release of previously locked tokens. These events, often referred to as crypto token unlocks , can sometimes add significant supply to the market, potentially influencing price dynamics. Understanding the upcoming token unlock schedule is crucial for any savvy investor. Why Do Crypto Token Unlocks Matter? Token unlocks occur when tokens held by founders, teams, early investors, or advisors become transferable or available for sale after a vesting period. When a large number of tokens are released simultaneously, it increases the circulating supply. While not always the case, a sudden increase in supply can lead to selling pressure if recipients decide to cash out, potentially impacting the token’s price. Monitoring these events is a key part of market analysis. This Week’s Significant Token Releases According to data from DropsTab, several major projects have significant token release events scheduled for this week. Here’s a breakdown of the notable unlocks to watch: Token Amount Unlocked USD Value (Approx.) % of Circulating Supply Unlock Time (UTC) WLD 5.02 million $5.65 million 0.38% April 29, 00:00 TRUMP 493,827.16 $7.25 million 0.25% April 29, 06:00 OP 32.21 million $24.90 million 1.94% April 30, 00:00 KMNO 229.35 million $14.24 million 16.99% April 30, 00:00 ALT 240 million $7.26 million 7.35% April 30, 06:00 BONK 504.4 billion $9.43 million 0.65% May 1, 00:00 DYDX 8.35 million $5.32 million 1.09% May 1, 15:00 ENA 94.19 million $32.16 million 1.7% May 2, 08:00 Which Altcoin Unlocks Should You Watch Closely? While all unlocks listed are significant in terms of USD value, some represent a larger percentage of the current circulating supply than others. The altcoin unlock events for KMNO (16.99%), ALT (7.35%), OP (1.94%), and ENA (1.7%) are particularly noteworthy because the released tokens constitute a more substantial portion of the currently available supply. A large percentage unlock could theoretically have a more pronounced impact on price, although this is not guaranteed and depends on various factors, including overall market sentiment, the project’s fundamentals, and who receives the tokens. What Does This Crypto Schedule Mean for Investors? Keeping track of the crypto schedule for these unlocks is an essential part of due diligence. Here are a few things to consider: Potential Volatility: Prices of the affected tokens might experience increased volatility around the unlock times. Research: Look into who is receiving the unlocked tokens (team, investors, etc.) as this can sometimes indicate their likelihood to sell. Market Context: Evaluate the broader market conditions. In a bull market, unlock pressure might be absorbed more easily than in a bear market. Risk Management: If you hold these tokens, be aware of the dates and consider your risk tolerance and strategy. It’s important to remember that a token unlock is just one factor among many influencing price. Project development updates, partnerships, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment also play significant roles. However, being informed about scheduled supply increases is always beneficial. In Conclusion: Stay Informed on Token Unlocks This week presents several key token unlock events across various altcoins. While the exact impact is difficult to predict, understanding when and how many tokens are entering circulation is vital for making informed decisions in the fast-paced crypto market. Keep these dates on your radar and combine this information with your broader market analysis.

The MUTM token is available in the fourth phase of eleven presale stages where buyers can obtain tokens at $0.025 per token. The DeFi project centers its efforts around lending and borrowing services by providing lasting utility instead of optimistic yet short-lived market trends. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leads the market through its defined approach to build wealth systems which will revolutionize wealth-building in 2025. The combination of organized token mechanics and raising investor interest creates an opportunity that current buyers can capitalize on successfully. The things that make it unique within the competitive market segment have yet to be exposed. Solana (SOL) Faces Headwinds Solana (SOL) is stumbling as market dynamics shift. Once celebrated for speed, it grapples with network congestion and declining developer activity. Prices hover around $150, but bearish signals loom. Analysts note fading momentum, with transaction volumes dipping 15% in Q1 2025. Investors seeking high-yield opportunities are turning elsewhere, as Solana’s ecosystem struggles to innovate beyond NFTs and dApps. Its reliance on speculative trading leaves it vulnerable to volatility, unlike projects with structured financial models. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Pre-sale Phase Attracts Significant Market Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently operates at phase 4 of its development during which they offer tokens for $0.025. Valid investors have been quickly purchasing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens ahead of phase 5 because it initiates a 20% price increase from $0.025 to $0.03, thus delivering 20% gains for existing token holders. The presale has accumulated $7.2 million in funding due to strong investor belief and enthusiasm. The initial projected 140% Tokenomics returns for MUTM reach up to 9,900% when the price reaches $2.50. The team recently initiated a new dashboard that offers bonus tokens to the leading 50 token holders who maintain their positions in the ranking. Through gamified rewards the project obtains higher engagement that propels phase 4 toward fast sales completion. Innovative Lending Drives Value Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is establishing new DeFi standards using a two-way lending system which merges peer-to-peer interactions with peer-to-contract mechanisms. Users earn passive revenue through asset lending whereas they access borrowing services by establishing collateral which is backed by additional funds to maintain stability. The method eliminates the intense price swings which affect speculative tokens. A smart contract audit conducted by CertiK reaches its final stages before the team releases results through social channels for enhanced trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM secures both skeptical investors who value security and ambitious investors seeking utility. The revenue resettlement system of MUTM sustains market demand by redirecting profits directly to token stakeholders. The innovative approach makes MUTM stand out among other projects within the upcoming 2025 surge of DeFi development. A Smarter Path to Millions The market conditions put intense pressure on legacy token Solana (SOL) to maintain steady growth rates because investors make their decisions based on market dynamics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM enables investors to access the opportunities presented by high-yield DeFi solutions through a well-planned process. The platform has attracted more than 9,100 investors who have collectively contributed $7.2 million toward the token through its presale program that precedes the scheduled phase 5 price adjustment. MUTM presents an attractive investment by offering 140% listing gains and potentially reaching $2.50 in post-launch market value after a 9,900% increase. Potential millionaires for 2025 should currently explore the investment opportunity in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Safely acquire tokens through the official website presale before the chance to purchase at $0.025 expires.

43899990,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153197,1745838031,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Altcoin Season Index Reveals Deep Bitcoin Season,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-bitcoin-2/,"Are you watching the crypto market closely? If so, you’ve likely heard terms like ‘Altcoin Season’ or ‘Bitcoin Season’ being thrown around. These aren’t just buzzwords; they refer to distinct phases in the market cycle where either altcoins collectively outperform Bitcoin or Bitcoin leads the pack. A key metric used to gauge this is the Altcoin Season Index , tracked by reputable cryptocurrency price data platform CoinMarketCap (CMC). This index provides a snapshot of where the market stands relative to these cycles. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? According to data from CoinMarketCap, the Altcoin Season Index recently registered a reading of 15. This figure remained unchanged from the previous day as of 00:28 UTC on April 28. What does a score of 15 signify? It’s a clear signal that the market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . The index itself is a simple yet powerful tool. It measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days, specifically comparing their gains against Bitcoin’s performance during the same period. Note that stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from this calculation to give a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. How is Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season Defined? The CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. The threshold for determining which ‘season’ the market is in is based on the percentage of the top 100 altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day window: Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have performed better than Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score would typically be high, often 75 or above. Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score would be low, typically 25 or below. Neither Season: If the performance falls somewhere in between (more than 25% but less than 75% of altcoins outperforming Bitcoin), the market is considered to be in a transition phase or simply ‘Neither Season’. With the index currently sitting at 15, it firmly places the market in Bitcoin Season. What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for the Crypto Market and Your Altcoin Performance? Being in Bitcoin Season suggests that over the past three months, a significant majority of the largest altcoins have failed to keep pace with Bitcoin’s price movements. Bitcoin has been the dominant performer among the top assets. This phase often coincides with periods where Bitcoin sees strong upward momentum, sometimes attracting capital away from altcoins as investors prioritize the perceived safety and liquidity of BTC. Alternatively, it can happen when the overall market is consolidating or experiencing a downturn, and Bitcoin holds its value better or declines less sharply than altcoins. For investors holding altcoins, Bitcoin Season can be challenging. While Bitcoin might be making gains, their altcoin portfolios may be lagging behind or even decreasing in value relative to BTC. This divergence highlights the varying risk profiles and market dynamics between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market. Why Are We Seeing Bitcoin Season Now? Several factors can contribute to a period of Bitcoin Season. Recent strong performance by Bitcoin, perhaps driven by macroeconomic factors, institutional interest, or anticipation of events like the halving, can cause it to outshine altcoins. When Bitcoin rallies hard, it often sucks liquidity from altcoins in the short term as traders consolidate positions into the market leader. Conversely, periods of market uncertainty can also lead to Bitcoin Season. In times of volatility or fear, investors often retreat to Bitcoin, viewing it as the less risky asset compared to the vast and often more volatile altcoin landscape. This flight to ‘quality’ within the crypto space strengthens Bitcoin’s relative performance. Actionable Insights During Bitcoin Season Understanding the current market season based on the Altcoin Season Index can inform investment strategies. During Bitcoin Season: Focus on Bitcoin: This period historically favors Bitcoin. Investors might prioritize accumulating BTC or trading its movements. Evaluate Altcoin Positions: It might be a time to re-evaluate altcoin holdings. Are certain altcoins showing resilience? Are others underperforming significantly? Look for Opportunities: While many altcoins lag, some niche projects might still perform well based on specific news or developments. However, broad altcoin rallies are less likely during this phase. Manage Risk: Altcoins can be more volatile, especially when Bitcoin is dominating. Proper risk management becomes even more crucial. It’s important to remember that the Altcoin Season Index is a historical look (90 days) and not a predictive tool. Market dynamics can change rapidly, and a shift back towards Altcoin Season is always possible, often following a significant move or consolidation in Bitcoin’s price. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Current Market Phase The CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index currently signals that the crypto market is firmly in Bitcoin Season. This means Bitcoin has been the dominant performer among the top 100 assets over the past three months. While this phase presents challenges for broad altcoin outperformance, it also offers opportunities for strategic positioning, particularly focusing on Bitcoin or carefully selecting altcoins that demonstrate relative strength. Keeping an eye on this index, alongside other market indicators, can help investors navigate the ever-evolving landscape of the crypto market.

The post stated: “BREAKING: Ripple President Monica Long announced that Ripple will provide the layer to enable banks to connect and utilize the XRP-Ledger!” The announcement was accompanied by a video clip of Monica Long speaking during an interview with CNBC. BREAKING: @Ripple President Monica Long announced that Ripple will provide the layer to enable banks to connect and utilize the #XRP -Ledger! pic.twitter.com/eLG6W9ysND — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) April 26, 2025 Ripple to Act as the Necessary Intermediary Layer In the video, Monica Long addressed the challenges and realities of integrating blockchain technology into traditional banking systems. She stated, “It’s not realistic that the existing systems like banks are going to plug directly into the blockchain. They do need some connective tissue. That’s what we provide.” Long clarified that Ripple’s role is to act as the necessary intermediary layer that enables financial institutions to access and utilize blockchain technology, particularly through the XRP Ledger. Infrastructure Services to Facilitate Blockchain Integration Elaborating further, Long described what infrastructure means within this context. She explained that infrastructure services include on-ramps to convert fiat currencies into digital assets and off-ramps to convert them back. Secure custody solutions are also part of the infrastructure Ripple aims to offer, ensuring that institutions have a safe and compliant method to store digital assets. In addition, Ripple intends to provide stablecoins and tokenization services to assist institutions in bringing traditional assets onto the blockchain. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Emphasis on the XRP Ledger’s Efficiency for Institutional Use Long also reinforced Ripple’s historic connection to the XRP Ledger. She reminded viewers that Ripple’s origin is rooted in the development of the XRP Ledger by three developers. She emphasized that Ripple has always believed in creating use cases that leverage the unique efficiencies of the XRP Ledger . According to her remarks, the range of services Ripple is currently focused on building will primarily operate through the XRP Ledger, ensuring financial institutions can adopt blockchain technology more easily and securely. Strengthening Financial Institutions’ Access to Blockchain JackTheRippler’s post highlighted the significance of this announcement for the broader crypto and banking industries. The XRP Ledger, originally designed to facilitate fast and cost-effective transactions, is positioned to become a key platform for institutional blockchain adoption. By serving as the connective infrastructure, Ripple aims to bridge the traditional financial system and decentralized technology, facilitating a smoother transition without requiring banks to overhaul their existing systems. Ripple’s strategy, as detailed by Monica Long, underscores a strong commitment to enabling financial institutions to benefit from blockchain’s efficiencies. Ripple’s provision of critical services like fiat on-ramps, custody solutions, stablecoin support, and asset tokenization layers will ensure that banks can interact with the XRP Ledger seamlessly. As this strategy unfolds, it would enhance institutional trust and participation in the blockchain ecosystem, with Ripple at the center of this evolution.

The cryptocurrency rose 0.75% in the past 24 hours, turning positive for the year and decoupling from traditional risk assets as investors questioned the durability of the U.S.’s role as the global financial anchor. The broader market, measured through the CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index, rose 2.2%. Stock-index futures in the U.S. are pointing to a slight drop and gold fell over 1% with investors likely taking profit from the precious metal’s 25% year-to-date rally. Equities endured a sell-off after China denied talks with the U.S. to reach a tariff deal. “Bitcoin has acted less like a liquid levered version of levered US equity beta and more like the non-sovereign issued store of value that it is,” Greg Cipolaro, the global head of research at NYDIG, wrote in a note. While the cryptocurrency’s longer-term correlation to U.S. equities remains high, the short-term price action points to a market starting to treat BTC less like a tech stock proxy and more like a non-sovereign safe haven, according to NYDIG’s report. Options and futures data suggest bitcoin’s rally, which saw it rise 9% last week, is still in its early stages. Funding rates for offshore perpetual swaps only recently turned positive, and call overwriting remains more popular than aggressive bullish positioning. Bitcoin’s appeal as a politically neutral asset appears to be growing. The note shows that since President Donald Trump’s April 2 ""Liberation Day,"" bitcoin has outperformed U.S. Treasuries, the Swiss franc and gold. The broader backdrop remains volatile. Measures of equity (VIX), bond (MOVE), and currency (CVIX) volatility have jumped in recent weeks. While they are expected to recede slightly, the outlook is for them to remain elevated for the foreseeable future, the note said. Despite bitcoin’s growing appeal, macro and geopolitical events remain “the primary drivers of flow,” according to Jake O., an OTC trader at Wintermute who flagged in an email that bitcoin call calendar spreads targeting $110,000 in June remain “the preferred structure for those reaching for topside."" This week investors will see an inflow of major corporate earnings reports, as well as the latest consumer income and expenditure report and April's nonfarm payrolls on Friday. The data could provide further insights into a potential earlier-than-expected interest-rate cut, which Trump has been calling for. Stay alert!

""We are agreeable to collaborating with you to reach a white hat agreement,"" the attackers said in an on-chain message sent to Loopscale. ""However, we would like to negotiate the bounty percentage; our expectation is 20%. To demonstrate our commitment to a cooperative approach, we will immediately return the 5000 wSOL funds following the transmission of this message."" ""However, a successful collaboration is contingent on two conditions: first, a full release of liability for our actions, and second, an official reconciliation announcement from your team, along with notification to all on-chain partners to cease fund tracking and freezing,"" the message added. The attackers stole over 5.7 million USDC and 1,200 SOL (worth around $180,000 at the time) from Loopscale’s storage pools on April 26. They manipulated the system Loopscale uses to set prices for its RateX PT token, which helps decide how much digital assets are worth when used as collateral (like a deposit for a loan). The hackers tricked the system into thinking the token’s price was different, allowing them take more money than they should have. This affected 12% of all the money Loopscale was holding, specifically hurting people who had put their money into the USDC and SOL vaults. Loopscale stopped all activity on the platform to prevent more theft. It initially let some users repay loans while keeping withdrawals from the vaults locked to stay safe. The protocol figured out the problem was in the price-checking system, not the RateX token itself. On Sunday, it offered the hacker a deal: Return 90% of the stolen money (worth $5.3 million) and keep 10% (about $592,000) with no legal trouble.

According to a recent update from crypto services firm DFX Swiss, SPAR grocery stores will soon expand their acceptance of Bitcoin ( BTC ) as a payment option across Switzerland. SPAR’s crypto payment system is powered by OpenCryptoPay, a platform developed by DFX Swiss, which uses the Bitcoin Lightning Network to enable fast and low-cost transactions. To complete their purchase, shoppers simply scan a static QR code presented by the cashier on checkout. The move follows successful internal trials in two locations — first Zug, and then Kreuzlingen. “Zug was just the prototype location — we will soon be rolling it out throughout Switzerland,” OpenCryptoPay said on X.

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is urging five U.S. states to abandon their lawsuits over the company’s staking services, warning that the legal actions are harming consumers and creating uncertainty. In a blog statement , the U.S.-based public crypto exchange said that while most regulators have backed off, actions in California, New Jersey, Maryland, Washington, and Wisconsin “continue to harm residents in those states.” According to the exchange’s estimates, residents in those states “have missed out on an estimated $90 million+ in staking rewards since June 2023” because of cease-and-desist orders still in place. “ the SEC and ten states sued Coinbase, alleging that our staking services were securities. Several of those states went even further by issuing cease-and-desist orders that immediately prevented Coinbase —and only Coinbase — from staking new assets for users.” Coinbase As of late April, several crypto exchanges besides Coinbase, including Kraken and Binance.US, are also offering staking services for a range of cryptocurrencies, though their availability varies by state. Coinbase framed the remaining lawsuits as out of step with the broader regulatory direction, adding that “continued litigation by the holdout states is more indefensible than ever.” The exchange also warned that these lawsuits “don’t protect consumers – they confuse them and expose them to greater risk.” In late April, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield sued Coinbase, claiming the company didn’t do enough to protect consumers from unregistered and risky cryptocurrencies, breaking Oregon’s securities laws. Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal criticized Oregon’s lawsuit as a “copycat” of the SEC’s previous action, asserting that it recycles arguments the federal agency has already abandoned.

A significant Bitcoin deposit has just occurred, involving an address connected to the Lorenzo Protocol. A Significant Bitcoin Deposit Event Unfolds According to insights shared by on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X, an address linked to the Lorenzo Protocol recently moved a substantial amount of Bitcoin. Specifically, 560 BTC was deposited into major cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and OKX, over the past ten hours. This movement of 560 BTC is notable not just for its size, currently valued at tens of millions of dollars, but also because of its origin. Addresses associated with specific protocols or early participants are often tracked closely by market observers seeking to understand potential selling pressure or strategic maneuvers by large holders. Understanding the Lorenzo Protocol Connection The Lorenzo Protocol aims to build a Bitcoin liquidity layer, enabling BTC holders to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities. While the exact nature of the link between this specific address and the protocol isn’t fully detailed, its association suggests it could belong to the protocol’s treasury, early investors, or a significant participant who acquired BTC with the protocol’s development or ecosystem in mind. When addresses linked to such projects make large deposits onto exchanges, it naturally raises questions about their intentions. Are they preparing to sell? Is it for liquidity provision on the exchange? Or perhaps for other trading or lending activities? Analyzing the BTC Whale’s Potential Strategy and Profit Moving 560 BTC classifies this address as a significant holder, often referred to as a BTC whale . Tracking the movements of these whales is a key part of on-chain analysis, as their actions can sometimes precede notable market volatility, especially if they decide to sell large portions of their holdings. The on-chain data provides some historical context for this specific holding. The 560 BTC was reportedly withdrawn from exchanges between October and November 2023 (correcting the likely year typo from the source data). The reported average price associated with this withdrawal period was $72,835. However, based on the reported potential profit, the actual acquisition cost basis for this BTC was likely significantly lower than that figure, aligning more closely with prices seen in late 2023. If the 560 BTC were to be sold at current market prices, the holding could yield a substantial profit. The analyst estimates this potential profit to be approximately $11.86 million. This figure highlights the significant gains accumulated by the holder since acquiring the Bitcoin. Crypto Exchange Deposit: What Does It Signify? A large crypto exchange deposit like this one doesn’t automatically mean the holder is about to dump their entire stack. There are several reasons why a whale might move BTC onto exchanges: Selling: The most common assumption is that the holder intends to sell some or all of the deposited BTC to realize profits or cut losses. Trading: The BTC might be moved to exchanges to be used as collateral for margin trading or futures positions. Lending/Borrowing: Exchanges often have lending platforms where users can earn yield on their assets. Liquidity: The holder might be preparing to provide liquidity on the exchange’s spot or derivatives markets. Security/Custody: While less likely for such a large, protocol-linked address, some holders prefer exchange custody for various reasons. Given the substantial potential profit, selling is a strong possibility, but without further on-chain activity (like actual trades), it remains speculative. Leveraging On-Chain Analysis for Market Insights This event underscores the value of on-chain analysis . By tracking the flow of assets on the blockchain, analysts can gain insights into the behavior of large market participants, identify potential trends, and understand where significant amounts of capital are moving. The data point about the unrealized gains at Bitcoin’s all-time high last year (March 2024) is particularly interesting. At that peak, the unrealized gains for this 560 BTC holding had reportedly surged to as much as $18.65 million. The decision to deposit now, potentially realizing an $11.86 million profit rather than the peak $18.65 million gain, could suggest various things: The holder believes the current price is a good exit point. They need liquidity now, regardless of the peak price. They anticipate a potential price dip. The $18.65 million was a fleeting peak they couldn’t or didn’t want to capture fully. Comparing the current potential profit to the past peak gain provides context on the holder’s timing and strategy. Conclusion: Watching the Whale’s Next Move The deposit of 560 BTC by a Lorenzo Protocol-linked address into Binance and OKX is a significant event in the crypto space. Representing a potential profit realization of nearly $12 million, this move by a likely BTC whale highlights the substantial gains made by early or strategic Bitcoin holders. While the exact intentions behind the deposit remain unknown, on-chain analysis provides crucial transparency, allowing the market to watch for potential follow-up actions, such as selling, that could impact liquidity and sentiment on these major exchanges. Keeping an eye on subsequent transactions from these exchange deposit addresses will be key to understanding the full impact of this large movement.

The altcoin thrived as Sui-based decentralized exchanges set new records. Sui DEXs recorded a whopping $3.649 billion in trading volume between April 20 and 26, as per data from DeFiLlama , marking a new weekly all-time high. Wu Blockchain @WuBlockchain · Follow According to DeFiLlama data, the trading volume on Sui DEXs reached $3.649 billion over the past week (April 20–26), marking a new all-time weekly high. Cetus accounted for 42.8% of the total Sui DEX trading volume. Momentum surpassed Bluefin to become the second-largest Sui DEX 2:08 pm · 28 Apr 2025 43 Reply Copy link Read 5 replies The milestone reflects surged activity within the SUI ecosystem and has sparked debates about the alt’s potential price reactions. Can the surged volumes fuel the anticipated Sui rally to $10? That would mean a nearly 165% increase from the token’s current price. Sui DEXs shatter records On-chain data shows that Sui-based decentralized exchanges witnessed a massive demand within the past seven days. The blockchain saw weekly trading volume topping $3.649 billion, cementing Sui’s status among the leading L1 platforms. Various factors fueled Sui’s growth in the past few sessions. Lookochain highlighted a 38% surge in the protocol’s total value locked. Also, increased decentralized exchange activities kept the altcoin afloat. Lastly, Sui has witnessed a significant growth in stablecoins within the past two months. Stablecoins on the Sui network increased by over 80% from $482 million to $879 million. Cetus leads, Momentum climbs to second place Cetus dominated the DEX activity on Sui in the past week, accounting for 42.8% of the overall trading volume. Meanwhile, Momentum overtook Bluefin to claim the second rank. The former saw a massive $91.59 million in volume within a day on April 27, indicating a shift in user preferences. Momentum’s lower fees, impressive liquidity incentives, and integration with top Sui-based projects drive its growth. SUI price outlook The native token exhibited a bullish stance amidst the optimistic updates. SUI trades at $3.78 after gaining 5.65% in the past 24 hours. Chart by CoinMarketCap It has pushed its weekly gains to 70%, and the increasing 24-hour trading volume signals more uptrends before possible corrections. The soaring TVL and trading volumes hint at a vibrant ecosystem. With the prevailing broad-based recoveries, SUI bulls target psychological resistance at $5.00. Overcoming this obstacle will open the path for accelerated gains. Digital assets enthusiast and investor Crypto GEMS believes SUI at $10 in the upcoming months is inevitable. That would translate to an approximately 165% upsurge from the alt’s current price. Source – X Meanwhile, broad market sentiments could influence SUI’s performance. Digital currencies trade in green as Bitcoin seeks a candle closing above $95,000, which could support rallies to new all-time highs. BTC trades at $95,385 after gaining 10% and 2% in the past week and day. A decisive move past $95,000 would open the gates to $100,000 and shift the market’s trajectory to bullish.

While the approval marks a significant step forward for XRP’s presence in traditional financial markets, many experts, including crypto influencer John Squire, caution that it is not the game-changing event many had hoped for. What’s the Difference Between a Spot and Futures ETF? To understand the implications of the approval, it’s important to grasp the difference between a Spot ETF and a Futures ETF. An ETF is an investment product that allows investors to trade an asset on traditional markets without owning it. The key distinction is that a Spot ETF buys and holds the actual asset, in this case, XRP tokens. This creates real demand for the token, potentially pushing the price up as the supply decreases. The SEC just approved an $XRP ETF But it’s not what many people think. It’s not a Spot ETF. It’s a Futures ETF. The difference? A Spot ETF buys and holds real XRP, creating real demand. A Futures ETF only bets on XRP’s price without touching a single real token. What… pic.twitter.com/EaqCWuOtM4 — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) April 27, 2025 In contrast, a Futures ETF doesn’t involve the purchase of physical XRP. Instead, it allows investors to speculate on the price movements of XRP without owning the asset. While it provides exposure to XRP, it doesn’t generate the same buying pressure that would influence the actual supply of tokens. The Benefits of the XRP Futures ETF Despite not directly affecting XRP’s supply, the approval of the Futures ETF still carries significant benefits. First and foremost, it offers increased institutional exposure. Futures ETFs appeal to large institutional investors who want to gain exposure to an asset without the hassle of owning it. This approval marks a major step in bringing XRP into traditional finance, where it may gain further recognition and credibility. Additionally, the ETF approval helps to amplify the positive narrative surrounding XRP’s adoption. As institutions enter the market, XRP’s credibility increases, drawing more attention from investors and the financial media and solidifying its market presence. Drawbacks of the Futures ETF While the XRP Futures ETF offers some advantages, it has its drawbacks. The most significant downside is that it doesn’t create real buying pressure for XRP. Since no physical tokens are purchased, there is no direct demand for XRP. This means that the price may not see the upward movement typically associated with increased demand for a cryptocurrency. Moreover, Futures ETFs are known for their volatility. They are subject to speculative trading, which can cause price swings that may not accurately reflect the asset’s true value. Additionally, Futures contracts often come with hidden costs, such as rollovers, slippage, and management fees, which can diminish potential returns for investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Real Catalyst: Spot ETF Approval Despite the positive aspects of the XRP Futures ETF, experts like John Squire argue that the real turning point for XRP will come when the SEC approves a Spot XRP ETF . A Spot ETF would directly purchase and hold XRP tokens, creating real demand for the asset. Reduced supply could drive up demand, potentially leading to a significant price increase and greater market impact. Without a spot ETF approval, the market will likely remain a mix of speculation and institutional interest, lacking the price surge that real-world adoption would bring. While the Futures ETF is a notable achievement for XRP’s legitimacy, it isn’t the breakthrough many expect. A Step Forward, but Not the Final Milestone In summary, while the SEC’s approval of the XRP Futures ETF is a significant milestone, it isn’t the catalyst that will trigger mass adoption or a surge in price. The approval opens the door for institutional investors and bolsters XRP’s credibility within traditional finance, but it does not create the same demand pressure that a Spot ETF would. As John Squire points out, the real market-shifting event will come when XRP can be accessed through a Spot ETF, leading to genuine demand and potential price appreciation. Until then, patience and strategic investment will be key for those looking to position themselves ahead of the next big move in the XRP market.

According to the official press release , founders of participating web3 start-ups will receive funding worth up to £250,000 in cash ($333,470) and 16 weeks of operational support as part of the joint accelerator program. Applications are open for all types of businesses engaged in the decentralized economy and tokenised business models across all sectors. Leading global accelerator Founders Factory will provide hands-on support for founders interested in participating in the program. The project will provide training for teams covering key aspects such as business strategy, product development, go-to market strategies and fundraising. On the other hand, Fabric Ventures, Animoca Brands and Coinbase will offer support on expanding tokenomics, market making, listing at crypto exchanges, market strategies for building communities, and best practices for scaling businesses within the blockchain and AI space. This joint program is designed to provide web3 start-ups with the funding and technical support they need in order to grow their businesses and drive investment into the web3 ecosystem, in order to further boost the U.K. economy. You might also like: UK trade bodies urge government to prioritize crypto and blockchain policy As countries like the U.S. and Hong Kong strive to further advance web3 industries through regulations and government-backed programs that pave the way for blockchain and AI technology, the U.K. has been moving slower than expected on the crypto front due to its relatively more cautious approach. Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds sees the creation of the web3 accelerator program as a “vote of confidence” for the U.K’s tech sector. He believes it will strengthen the U.K.’s position in supporting innovation within the web3 space. “Not only will it ensure that the U.K. remains a key leader in blockchain technology but will also unlock growth as we deliver on the Plan for Change. Our modern industrial strategy has highlighted financial and professional services as key growth sectors for the U.K. to thrive in,” said Reynolds in his statement. U.K. CEO of Coinbase , Keith Grose, said the nation already has the talent, capital and regulatory support to benefit from the opportunities offered by the web3 landscape. However, there are still some obstacles that stifle innovation. “Ensuring that these products and services are born out of the UK is vital. For too long, access to capital, mentorship and resources has held back this ambition. This significant investment changes that,” said the Coinbase U.K. CEO. Earlier this month, a coalition of six major U.K. trade bodies urged the U.K. government to prioritize blockchain and digital assets by calling for an action plan so that it does not risk falling behind in the global race. In fact, the group proposed the appointment of a blockchain-specific special envoy, much like the U.S’ AI and crypto czar, David Sacks. The envoy would be responsible for coordinating policies, fostering innovation and representing the U.K as a global ambassador for all things AI and crypto.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is at the forefront of establishing SEC Crypto Regulation , navigating the complex terrain of digital assets. However, a recent report from Forbes shines a spotlight on a developing situation that is sparking significant scrutiny: the intersection of politics, particularly involving the family of President Donald Trump, and the crypto business, including the controversial Trump Memecoin (TRUMP). This dynamic is raising serious questions about the agency’s independence and the potential for Crypto Conflict of Interest . Understanding the Shifting Landscape of SEC Crypto Regulation For years, the SEC has taken a cautious, often enforcement-focused approach to the crypto market. Under new leadership, there have been signals of a potential shift towards establishing clearer rules of the road, a move largely welcomed by the industry seeking regulatory certainty. The goal is to protect investors while fostering innovation. However, this path is fraught with challenges, not least of which are the inherent complexities of decentralized technology and the rapid pace of market development. The agency’s efforts involve various facets: Defining Crypto Assets: Determining which digital assets qualify as securities under existing law. Establishing Disclosure Requirements: Ensuring investors have adequate information about crypto projects. Overseeing Exchanges and Intermediaries: Bringing platforms where crypto is traded under regulatory oversight. Enforcement Actions: Pursuing cases against projects or individuals deemed to be violating securities laws. Progress on these fronts is crucial for the maturation of the crypto ecosystem in the United States. Yet, external pressures and perceived biases can significantly impact the speed and fairness of this progress. The Rise of Politically Linked Crypto: Trump Memecoin and Beyond In recent times, the crypto space has seen the emergence of tokens explicitly linked to political figures or movements. The TRUMP Coin , a memecoin bearing the former president’s name, is perhaps the most prominent example. Memecoins, by their nature, are often highly volatile, community-driven, and speculative, their value frequently tied more to social media trends and hype than underlying fundamentals. Beyond memecoins, the Forbes report also mentions the presence of the Trump-backed crypto project World Liberty Financial (WLFI). While details on WLFI’s specific activities and structure may vary, its association with a politically prominent family immediately draws attention, especially in a regulatory environment that is still taking shape. The increasing visibility and market presence of these politically affiliated crypto projects introduce a new layer of complexity into the regulatory discussion. They raise immediate questions about potential influence and fairness. Why is This Sparking Scrutiny Over SEC Independence? The core of the Forbes report’s concern lies in the potential for a Crypto Conflict of Interest to compromise the perceived or actual SEC Independence . Here’s a breakdown of the issues: When crypto projects are associated with powerful political figures, particularly those who have appointed or influenced the leadership of regulatory bodies like the SEC, it creates a delicate situation. Allegations are emerging, particularly from Democratic voices cited in the report, suggesting that the presence and growth of Trump-backed projects like WLFI and the TRUMP memecoin warrant investigation due to potential conflicts. The concern is that the SEC, in its efforts to regulate the broader crypto market, might face pressure—either explicit or implicit—to treat politically connected projects differently. This could manifest in various ways: Slower or less rigorous investigation into potential violations. More favorable interpretations of regulations. Hesitation to take enforcement action. Any perception of political favoritism can severely undermine public trust in the regulator. For an agency tasked with ensuring fair and orderly markets, maintaining an image of strict impartiality is paramount. What are the Challenges Posed by Political Influence on SEC Crypto Regulation? The challenges presented by this situation are significant and far-reaching. Political influence, or the appearance thereof, can directly impede the SEC’s mission and the progress of sensible SEC Crypto Regulation . Key challenges include: 1. Eroding Trust and Credibility: If the public and market participants believe the SEC is not acting independently, its ability to effectively regulate is compromised. This lack of trust can lead to non-compliance and skepticism towards legitimate regulatory efforts. 2. Slowing Regulatory Momentum: Allegations of conflict can divert the agency’s resources and attention. Investigations into potential conflicts or political pressure can consume time and energy that would otherwise be spent developing clear rules for the entire market. This could significantly delay the much-needed clarity for crypto businesses and investors. 3. Creating an Uneven Playing Field: If politically connected projects are perceived to operate under different rules or receive preferential treatment, it disadvantages other projects and companies in the crypto space who are attempting to comply diligently with regulations. This stifles fair competition and innovation. 4. Increasing Market Uncertainty: The regulatory status of politically linked tokens like the TRUMP Coin becomes particularly ambiguous. Will they be treated like other memecoins? Will their political backing offer a shield or make them a target? This uncertainty adds another layer of risk for investors. According to the Forbes report, these potential allegations of political favoritism could indeed weaken the momentum towards comprehensive crypto reform. The focus shifts from developing sound regulatory frameworks based on financial principles to navigating political sensitivities. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community While the situation presents challenges, there are also potential takeaways and points of focus for market participants: Increased Scrutiny of Politically Linked Projects: Investors should be acutely aware of the unique risks associated with tokens or projects tied to political figures. Beyond market volatility, these projects face heightened regulatory and reputational risks depending on the political climate and scrutiny. Advocacy for Regulatory Transparency: The situation underscores the importance of transparency in regulatory processes and robust ethical guidelines for officials involved in overseeing industries where political interests may intersect. Monitoring Regulatory Developments Closely: Pay close attention to how the SEC handles politically linked crypto projects. Any actions or inactions could signal the agency’s approach to navigating such conflicts in the future and its commitment to SEC Independence . Understanding the Nature of Memecoins: The case of the TRUMP Coin serves as a reminder of the speculative nature of memecoins. Their value is heavily influenced by sentiment and hype, now potentially including political narratives, adding layers of unpredictability. For regulators, the situation highlights the critical need to demonstrate impartiality and adhere strictly to their mandate of protecting investors and maintaining fair markets, irrespective of political affiliations. Conclusion: Navigating the Intersection of Politics and Crypto The Forbes report detailing the scrutiny surrounding the Trump Memecoin , other Trump-backed crypto ventures, and their potential impact on SEC Independence brings a crucial issue to the forefront of the discussion around SEC Crypto Regulation . The allegations of a potential Crypto Conflict of Interest pose a significant challenge to the agency’s efforts to build a clear and trusted regulatory framework for the digital asset space. Maintaining the perception and reality of independence is vital for the SEC’s effectiveness. As the crypto market continues to grow and intersect with various sectors, including politics, the pressure on regulators will only increase. How the SEC navigates this particular instance of scrutiny, involving high-profile political figures and projects like the TRUMP Coin , will likely set precedents and influence the trajectory of crypto regulation for years to come. The market needs clear, fair, and impartial rules, and ensuring the SEC’s independence is paramount to achieving that goal.

Displaying a BITSTAMP four-hour chart overlaid with multi-sigma deviation bands, he wrote that XRP is “over this standard deviation and we likely move up quickly to the next one at the $3 area, then one around $4.20 and the last one at the top around $8… coincidently my main target this cycle.” No Double Digits For XRP This Cycle The analyst’s tone turned caustic when addressing hopeful forecasts for double- or triple-digit prices. “To all the people saying $8 isn’t high enough,” he said, “please throw your brain in the dryer after it got washed by all these influencer moonboys.” He argued that a move from last cycle’s capitulation low near $0.28 to $8 already implies a 2,757% advance. “Imagine not taking at least some profit lol,” he added, warning that fixation on outlier targets had trapped retail investors in every prior top. Charting Guy conceded that valuations beyond three digits are theoretically possible “if they completely achieve their goal,” referencing Ripple’s long-term ambitions in cross-border settlement and CBDC plumbing, yet he insisted that such a scenario is “absurd” for the current market phase. “It’ll likely take a few decades for all that to play out,” he wrote. “Influencer moonboys who know nothing have been saying these things for 10 YEARS and look at the chart. It’s at $2.23 right now.” Related Reading: XRP Price Pullback To $2 According To Plan For Historic Breakout To $10, Analyst Says His broader technical read remains constructive. In a slew of follow-ups he highlighted that XRP is “holding monthly Tenkan and Kijun perfectly,” “fighting between Kijun and Tenkan on weekly Ichimoku Cloud,” and has “held weekly EMA Ribbon perfectly” as well as the weekly Supertrend. Those confluences keep the medium-term structure intact, he implies, even if short-term volatility remains. On the daily timeframe he cautioned that XRP “broke out of channel, might come back to retest,” a move that—by his chart—could drag price briefly below $1.90 before the anticipated climb resumes. For Charting Guy, the disciplined approach is to respect those levels rather than chase grandiose numbers. “That lack of understanding will make these people miss bull-cycle tops and ride it down −50 to −90 percent every cycle when they can trade a big chunk of their bag each cycle and quit their 9-5 sooner,” he said. “I just try my best to be realistic and help people based on actual data in the charts, not some fairy tale a YouTuber told me.” Related Reading: XRP Will Print A New All-Time High If This Happens: Analyst While his $8 ceiling may disappoint the most fervent XRP believers, the target—if hit—would still mark the highest price in the token’s history and a near-thirty-fold return from the bear-market lows. For now, traders watching the four-hour deviation bands will be looking first for confirmation of a push through $3, then $4.20, as the analyst’s path to eight dollars begins to unfold. At press time, XRP traded at $2.33.

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ripple (XRP) both started as quietly positioned assets before delivering life-changing returns. Today, many investors are saying the same thing about MAGACOINFINANCE . With its low exposure and rising insider traction, this project is quickly becoming one of the most closely watched early-stage tokens of the cycle. MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining serious attention Bonus still available: The final bonus window is open—but supply is thinning fast. Listings are getting closer: Early investors are locking in positions before public trading begins. Private interest is increasing: High-conviction traders are moving early to get in before the crowd. Opportunity is still exclusive: This window is small—and it’s closing quickly. MAGACOINFINANCE is built for long-term upside MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t a trending token—it’s a calculated project structured to reward long-term conviction. Its quiet rollout and limited access have created the perfect setup for early-stage momentum to build organically. With a strong model and increasing investor activity, many now consider it a rare asset—the kind that’s easy to overlook until it’s too late. How it stacks up against ADA, TRX, and LTC Cardano (ADA) , TRON (TRX) , and Litecoin (LTC) are still important players—but their growth phases are well past the discovery stage. MAGACOINFINANCE remains in a unique position: limited, underexposed, and built for those who act before the headlines hit.

Kammer said the recently approved multi-billion economic stimulus package in Germany is not enough to outweigh the projected drag from U.S. tariffs. He added that the IMF has a very clear recommendation for the European Central Bank (ECB), noting that so far, there has been a huge success in the disinflation effort and monetary policy has worked–so the IMF is expecting the Eurozone to sustainably hit the 2% inflation target in the second half of 2025. Kammer said the IMF’s recommendation for the ECB is that there is room for one more 25 basis points cut in the summer, and then the ECB should hold that 2% policy rate unless major shocks hit and there is a need for recalibrating monetary policy. Kammer says increased spending in Germany will not offset U.S. tariff drag Kammer during an interview with CNBC’s Carolin Roth. Source: CNBC According to Kammer, Germany’s recent infrastructure spending bill will only offset the negative impact of tariffs “slightly,” which will boost growth in the euro area over the next two years. However, the deputy director of the IMF’s European department, Oya Celasun, said on Friday that Germany’s fiscal expansion will boost its economy starting in 2026 to offset the increased drag from U.S. tariffs after years of weak growth. Celasun told a panel during the IMF and World Bank spring meetings in Washington that she did not expect Germany’s increased spending to happen quickly. She, however, pointed out that it would be a dominant factor in offsetting the ongoing drag from trade tensions as “we move into 2026 and 2027.” Kammer told CNBC’s Carolin Roth in an interview at the IMF-World Bank Spring Meetings last week that tariffs and trade tensions weighed on the euro area’s growth outlook rather than the positive effects on the fiscal side. The IMF cut its Eurozone growth forecasts for each of the next two years by 0.2 percentage points, to 0.8% in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026. “What we see is we have a meaningful downgrade for Europe’s advanced economies…and for the emerging euro area countries double as much over this two-year period.” – Alfred Kammer , Director of the European Department at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Kammer also suggested that the ECB should cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point only once more this year, despite growth risks. The ECB has so far reduced rates seven times in quarter-percentage-point increments, starting in June 2024. Its most recent rate cut in April took the deposit facility down to 2.25%. IMF praises German multi-billion fiscal stimulus package The IMF’s Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said on April 24 that the global economy was entering a “new era,” praising what she described as “impossible” policy shifts in Germany, Britain, and Argentina. The IMF particularly praised the special fund for infrastructure, saying that the package was likely to boost growth in the near term and also have a long-term impact. Germany’s parliament approved in March plans for a massive spending surge, throwing off decades of fiscal conservatism in hopes of reviving economic growth and scaling up military spending. The stimulus package will allow investments in defense, transport, energy grids, schools, sporting facilities, and climate protection. The IMF urged Germany to embark on reforms, stressing that the most important thing was to cut red tape so that the special fund could actually achieve its full impact. The fund also asserted that Germany should help more women to work full-time. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Referencing a carefully revised chart, Egrag highlighted that Bitcoin (BTC) has been in a corrective phase since February 2025. According to his commentary, the chart presented continues his earlier analyses, which have been updated more than seven times to track Bitcoin’s evolving structure. In his post, Egrag reaffirmed that he originally highlighted the existence of a Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) gap, which was critical in signaling that a bounce could be expected. He said His earlier projections indicated that Bitcoin would not immediately break into a parabolic rally but instead would undergo a corrective consolidation phase before further movement. #BTC – Corrective Phase (UPDATE): Since February 2025, I've consistently stated that #BTC is in a corrective phase. I've updated the chart below more than seven times, with the original chart reflecting my initial analysis. I first mentioned the CME gap and then indicated that a… https://t.co/g9k6pR2Ct7 pic.twitter.com/dCVhUFeHYs — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 26, 2025 Projected Dip and Fractal Validation The attached chart outlines Bitcoin’s behavior over an extended period, clearly delineating past bear markets, corrective structures, and periods of significant bounce. Egrag points out that Bitcoin has exhibited a pattern of corrections followed by strong upward momentum, measured historically in spans of approximately 230 to 231 days. In the current phase, Bitcoin follows a similar fractal pattern. According to Egrag’s forecast, if the fractal continues to play out as anticipated, Bitcoin may experience one final dip, potentially reaching a price zone around $75,000. The analyst indicates that the current price levels, near $94,000, leave room for this corrective move before any major breakout occurs. He notes that a closure above $100,000 would invalidate the existing fractal, suggesting that Bitcoin could move sharply higher without undergoing the expected dip. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Target Levels and Critical Support Zones The chart further sets future price targets around $145,000 and $175,000, indicating the potential for a significant rally once the corrective phase concludes. Key support and resistance levels are also marked on the chart, with particular attention given to $69,500 and $71,500 as critical lower support zones and $93,000 as a mid-term key level. Egrag also highlighted an important upcoming date: July 7, 2025. He points out that this date marks the conclusion of a 90-day tariff duration, although he did not elaborate extensively on its direct impact on Bitcoin’s price action. Nevertheless, the mention suggests a potential catalyst aligns with Bitcoin’s projected movements. Final Expectations for the Blow-Off Top In closing, Egrag issued a clear statement of expectation, asserting that a major upward move, commonly referred to in trading as a “blow-off top,” could occur sooner than many might anticipate. He advises followers to prepare accordingly as the corrective phase nears its end. Egrag Crypto’s update remains consistent with his prior analysis while refining short-term expectations. His focus on fractal patterns and historical behavior continues to shape his outlook, providing a structured framework for anticipating Bitcoin’s next significant moves.

Over the last decade, Bitcoin has become both a symbol of financial freedom and a lightning rod for criticism — especially when it comes to energy consumption. Headlines about the immense power needed to mine Bitcoin have put its environmental cost in the spotlight, with institutions, governments, and even retail users asking: is there a better way? This is where Bitcoin Solaris steps onto the scene. By building a project that is 99.95% more energy efficient than Bitcoin, Bitcoin Solaris is rewriting the rules for how digital assets can work — both for people and for the planet. Its approach isn’t just about reducing electricity bills; it’s about setting a new benchmark for sustainable, scalable, and accessible blockchain technology. And with a presale underway in 2025, Bitcoin Solaris is offering the first wave of users a real stake in what could become one of the most talked-about projects in the next phase of crypto adoption. Why Energy Efficiency Matters More Than Ever The original Bitcoin network has proven its value as a digital store of wealth, but at a significant environmental cost. Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work mechanism demands vast amounts of electricity, often compared to the power usage of entire countries. For many potential users and investors, especially those aware of climate issues, this is a real concern. The market has reached a point where being energy-efficient is no longer just a marketing point — it’s a requirement for long-term relevance. Bitcoin Solaris addresses this challenge head-on. By utilizing an innovative consensus mechanism, it cuts energy use by a staggering 99.95% compared to traditional Bitcoin mining. This means that the network can validate transactions and secure its blockchain without the need for enormous server farms or endless racks of GPUs running day and night. Instead, users can participate in network operations with far less hardware, dramatically lowering both costs and the environmental impact. This move toward sustainability isn’t just about optics; it has real-world implications for the speed, scalability, and inclusivity of the entire network. Technical Innovation That Goes Beyond Energy Savings But energy efficiency is just one side of the Bitcoin Solaris story. The project is designed to provide a real upgrade on nearly every front. Transaction speeds are significantly faster than Bitcoin, and the network is built to handle high volumes without getting bogged down or raising fees to unmanageable levels. The architecture also supports smart contracts, making it a suitable foundation for decentralized finance applications and new blockchain-based services. Just as importantly, Bitcoin Solaris maintains a fixed supply of 21 million tokens, following the scarcity model that made Bitcoin famous. But unlike the original, which can feel closed off to everyday users, Bitcoin Solaris introduces user-friendly staking, transparent governance, and an app that allows users to participate in mining from standard devices — including smartphones. The project’s documentation and tokenomics lay out exactly how tokens are allocated, how staking rewards are distributed, and how users can influence future updates. Set for Explosive Growth in 2025 The timing for Bitcoin Solaris couldn’t be better. With the crypto market maturing and both regulators and the public demanding greater responsibility, projects that take sustainability seriously are in a strong position to gain trust and market share. The infrastructure behind Bitcoin Solaris makes it easy for both developers and regular users to get involved — whether they’re looking to stake tokens, build new decentralized apps, or simply transact quickly and securely. As more institutional players look for green solutions and eco-conscious investors seek out projects aligned with ESG values, Bitcoin Solaris stands out. Its blend of low energy use, high usability, and community-first approach puts it in a unique spot for growth as the industry shifts focus from mere speculation to practical, sustainable innovation. Secure Your Share: The Bitcoin Solaris Presale Is Live With Bitcoin Solaris now in its presale phase, early supporters have a genuine chance to get involved at the ground level of a project that’s prioritizing real value and sustainability. Out of total supply, 20% — that’s 4.2 million tokens — are available during the presale. Each BTCS token is priced at 1 USDT, making it easy for new buyers to understand exactly what they’re getting for their investment. Funds from the presale are earmarked for continued development, expanding the ecosystem, and incentivizing the community — all managed without the risk of excessive inflation. The end result is a launch built on stability, fairness, and growth potential, with early backers at its core. How to Participate in the Presale The process to join the Bitcoin Solaris presale is straightforward — even if you’re new to the crypto world: Head to the official Bitcoin Solaris website . Always start here to avoid unofficial links or scams. Set up a compatible crypto wallet. If you don’t have one, the website offers suggestions and guides. Access the presale dashboard on the site. Here, you’ll find live stats, current price, and instructions for buying BTC-S. Enter how many tokens you want to buy and complete the transaction from your wallet. Double-check your wallet address, since this is where your tokens will be sent once the sale is complete. For questions or help, the team and community are active on Telegram and X . Bitcoin Solaris is more than just another crypto project. It’s a serious step forward for blockchain, combining efficiency, real usability, and a strong stance on sustainability. In a market ready for the next big thing, Bitcoin Solaris makes a strong case for itself — as a more energy-conscious alternative to Bitcoin, and a platform built for the realities of 2025 and beyond.

Yes, another day, another massive Bitcoin buy – MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy, just secured 15,355 more BTC coins! Despite the volatility that has gripped the crypto market, the company has once again demonstrated its commitment to Bitcoin as a long-term asset. The latest move comes amid fluctuating Bitcoin prices, but Strategy’s belief in the digital asset’s potential remains stronger than ever. For them, Bitcoin is the future and they’re all in. Stick around as we break down this move. $MSTR has acquired 15,355 BTC for ~$1.42 billion at ~$92,737 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 13.7% YTD 2025. As of 4/27/2025, we hodl 553,555 $BTC acquired for ~$37.90 billion at ~$68,459 per bitcoin. https://t.co/5OOs3UdWLg — Michael Saylor (@saylor) April 28, 2025 Details of the Latest Bitcoin Purchase Strategy’s latest Bitcoin acquisition marks another impressive chapter in its journey to becoming one of the largest Bitcoin holders on the planet. The company has just acquired 15,355 Bitcoin, at $92,737 per bitcoin, valued at an eye-popping $1.42 billion. With this new purchase, Strategy’s YTD yield for 2025 has already reached an impressive 13.7%. It’s no secret that the company’s focus is on securing an even larger stake in the crypto market, and this acquisition is just another step toward that goal. It’s all about securing that future-proof asset, the “digital gold”, no matter the short-term volatility. Strategy’s Commitment to Bitcoin Continues, But How? This isn’t the first time Strategy has made headlines with its Bitcoin buys. Just 6 days ago, on April 22, the company snapped up an additional 6,556 Bitcoin (BTC) for $555.8 million. In 2025 alone, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings have generated $5.1 billion in unrealized gains, according to CEO Michael Saylor. Strategy funds these purchases through cash raised from recent stock offerings. Between April 14 and 20, the company sold 1.76 million Class A shares and 91,000 preferred shares, raising $547.7 million and $7.8 million, respectively. This method of raising capital through equity markets to fund Bitcoin acquisitions has become a hallmark of Strategy’s approach, allowing the company to leverage shareholder-backed capital while avoiding traditional debt. In doing so, Strategy maintains its flexibility and agility in a volatile market, continuing to build its position as a leader in the institutional Bitcoin space. “Our ATM programs provide flexible funding to execute our Bitcoin strategy,” the company noted in its SEC filing. Michael Saylor’s Vision: Holding Strong Despite the Critics Michael Saylor, the co-founder of MicroStrategy, has long been a vocal advocate of Bitcoin. Under his leadership, the company made bold moves to acquire massive amounts of the crypto, even though there has been more than a fair share of criticism for the same. “MicroStrategy’s strategy hinges on Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation,” said financial analyst Clara Wu. “If that stalls, the math collapses.” But Saylor’s vision has been clear from the start: Bitcoin is a store of value, and the company’s mission is to position itself as a leader in this new digital economy. “Bitcoin is digital gold – growing harder, smarter, faster, and stronger due to the relentless progression of technology” The latest Bitcoin purchase aligns with this vision and Strategy’s ambitious “21/21 Plan,” unveiled in October 2024. The plan aims to raise $42 billion by 2027 – half from equity and half from debt – to continue expanding its Bitcoin reserves. With the way acquisitions are happening, it seems they are right on track. Bitcoin as a Hedge Against Inflation: Is Strategy Proof Enough? Let’s be real. Inflation and economic uncertainty is currently top of the mind for investors. But Bitcoin is earning its reputation as a safe-haven asset. While companies like Metaplanet are starting to follow suit, Strategy stands out – holding more than 2% of all Bitcoin in circulation. So, what’s next for Strategy? The company shows no signs of slowing down and is positioning itself to capitalize on the next wave of momentum. Upcoming stock offerings could inject billions more into its Bitcoin reserves, pushing its holdings even further. However, it’s not all smooth sailing. The company faces challenges – from regulatory hurdles to market fluctuations and interest rate shifts – that could put both Bitcoin and MSTR’s stock under pressure. But for now, Michael Saylor and his team are all-in on the crypto revolution, betting that Bitcoin’s best days are still ahead. Let’s hope he is right.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 12:07:58

After months of volatility, investors are witnessing a slow but steady recovery, with many assets showing signs of stabilization. This rebound is characterized by a measured increase in trading volumes and a renewed interest from both retail and institutional investors.​ While the market sentiment remains positive, experts advise caution. The recovery is still in its early stages, and unforeseen macroeconomic factors could impact the trajectory. Nonetheless, the current trend suggests that the worst may be behind us, and prudent investors are beginning to re-enter the market with a long-term perspective.​ ONDO (ONDO): A Solid Performer with Promising Outlook ONDO is currently trading at $0.9874, reflecting a stable position in the market. Analysts predict a potential rise to $2.00 over the next four weeks, driven by increasing adoption of its decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. Looking ahead to 2025, the token could reach $4.00, provided the platform continues to expand its user base and maintain its security standards. However, in the event of a broader market correction, ONDO might see a downside to $1.40.​ Bitcoin (BTC): Leading the Charge with Strong Fundamentals Bitcoin is trading at $94,821.63, maintaining its position as the market leader. Short-term forecasts suggest a potential rise to $98,000 over the next month, fueled by renewed institutional interest and macroeconomic factors favoring digital assets. For 2025, Bitcoin could reach $106,000 if adoption continues to grow and regulatory clarity improves. Conversely, a market downturn could see Bitcoin's price dip to $96,000.​ FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Meme Coin Reinvented with AI and Utility FloppyPepe (FPPE) is making waves in the crypto community with its innovative approach to meme coins. Priced at $0.0000002 during its Stage 1 presale, FPPE has already raised over $1.5 million, attracting significant attention from both retail investors and crypto whales. The project's unique blend of humor, technology, and utility positions it as a potential next 100x token.​ The FloppyPepe Ecosystem: Tools and Tokenomics FloppyPepe's ecosystem includes several key components:​ FloppyX: An AI-powered video creation tool that allows users to generate content from text prompts.​ Meme-o-Matic: An AI meme generator that transforms text into shareable memes, enhancing community engagement.​ Floppynomics: A deflationary tokenomics model featuring a 1% burn mechanism and a 1% redistribution to holders, promoting scarcity and rewarding long-term investors.​ Additionally, FloppyPepe has completed a SolidProof audit, ensuring the project's security and legitimacy. ​ Floppy Agent: AI-Powered Community Engagement Floppy Agent is an AI tool designed to transform complex crypto market data into engaging content like memes and tweets. By scanning platforms such as Twitter and crypto news sites, Floppy Agent distills information into bite-sized insights, helping maintain an informed and engaged community. This innovative approach sets FloppyPepe apart from traditional meme coins.​ The Case for Presale Investments in Today's Market Investing in presale tokens offers unique opportunities, especially in a recovering market. Early-stage investments allow participants to acquire tokens at a lower price point, potentially leading to significant returns as the project gains traction. However, it's essential to conduct thorough research and assess the project's fundamentals before investing.​ Historically, assets like Bitcoin faced skepticism in their early days, yet they have become cornerstone investments over time. Similarly, presale projects with strong fundamentals and innovative solutions can yield substantial returns as they mature.​ Why FloppyPepe Stands Out in the Meme Coin Space FloppyPepe distinguishes itself from other meme coins through its integration of AI technology, robust tokenomics, and commitment to real-world impact. The project's tools, such as FloppyX and Meme-o-Matic, provide tangible utility beyond mere speculation. Endorsements from influencers like Nass Crypto further validate FloppyPepe's potential.​ Join the FloppyPepe Community Early For those interested in participating, FloppyPepe is offering an 80% bonus on presale tokens using the code ""Floppy80,"" starting April 21, 2025. This promotion presents an excellent opportunity to acquire FPPE tokens at a favorable price point before the project's anticipated launch.​ In summary, ONDO, Bitcoin, and FloppyPepe are three cryptocurrencies to watch this week. Each offers unique opportunities and potential for growth, catering to different investor profiles. Whether you're seeking stability, long-term growth, or innovative projects with high upside potential, these tokens merit consideration in your investment strategy.Join the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale and community: Website: https://floppypepe.io/ Whitepaper: https://floppypepe.gitbook.io/floppypepe.io Telegram: https://t.me/floppypepeofficial X (Twitter): https://x.com/floppypepe Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Revealing how American workers can achieve wealth freedom through cloud mining,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/can-bitcoin-cloud-mining-really-make-money-revealing-how-american-workers-can-achieve-wealth-freedom-through-cloud-mining,"For years, many migrant workers in the United States have struggled to make ends meet, working long hours in physically demanding jobs that barely provide enough for basic living expenses. But what if there was a way for these workers to break free from their routine lives and achieve financial independence without leaving their communities? This is exactly what cloud mining with Snxcrypto has made possible for many, including one remarkable individual—James Miller, a 34-year-old former construction worker who found his path to financial freedom through Snxcrypto's clean energy mining solutions. A Hard Life of Labor James Miller's story is one that resonates with many migrant workers across the U.S. As a construction worker, James spent over 12 hours a day in the blistering heat, doing backbreaking work that barely paid the bills. Each week, he earned just $200, struggling to support his family and deal with the pressures of life in a foreign land. Despite his long hours and hard work, James could see no end to his financial struggles. The dream of building a better life seemed just out of reach. However, everything changed for James when he learned about cryptocurrency and the potential it held. Intrigued by the idea of passive income, he began researching the world of digital currencies. After some time, he discovered Snxcrypto—a platform offering clean energy cloud mining solutions that made cryptocurrency mining accessible to everyone, including people like James who had no prior knowledge of mining equipment or technology.

43902020,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153209,1745842223,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Nike NFT Platform Shutdown Triggers Alarming $5M RTFKT Lawsuit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nike-nft-rtfkt-lawsuit/,"The world of Web3 adoption by major brands has been exciting, but it’s not without its pitfalls. A recent development involving sports giant Nike highlights the potential legal challenges companies face when venturing into the volatile realm of digital assets. Specifically, the Nike NFT project, RTFKT, is now at the center of a significant class-action lawsuit. What Led to the RTFKT Lawsuit? According to reports, investors who purchased NFTs associated with Nike’s RTFKT platform have filed a $5 million class-action lawsuit. The core of the complaint, filed on April 25 in a Brooklyn federal court, revolves around allegations that Nike violated consumer protection and unfair trade laws. The plaintiffs claim that Nike actively promoted RTFKT NFTs to attract investment, only to then abruptly shut down the platform in January 2024. This shutdown, they argue, caused “significant damages” to the investors. Let’s break down the key points of the plaintiffs’ argument: Promotion and Investment: Nike allegedly used its brand power to market the RTFKT NFTs, encouraging people to invest. Abrupt Shutdown: The platform was reportedly shut down unexpectedly, leaving investors with potentially devalued assets and limited utility. Significant Damages: The lawsuit seeks $5 million in damages to cover the losses incurred by investors. The Heart of the Claims: Unregistered Securities? Perhaps the most serious allegation in the lawsuit is the claim that the RTFKT NFTs were, in fact, unregistered securities. The plaintiffs contend that these digital assets were sold without the necessary approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is a critical point in the evolving landscape of crypto regulation. If the court were to agree that these NFTs meet the legal definition of a security, it could have far-reaching implications not only for Nike but for other companies that have launched similar NFT projects. Understanding the concept of unregistered securities in the context of crypto often involves the Howey Test, a framework used by the SEC to determine if a transaction qualifies as an investment contract. The test considers: An investment of money. In a common enterprise. With the expectation of profits. Derived solely from the efforts of others. The plaintiffs in the RTFKT lawsuit likely argue that their purchase of Nike’s NFTs meets these criteria, positioning the NFTs as investment contracts that should have been registered with the SEC. Examining the Impact: The NFT Lawsuit and Asset Value A central piece of evidence cited in the lawsuit is the dramatic drop in the value of the RTFKT NFTs since their launch. This depreciation is presented as a direct consequence of the platform’s shutdown and the alleged actions of Nike. Consider the trajectory based on data from OpenSea: Timeframe Average Price (ETH) Approximate Price (USD) April 2022 (Launch) 3.5 ETH ~$8,000 April 2025 0.009 ETH ~$16 This stark contrast in value underscores the plaintiffs’ claim of significant financial loss. While the broader NFT market has experienced volatility, the lawsuit specifically links the devastating drop for RTFKT holders to Nike’s management and ultimate shutdown of the platform. Wider Implications: A Crypto Legal Challenge for Brands The Nike RTFKT lawsuit is more than just a dispute over one specific NFT collection; it represents a significant crypto legal challenge for established brands entering the Web3 space. It raises crucial questions about: Brand Responsibility: What level of responsibility do major companies have to investors in their digital asset projects? Platform Longevity: Is there an implicit expectation of long-term support for NFT platforms launched by large corporations? Regulatory Clarity: How should NFTs be classified, and what are the legal obligations surrounding their sale and promotion? Consumer Protection in Web3: How do existing consumer protection laws apply to decentralized or semi-decentralized digital environments? This case could potentially set a precedent for how future brand-led NFT initiatives are structured, marketed, and managed. It highlights the need for companies to approach Web3 with a robust understanding of potential legal and regulatory hurdles, as well as a clear strategy for platform sustainability and investor communication. Navigating the Future: Lessons from the RTFKT Lawsuit For brands considering or currently involved in Web3, the RTFKT lawsuit serves as a cautionary tale and offers valuable insights: Prioritize Legal Review: Before launching any digital asset project, seek comprehensive legal counsel regarding securities laws, consumer protection, and intellectual property in the blockchain space. Be Transparent: Clearly communicate the risks associated with investing in volatile digital assets. Avoid language that could be interpreted as guaranteeing returns or long-term value appreciation. Plan for the Long Term: Have a clear strategy for the utility, support, and potential sunsetting of a digital platform. Abrupt shutdowns can erode trust and lead to legal challenges. Understand Market Dynamics: While market volatility is inherent in crypto, be prepared for how market downturns can exacerbate investor dissatisfaction, especially if coupled with platform issues. The outcome of this case will be closely watched by the crypto community, legal experts, and corporations alike. It underscores the ongoing tension between innovation in the digital asset space and the need for robust legal frameworks to protect investors. Conclusion: A Turning Point for Brand NFTs? The $5 million class-action lawsuit against Nike over its RTFKT NFT platform is a stark reminder that entering the Web3 space requires careful consideration of legal, regulatory, and consumer relations aspects. The allegations of unregistered securities and significant damages highlight the potential risks when established brands navigate the complex and often uncertain world of digital assets. As this crypto legal challenge unfolds, its resolution could significantly influence how other major companies approach NFTs and decentralized technologies in the future, emphasizing the critical importance of compliance and transparent communication in this rapidly evolving market.

43902130,https://thecoinrise.com/ethereum-could-reach-2000-transactions-per-second-under-new-proposal/,1745842455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/43902130.jpeg,"Ethereum Could Reach 2,000 Transactions per Second Under New Proposal",https://thecoinrise.com/ethereum-could-reach-2000-transactions-per-second-under-new-proposal/,"Ethereum could soon see a major boost in its transaction capacity if a new proposal from Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist is approved. On April 27, Feist introduced EIP-9698, which suggests a “deterministic gas limit growth schedule” set to begin around June 1. If adopted, this plan would steadily raise ETH gas limit by a factor of 10 over roughly two years, followed by one final tenfold increase. The changes could theoretically allow Ethereum to handle up to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS)—a big jump from the current 20 TPS seen during simple transaction-heavy periods. The gas limit would expand from 36 million to 3.6 billion, enabling around 6,000 transactions to fit within each block. Feist explained that the predictable growth schedule would align with expected hardware improvements and protocol efficiency, offering a sustainable and transparent roadmap for scaling Ethereum at the base layer. Boosting Ethereum Scalability Feist’s proposal aims to better position Ethereum against faster blockchains like Solana, which currently processes between 800 and 1,050 TPS, with a theoretical maximum of 65,000. The idea comes at a time when the blockchain is seeking new ways to scale beyond its heavy reliance on layer-2 solutions. Critics of Ethereum’s current scaling strategy argue that multiple layer-2 networks have fragmented the ecosystem, resulting in poorer user experiences due to low interoperability. By boosting the mainnet’s capacity, EIP-9698 could provide a more unified and efficient platform for users and developers alike. Feist acknowledged the potential challenges, such as increased stress on less-optimized nodes and slower block propagation times. However, he emphasized that the gradual nature of the gas limit increase would give node operators and developers enough time to adjust and optimize their systems. Upcoming Developments: Fusaka and Pectra Hard Forks Alongside EIP-9698, Ethereum developers are also exploring other ways to increase scalability. Under EIP-9678, they plan to test a fourfold increase to the gas limit during the Fusaka hard fork, anticipated for late 2025. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s next major upgrade, Pectra , is set to go live in May, bringing further enhancements to the network. EIP-9698 marks another step in Ethereum’s ongoing efforts to strengthen its base layer and address the growing demand for faster, cheaper transactions. Whether the community fully embraces this bold expansion remains to be seen, but the path forward could reshape the blockchain’s future dramatically.

The fund targets an annual net return of 4% to 8% on Bitcoin holdings, according to an April 28 blog post by Coinbase. “To address the growing institutional demand for bitcoin yield, Coinbase Asset Management is excited to introduce the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF),” the company wrote. The fund is backed by multiple investors, including Aspen Digital, a digital asset manager based in Abu Dhabi and regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority.

Beijing made this statement during a regular press conference, slamming Trump’s claim made last week in a Time magazine interview that Xi had picked up the phone and called him. According to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there have been no calls, no negotiations, and no backdoor deals to fix the tariff disaster between the two biggest economies on the planet. Guo Jiakun, the spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry, stood in front of reporters and said , “As far as I know, there has been no recent phone call between the two heads of state.” He went even further to drive the point home: “I want to reiterate that China and the United States are not engaged in consultations or negotiations on the tariff issue. These are lies.” That was about as clean and cold as it could get. No talk, no deals, no progress. Beijing shuts down Trump’s lies Despite China throwing a concrete wall at the idea, Trump kept his own story alive. Last week, he tried to soften the mess he created with his eccentrically high tariffs, promising that these levies would “come down substantially” and claiming he would be “very nice” at the negotiation table if Xi wanted to jump in. “He’s called. And I don’t think that’s a sign of weakness on his behalf,” Trump said during his Time interview, trying to make it sound casual. But he didn’t say what they supposedly talked about, when the call even happened, or why it was not mentioned officially. Later on Friday, CNN’s Alayna Treene pushed Trump to explain himself as he left the South Lawn of the White House. Instead of answering, Trump ducked the question, saying, “I don’t want to comment on that, but I’ve spoken to him many times.” There were no details given, no confirmation, just vague answers – classic Trump. Publicly available records show the last real phone call between Trump and Xi was on January 17, days before Trump took the oath for his second term. That was months ago. Even after Trump kept tossing around claims that negotiations were happening, China kept smacking them down. Hours before the Time interview hit the news, the Chinese Foreign Ministry issued another statement warning the United States not to “mislead the public” about what was happening with trade talks. Since getting back into the White House, Trump has ordered a 145% levy on goods coming in from China, but he made exceptions for electronics like smartphones and computers. He called them “reciprocal” even though that word didn’t make sense when you know all the context. But China answered by raising its own tariffs on American imports to 125%. At the same time, they made some quiet moves behind the scenes, cutting tariffs on certain US-made semiconductors. Import agencies picked up the change, saying it looked like China was trying to give a little breathing room to its tech industry while keeping pressure on the United States. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent went on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday and already made it pretty obvious he had no clue about any phone calls between Trump and Xi. When Martha Raddatz asked him directly whether Trump had spoken with Xi, Scott said, “I don’t know if President Trump has spoken with President Xi.” Instead of confirming anything, the former Wall Street star tried to cool things down by saying that the US government was talking with “various nations” about trade and admitted that the high tariffs could not last forever. Even when pressed harder, Scott could only say that Trump and Xi had a “very good relationship and a lot of respect for each other.” So while Trump keeps painting a picture of secret deals and cozy phone calls, Beijing and even his own guy are telling a very different story: no calls, no talks, and no quick end to the brutal tariff fight.

The latest data shows a significant surge in institutional interest, specifically through the highly popular US spot Bitcoin ETFs . This isn’t just a trickle; we’re talking billions flowing in, marking a major moment for the crypto market . What Exactly Happened with US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Last Week? According to fresh data from SoSoValue, US spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a remarkable week. For the period ending April 25th, these investment vehicles recorded a net inflow totaling an impressive $3.06 billion . This figure isn’t just large; it represents the second-largest weekly inflow since these ETFs began trading earlier this year. It signals strong demand and renewed confidence among investors looking for regulated exposure to Bitcoin. Let’s break down where some of that money went: BlackRock IBIT: Leading the pack, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) was a major beneficiary, attracting approximately $1.45 billion during the week. IBIT has consistently been a top performer in terms of attracting capital since its launch. ARK Invest ARKB: ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) also saw substantial interest, bringing in $621.13 million. This highlights continued investor appetite for Bitcoin exposure through different fund providers. While these two funds captured significant portions of the inflows, other spot Bitcoin ETFs also contributed to the overall positive net figure, demonstrating broad interest across the product range. Why Are These Bitcoin ETF Inflows So Important for the Crypto Market? The scale of these Bitcoin ETF inflows is a critical indicator for several reasons: Institutional Validation: Large inflows from major asset managers like BlackRock and ARK Invest underscore growing institutional acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin as an asset class. It moves Bitcoin further into the mainstream financial system. Supply Dynamics: When ETFs buy Bitcoin to back new shares, they are taking supply directly off the market. Consistent, large inflows can create significant buying pressure, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s price positively over time. Accessibility: Spot Bitcoin ETFs provide a familiar and regulated investment vehicle for individuals and institutions who may be hesitant or unable to directly hold cryptocurrencies. This expands the potential investor base dramatically. Market Sentiment: Strong inflows boost confidence across the entire crypto market , signaling healthy demand and potentially attracting further investment into Bitcoin and other digital assets. Comparing this week’s performance to historical data confirms its significance. The $3.06 billion inflow is a strong rebound from periods of lower inflows or even outflows seen in previous weeks, particularly following the initial post-launch excitement and subsequent market fluctuations. How Do BlackRock IBIT and ARK Invest ARKB Stack Up? Both BlackRock IBIT and ARK Invest ARKB have emerged as key players in the US spot Bitcoin ETF landscape. Their performance in attracting capital is often seen as a barometer for investor sentiment. Here’s a simplified look at their contribution last week: ETF Ticker Issuer Weekly Inflow (Approx.) IBIT BlackRock $1.45 billion ARKB ARK Invest / 21Shares $621.13 million While IBIT consistently leads in total assets under management and often weekly inflows, ARKB’s significant contribution demonstrates the competitive nature of the market and the widespread interest across different fund providers. Investors often choose between these based on factors like fees, issuer reputation, and specific investment strategies. What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges Associated with High Bitcoin ETF Inflows? While large inflows are generally positive, it’s important to consider the broader picture: Benefits: Increased Liquidity: Higher trading volume and assets under management in ETFs generally lead to better liquidity. Price Support: As mentioned, buying pressure from ETFs can provide support for Bitcoin’s price. Mainstream Integration: Solidifies Bitcoin’s position within traditional finance. Educational Impact: The existence and success of these products educate a wider audience about Bitcoin. Challenges: Market Correlation: ETFs tie Bitcoin’s performance more closely to traditional market hours and sentiment, potentially increasing volatility during those times. Centralization Concerns: A large portion of Bitcoin supply held by a few large institutions could raise centralization concerns for some crypto enthusiasts. Fee Structures: While competitive, ETF fees are an ongoing cost for investors compared to direct ownership. Regulatory Risk: The regulatory environment for crypto and related products can change, potentially impacting ETFs. Understanding these aspects is crucial for anyone observing the impact of US spot Bitcoin ETFs on the market. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors and Enthusiasts Watch Next? Given the recent strong Bitcoin ETF inflows , here are a few things to keep an eye on: Sustained Inflows: Is this $3.06 billion week a one-off surge, or the start of a new trend? Continued strong inflows would be a very bullish signal for the crypto market . Bitcoin Price Reaction: How does Bitcoin’s price respond to these inflows? Does it reflect the buying pressure? Other ETF Performance: Monitor the performance of other ETFs beyond just BlackRock IBIT and ARK Invest ARKB to gauge broader market participation. Regulatory Developments: Keep informed about any potential regulatory changes concerning Bitcoin or crypto ETFs. Global ETF Landscape: Watch for developments in other countries potentially launching similar spot Bitcoin products, which could further increase global demand. These factors will provide valuable clues about the ongoing trajectory of institutional adoption and its effect on the price and stability of Bitcoin. Conclusion: A Resounding Vote of Confidence for Bitcoin The $3.06 billion weekly inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs is a powerful statement. It underscores robust demand, significant institutional interest, and the growing integration of Bitcoin into traditional investment portfolios. With key players like BlackRock IBIT and ARK Invest ARKB attracting substantial capital, the infrastructure for mainstream Bitcoin investment is clearly gaining momentum. While the crypto market remains dynamic and subject to various factors, this recent surge in inflows provides a compelling positive signal for the future of digital assets and their role in the global financial landscape.

Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem shared the development on X, emphasizing the potential implications these products could have on investor sentiment and the broader XRP market dynamics. Proshares Short #XRP and UltraShort #XRP ETFs are launching and betting against XRP’s rising price using futures. If POPULAR, they depress *sentiment* by signaling bearish institutional views, potentially reducing investor confidence. If UNPOPULAR, sentiment impact is minimal,… pic.twitter.com/2L1X7Ykyx1 — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) April 27, 2025 Short and UltraShort ETFs Short and Ultra-short ETFs are financial products designed to profit from a decline in the price of an underlying asset, in this case, XRP. Rather than holding XRP directly, these ETFs use futures contracts to bet against XRP’s price. The Short XRP ETF typically aims to deliver the opposite of XRP’s daily performance, while the UltraShort XRP ETF seeks to achieve twice the inverse of XRP’s daily movement. Such products allow institutional investors and traders to hedge their portfolios or speculate on XRP’s price falling, without actually shorting the cryptocurrency themselves. Impact on Sentiment and Price Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem points out a critical factor: the popularity of these ETFs will determine their broader market impact. If these short ETFs gain significant traction among investors, it could send a strong signal that institutional players are bearish on XRP’s prospects. This, in turn, could dampen market sentiment, causing retail and even other institutional investors to lose confidence. Lower sentiment often correlates with weaker price performance, as fear and uncertainty grow within the community. On the other hand, if the Short and UltraShort XRP ETFs fail to attract meaningful interest, their impact would be minimal. In such a case, sentiment would likely remain unaffected, and the overall influence on XRP’s price would be negligible. A Strategic Moment for XRP The launch of short-selling products like these comes at a time when XRP is navigating a complex landscape. Between ongoing legal clarity developments in the United States and the rising interest in XRP-based ETFs globally, XRP is at a pivotal juncture. The introduction of these bearish instruments reflects a maturing market, where both bullish and bearish bets can now be more easily placed. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, it also underscores the importance of investor sentiment in crypto markets. In traditional financial markets, sentiment shifts can drive massive price swings, and in the often more volatile world of cryptocurrencies, the effect could be even more pronounced. ProShares’ decision to launch Short and UltraShort XRP ETFs marks a significant milestone for XRP’s financial ecosystem. While the real-world impact will largely depend on how investors receive these products, the message is clear: XRP is evolving into a more sophisticated asset with a full spectrum of investment tools, bullish and bearish alike. Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem’s insights highlight the delicate balance XRP faces: popularity among bearish ETFs could erode confidence, while their failure to gain traction could solidify bullish sentiment and stability. As the market watches closely, XRP’s next moves could be shaped not just by fundamentals or technicals, but by the underlying emotional pulse of its investors.

Investment Giant Grayscale Files with SEC! Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-ethereum-etf-staking-coming-investment-giant-grayscale-files-with-sec-here-are-the-details/,"Grayscale has taken a significant step toward expanding its Ethereum-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and held an official meeting with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Cryptocurrency Task Force. Grayscale Seeks SEC Approval to Enable Staking for Ethereum ETFs During the meeting, Grayscale filed to amend its Form 19b-4 filings for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH). The proposed changes would allow two funds to participate in staking activities and, if approved, would be a first for U.S.-listed Ethereum ETFs. Staking allows Ethereum (ETH) holders to earn rewards by locking up their tokens to support blockchain operations such as transaction validation and network security. Enabling Staking in ETFs could provide investors with additional returns beyond simple price appreciation. Grayscale’s move comes amid growing interest from institutional investors in not just holding digital assets but actively participating in blockchain ecosystems. However, staking-related activities within public funds remain a sensitive topic for US regulators, who have previously scrutinized staking programs offered by centralized crypto platforms. Approval of Grayscale’s changes would mark a significant shift in how crypto investment vehicles are structured in the U.S., blending traditional financial products with decentralized finance (DeFi) mechanisms. The SEC has not yet publicly commented on Grayscale's proposal. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Is Ethereum ETF Staking Coming? Investment Giant Grayscale Files with SEC!

The heavy selling, which follows a similar pattern observed over the past month, raises questions about insider rug-pulling and the future trajectory of the token. According to Lookonchain , the Melania team not only manipulated liquidity but also executed a calculated dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy to sell substantial amounts of tokens in small tranches, preventing sharp price crashes but maintaining consistent sell pressure. The #Melania team didn’t just add or remove liquidity to sell $MELANIA, they also employed a DCA strategy for direct sales! 2 days ago, they sold 1.18M $MELANIA for 4,230 $SOL ($632K) using the DCA strategy. Today, they are selling another 2.01M $MELANIA($938K) through the DCA… pic.twitter.com/FQBUghEogv — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 28, 2025 In the latest sales, the team sold approximately $632,000 worth of MELANIA two days ago, followed by another $938,000 today, bringing the total to over $1.5 million. Blockchain data from Solscan reveals that the team dispersed sales across multiple wallets, including addresses such as 38z***Tv and 9sV***RG. This strategic dumping occurred even as MELANIA’s price staged a 21% recovery in the past week. Source: LookOnChain Despite the price pump, MELANIA remains around 96% below its all-time high of $13.70, which was briefly reached on January 20, coinciding with President Donald Trump’s inauguration date. Yet the Melania team’s sell-offs are not isolated incidents. On April 20, blockchain analyst EmberCN reported that the team had already sold 23.45 million MELANIA tokens worth roughly $14.75 million over the prior month. They executed these sales through both centralized exchanges and liquidity manipulation on decentralized platforms, such as Meteora. On April 19 alone, the team sold 2.95 million tokens for 9,009 SOL, valued at approximately $1.2 million. Such aggressive selling has impacted market confidence. 7 小时前，又有 295 万枚 $MELANIA 被项目方以添加单边流动性的形式出售成 9,009 枚 SOL ($1.2M)。 过去 3 天里，$MELANIA 项目方继续从流动性跟社区地址转出 764.3 万枚 $MELANIA ($3.21M)，然后在 Meteora 上添加到 MELANIA/SOL 单边流动性，将 $MELANIA 在设定区间出售成 SOL。 其中 295 万枚… https://t.co/DCOMFOsGfz pic.twitter.com/zL2rIeTqOB — 余烬 (@EmberCN) April 19, 2025 Deepening Sell-offs and Connections to Previous Scandals The persistent selling has exacerbated fears of a potential rug pull, a concern that has surrounded the Melania meme coin almost since its inception. Back in February, blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps uncovered on-chain evidence linking the Melania project to the controversial Libra (LIBRA) token . Analysts claimed that the same wallet, 0xcEA, was involved in both projects, suggesting a coordinated insider effort to manipulate token launches for massive profits. @Bubblemaps has presented new on-chain evidence suggesting that the team behind Libra meme coin is responsible for launching Melania. #Bubblemaps #Libra https://t.co/lV88r49B5P — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 17, 2025 According to Bubblemaps, wallet 0xcEA heavily sniped MELANIA’s launch on January 19, turning a quick $2.4 million profit, which was laundered through multiple Solana wallets into Avalanche. Weeks later, the same wallet funded the launch of the LIBRA token, which similarly collapsed shortly after insiders reportedly cashed out $107 million. The collapse of the LIBRA token was swift and devastating. Within four hours of launch, the token’s value plummeted by 94%. Similar patterns have plagued MELANIA. After reaching an astonishing $13 billion market cap at its peak, MELANIA’s value plummeted by 99%, wiping out most of its early investors. Source: Cryptonews These findings suggest a pattern of behavior in which insiders create hype around politically themed meme coins, aggressively pump prices, and then rapidly sell off their holdings, leaving retail investors with substantial losses. Meme Coin Sector Faces Headwinds Amid Market Shifts The broader meme coin market itself is facing mounting pressures. Although a report on April 25 indicates that the market is recovering , attaining back its $60 billion market cap. Meme coin mania surges as $BONK ( @bonk_inu ) leads with 35.5% weekly gains, pushing sector cap to $60.3B amid cat-themed rallies and political token hype. #MemeCoins #Crypto https://t.co/V8c1BKMNcu — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 25, 2025 However, the launch and subsequent underperformance of high-profile tokens like TRUMP and MELANIA may have punctured the meme coin bubble. The waning enthusiasm suggests that investors may be shifting their focus to newer narratives or becoming increasingly cautious about the risks associated with politically themed meme projects. The struggles are not isolated to MELANIA alone. The TRUMP token, another prominent political meme project, has also seen a dramatic decline, from a peak price of $75.35 to just $8.14 within three months. Source: Cryptonews Although TRUMP has recently shown signs of recovery due to a fresh unlocking event releasing 40 million tokens worth over $300 million and the recent announcement of a private dinner with President Donald Trump to be attended by top holders. Despite general market stability, the Melania token continues to underperform. Within the last 24 hours, MELANIA’s price fell an additional 5%, underperforming other meme coins.

In the latest purchase announcement shared earlier on April 28, Saylor said the company he co-founded had acquired 15,355 BTC for $1.42 billion. $MSTR has acquired 15,355 BTC for ~$1.42 billion at ~$92,737 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 13.7% YTD 2025.

Named Beyond, Dymension’s new release means that any project can launch a rollup on virtually any chain – with Dymension serving as the universal settlement layer. Beyond certainly lives up its name, radically expanding the scope of Dymension’s capabilities while doing the same for existing L1 and L2 blockchains, all of which have effectively now gained a badge marked “Rollups-Compatible.” It’s a bold move that should not only raise Dymension’s profile, but drive down the barriers to enterprise blockchain adoption. Rollups-as-a-Service Rollups-as-a-Service (Raas) may not be as popular as SaaS, but it’s a service vertical that’s rapidly gaining ground in web3 circles. By posting minimal data back to the main blockchain for security and finality, rollups are so named because they “roll up” multiple transactions into a single batch. This is the trick to reducing main chain bloat and keeping transaction costs vanishingly small. The other benefit is that rollups inherit the security of the Layer 1 chain while improving scalability – making them analogous to the cuckoo which lays its eggs in other birds’ nests. In an industry that is constantly seeking greater efficiency without reducing protocol security, rollups tick all the right boxes, which is why they’ve become so popular in recent years. Dymension is at the vanguard of this trend, empowering businesses to create their own rollup in minutes. And that ability has just gotten even simpler. What’s cool about the Beyond upgrade is that it transforms the compatibility of every major blockchain without altering its code. You want Ethereum but with lower fees and less congestion? Beyond gives you that. The way the seemingly impossible is made possible is by having Dymension’s chain serve as the bridge connecting rollups and networks such as Ethereum and Solana. Businesses typically choose rollups over spinning up their own public or private chain for a narrow range of reasons: lower maintenance, lower fees, and quicker deployment. Dymension gives them all that, providing connectivity to the omnichain world in a single click. Faster, Stronger The headline upgrade that Beyond brings to the table is the promise of “any rollup, any chain,” but it also adds some other powerful features. Chief among these is a reduction in block times from five seconds to just a single second on Dymension, resulting in a significantly improved user experience. This is blockchain that doesn’t feel like blockchain: it feels like using a conventional web2 platform. It’s an upgrade that will prove invaluable, given that Dymension’s L1 is poised to start seeing a lot more action now that it’s becoming the settlement layer for the multi-chain rollups it now supports. The primary beneficiaries of the Beyond upgrade are obviously businesses looking to deploy their own rollup, who no longer need to study every EVM L2 out there, parsing the differences between optimistic and ZK rollups before settling on a favorite.With Dymension, all roads lead to all chains, and any rollup can be routed anywhere. But aside from benefiting businesses, Beyond also helps Layer 1 chains, which can now effectively bill themselves as rollup-compatible, even though they haven’t modified their underlying architecture. Dymension has described Beyond as being “a new chapter” rather than a mere upgrade, and the hyperbole appears justified in this case. It’s too early to call it a game-changer, but it’s certainly a bold move that will give traditional enterprises and web3 businesses pause for thought. The blockchain world probably doesn’t need more L1s – but there’s always space for more rollups. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The company spent about $1.42 billion at an average price of $92,737 per Bitcoin, according to an SEC filing Monday. The purchase brings Strategy’s total Bitcoin ( BTC ) holdings to 553,555 BTC, worth over $52 billion at Bitcoin’s current price of just above $95,000. The company’s cumulative average purchase price now stands at $68,459 per Bitcoin, reflecting a total investment of around $37.9 billion, including fees. Strategy’s holdings account for more than 2.6% of Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million supply. Meanwhile, competition in corporate Bitcoin accumulation is heating up . Firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald, SoftBank, Bitfinex, and Tether recently announced a $3.6 billion Bitcoin venture, while new entrants like Twenty One Capital , led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers, are launching with a Bitcoin-native strategy. Shares of Strategy’s MSTR closed 5.2% higher at $368.71 on Friday and are up another 1.42% in pre-market trading Monday. The stock has gained nearly 23% year-to-date, supported by Bitcoin’s price rebound and rising institutional interest in companies focused on Bitcoin.

As the country's 45th election comes to a close, a contract asking bettors to predict who will be Canada's next Prime Minister gives the Liberal Party's Mark Carney a 78% chance, and the Conservatives' Pierre Poilievre a 22% shot. Political bettors are slightly more skeptical of Carney's chances of winning than the polls, but both are pointing in the same direction. A poll aggregator from public broadcaster CBC puts Carney's chances at 89%. Myriad Markets , another prediction market, is giving Carney similar odds to Polymarket. FanDuel , a licensed betting platform open only to residents of Ontario, Canada, initially gave the Conservatives a sharp, contrarian lead of 70%, according to a report from the National Post . Still, odds have fallen in line with prediction markets, and it now gives the Liberals a roughly 80% chance of winning. Unlike the U.S. election, there isn't a crypto angle up north with leaders' campaigns focused on the trade war and inflation. Too Big to Rig? A growing narrative in certain corners of the internet is that Polymarket is prone to manipulation and its numbers aren't reliable, criticisms that echo what was said in the last weeks of the U.S. election when the site gave Donald Trump a commanding lead as polls showed a tight race. Critics say Poilievre's chances are being suppressed and do not reflect the political sentiment of the populace. However, manipulating prediction markets would be expensive, and there's no credible evidence that this is happening even as Polymarket is banned in Canada's largest province after a settlement with its securities regulator. Data portal Polymarket Analytics shows that the Canadian election contract leads the platform in open interest, which is the total value of active, unsettled bets and a good measure of market engagement. Market data also shows that position holding is quite distributed, with the largest holder of the Poilivere—No side of the contracting holding 6% of all shares and the largest holder of the Carney—Yes side holding 5%. One bettor, who is betting big on Carney with a six-figure position, who spoke to CoinDesk, said their motives are non-partisan, and said that the quality of Canadian polling makes him confident that the Liberals will win. ""Poilievre needs a 7-point polling error to win and I think the probability of that is closer to 7% than his current market price of 23c,"" trader Tenadome told CoinDesk via an X DM. ""The pool of Poilievre bettors seems to largely be very dumb money that believes in things like China is rigging the polls."" Currently, the trader with the largest winnings on the contract is "" ball-sack "" with a profit of $124,890, thanks to bets on Carney. On the other side of the trade is ""biden4prez,"" who lost just over $98,000 – the most out of any trader – betting on Poilievre and against Carney.

Other political-themed meme coins like TRUMP are also facing bearish sentiment, with whales opening sizable short positions. Meanwhile, Trump-backed World Liberty Financial signed a major partnership with Pakistan’s Crypto Council to promote blockchain adoption. Back in the US, President Trump proposed eliminating federal income taxes by funding the government through tariffs. Melania Team Deploys DCA Strategy The team behind the Official Melania Meme (MELANIA) token sold more than $1.5 million worth of tokens over the past three days. This points to a programmatic selling strategy that could add even more downside pressure to the token's price. On April 28 alone, the team sold $930,000 worth of MELANIA tokens, which followed a $630,000 sale two days earlier. According to blockchain intelligence firm Lookonchain, the pattern of these sales suggests a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, where assets are sold at regular intervals to manage market impact and reduce emotional trading decisions. Lookonchain noticed that the Melania team did not simply add or remove liquidity but employed DCA for direct sales as well. Despite the team's heavy selling, MELANIA's price managed to recover more than 21% over the past seven days. However, it still trades about 96% below its all-time high of $13.7, which was recorded on Jan. 20. This was the date of President Donald Trump’s inauguration. MELANIA’s all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Meanwhile, sentiment around other political-themed meme coins seems very bearish. A newly created whale wallet recently deposited $1.33 million worth of USDC to open a short position on the Official Trump (TRUMP) token at a price of $14.70, using 2x leverage. This short position will be liquidated if TRUMP’s price rises above $21.50. This indicated that the whale is quite confident that the token's price will fall. The broader meme coin market is still significant in the cryptocurrency sector. During the first quarter of 2025, meme coins represented around 27% of global investor mindshare, making them the second most popular investment theme after artificial intelligence tokens. AI tokens captured over 35%, according to a report by CoinGecko. However, some signs suggest that the meme coin narrative may be losing some steam. The launch of the TRUMP token and its disappointing performance coincided with a major decline in weekly usage activity on meme coin launchpad Pump.fun, which dropped from 2.85 million active wallets during the week of Jan. 20 to just 1.44 million by the end of March. According to CoinGecko’s co-founder Bobby Ong, the market seems to be continuing past trends without any major new narratives emerging just yet. World Liberty Financial Expands into Pakistan’s Crypto Market Another Trump project also recently took some big steps. Donald Trump-backed World Liberty Financial signed a Letter of Intent with the Pakistan Crypto Council to boost crypto adoption in one of the world’s fastest-growing digital asset markets. According to an April 27 report from Business Recorder, the partnership will focus on launching regulatory sandboxes to test blockchain products, expanding stablecoin use cases for remittances and trade, exploring real-world asset tokenization, and supporting the growth of decentralized finance initiatives. World Liberty founders Zach Witkoff, Zak Folkman, and Chase Herro signed the agreement in a recent meeting with the Council’s CEO Bilal bin Saqib, which was also attended by key Pakistani officials including the governor of the central bank, the finance minister, and the IT secretary. World Liberty Financial was launched last year with backing from Donald Trump and his family, and shares its profits with the former president's family. The Pakistan Crypto Council is a government-backed organization overseeing regulatory initiatives to boost crypto innovation and attract foreign investment. Pakistan’s efforts come as the country ranks ninth globally in crypto adoption, with an estimated 25 million active users and $300 billion in annual transaction volume, according to Chainalysis data . (Source: Chainalysis ) Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb explained that Pakistan’s young and tech-savvy population, with around 60% under the age of 30, represents a key advantage in driving innovation and global leadership in the blockchain economy. Pakistan’s push toward a more open crypto environment is reinforced by its recent engagement with key industry figures, including former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, who was appointed as an adviser to the Pakistan Crypto Council to assist with regulatory development and innovation strategies. In addition to private sector partnerships, Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency also recently proposed a new crypto regulatory framework that will be aimed at balancing innovation with national security concerns, particularly around terrorism financing, money laundering, and Know Your Customer standards. The proposed framework is expected to roll out in multiple phases starting in 2026. This crypto-friendly pivot is in stark contrast to the country’s position in May of 2023, when former finance minister Aisha Ghaus Pasha said that Pakistan would never legalize cryptocurrencies because of regulatory and security concerns. Trump Pushes for Tariff Funded Government Model Meanwhile, United States President Donald Trump recently announced that federal income taxes will be ”substantially reduced” or potentially eliminated once the administration’s new tariff regime is fully implemented. In an April 27 post on Truth Social, Trump stated that the primary beneficiaries of the proposed tax cuts will be individuals earning less than $200,000 per year. (Source: Truth Social ) He also mentioned that the ”External Revenue Service” concept, which would fund the federal government exclusively through tariffs rather than through the Internal Revenue Service, is beginning to take shape. The elimination of the federal income tax could serve as a positive catalyst for asset prices, including cryptocurrencies, as an increase in disposable income could encourage higher levels of investment. However, analysts still warned that this stimulative effect is not guaranteed and will depend heavily on broader economic conditions. Trump floated the idea of eliminating the income tax before, during an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience in October of 2024, but offered very few specifics at the time. The proposal was inspired by the late 19th-century Gilded Age when the US government relied largely on tariffs for funding, but it is still highly ambitious. Research from accounting automation company Dancing Numbers estimated that Trump's plan could save the average American $134,809 in lifetime tax payments, with potential savings rising to $325,561 if other wage-based taxes were also eliminated. Trump’s broader tariff policy, however, has drawn a lot of skepticism. On April 2, he signed an executive order introducing sweeping tariffs on all US trading partners, establishing a 10% baseline tariff with additional reciprocal rates against countries that tax US imports. Yet since the order was signed, the administration repeatedly revised its stance by altering tariff rates and delaying implementation dates. This lack of consistency contributed to increased volatility in US financial markets. Financial analysts criticized the protectionist approach, and argued that it undermines capital markets while offering few tangible benefits.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-28 13:37:04

The market looked to bounce even as tariffs remained a key issue that investors are increasingly seeing as a source of major uncertainty. The S&P 500 opened 0.28% up, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.45% and Nasdaq added 0.21%. Across the market, Bitcoin (BTC) was up nearly 2% above $95k and gold +0.3% around $3,307 per ounce. However, the U.S. Treasury yields also remained high on Monday, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield up 2 basis points to 4.29%. Meanwhile, the 2-year Treasury yield was at 3.76%.

As well as tariffs, still an area of notable uncertainty , the market will also be keen releases on the economic data front. While President Donald Trump’s tariffs remarks and an easing of pressure on Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell helped Wall Street extend weekly gains last week, the U.S.-China trade war situation remains largely cloudy. “I think there is a quiet, bubbling frustration about the status of these negotiations and the status of tariffs,” Jake Sherman, founder of Punchbowl, told CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’. Focus through the week will however not be just on the tariffs corner. Earnings and Fed’s personal consumer expenditure will highlight the week. Notable quarterly financial results investors are likely to pay attention to are from the Magnificent 7 that includes Big Tech giants Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META). “Markets have rebounded very nicely off the lows,” said Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist, head of investment solutions at Hightower Advisors. “I think we can continue to rally if earnings continue to be good.” The earnings come through the week, while PCE data, Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, will be out on Wednesday April 30.

Experts Warn the Trade War Could Push Us There!,https://coinpedia.org/news/us-recession-looming-in-2025-experts-warn-the-trade-war-could-push-us-there/,"The post US Recession Looming in 2025? Experts Warn the Trade War Could Push Us There! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The talk of a possible US recession in 2025 is getting louder, and it’s all linked to the ongoing trade war between the US and China that many of us have been hearing about for months. Experts are saying that if the situation doesn’t change soon, we could be in for a massive recession in 2025. Increasing Odds of a Recession in 2025 Since Trump took office for the second time, the US economy has been stable for a while now, but it now faces serious trouble. Torsten Slok, an economist at Apollo Global Management, recently warned that the US could experience a recession by 2025, mainly due to the trade war with China. In an interview, Slok explained that if the tariffs imposed on Chinese goods stay as high as they are now, up to 145%, the US could face a 4% drop in GDP, leading to a two-quarter economic contraction. The chances of a US recession in 2025 are rising, as the Polymarket now estimates a 56% chance of a recession , and these numbers are only going up. However, this would be a major setback for the economy, affecting businesses and everyday people alike. With no clear moves from the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates , the US could be heading toward an economic storm, and these numbers are only getting higher. Impact on Business and Jobs: Are We Feeling It Yet? It’s not just about the 56% possibility of recession; the effects of this trade war are already being felt in the real world. Major retailers like Walmart and Target are bracing for supply shortages. And the biggest reason behind these shortages is that tariffs have made it harder to get goods into the US. Worse, reports are showing that cargo shipments have dropped by a massive 60%. This could lead to shortages and even layoffs, which would make life harder for a lot of Americans. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : China and U.S. Reduce Bitcoin Reserves, Total Government Holdings Fall 12% in Nine Months , Small Businesses Are at Risk It’s not just the big companies that are struggling. Small businesses, especially in manufacturing, are also feeling the pain. Tariffs are driving up costs, and many of these businesses are already at risk of going bankrupt. If things don’t change, more small businesses might be forced to close. Can We Avoid a Recession? It’s still unclear if the US will go into a full recession in 2025. But one thing is certain: the trade war with China is having a big impact. If the tariffs stay, we might see more job losses and higher costs. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Onchain tracker Lookonchain reported the latest sell-offs. According to Lookonchain , the team is utilizing a dollar-cost average (DCA) strategy for direct sales of the MELANIA token. Two days ago, they sold 1.18 million MELANIA for $632,000 worth of SOL using the strategy, followed by the sale of another 2.01 million MELANIA for $938,000 today. Lookonchain said: “The #Melania team didn’t just add or remove liquidity to sell $MELANIA, they also employed a DCA strategy for direct sales!” DCA is a strategy where the investor buys or sells a specified amount of an asset once it hits a particular price. This selling method can be programmed, allowing the dumping of tokens at intervals. By adopting this strategy, the project team adds to the selling pressure that is already on MELANIA due to its over a month-long sell-off through exchange sales and unilateral liquidity to the MELANIA/SOL pool. With the latest sales, the MELANIA team has now dumped over 33 million tokens since March 16 while raking in almost $20 million in SOL from the sales. The profit taking has continued despite concerns of a slow rug pull. MELANIA no longer mirroring TRUMP performance Meanwhile, the continued sell-off of MELANIA is now affecting its performance. Although the memecoin is up 21% in the past week, it may not be able to defy the continued selling pressure for long. The reason behind its rise earlier was the TRUMP memecoin team announcing an exclusive dinner for the top 220 holders of TRUMP. While the news caused TRUMP token to rise and pushed MELANIA’s value due to its affiliation, there is now a divergence in their price performances. TRUMP is up 2% today and is currently trading above $15, while MELANIA has fallen more than 6% to $0.4511. That divergence will likely continue given that even in the past week, MELANIA only gained 21% compared to over 80% gained for TRUMP. TRUMP memecoin’s recent gains have allowed it to wipe off medium-term losses, with the token showing positive 48% performance in 30 days. However, MELANIA is still down 26.54% in that period as it has not been able to sustain its gains. The divergence is not surprising given how the sell-offs have affected interest in MELANIA and piled more selling pressure on the token. Its 24-hour trading volume according to CoinMarketCap, is less than $30 million despite a circulating supply of 550 million tokens. By comparison, TRUMP’s circulating supply of 200 million tokens has had over $1.47 billion in trading volume. This is a reflection of the demand in the asset and its sustained buying pressure. However, one thing that both memecoins have in common is that most of those who bought them are in the red. TRUMP is down 79% from its peak price, while MELANIA has lost 96.5% of its value since reaching its all-time high. Whale shorts TRUMP despite recovery trend Despite TRUMP memecoin enjoying a resurgence in performance, one whale is betting on its subsequent decline. According to Lookonchain , the whale funded a new wallet with $1.33 million in USDC to short the token on Hyperliquid. The whale has an entry price of $14.787, with their liquidation price at $21.528, showing that they do not expect the current momentum to last. This is coming at a time when the token has the top netflow in the last 24 hours. Token netflow in the last 24 hours (Source: Nansen) Nevertheless, some people believe the bearish sentiment around TRUMP is reasonable given that there will be unlocks of the token scheduled over the next two months. Token unlocks will increase the circulating supply, which will increase selling pressure. The demand for the token, which has been close to its January levels over the past week, could also plunge after May 12, which is the last day for determining which holders qualify for the exclusive dinner.

Are you wondering where Bitcoin is heading next? The market is buzzing with analysis, and one voice, in particular, is catching attention. According to renowned on-chain analyst Willy Woo, the underlying health and activity of the Bitcoin network are flashing undeniably bullish signals, suggesting that a significant upward move could be on the horizon. This shift in Bitcoin fundamentals is a key indicator many traders and investors watch closely. Understanding the Bullish Shift in Bitcoin Fundamentals Willy Woo, a widely respected figure in the crypto analysis space, recently shared his insights, highlighting a critical turning point for Bitcoin (BTC). His analysis centers on the fundamental strength of the network itself, looking beyond mere price action to understand the true health of the asset. What exactly does this shift entail? Capital Flows Are Rising: Woo points to an increase in the amount of capital entering the Bitcoin network. This isn’t just about price going up; it’s about new money flowing in, indicating growing interest and adoption. Total and Speculative Flows Bottomed: He notes that both the overall flow of capital and the more speculative flows have hit their lowest points and are now trending upwards. This suggests that the market has absorbed previous selling pressure and is now seeing renewed buying interest from various participant types. Alignment Creates Bullish Environment: The combination of rising capital inflows and the bottoming out of speculative flows creates a powerful confluence. This alignment, according to Woo, provides a strong fundamental backdrop for potential price appreciation. Think of it like a company’s stock. While the stock price fluctuates daily, its long-term potential is often dictated by its underlying business fundamentals – revenue growth, profitability, market share, etc. In the crypto world, on-chain data like capital flows serve as a proxy for these fundamental metrics, showing the real activity and value being transacted on the network. What Does On-Chain Analysis Reveal About Capital Flows? For those new to the concept, On-chain analysis involves examining data recorded on the public blockchain ledger. This includes transaction volumes, active addresses, miner activity, and, crucially, capital flows. Unlike traditional market analysis that relies on price charts and trading volume on exchanges, on-chain data provides a transparent look at what’s happening directly on the network. Willy Woo specializes in interpreting this complex data to understand market cycles and investor behavior. When he talks about capital flows, he’s looking at metrics that track the movement of value into and out of wallets, distinguishing between long-term holders, short-term speculators, and new entrants. The recent data, in his view, shows a healthy influx, indicating robust demand that can support higher prices. Examining Willy Woo Bitcoin ‘s Latest Price Targets Building on his bullish fundamental outlook, Willy Woo has also updated his BTC price prediction models. These models often leverage on-chain data and historical cycles to project potential future price levels. It’s important to remember that these are targets based on specific models and analysis, not guarantees. According to Woo, Bitcoin has already successfully reached and surpassed some significant medium-term targets he had previously identified. These include the approximately $90,000 and $93,000 levels. Hitting these milestones is often seen as validation for the underlying model’s predictive power. Decoding the Latest Bitcoin Price Target Projections With the earlier targets met, attention now shifts to the next potential levels. Woo highlighted that the ambitious $108,000 target remains an active projection based on his analysis. Furthermore, a new, slightly closer interim target has emerged at $103,000. These figures represent potential points where Bitcoin’s price could reach if the current bullish fundamental trend continues to play out as his models suggest. Here’s a quick look at the targets mentioned: Previous Medium-Term Targets Reached: ~$90,000, ~$93,000 New Interim Target: ~$103,000 Active Longer-Term Target: ~$108,000 These targets are derived from complex models that factor in network growth, investor behavior, and supply dynamics. While hitting $100,000 has long been a psychological milestone for Bitcoin, these specific figures from Woo provide a data-driven perspective on potential near to medium-term tops based on his current read of the market’s structure and flows. Is This the Right Time for BTC Price Prediction and Action? Given the current conditions and the bullish signals from On-chain analysis , Willy Woo suggests a strategic approach for investors. His view is that with fundamentals strong and capital flowing in, any price dips should be considered potential buying opportunities. This perspective is rooted in the belief that the underlying strength of the network will ultimately drive the price higher over time. However, he also adds a crucial caveat: short-term price dips are still likely. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and even within a strong uptrend, corrections and pullbacks are normal. Therefore, while the long-term outlook may be bullish based on his analysis, investors should be prepared for potential short-term fluctuations. Actionable Insights: Consider the potential significance of rising capital flows as a fundamental strength indicator. Understand that price targets like $103,000 and $108,000 are model-based projections, not guarantees. Evaluate potential short-term dips as opportunities if your investment strategy aligns with a bullish long-term outlook based on fundamental analysis. Always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making investment decisions. Willy Woo’s analysis is one perspective among many. Potential Challenges/Considerations: Market sentiment can shift rapidly, overriding fundamental signals in the short term. Unexpected global economic events can impact risk assets like Bitcoin. On-chain analysis, while powerful, is an interpretive field, and different analysts may draw different conclusions. Price targets are just that – targets. Market dynamics can prevent them from being reached or cause them to be exceeded. Conclusion: Riding the Wave of Bullish Fundamentals? In summary, the message from Willy Woo Bitcoin analysis is clear: the foundational elements supporting Bitcoin’s value appear increasingly robust. Rising capital flows, confirmed by On-chain analysis , suggest that the network’s health is improving, setting the stage for potential significant price movements. With previous targets met and new ones like $103,000 and $108,000 in focus, the outlook from this perspective is decidedly optimistic. While short-term volatility is expected, the prevailing sentiment from this analysis is that the current environment favors long-term accumulation. As always, navigate the market with caution, informed by multiple perspectives and your own diligent research.

While the XRP price has risen to $3 due to many factors, XRP is breaking new records in Japan. Japan's banking sector is preparing for a major change, with nearly 80% of banks planning to adopt XRP by 2025. At this point, according to a report prepared by SBI VC Trade, the cryptocurrency arm of Ripple partner SBI Holdings, XRP has surpassed Ethereum in trading volume in the last 30 days. Accordingly, while XRP became the second most traded cryptocurrency last month, just after Bitcoin, this was interpreted as a strong sign that XRP still has a large follower base, especially in Japan, where it has been popular for years. According to the data, Japanese investors preferred Bitcoin (BTC) in first place, XRP in second place, Ethereum (ETH) in third place, Solana (SOL) in fourth place, and Dogecoin (DOGE) in fifth place. SBI Group CEO Yoshitaka Kitao voiced his strong support for XRP, highlighting its growing use in international money transfers via RippleNet. In a sign of XRP’s growing popularity in Japan, XRP was recently made available on Mercoin, one of Japan’s largest marketplaces, as the third cryptocurrency after Bitcoin and Ethereum.

This is not merely coincidental; RTX has been referred to as “XRP 2.0,” which speaks volumes about its new and improved approach to the intricacies involved in worldwide money transfers. Given these events, let’s take a closer look at the reasons why Remittix is now garnering so much attention and interest from the crypto world and beyond. Remittix (RTX) Momentum Builds Among Investors Momentum continues to build and gather strength for Remittix, popularly referred to as RTX. Remittix has been able to amass a staggering amount of over $14.6 million, trading at a current price of $0.0757 for every token. Besides this success, the firm has also sold over 529 million tokens to investors. As per the analysis presented by Mitrade , this fast and high rate of growth is reflective of the high degree of confidence that investors have in the practical and real-life use of RTX in the large and continuously developing worldwide remittance market. Analysts working with CoinCentral have done a comprehensive review versus Remittix, comparing it to the infrastructure being leveraged over at Ripple. They have praised its phenomenal ability to reduce fees considerably while pointing to the immense speed with which transactions are processed and settled. Remittix has a very clear and differentiating use case that makes it stand out, in a sense giving it a huge edge not just over speculative meme coins but even over platforms that are a bit slower in nature. There are several reasons why increasingly more Cardano and Solana investors are embracing the current trends existing within today’s market. Why Cardano and Solana Investors Are Joining the Shift The latest addition of XRP to Cardano’s Lace Wallet speaks volumes about the platform’s firm dedication to bringing about interoperability between different cryptocurrencies and blockchain networks. Nevertheless, in spite of this remarkable development and enhancement, ADA’s price still exhibits a mediocre performance, trading at the $0.65 level. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, Solana’s outlook is mixed. SOL is now trading at a price very near $148.52, and based on technical analysis, there are signals that indicate the possibility of rallies or breakdowns in its price. Cointribune has reported and explained this in detail. According to CryptoDnes , the enthusiasm and hype for Remittix are continuously growing since it is offering users instant financial use cases that are proving to be greatly useful to them. Why Investors Are Calling Remittix ‘XRP 2.0’ Remittix’s focus on enabling cross-border payments is indicative of the core purpose that XRP is representative of, but it differs by taking an innovative and contemporary approach that differentiates it from conventional practices. The professionals at CryptoTimes have the opinion that there are market segments that have remained unpenetrated or unreached by XRP, but which can be captured by RTX. Given the large and valuable remittance market that we have today, it is evident that the potential growth prospects of Remittix may be huge and sizable if the adoption trend continues to evolve.

Bitcoin is increasingly gaining recognition as a safe asset, similar to gold or the US dollar. NYDIG Research pointed out that Bitcoin is shifting from a speculative investment to a reliable store of value, especially after the introduction of US trade tariffs. XRP Leads Major Altcoin Gains Coming to altcoins, XRP led the major gains, rising almost 8%, driven by the approval of a ProShares ETF , which will see three futures-tracked products go live on April 30. Cardano’s ADA gained more than 3%, while BNB Chain’s BNB added just 1%. Ether remained neutral. Solana was also up over 1%, while SUI made gains of over 4% in the past day. Monero (XMR), however, saw an unexpected surge , soaring over 40% to hit $371. Currently, it’s trading at $268, up 17% in the last 24 hours. When Will Altcoins Rally? Analysts Share Predictions Arthur Hayes, in a recent blog post , shared that he expects altcoins to start gaining momentum once Bitcoin breaks its previous all-time high of $110,000; it could surge further, potentially nearing $200,000. However, he warned that not all altcoins will perform well during the potential altcoin season. Analyst Moustache believes that the biggest part of the altcoin rally is yet to come. He thinks the worst is now over and expects many green candles going forward. Crypto Rover highlighted that altcoins are breaking out of a 140-day downtrend. He noted that this could signal the start of a massive utility season ahead. Analyst Wimar.X predicts that the biggest altcoin season in history is about to begin, with altcoins forming a triple-bottom pattern, hinting at a potential parabolic rally. He expects that the total altcoin market cap could reach $15 trillion during this cycle, although such predictions come with significant risks due to the volatile nature of crypto markets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Congress Struggles to Meet Trump’s August Deadline for U.S. Crypto Regulation , Altcoin Index Stands At 18 Bitcoin is currently the dominant force in the market, holding 63.4% of the total market share.

At the time of writing, daily trading volume stands at $81.4 billion, reflecting a moderate decline from the previous day. Among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, most are trading in the green. Bitcoin (BTC is up 1.4% over the past 24 hours, currently priced at $95,360, marking a 9.2% gain over the week. Ethereum (ETH) follows with a 0.7% daily increase, trading at $1,821.62, and showing an impressive 11.4% rise over the past seven days. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) leads the top performers in this category, climbing 12.5% over the week to trade at $0.1821. On the downside, Solana (SOL) and XRP saw minor pullbacks, with SOL down 0.5% and XRP slipping 0.4% in the past day, though both remain positive on the weekly chart. Notably, Sui (SUI) emerged as a standout performer, soaring 68.7% over the past seven days to trade at $3.84, reflecting growing investor interest. In the trending category, privacy coin Monero (XMR) surged 17.4%, fueled by recent market events, while Casper Network (CSPR) topped the gainers list with a 56% jump. Nike Faces $5M Lawsuit Over Alleged NFT Rug Pull Nike is being sued for $5 million in a class action lawsuit after investors accused the company of orchestrating a rug pull by shutting down its NFT subsidiary, RTFKT, in January. The plaintiffs claim Nike promoted unregistered securities through its branded NFTs, which were intended for trading on secondary markets. Nike was sued for $5M USD because of the RTFKT rug. This video will be presented by the plaintiffs as evidence in court: pic.twitter.com/XGDF0X5UDi — wale.moca (@waleswoosh) April 28, 2025 Following RTFKT’s closure, the value of the Nike-themed NFTs collapsed, with investors stating they would not have purchased the tokens had they known about the regulatory risks or the impending shutdown. RTFKT, acquired by Nike in 2021, announced its wind-down in late 2023. Crypto Funds See $3.4B Inflows Global crypto investment products managed by firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale saw a surge of $3.4 billion in net inflows last week, marking the third-largest inflow on record, according to CoinShares . Analysts attribute the spike to investor concerns over U.S. tariff impacts and a weakening dollar, positioning digital assets as a growing safe-haven alternative.

Bitcoin-focused products dominated the inflows, attracting $3.2 billion globally, with U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs contributing over $3 billion—the highest in five months. Bitget and Avalanche Partner to Drive Web3 Adoption in India Crypto exchange Bitget and blockchain platform Avalanche have announced a strategic partnership to promote grassroots Web3 adoption in India. The collaboration focuses on educational initiatives, community programs, and financial support, aiming to boost awareness and development of blockchain technology across the country, according to a Monday press release .

In an April 28 X post , Ethereum Foundation co-executive director Tomasz Kajetan Stańczak said that the organization is aiming to deploy the Fusaka Ethereum network upgrade in Q3 or Q4 2025. Still, the exact rollout schedule has not been decided yet. The comments come amid controversies over the upcoming implementation of the EVM object format (EOF) upgrade for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) . As Stańczak pointed out, EOF is expected to be a part of the Fusaka network upgrade. Source: Tomasz Kajetan Stańczak The EVM is the software that runs Ethereum smart contracts . EOF would implement a series of protocol changes, known as Ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs), with profound implications for how it operates. EOF introduces an extensible and versioned container format for the smart contract bytecode that is verified once at deployment, separating code and data for efficiency gains. Related: Researcher proposes scaling Ethereum gas limit by 100x over 4 years Wrap, stamp once, send Bytecode is a low-level, compact set of instructions. Solidity smart contracts must be compiled into bytecode before the EVM can execute them. EOF defines a container module for smart contract bytecode, replacing today’s free-form bytecode blobs with a better-defined structure. These objects would be composed of: A header starting with the 0xEF00 hexadecimal value, followed by a one-byte version number to ensure upgradability. A section table, providing metadata about the contents of the container. Each entry comprises one byte setting for the kind of entry and two bytes for the entry’s size. Sections with the actual content, with at least one code section and any necessary data sections — more types of sections could be added through future EIPs. This structure streamlines EVM operation, allowing for higher efficiency and lower processing overhead. This upgrade would result in a cleaner developer environment and easier-to-understand deployed smart contracts. Don’t JUMP, RJUMP instead! EIP-4200 , one of the EOF EIPs, provides an alternative to the JUMP and JUMPI instructions, which allow the program to move execution to any arbitrary byte offset. This kind of execution chain leads to hard-to-spot bugs (the JUMP value being wrong in some instances may not be easy to predict) and makes it easy to hide malware in data blobs and move the execution pointer there. This practice is known as dynamic jump, and EIP-4750 (under review) proposes disallowing dynamic JUMP/JUMPI inside EOF smart contracts, rejecting them entirely during a later phase of EOF deployment. In its current form, this EIP replaces them with call function (CALLF) and return from function (RETF) function calls. Those new instructions would ensure that destinations are hardcoded into the bytecode, but legacy pre-EOF smart contracts would be unaffected. Developers who opt to use JUMP or JUMPI after the upgrade will have their bytecode go through deploy-time validation, which ensures that they can never jump into data or the middle of another instruction. This verification would take place via EIP-3670 ’s code-validation rules, plus the jump table ( EIP-3690 ), so every destination is checked. As an alternative to those functions, EOF implements RJUMP and RJUMPI instead, which require the destination to be hardcoded in the bytecode. Still, not everyone is on board with EOF implementation. Related: Ethereum community members propose new fee structure for the app layer EOF has its haters EOF is the implementation of 12 EIPs with profound implications for how smart contract developers work. Its supporters argue that it is efficient, more elegant, and allows for easier upgrades down the line. Still, its detractors argue that it is over-engineered and introduces further complexity into an already complex system such as Ethereum. Ethereum developer Pascal Caversaccio lamented in a March 13 Ethereum Magicians post that “EOF is extremely complex,” as it adds two new semantics and removes and adds over a dozen opcodes. Also, he argued that it is not necessary. He said all the benefits could be introduced in “more piecemeal, less invasive updates.” He added that the legacy EVM would also need to be maintained, “probably indefinitely.” Caversaccio also explained that EOF would require a tooling upgrade, which risks introducing new vulnerabilities due to its large attack surface . Also, he said, “EVM contracts get much more complicated due to headers,” while currently empty contracts weigh just 15 bytes. Another developer raised a separate point in the thread: “Perhaps as a meta point, there seems to be disagreement about whether major EVM changes are desirable in general. A stable VM, on which people can invest in building up excellent tooling and apps with confidence, is much more valuable.“ Caversaccio appears to be in good company in his opposition to EOF. A dedicated poll on the Ethereum polling platform ETHPulse shows that 39 voters holding a total of nearly 17,745 Ether (ETH) are opposed to the upgrade.

The upcoming Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Funds aims to offer non-US institutional investors an opportunity to earn consistent returns on their BTC holdings. Participants will enjoy yearly net profits of between 4% and 8%, paid in Bitcoin. Mister Crypto @misterrcrypto · Follow BREAKING:COINBASE IS LAUNCHING AN INSTITUTIONAL FUND OFFERING YIELD ON BITCOIN.INSANELY BULLISH! 4:55 pm · 28 Apr 2025 275 Reply Copy link Read 35 replies The new investment vehicle presents a competitive alternative to yield-generating cryptocurrencies like Solana and Ethereum, which offer staking rewards. Notably, Coinbase leverages the “cash-and-carry” trade strategy to help institutional players maximize returns on their Bitcoin holdings. Coinbase Asset Management president Sebastian Bea commented on the move, stating: Coinbase AM believes the next cycle needs better products to enable institutional investment in digital assets. We believe the Bitcoin Yield Fund is particularly well suited to the task, given its conservative and compliant investment strategy. The “cash-and-carry” trade strategy: what is it about? The Coinbase BTC Yield Fund will use the cash-and-carry trade approach. Common in traditional finance, the strategy leverages the price differences between BTC spot (market price on exchanges) and BTC perpetual swaps. Perpetual swaps are futures contracts that do not expire. Thus, their prices should mimic Bitcoin’s actual value. Nonetheless, that’s not usually the case. Perp prices diverge from spot values during market rallies as the bulls rush to capitalize on the optimistic trends. Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund leverages the misalignment to generate passive income for BTC investors. The fund’s approach will work best amid Bitcoin rallies as the price discrepancy widens. The only risk is that the yields reduce or become negative during bearish markets. Only for non-US customers Details show that only companies outside the US can participate in Coinbase’s new fund. That could be due to the United States regulations on crypto offerings. Meanwhile, eligible institutional players can invest by depositing Bitcoin assets into the fund to own a share of the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund. While promising considerable returns, the team has guaranteed it will ensure low leverage to reduce risks. Moreover, customer funds will remain on Coinbase and other authorized custodians to secure underlying assets. Crypto market overview The new product from Coinbase Asset Management comes as digital assets eye robust gains. Bitcoin displays resilience as it held above $90,000 in the past week, teasing a break past the crucial obstacle at $95,000. The prevailing sentiments support continued recovery for Bitcoin.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one standout, still available at a modest entry price of $0.025. While larger-cap assets grab the headlines, investors are zooming in on this low-cap DeFi token that analysts say could be gearing up for a 3400% rally once it hits public markets. With so many speculative plays circulating, the appeal of a project like Mutuum lies in its actual utility. It’s not just promising potential—it’s laying the groundwork to deliver on it. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) The numbers speak volumes. Mutuum has already raised over $7 million in its presale, with more than 420 million tokens sold and nearly 9,000 wallet holders already involved. As of now, the fourth presale phase is halfway sold out, and interest is ramping up fast. Once this phase closes, the price will move to $0.03—locking in a 20% gain for early buyers. Given there are only 11 presale phases in total, each stage brings a new price increase, creating urgency among those who don’t want to miss out. Getting in early often leads to the highest potential returns. What separates Mutuum Finance from many other presale tokens is the combination of real functionality and smart token mechanics. The platform is built for decentralized lending and borrowing, where users can either supply assets or borrow against their existing holdings using smart contracts. These contracts are undergoing a full audit by CertiK, further reinforcing the protocol’s transparency and security focus. When users deposit assets into Mutuum, they receive mtTokens—digital assets that represent their deposit plus real-time interest accumulation. These mtTokens aren’t just placeholders; they’re active tools. Users can hold them, trade them, or use them within broader decentralized applications. This system ensures that every dollar put into the protocol is working, constantly growing through interest-based yield. A portion of its protocol earnings is used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens are then redistributed to mtToken holders and participants within the ecosystem. It’s a closed-loop system that reinforces value instead of diluting it. The current entry point of $0.025 opens the door for massive returns. Analysts are eyeing a conservative $0.85–$1.00 price target post-launch, which would already represent a 3400% increase from today’s valuation. And that’s without factoring in what happens once exchange listings begin. Exposure to wider audiences almost always triggers new waves of buying activity, and Mutuum has already hinted at major exchange announcements coming shortly after launch. To put that in perspective: a $1,200 allocation at the current price secures 48,000 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches just $0.85, that position would be worth over $40,000. A $2,500 investment? You’re looking at potentially $100,000+ in return. Beyond the financial forecasts, the core of the project is focused on sustainability. The team is preparing to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin designed to give users liquidity without forcing them to sell core assets. This feature alone gives Mutuum a real-world use case that goes beyond hype. Borrowers retain ownership of their assets while unlocking liquidity, and lenders generate passive income through dynamic APY, depending on pool utilization. These are functions seasoned crypto investors actively look for—and Mutuum has packaged them together with flexibility and simplicity. While many investors chase tokens that have already hit the spotlight, Mutuum Finance offers the kind of asymmetric upside that only early-phase entries can. Backed by DeFi utility, a working roadmap, and strategic tokenomics, it’s becoming one of the best crypto projects to consider before launch. With the presale still open and the next price increase already in sight, MUTM isn’t just a DeFi token to watch—it’s the one to act on.

With $3.18 billion flowing into Bitcoin products last week alone, the pioneer cryptocurrency accounted for the majority of the $3.4 billion in total inflows. This momentum not only erased the previous outflows recorded since early April but also pushed Bitcoin’s year-to-date (YTD) inflows to a strong $3.7 billion. Source: YahooFinance The surge in Bitcoin inflows can be largely attributed to a combination of macroeconomic factors and market-specific developments. Mounting concerns over the impact of tariffs on corporate earnings, coupled with the dramatic weakening of the U.S. dollar, drove investors toward assets seen as resilient to traditional market shocks. Bitcoin, often referred to as “digital gold,” naturally attracted investors seeking a safe haven. Coinciding with the renewed interest was Bitcoin’s impressive price action. After a volatile period earlier in the year, Bitcoin reclaimed the $90,000 mark last week, its highest level since March, and continued to push higher towards $95,000. Source: Cryptonews U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs also played a critical role in this resurgence, accounting for over $3 billion of the weekly net inflows.

Meanwhile, blockchain equities, particularly Bitcoin mining-related ETFs, saw an additional $17.4 million in net inflows. Ethereum Reverses Outflows as XRP, Sui Gain; Solana Stumbles While Bitcoin dominated the headlines, Ethereum also experienced a notable reversal of fortunes last week. After enduring eight consecutive weeks of outflows, Ethereum-based investment products attracted $183 million in new inflows, signaling a renewed surge in investor confidence. U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs played a crucial role in this turnaround, contributing $157.1 million to the inflows and registering their first net positive weekly inflow since February. Source: SosoValue The positive momentum extended beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP investment products recorded a substantial $31.6 million in inflows, reflecting growing optimism around the asset, possibly tied to regulatory clarity and continued institutional interest . Meanwhile, Sui (SUI) funds saw $20.7 million in inflows, highlighting investor appetite for newer, emerging blockchain ecosystems. However, not all altcoins shared in the gains. Solana stood out as the sole major digital asset product to experience outflows last week, with $5.7 million exiting Solana-based investment vehicles. Regionally, while U.S. investors dominated with $3.3 billion in inflows, the positive sentiment was echoed globally. Source: CoinShares Germany and Switzerland notably contributed $51.5 million and $41.4 million in inflows, respectively, while Australia, Sweden, and Hong Kong also recorded modest gains. On the issuer side, BlackRock’s iShares ETFs led the inflow charts , attracting a remarkable $1.5 billion, with ARK and Fidelity following at $621 million and $574 million, respectively. @BlackRock ’s IBIT leads $917M Bitcoin ETF inflow surge with a record $643M single-day haul, signaling strong institutional demand as Ethereum ETFs lag. #Bitcoin #BitcoinETFs https://t.co/cW3CDz38Pa — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 24, 2025 Despite this strong performance, a few issuers, including Grayscale, ProShares, and CoinShares, continued to experience outflows month-to-date, suggesting that investors are rotating toward newer or better-performing products.

Ever wonder what happens behind the scenes with those popular meme coins? Sometimes, the teams behind them make moves that can significantly impact the market. We’ve just seen a notable instance involving the Melania Meme token , and it’s worth taking a closer look. What’s Happening with the MELANIA Token Team? According to insights shared by the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain on X, the team responsible for the MELANIA token has been actively selling a substantial amount of their holdings. This isn’t just a small transaction; we’re talking about a significant offload of tokens over a short period. Specifically, Lookonchain reported that the team is currently in the process of selling 2.01 million MELANIA tokens, which were valued at approximately $938,000 at the time of the report. This follows a prior sale just two days earlier, where they offloaded 1.18 million tokens for 4,230 SOL, equivalent to about $632,000. Combining these amounts, the total value of MELANIA tokens sold by the team within a three-day window exceeds $1.57 million. Understanding the Crypto Team Offload Strategy One interesting detail highlighted by Lookonchain is the strategy the team is employing: Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA). Now, you might be familiar with DCA as an investment strategy where you buy a fixed dollar amount of an asset at regular intervals, regardless of the price. The goal is to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall purchase. However, in this scenario, the team is using DCA in reverse – to sell. This means they are likely selling a fixed dollar amount (or a fixed amount of tokens) at regular intervals over time, rather than dumping everything at once. Why would a team choose this method for a crypto team offload ? Minimize Market Impact: Selling a large amount of tokens all at once can flood the market, causing a sharp price drop. DCA selling spreads the sales out, potentially reducing volatility and preventing a crash. Realize Value Over Time: It allows the team to capture an average selling price over the period, rather than being subject to the price at a single point in time. Fund Operations or Other Ventures: Teams often hold a significant portion of the token supply. Selling some of these tokens can provide necessary funds for project development, marketing, exchange listings, or even personal gain. While DCA selling can be seen as a more responsible way for a large holder to exit compared to a sudden dump, it still represents consistent selling pressure on the token’s price over the period the strategy is active. The Role of Lookonchain Analysis How do we know about these team movements? This is where on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain analysis come into play. These tools monitor public blockchain data, tracking transactions from specific wallets, including those known to belong to project teams, early investors, or large holders (often called ‘whales’). By analyzing transaction patterns, wallet balances, and token flows, platforms like Lookonchain can identify significant activities such as large buys, sells, transfers to exchanges, or the adoption of specific strategies like DCA. This provides transparency in a market that can often feel opaque. For investors, following on-chain analysis can offer valuable insights: Identifying potential selling pressure from large holders. Spotting accumulation phases. Understanding how tokens are moving within the ecosystem. Gauging team activity and potential intentions. However, it’s crucial to remember that on-chain data provides information about transactions, not necessarily the full story or motivation behind them. It’s a powerful tool but should be used in conjunction with other research. What Does This Meme Coin Team Selling Mean for Investors? The fact that the team behind a project is engaging in significant meme coin team selling is a piece of information that investors should consider carefully. While not inherently malicious (teams need funds), it can signal several things: Potential Price Impact: Consistent selling, even via DCA, adds supply to the market, which can put downward pressure on the price, especially if demand doesn’t keep pace. Team Confidence: Large-scale selling might raise questions about the team’s long-term confidence in the project’s growth potential, or signal they are prioritizing taking profits. Supply Distribution: It changes the distribution of the token supply. While it might decentralize holdings slightly, it means a significant portion of the initial supply held by the team is entering the market. For holders of the Melania Meme token , this news means being aware of potential ongoing selling pressure. It doesn’t automatically mean the price will crash, but it’s a factor influencing market dynamics. Actionable Insights for MELANIA Holders and Meme Coin Investors: Given this information, what steps can investors take? Stay Informed: Continue monitoring on-chain reports and news related to the project. Evaluate Your Position: Reassess your investment in MELANIA based on this new information and your own risk tolerance. Understand the Risks: Meme coins are inherently volatile and high-risk investments. Team selling adds another layer of potential volatility and uncertainty. Look Beyond the Hype: While community and hype drive meme coins, fundamental analysis (like token distribution and team activity) is still relevant for understanding potential risks. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially with high-risk assets like meme coins. Challenges and Considerations Investing in meme coins, and specifically navigating situations like a crypto team offload , comes with significant challenges: Volatility: Prices can swing wildly based on social media sentiment, news, and whale movements like team selling. Lack of Fundamentals: Many meme coins lack a strong use case or underlying technology, making their value purely speculative and driven by community and hype. Information Asymmetry: Project teams often have more information about their plans and holdings than retail investors. On-chain data helps bridge this gap but isn’t perfect. Trust: Team selling can erode investor trust, particularly if not communicated transparently or if it appears excessive. While some may view team selling as necessary for funding, others see it as a red flag, indicating a potential exit strategy rather than long-term commitment. Conclusion: Keeping an Eye on the MELANIA Token Movement The revelation that the team behind the Melania Meme token has been systematically offloading over $1.57 million worth of MELANIA using a DCA strategy is a significant development. Highlighted by Lookonchain analysis , this instance of meme coin team selling underscores the importance of transparency and the potential impact of large holder movements in the crypto market, particularly within the volatile meme coin sector. While DCA selling is a smoother approach than a sudden dump, it still represents sustained selling pressure. Investors should stay informed about this crypto team offload and factor such activities into their risk assessment when dealing with meme coins.

Coinbase to launch yield-bearing Bitcoin fund for institutions Coinbase, the world’s third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, is launching the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund on May 1, aiming to offer Bitcoin ( BTC ) exposure for institutional investors outside the US. The fund targets an annual net return of 4% to 8% on Bitcoin holdings, according to an April 28 blog post by Coinbase. “To address the growing institutional demand for bitcoin yield, Coinbase Asset Management is excited to introduce the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF),” the company wrote. The fund is backed by multiple investors, including Aspen Digital, a digital asset manager based in Abu Dhabi and regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority. Coinbase introduces a Bitcoin yield-bearing fund. Source: Coinbase The yield will be generated through a cash-and-carry strategy, through the difference between spot Bitcoin prices and derivatives. Unlike Ether ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ), Bitcoin holders can’t generate passive income through staking — a gap the fund is aiming to fill, according to the announcement: “Bitcoin yield funds have emerged to address this limitation, but these funds generally require institutional allocators to take on significant investment and operational risk.” The new fund seeks to lower the investment and operational risks typically associated with Bitcoin yield products, which Coinbase says will better align with the risk appetite of institutional investors. Bitget sends legal letters to alleged VOXEL manipulators Bitget’s lawyers have sent letters to eight account holders at the crypto exchange , accusing them of manipulating the price of perpetual futures contracts tied to the VOXEL token and pocketing $20 million in total. Bitget’s head of Chinese operations, Xie Jiayin, said in an April 27 X post that those behind the eight accounts will receive the legal letters in “quick succession,” and it will redistribute any recovered funds to its other users.

The trading pair clocked over $12 billion in volume, dwarfing the metrics of the same contract on Binance. After the pause, Bitget rolled back the irregular trades to claw back the gains.

43904998,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65419,1745848541,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Touts This Major XRP Ledger Update,https://timestabloid.com/expert-touts-this-major-xrp-ledger-update/,"Crypto advocate Max Avery recently emphasized a significant challenge facing the cryptocurrency industry: the reliability of multi-step transactions. According to Avery, about 30% of multi-step crypto transactions encounter completion issues. He noted that this problem poses a major barrier for institutions that require high reliability in their operations. Avery says that without dependable transaction processes, institutional adoption of blockchain technologies remains difficult. To address this concern, Avery pointed to the XRP Ledger’s new XLS-56 update. He explained that this update is designed to make transactions “smarter, safer, and way more reliable.” In many blockchain ecosystems today, if one step in a multi-step transaction fails, funds can get stuck in limbo. Avery stated that XLS-56 tackles this persistent issue through a redesign of how complex transactions are handled on the XRP Ledger. About 30% of multi-step crypto transactions have completion issues….a major problem for institutions that need things to work reliably. The #XRP Ledger’s XLS-56 update works to make transactions smarter, safer, and way more reliable. 1/20 pic.twitter.com/WZkAmW4Ach — Max Avery (@realMaxAvery) April 25, 2025 Transformative Features of XLS-56 Avery described XLS-56 as a system that allows up to eight transactions to be bundled together under built-in governance rules. Instead of relying on external code or risky workaround solutions, participants can now define precisely what should happen if part of the transaction sequence fails. He stressed that this logic is embedded directly into the XRP Ledger, eliminating the need for costly development teams to maintain fragile custom scripts for basic functionality. Work on XLS-56 began in 2019, and after several years of refinement, Avery reported that it is now ready for implementation. The update introduces four modes for managing transaction groups, each designed to solve specific, real-world problems. The first mode, AtomicMode (“All or Nothing”), ensures that all transactions succeed or fail together. Avery indicated that this mode is suited for operations where complete integrity across multiple steps is essential. He provided an example involving simultaneous payment transfers, database updates, and contract locks, explaining that AtomicMode ensures a clean rollback with no partial states if any part fails. The second mode, FirstSuccessfulMode (“Only One”), attempts each transaction in sequence and stops after the first success. Avery explained that this is ideal for scenarios where a backup option is needed, such as paying a bill from one of several wallets without knowing which has sufficient funds. Some developers, he added, are already applying this model to subscription payment models. The third mode, StopOnFailureMode (“Until Failure”), processes transactions sequentially but halts the sequence if any transaction fails. Avery stated that this is well-suited for step-by-step operations where each subsequent action depends on the success of the previous one. By stopping immediately upon failure, cascading errors are prevented, thereby protecting both funds and process integrity. The fourth mode, IndependentMode, processes each transaction separately, with the success or failure of one not affecting the others. Avery pointed out that this mode is appropriate for multi-party settlements or operations where each transaction carries independent significance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Simplifying Complex Processes for Broader Adoption Avery emphasized that before XLS-56, achieving such transactional flexibility typically required clunky off-chain systems or hiring developers to build costly workarounds. With XLS-56, this functionality is now native to the XRP Ledger . He suggested that this unlocks new possibilities, including automated trading platforms, self-enforcing escrow contracts, and decentralized insurance systems. Avery mentioned that one developer even built a conditional insurance payout system with just a few hundred lines of code, illustrating the simplicity and efficiency the update offers. He also highlighted another important improvement: transaction signing. Previously, users had to manually sign multiple transactions individually. With XLS-56, a single signature (or two, if multiple accounts are involved) generally covers all bundled transactions. Testing showed an 87% reduction in signing time, leading to a faster and cleaner experience for users. Avery stressed that smoother user experiences are essential for building trust, particularly among institutions exploring blockchain adoption. Enhancing Trust Through Certainty Beyond technical efficiency, Avery pointed out that XLS-56 provides psychological reassurance by eliminating the risk of funds or data becoming trapped in uncertain states. For large institutions, he argued, transactional certainty is not optional—it is a fundamental requirement. According to Avery, XLS-56 removes one of the largest barriers to institutional participation in blockchain ecosystems. He concluded by stating that the goal of crypto innovation extends beyond speed. It is about making transactions smarter, safer, and more reliable. Avery described XLS-56 as a major step toward achieving these objectives. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Bessent reiterated on CNBC that while various branches of the U.S. government remain in contact with Chinese officials, it is ultimately up to China to take steps toward a trade de-escalation. He said that while China sells “five times more to us than we sell to them,” Bessent emphasized that the current 125%–145% tariffs are “unsustainable.” As such, the imbalance gives China a greater incentive to seek compromise. While President Trump’s tough tariff stance has stirred debate among investors, Bessent noted that the U.S. is working with a standardized trade negotiation framework for other key countries. With 15 to 18 major trading relationships under review, Bessent said multiple Asian nations have already offered significant proposals to lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers. His comments appear to have at least stabilized markets with equities edging higher and Bitcoin ( BTC ) holding on to the $94,000 level. U.S. will remain the premier global investment hub Addressing concerns about the U.S. losing its edge as the premier global capital home, Bessent highlighted the administration’s commitment to tax certainty, deregulation, and fairer trade as key pillars of keeping the U.S. “the best place in the world for capital to arrive.” He contrasted this with Europe’s slower growth and heavy regulation, warning that Europe’s high tariffs on goods and services were damaging its competitiveness. This is evident in the Euro Stoxx 50 index delivering a 1.86% annualized return over the past 20 years compared to over 10% for the S&P 500 index. Bessent also predicted that the European Central Bank would soon cut rates to weaken the euro. Meanwhile, the U.S. remains committed to a strong dollar policy. Public comments the same as private When asked about market reactions to earlier comments regarding a possible “near-term de-escalation” in trade tensions, Bessent clarified that he had said nothing privately at a JPMorgan investor meeting that he hadn’t already shared publicly in interviews just days earlier. He noted that while markets temporarily rallied following the meeting, the moves were likely based on misinterpretation rather than new information. Bessent stressed that the broader U.S.-China economic relationship remains complicated, but he believes that structural realities will ultimately force change. China’s economic model is heavily reliant on subsidized exports to the U.S. which is no longer sustainable in today’s environment of heightened tariffs and growing scrutiny. “We believe what is unsustainable will not be sustained,” Bessent stated.",News|Donald Trump|stocks|tariffs,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-28 13:56:51

XRP’s recent short-term gains may be short-lived, as on-chain data suggests whale activity could signal an impending sell-off. Specifically, on April 28, a massive transfer of 29,532,534 XRP, worth approximately $68.7 million, was moved from an unknown wallet to crypto exchange Coinbase , according to Whale Alert data . XRP whale transaction. Source: Whale Alert Large transfers of XRP to exchanges are often considered precursors to sell-offs, which can exert downward pressure on prices. Typically, such movements indicate that the holder may be preparing to sell. The mechanics are simple: If the XRP is sold on Coinbase, the sudden increase in supply could depress prices, especially in a thin market with limited buying interest. This could trigger a cascading effect, where stop-loss orders are activated, and panic selling accelerates the decline. Additionally, such moves often spark fear and uncertainty among retail investors. Mixed sentiment around XRP whale transaction Regarding this particular transfer, crypto insights platform Alva noted that it could precede a “quick dump,” potentially triggering a sharp price drop. However, in an X post on April 28, Alva also pointed out that sentiment among traders remains mixed. While some fear a sell-off, others are optimistic about the broader market backdrop, including growing speculation around a potential XRP ETF. Big size to Coinbase always gets traders talking—right now, the transfer has the community split. Some see a setup for a quick dump as XRP whales move to exchanges, while others are betting ETF hype and legal wins will keep the bid strong. Watch for volatility and fast reactions… — Alva (@AlvaApp) April 28, 2025 In this context, XRP is witnessing increased interest ahead of the ProShares launch of three XRP futures ETFs on April 30. One product seeks to profit from price declines, another aims to target 2x daily gains, and a third aims to achieve 2x inverse daily performance. At the same time, there is growing hype around the possible approval of a spot ETF by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States, especially as other regions, such as Brazil, have unveiled the world’s first similar product. XRP price analysis By press time, XRP was trading at $2.32, rising over 6% for the day. Similar gains are also visible on the weekly chart, where the token is up almost 10% amid sustained capital inflows. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Following the large whale transaction, XRP remains vulnerable. Immediate support lies at $2.20, and a breakdown below this level could accelerate losses toward the key psychological barrier of $2. Conversely, a decisive move above $2.50 suggests bullish sentiment overpowering selling pressure.

And Could it Outperform Avalanche (AVAX)?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/which-new-token-has-the-highest-growth-potential-after-listing-in-2025-and-could-it-outperform-avalanche-avax/,"The crypto space is a hotbed of innovation and fun, where Avalanche is still getting developers and users all sorts of excited with its blockchain. But another project is quietly making its move to be the next big thing in crypto. Ruvi AI, a token that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain, is making its presence known before its highly anticipated listing. Avalanche is getting traction for its scalability and adoption in various use cases, Ruvi AI is a contrast to just another blockchain project, but one that wants to redefine how AI is applied in everyday apps. Its presale is making waves and its potential for huge returns has got investors sitting up and taking notice. Ruvi AI’s Entry Ruvi AI entered the crypto scene with a bold idea—to make artificial intelligence accessible and impactful through blockchain networks.

Its presale performance is a proof of growing investor confidence. Within days, Ruvi AI sold over 10 million tokens, raising more than $100,000 and built credibility as a serious project. Investors were further reassured by the release of a beta version of its AI-powered platform, showing a roadmap that’s not just theoretical but tangible and actionable. The underlying concept of Ruvi AI is to merge blockchain’s decentralized infrastructure with artificial intelligence’s decision making power. Whether it’s optimizing efficiency for businesses or enabling breakthroughs in diagnostic tools for healthcare, Ruvi AI is targeting real world applications—not just trading charts. Why Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI’s approach is different from both established players and other emerging tokens. The project is focused on solving practical problems often overlooked in the crypto space, combining cutting edge AI algorithms with secure and immutable blockchain technology. This blockchain utility has given Ruvi AI a unique positioning that appeals to tech savvy investors looking for tokens with usability and scalability. The presale success is a major takeaway for observers: Ruvi AI isn’t just building hype; it’s showing its long term potential. With its early demonstrable success it’s on track to be a key player for exponential growth in a crowded market. VIP Tiers Packed With ROI Ruvi AI has VIP tiers for a variety of investors, where contributors are rewarded generously. Two tiers stand out for their potential. For those dipping their toes in crypto but looking for rewards, VIP Tier 2 is the entry point. A $500 investment during the presale gets 50,000 tokens at the current price of $0.01, with an additional 40% bonus for a total of 70,000 tokens. At listing price of $0.07 this would be worth $4,900. If Ruvi AI reaches its long term target of $1, the ROI for this tier would be 13,900%, a great option for conservative yet growth seeking investors. For those with higher risk tolerance and appetite for big gains, VIP Tier 5 is the way to go. A $5,000 investment gets 500,000 tokens, doubled to 1,000,000 tokens with 100% bonus. Immediate returns can be seen at listing price of $0.07, making the initial investment worth $70,000. If Ruvi AI scales to $1 per token, the value would be $1,000,000, an ROI of 19,900%. These tiers show Ruvi AI’s commitment to rewarding early believers who see its upward trajectory. Technology + Community One of the things that makes Ruvi AI special is its focus on community engagement alongside financial incentives. Through its Leaderboard Rewards program Ruvi AI encourages participation and rewards top contributors. For the most committed backers, those in the Top 10 get 500,000 tokens as rewards, worth $500,000 if Ruvi AI’s projections hold true. Even those in the Top 1000 aren’t left out, with 20,000 tokens each and a potential value of $20,000 in a bull run. This leaderboard approach not only builds its community but ensures long term loyalty among its early adopters. Why Ruvi AI Could Be the Next Big Thing While Avalanche is the established blockchain ecosystem, Ruvi AI is the disruptor. By focusing on transformational applications of AI and blockchain Ruvi AI is carving out a new niche that combines two of the most exciting technologies of the 21st century. Its presale success, strong incentive structures like VIP tiers and community focused rewards make it more than just another token. Avalanche may be the best in terms of established blockchain infrastructure but Ruvi AI is the innovation that keeps the crypto world spinning. If high growth potential before listing is the metric for an investment then Ruvi AI has everything. Get Ready for a Strong Launch As Avalanche sets the bar high for blockchain ecosystems Ruvi AI is the project that’s about to break out. With unique applications, accessible investment tiers and big ROI potential Ruvi AI is getting the attention of cautious entrants and seasoned investors. For crypto enthusiasts looking to ride the next wave of blockchain innovation Ruvi AI means the future of technology isn’t just speculation but practical, scalable solutions. Keep an eye on this project because its peak will redefine what high growth investments look like in today’s crypto economy.

This vision of a multi-chain DeFi landscape, in which cross-chain can be experienced without cumbersome blockchain bridges, is a step closer to reality thanks to Supra . The Layer 1 chain has just launched two major upgrades on its public testnet that have huge potential for the broader DeFi landscape. AutoFi and SupraNova are the products Supra’s just shipped and between them they pack a bunch of powers that should excite devs and users alike. AutoFi is particularly interesting, supporting the creation of self-executing smart contracts dependent upon highly granular conditions being met. This is effectively Automation as a Service, and it opens the door to some exciting possibilities for use in decentralized finance. Automation Meets Onchain Innovation AutoFi’s automation capabilities aren’t just wide-ranging – they’re also fast. So fast in fact that they can be set to trigger within the same block as the conditions that have been met to cause their execution. As Supra proclaims , “AutoFi changes everything with enshrined automation for true “if-this-then-that” style apps.” While devs are free to create whatever they want with AutoFi, Supra sees particular value in it being used to automate recurring fees; to support competitive bidding for onchain events such as liquidation auctions; and for protocol-level automation, such as distributing fees to all network users. AutoFi’s current public testnet deployment will allow third-party developers to get a feel for the sort of use cases AutoFi supports before Supra ships it on mainnet, allowing for sophisticated auto-executing dapps to be deployed in a live environment. Supra Goes SupraNova The other major product to have been rolled out by Supra is SupraNova, which is also live on public testnet from April 29. It’s described as “the first bridgeless cross-chain interoperability protocol that enables direct, trustless L1-to-L1 communication without relays, wrappers, or third-party multisigs.” In layman’s terms, it’s a safer way to send value between chains. Think less hacks, better security. One of the problems with software design, not just in web3 but in general, is that systems tend to add complexity over time through introducing more plug-ins, upgrades, and patches. Each time this occurs, the surface attack area increases. SupraNova is an attempt to do away with things like multi-sigs and token wrappers, both of which have been successfully exploited by attackers in the past. Initially compatible with Ethereum, before expanding to accommodate the full EVM stack, SupraNova has the potential to radically change the way blockchains “talk” to one another. There are also plans in progress to make it compatible with Move VMs, which could ultimately see SupraNova become a bridgeless interoperability solution for the entire omnichain landscape. While that’s further down the line, in the here and now, Supra’s brace of new products have showcased its team’s ability to innovate while giving DeFi devs some new tools to play with. In the process, they’ve moved the center of decentralized finance closer to Supra, and shone a spotlight on its multi VM-compatible Layer 1.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 14:00:36

The ongoing Bitcoin ( BTC ) recovery has been driven by recent optimism surrounding a potential trade deal between the United States and China. Bitcoin and other altcoins also jumped after Trump hinted that he was not going to fire Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman. Trump has changed his mind on tariffs and Powell’s firing following recent turmoil in the bond market, driven by bond vigilantes . Bitcoin now has another major catalyst that could push its price higher over the longer term: the soaring unrealized losses among U.S. banks. The recent bank earnings season revealed that U.S. banks are holding over $482 billion in unrealized losses. These unrealized losses stem from longer-dated Treasury bonds that banks purchased during the era of low interest rates. You might also like: Strategy acquires 15,355 more Bitcoin for $1.4b, holdings top 550k BTC Interest rates have surged from near zero during the pandemic to over 4% today. This increase has caused the value of existing fixed-income securities to drop, as their yields are now less attractive compared to newly issued bonds offering higher yields. A good example of this is a ten-year government bond issued in 2020, when yields were near zero. Today, similar bonds yield between 4% and 5%. Some of the banks most affected by unrealized losses are Bank of America, Charles Schwab, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo. The challenge for banks is that they cannot easily sell these bonds without realizing large losses, which could impact their stock prices. At the same time, the Federal Reserve may find it difficult to cut interest rates, as Trump has demanded , since doing so could lead to higher inflation. The risk, is that one or more banks, will end up like First Republic Bank , which collapsed in 2023 because of its high unrealized losses. Analysts note that Bitcoin may benefit if these banks may benefit as these risks rise because it is becoming a safe-haven asset. One analyst wrote that : “This massively reinforces the structural case for Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin isn’t just an “inflation hedge.” It’s becoming the collateral of last resort as trust in traditional collateral evaporates.” Bitcoin price technical analysis BTC price chart | Source: crypto.news The 3-day chart shows that the BTC price has bounced back over the past few days. It recently crossed the crucial resistance level at $88,666, the neckline of the double-bottom pattern that formed earlier this month. Bitcoin remains above the key resistance at $73,805, which marks the upper side of the cup and handle pattern. It has also moved above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages, signaling that bulls remain in control. Therefore, the most likely scenario is for the coin to rise toward the important resistance at $100,000. After that, Bitcoin could soar to its all-time high of $109,300, followed by the cup and handle target of $122,000 .

Đó chính là Bitcoin FilmFest , sự kiện văn hóa độc lập mang tính đột phá tại Warsaw, Ba Lan. Kể từ lần đầu tiên tổ chức vào năm 2023, lễ hội này đã nhanh chóng trở thành điểm hội tụ lý tưởng giữa nghệ thuật điện ảnh và những giá trị cốt lõi của hệ sinh thái Bitcoin như phi tập trung, tự chủ tài chính và tinh thần sáng tạo không biên giới. Năm 2025, Bitcoin FilmFest sẽ diễn ra từ ngày 22 đến 25/5 tại rạp Kinoteka , tọa lạc trong tòa nhà mang tính biểu tượng – Cung Văn Hóa và Khoa Học ở trung tâm Warsaw. Từng là biểu tượng của quyền lực tập trung thời Liên Xô cũ, nay tòa nhà này lại trở thành không gian để thảo luận về tự do cá nhân và triết lý phi tập trung – những giá trị nền tảng của Bitcoin. Nghe có vẻ nghịch lý, nhưng chính sự đối lập đó đã tạo nên nét đặc biệt và sức hút khó cưỡng của lễ hội này! Điểm Nhấn Mới Tại Bitcoin Film Fest 2025 . Nếu bạn đang thắc mắc điều gì đặc biệt tại kỳ lễ hội năm nay, thì đây chính là cơ hội để khám phá cách mà Bitcoin thể hiện không chỉ là một công nghệ tài chính mà còn là một hiện tượng văn hóa và xã hội. Chương trình năm nay bao gồm hàng loạt phim tài liệu và phim truyện đa dạng, phản ánh tầm ảnh hưởng toàn cầu của Bitcoin. Lần đầu tiên nghe về Bitcoin Film Fest ? Hãy nghĩ về nó như một cuộc chơi của những bộ phim kết hợp với tinh thần cộng đồng Bitcoin. Dự án này bắt nguồn từ Warsaw, Ba Lan, nhưng tầm ảnh hưởng của nó đã lan rộng khắp thế giới. Không chỉ dừng lại ở lễ hội chính tại Warsaw, Bitcoin Film Fest còn tổ chức các sự kiện vệ tinh nhỏ hơn – được gọi vui là “BFF minis” – tại Lisbon, Cape Town, San Salvador và Lugano. (Nhân tiện, đây cũng là nơi bộ phim tài liệu của Bitfinex , “ Don’t Trust, Verify ” , lần đầu ra mắt đấy!) Đặc biệt, địa điểm chính – tòa nhà Cung Văn hóa và Khoa học – từng là biểu tượng của quyền lực trung ương thời Liên Xô. Việc chọn nơi này làm sân khấu chính càng làm nổi bật thông điệp về phi tập trung và tự chủ. Lễ hội không chỉ dừng lại ở việc chiếu phim, mà còn tạo cơ hội kết nối cho các nhà làm phim độc lập, nhà sản xuất và khán giả quan tâm đến hệ thống tiền tệ mở. Mục tiêu cuối cùng? Khuyến khích đối thoại phê bình và xây dựng một không gian sáng tạo mới tại giao lộ giữa chủ quyền kỹ thuật số và nghệ thuật kể chuyện. Bứt Phá Hơn Và Nhiều Lan Tỏa Đánh dấu lịch nào! Từ 22-25/5/2025 , Bitcoin FilmFest sẽ trở lại với chương trình đặc sắc kéo dài 4 ngày tại Warsaw. Điểm nhấn của lễ hội năm nay là những bộ phim khám phá Bitcoin không chỉ như một công nghệ tài chính, mà còn như một hiện tượng văn hóa và xã hội. Chương trình đa dạng từ phim tài liệu đến phim truyện, đưa khán giả đi từ Mỹ Latinh đến châu Phi, từ câu chuyện cá nhân đến bức tranh toàn cầu. Bitcoin is the Mycelium of Money ví Bitcoin như mạng lưới nấm dưới lòng đất, kết nối mọi thứ lại với nhau. Revolución Bitcoin đưa bạn đến Mỹ Latinh, nơi Bitcoin đang trở thành công cụ giúp người dân vượt qua bất ổn chính trị. Còn Zones of Prosperity thì đào sâu vào các thí nghiệm kinh tế địa phương sử dụng Bitcoin. Không thiếu những tác phẩm mang chiều sâu tâm lý và cảm xúc. Finding Home kể về hành trình tìm kiếm danh tính trong thời đại tài chính không biên giới. Unbankable thì làm nổi bật những con người bị hệ thống tài chính truyền thống bỏ rơi – và cách Bitcoin mang lại hy vọng cho họ. Và đừng quên Hotel Bitcoin – bộ phim hài nhẹ nhàng nhưng đầy châm biếm về những kiểu người bạn có thể gặp trong thế giới Bitcoin. Tất cả các tác phẩm đều góp phần làm rõ vai trò của Bitcoin trong việc định hình lại không chỉ nền kinh tế, mà cả văn hóa, nghệ thuật và danh tính cá nhân. Tại Sao Điện Ảnh Bitcoin Quan Trọng? Phim về Bitcoin không chỉ là phim – chúng là tấm gương phản ánh mối quan hệ phức tạp giữa công nghệ, tài chính và con người. Những bộ phim này ghi lại câu chuyện của những cá nhân và cộng đồng đang thay đổi thực tế kinh tế của mình, thoát khỏi khuôn khổ truyền thống. Chúng mang đến góc nhìn khác biệt so với cách tài chính thường được miêu tả trên màn ảnh lớn: khô khan, trừu tượng và xa rời cuộc sống. Văn hóa Bitcoin trên màn ảnh không chỉ giáo dục, mà còn kích thích suy ngẫm. Bạn sẽ không chỉ hiểu cách hệ thống giá trị được xây dựng, mà còn đặt câu hỏi: Ai có quyền định hình chúng? Và trên cơ sở nào? Đây là sự tiếp nối di sản của dòng phim chính trị và kinh tế, nhưng được cập nhật cho thời đại hậu tổ chức, nơi công nghệ mã hóa đóng vai trò trung tâm. Sự xuất hiện của một dòng phim Bitcoin riêng biệt đánh dấu bước chuyển mình văn hóa lớn hơn: từ những câu chuyện phi tập trung đến truyền thông tham gia. Những bộ phim này không chỉ nói về giao thức hay tiền tệ – chúng khám phá Bitcoin như một biểu tượng của sự đột phá, khả năng và kháng cự. TÓM LẠI LÀ: Bitcoin Film Fest không đơn thuần là một lễ hội phim – đó là nơi hội tụ của nghệ thuật, công nghệ và những triết lý sống. Nếu bạn muốn hiểu Bitcoin từ góc nhìn văn hóa, hoặc đơn giản là tìm kiếm trải nghiệm điện ảnh thú vị, đây chắc chắn là sự kiện dành cho bạn. Với những bộ phim đa dạng từ tài liệu sâu sắc đến truyện hư cấu hài hước, lễ hội hứa hẹn mang đến nhiều cảm hứng và suy ngẫm. Vậy nên, hãy lưu ngày và chuẩn bị tinh thần để bước vào thế giới nơi điện ảnh gặp gỡ công nghệ. Ai biết được, có khi bạn sẽ tìm thấy ý nghĩa mới mẻ về tự do tài chính và sức mạnh của cộng đồng!

43905379,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/ethereum-price-eth-crosses-bridge-towards-7000-is-coldware-closer,1745849333,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/43905379.jpeg,"Ethereum Price: ETH Crosses Bridge Towards $7000, Is Coldware Closer?",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/ethereum-price-eth-crosses-bridge-towards-7000-is-coldware-closer,"Ethereum (ETH) has long been a frontrunner in the cryptocurrency space, consistently evolving and enhancing its ecosystem. Recent updates, such as the new Ethereum proposal to increase transaction throughput and scalability, have sparked a wave of optimism around the second-largest cryptocurrency. As Ethereum pushes toward a potential $7,000 price point, many crypto enthusiasts are wondering if Coldware (COLD) could soon be following a similar upward trajectory, bolstered by its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) and its upcoming presale stages. Coldware's Parallel Growth: A Presale Gem Rising in the DeFi Space While Ethereum continues to gain traction, Coldware (COLD), a Layer 1 blockchain with a strong focus on DeFi and tokenization, is making waves in its own right. Coldware’s presale, which is nearing Stage 3, has generated significant interest due to its unique value proposition: offering secure, decentralized finance solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing crypto ecosystems. With Ethereum pushing toward higher scalability, Coldware is positioning itself as a viable competitor, providing decentralized lending, staking, and tokenized assets. Coldware’s emphasis on security, ease of use, and decentralization make it an attractive project for investors who are looking for the next big DeFi platform. As Coldware (COLD) progresses through its presale stages, its roadmap and growing community suggest that it could soon join the ranks of high-performing assets in the crypto market. Ethereum's Momentum: Scaling Up Towards $7,000 Ethereum’s price action has recently shown signs of life, with the coin crossing key price thresholds and approaching new all-time highs. The ongoing proposal, known as Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 9698, aims to increase Ethereum’s transaction capacity to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). This ambitious upgrade promises to increase Ethereum’s scalability significantly, enabling the network to compete with high-throughput blockchains like Solana. Such technical improvements are driving confidence among Ethereum investors, with many speculating that ETH could soon reach the $7,000 mark. Ethereum’s evolving ecosystem, especially with the integration of Layer-2 scaling solutions and upcoming protocol updates like EIP-9698, strengthens the long-term outlook for the coin. Many investors and analysts are bullish, believing that these updates will position Ethereum as a more sustainable platform capable of handling global-scale decentralized applications. What Coldware’s Success Means for the Market Coldware’s market potential is being increasingly recognized as it nears its presale's Stage 3. As Ethereum focuses on scaling and increasing its transaction capacity, Coldware (COLD) has the opportunity to capture a niche in the decentralized finance space with its secure and efficient solutions. As more investors and institutions recognize the potential for scalable and secure DeFi ecosystems, projects like Coldware will likely see increased demand and adoption. Coldware’s price trajectory mirrors Ethereum’s in some ways, with both assets benefitting from the growing adoption of blockchain technology and decentralized finance. While Ethereum’s scalability solutions will undoubtedly boost its price, Coldware’s early-stage growth and potential to disrupt the DeFi sector give it a promising future. The Role of Ethereum's Technological Evolution in Coldware’s Rise Ethereum’s technological advancements play a crucial role in Coldware’s ability to succeed. As Ethereum continues to expand its use cases, Coldware (COLD) could leverage this growth by providing secure, decentralized alternatives that complement Ethereum's ecosystem. With Coldware focusing on DeFi applications and tokenization, it will likely attract Ethereum users and developers looking for greater security, privacy, and flexibility in their financial solutions. Furthermore, Ethereum’s increasing focus on AI and decentralized finance, combined with Coldware’s focus on decentralization, sets the stage for a stronger blockchain ecosystem where multiple projects can thrive together. By positioning itself as a DeFi solution with security and utility at its core, Coldware could mirror Ethereum’s rise, drawing interest from both retail and institutional investors alike. Conclusion: Coldware and Ethereum’s Symbiotic Relationship While Ethereum is likely to continue its impressive climb toward the $7,000 price point due to technological advancements like EIP-9698, Coldware’s increasing presence in the market makes it one to watch in the coming months. As Ethereum scales its network, Coldware’s DeFi innovations will be key in providing users with the security and utility they need to thrive in the blockchain space. The crypto market is ripe for innovation, and Coldware (COLD) is poised to capitalize on the evolving demands of decentralized finance, potentially following Ethereum’s footsteps and carving its own path to success.

For Ethereum, the leading smart contract platform, this capacity is largely dictated by the Ethereum gas limit . Recently, a groundbreaking proposal has emerged that could dramatically reshape Ethereum’s future scaling potential, promising a massive increase in throughput. Understanding the Ethereum Gas Limit and Why it Matters Before diving into the specifics of the new proposal, let’s quickly recap what the Ethereum gas limit is. Think of gas as the fuel needed to execute operations on the Ethereum network. Every transaction, every smart contract interaction, requires a certain amount of gas. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that can be spent per block. This limit is dynamically adjusted by validators based on network conditions, but there’s a hard cap voted on by the network. Why is this limit so crucial? It directly impacts how many operations (and thus, how many transactions) can fit into a single block. A higher gas limit means more operations per block, leading to potentially higher ETH transactions per second (TPS) for the base layer. However, increasing the gas limit also means larger blocks, which require more resources (processing power, storage, bandwidth) from the nodes running the network. This balance is critical for network health and decentralization. EIP-9698: Unpacking Dankrad Feist’s Ambitious Proposal The recent buzz surrounds a proposal put forth by prominent Ethereum researcher Dankrad Feist . Known as EIP-9698 , this plan outlines an ambitious strategy to increase the network’s gas limit by a factor of 100 over a four-year period. According to reports, the phased rollout is slated to begin in June 2025. Here are the key details of the EIP-9698 proposal: Starting Point: The proposal targets a gradual increase beginning mid-2025. Phased Growth: Instead of a single, large jump, the gas limit would increase tenfold every two years. Four-Year Horizon: The full 100x increase would be achieved by the end of the four-year period. Target Limit: If implemented, the gas limit could eventually reach an astounding 3.6 billion per block. This step-by-step approach is designed to give the ecosystem time to adapt, addressing concerns about sudden increases in node requirements. Boosting ETH Transactions Per Second: The Promise of Massive Scaling The primary motivation behind increasing the Ethereum gas limit is to enhance the network’s capacity for Ethereum scaling . By allowing significantly more gas per block, the base layer could theoretically handle a much higher volume of activity. Dankrad Feist ‘s proposal suggests that reaching a gas limit of 3.6 billion could enable the base layer to process up to 2,000 ETH transactions per second . To put this in perspective, Ethereum’s current base layer capacity is significantly lower, often cited as around 15-30 TPS, although this varies based on transaction complexity and network conditions. This potential boost in ETH transactions per second could have several positive impacts: Improved User Experience: Faster transaction confirmations and potentially lower base transaction costs (though overall gas price is also dependent on demand). Enhanced dApp Performance: Decentralized applications could operate more smoothly and handle more users directly on Layer 1. Increased Network Utility: A higher capacity network is better equipped to handle growing demand from various use cases like DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. While Layer 2 solutions are crucial for scaling, a higher L1 gas limit can complement these by providing a more robust base layer for settlement and data availability. Navigating the Challenges of a Higher Ethereum Gas Limit While the prospect of a 100x increase in the Ethereum gas limit is exciting for Ethereum scaling , it’s not without its challenges. The most significant concern revolves around node requirements. As the gas limit increases, block sizes grow proportionally. This means: Increased Bandwidth: Nodes need to download and upload larger blocks faster. Higher Processing Power: Verifying larger blocks with more transactions requires more CPU power. Greater Storage: Storing the blockchain history with larger blocks demands more disk space over time. These increased demands could potentially make it more difficult and expensive for individuals to run full nodes, raising concerns about centralization. If only well-resourced entities can afford to run nodes, the network could become less decentralized, which is a core tenet of Ethereum. However, the gradual nature of EIP-9698 is specifically designed to mitigate this. By increasing the limit tenfold every two years, the proposal aims to provide hardware manufacturers, node software developers, and node operators sufficient time to research, develop, and deploy necessary upgrades to handle the increased load. This contrasts with previous discussions or proposals that might have suggested more immediate, significant jumps. Context: This Isn’t the First Ethereum Scaling Discussion It’s important to note that discussions around increasing the Ethereum gas limit are not new. The current proposal by Dankrad Feist follows a separate, more immediate suggestion to raise the gas limit to 150 million by the end of this year. This indicates an ongoing desire within the community to explore ways to increase L1 throughput. Furthermore, this proposal exists within the broader context of Ethereum scaling efforts, which heavily rely on Layer 2 solutions like rollups (Optimistic and ZK-rollups). Layer 2s bundle transactions off-chain and settle them on Layer 1, dramatically increasing effective TPS. A higher L1 gas limit can benefit Layer 2s by providing more space for data availability and settlement proofs on the base layer, potentially lowering L2 costs. The debate isn’t necessarily L1 scaling versus L2 scaling, but rather how they can best work together to achieve the necessary capacity for mass adoption. Proponents of increasing the L1 gas limit argue that a stronger base layer is essential, while others prioritize pushing most activity to Layer 2s to preserve L1 decentralization. Dankrad Feist’s Vision: A Long-Term Strategy for Ethereum Dankrad Feist ‘s proposal reflects a long-term vision for Ethereum’s capacity. The phased, four-year plan suggests a belief that the ecosystem’s ability to handle increased hardware requirements will naturally evolve with time and technological advancements. It’s a proactive approach to ensure that the base layer doesn’t become an insurmountable bottleneck as the decentralized web grows. His work, often focused on complex areas like cryptography and scaling, lends significant weight to the technical feasibility and implications of such a change. The proposal is now open for discussion within the Ethereum community, where it will be debated, analyzed, and potentially refined before any decision is made about its inclusion in a future network upgrade. Implications for Developers and Users: Adapting to a Scaled Ethereum For Ethereum developers, a higher Ethereum gas limit means new possibilities but also potential adjustments. Smart contracts might need optimization to be more gas-efficient, although the higher limit offers more room. Developers of infrastructure like nodes, block explorers, and wallets will need to ensure their systems can handle larger blocks and higher throughput over time. For users, the change could eventually translate to a more responsive network, although gas fees will still fluctuate based on demand. The potential for higher L1 capacity might also influence the dynamics between L1 and L2 usage. The Road Ahead: Community Consensus and Implementation It’s crucial to remember that EIP-9698 is currently a proposal. Like all significant changes to Ethereum, it must undergo rigorous review, discussion, and testing by the core development community and gain broad consensus among stakeholders. The technical challenges, particularly concerning node requirements and potential centralization risks, will be thoroughly debated. The process involves: Discussion: Open forums and calls among researchers and core developers. Analysis: Simulations and technical analysis of the proposal’s impact. Testing: Implementation on testnets to identify potential issues. Consensus: Agreement among core developers and potentially network stakeholders (though validator signaling for gas limit changes is standard). If accepted, the proposal would be scheduled for inclusion in a future Ethereum network upgrade. Conclusion: An Ambitious Step Towards a Scaled Future Dankrad Feist ‘s proposal to increase the Ethereum gas limit by 100x over four years, starting in June 2025 via EIP-9698 , represents one of the most ambitious base-layer Ethereum scaling initiatives discussed in recent times. By aiming to boost ETH transactions per second to potentially 2,000 on L1, it signals a strong desire to unlock significantly more capacity for the network. While the potential benefits for throughput and user experience are substantial, the proposal also brings significant technical challenges, primarily related to increasing node requirements and the need for ecosystem-wide adaptation. The phased approach is a thoughtful attempt to balance ambition with practicality, providing the necessary time for infrastructure to catch up. The future of Ethereum scaling will likely involve a combination of robust Layer 2 solutions and, potentially, a higher capacity Layer 1. EIP-9698 is a bold step in exploring that latter path, pushing the boundaries of what the base protocol can handle and setting the stage for intense discussion and development within the community as Ethereum continues its journey towards mass adoption.

Some analysts predict a potential rebound, while others have warned that dealing with the asset could lead to painful losses. Missing the Green Wave The cryptocurrency market has been on an evident uptrend in the past week. Bitcoin (BTC) is up almost 10% for the period, currently trading at around $95,000, whereas Ethereum (ETH) saw its valuation rise by 11.5%. Very few of the top 50 digital assets remain in the red on a seven-day scale, and unfortunately for the Pi Network community, their favorite token is one of those. As of this writing, PI is worth roughly $0.61, which is a 3% weekly decline. What’s more, the current level represents an 18% drop for the last two weeks. PI Price, Source: CoinGecko It is worth mentioning that the asset started retracing in mid-April, right after the major release of almost 7 million tokens. The unlocks remained in the millions in the following weeks and are expected to speed up even further in the upcoming days. Data shows that over 230 million PI will be freed up in the next month, with April 30 being the record day when 11.3 million tokens will be released. Events like these typically lead to higher selling activity, as investors finally get the opportunity to sell coins they’ve been waiting for a long time . Although some holders may stay put, the danger of a mass exit still looms. Another factor that may have negatively impacted PI’s price is the lack of new support from leading crypto exchanges. Well-known names that have already embraced the asset include Gate.io, OKX, Bitget, and others. However, Binance and Coinbase remain uninvolved. The former issued a community vote in February to determine whether its users want to see PI available on the platform. While more than 85% clicked the “yes” option, there hasn’t been a follow-up announcement. Price Predictions Despite the retreat registered in the past weeks, certain X users continue to make optimistic predictions. MOON JEFF, who often touches upon the matter, recently forecasted that PI could rise to $1. Interestingly, at the beginning of the month, he labeled Pi Network “a slow rug,” suggesting that the token’s potential ascent to $1 is “just a dream.” Kuzo also shared their thoughts, claiming PI “doesn’t look good” based on investigations conducted over the past month. “People will lose millions or even billions of dollars. It’s worse than you could’ve imagined. If you’re still holding, think twice. I’ll drop my investigation soon , make sure you’re following,” they added.

This comes as the crypto market as a whole drops by 1% today, with PENGU’s weekly return making it the best-performing top-200 coin in the last seven days. Many analysts have only just begun jumping on the Pudgy Penguins hype train, with some saying that its bull market hasn’t even really started . And with the coin still 81% down on its ATH of $0.06845 (set in December), it still has plenty of space to rise even further in the coming weeks and months. Pudgy Penguins Explodes 156% – Why Analysts Say the Rally Is Far From Over – Price Prediction Some traders are suggesting that Pudgy Penguins is getting ready to reach its ATH, with some arguing that it could happen sooner rather than later. these mfs are building a religion while the rest still chasing rugs if you aint locked in with $pengu by now you might as well log off cuz this one going above ath sooner than you think be smart mf pic.twitter.com/pGxfK9gfah — heinous (𝒔𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒛𝒐 𝒂𝒓𝒄) (@Arcane_Crypto_) April 27, 2025 Aside from pure hype, some analysts have highlighted Pudgy Penguins’s use of NFTs as a key factor in why it will outperform during the current cycle. Because it’s a popular collection of 8,888 NFTs, its native token PENGU will in theory attract more usage than meme coins without any obvious utility, boosting its price over time. And it seems that traders are piling back into PENGU, after the wider market began recovering last week amid signs of a thawing in the recent tariff war between the US and China. Its chart today shows that it’s at its highest level in terms of momentum since it listed back in December. For instance, its relative strength index (purple) has risen to 80, which puts it firmly in overbought territory. Source: TradingView At the same time, its 30-period average (orange) has jumped well above the 200-period average (blue), which indicates that buying is maybe getting too hot right now. Yet the obvious comeback to this is that PENGU is still 81% below its record high of $0.06845, so it’s possible to argue that it still isn’t really overbought. Based on this, and based on the hope that the US and China continue to climb down from their recent tit-for-tat tariffs, the Pudgy Penguins price could reach $0.015 in the next couple of weeks. It could then hit $0.30 by the fourth quarter of the year. New Altcoin Set to Soar as the Market Heats Up PENGU looks like one of the most promising coins in the top 200 right now, yet it won’t be the only new alt doing well as and when the wider market continues its recovery. There are also numerous newer tokens that are showing lots of potential at the moment, including several presale coins with bullish fundamentals. One good example of this is Best Wallet Token (BEST) , which has raised $11.8 million in its highly popular sale.

Holding BEST will provide a range of benefits to Best Wallet users, including discounts on transaction fees, greater staking yields, governance rights, and early access to new tokens. These perks will help to draw new users to Best Wallet, which in turn will draw users to BEST, helping to boost the token over the longer term. It’s also worth pointing out that Best Wallet’s official X account has just over 64,000 followers , a sign of how big the app and its native token could become in the future. These ingredients mean that BEST is shaping up to be one of the biggest coin launches of 2025, with investors still able to buy it early at the Best Wallet Token site .

Solstice Labs , an onchain asset manager backed by $1 billion digital asset investment firm Deus X Capital , today announced USX, a stablecoin purpose-built for sustainable yield on Solana. Launching this summer, USX offers permissionless access to a native yield protocol that has over $100 million in committed total value locked (TVL), providing users access to institutional-grade returns through automated delta-neutral trading strategies. Designed for both institutions and everyday users, USX is a synthetic stablecoin optimized for performance on Solana. The USX peg is maintained by the 1:1 collateralization of fiat-backed stablecoins, such as USDC and USDT, and partnerships with some of the biggest market makers and liquidity providers in the industry. Users are able to lock USX into Solstice’s YieldVault to access real-time returns generated through off-chain funding-rate arbitrage and dynamically hedged staking-yield strategies, leveraging a 3-year track record showing 19.2% average over the last 12-months and protected by a dedicated insurance fund. “We’ve seen the same dynamic repeat in crypto: DeFi yields are constantly over-engineered, opaque or reserved for institutional players,” said Ben Nadareski, CEO and Co-Founder of Solstice Labs. “USX is designed at its core to change this by simplifying competitive yields in a transparent and sustainable way. All stablecoin users should have the opportunity to capture the yield that larger protocols keep to themselves while not giving up utility in the base asset. That’s the promise of DeFi, and that’s what we’re building at Solstice.” The Solana Stablecoin for Everyone Solana has quickly emerged as one of the fastest-growing stablecoin ecosystems, expanding its share of stablecoin liquidity from 2.5% to 5.4% in just two months, at the time of publication. But while the chain has become a hub for stablecoin velocity, especially in MEV, arbitrage, and orderbook-style trading, it still lacks a dominant Solana-native stablecoin built for yield. USX is designed to fill that gap, purpose-built for Solana’s low-latency, high-throughput infrastructure. As stablecoin transfer activity increasingly shifts from centralized exchanges to trading-driven DeFi applications, USX positions Solana at the forefront of capturing new onchain capital via yield-native stable assets. USX’s launch is supported by a growing network of infrastructure, security, and liquidity partners to enable off-exchange settlement solutions, expanding the stablecoin’s utility across both centralized and decentralized exchanges.

Solstice Labs , an onchain asset manager backed by $1 billion digital asset investment firm Deus X Capital , today announced USX, a stablecoin purpose-built for sustainable yield on Solana. Launching this summer, USX offers permissionless access to a native yield protocol that has over $100 million in committed total value locked (TVL), providing users access to institutional-grade returns through automated delta-neutral trading strategies. Designed for both institutions and everyday users, USX is a synthetic stablecoin optimized for performance on Solana. The USX peg is maintained by the 1:1 collateralization of fiat-backed stablecoins, such as USDC and USDT, and partnerships with some of the biggest market makers and liquidity providers in the industry. Users are able to lock USX into Solstice’s YieldVault to access real-time returns generated through off-chain funding-rate arbitrage and dynamically hedged staking-yield strategies, leveraging a 3-year track record showing 19.2% average over the last 12-months and protected by a dedicated insurance fund. “We’ve seen the same dynamic repeat in crypto: DeFi yields are constantly over-engineered, opaque or reserved for institutional players,” said Ben Nadareski, CEO and Co-Founder of Solstice Labs. “USX is designed at its core to change this by simplifying competitive yields in a transparent and sustainable way. All stablecoin users should have the opportunity to capture the yield that larger protocols keep to themselves while not giving up utility in the base asset. That’s the promise of DeFi, and that’s what we’re building at Solstice.” The Solana Stablecoin for Everyone Solana has quickly emerged as one of the fastest-growing stablecoin ecosystems, expanding its share of stablecoin liquidity from 2.5% to 5.4% in just two months, at the time of publication. But while the chain has become a hub for stablecoin velocity, especially in MEV, arbitrage, and orderbook-style trading, it still lacks a dominant Solana-native stablecoin built for yield. USX is designed to fill that gap, purpose-built for Solana’s low-latency, high-throughput infrastructure. As stablecoin transfer activity increasingly shifts from centralized exchanges to trading-driven DeFi applications, USX positions Solana at the forefront of capturing new onchain capital via yield-native stable assets. USX’s launch is supported by a growing network of infrastructure, security, and liquidity partners to enable off-exchange settlement solutions, expanding the stablecoin’s utility across both centralized and decentralized exchanges. Built by the Team Behind Solstice Staking USX and its protocol are part of the Solstice umbrella, which also includes Solstice Staking AG , after a recent acquisition . Solstice Staking is one of the most trusted staking operations in the industry, currently securing: $1B+ in staked assets 9,000+ validator nodes 100% renewable energy-powered infrastructure 99.99% uptime for institutional reliability With a track record rooted in stability, Solstice is now focused on creating the next evolution of DeFi; one where transparency, performance, and access go hand in hand.

Will Bitcoin Surpass $100,000? Here Are the Details",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-gold-correlation-back-in-action-will-bitcoin-surpass-100000-here-are-the-details/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has returned to positive territory, approaching $95,000 and erasing nearly two months of losses, as the cryptocurrency continues to align more closely with gold amid heightened economic uncertainty. Bitcoin Paints Positive Outlook for 2025 as It Moves Towards a “Digital Gold” Narrative Bitcoin, which fell as much as 18% earlier in the year, has gained about 1.5% since Dec. 31. Its performance ranks between gold, which has gained 24% since the beginning of the year, and the Nasdaq 100, which has lost more than 7%. As a result, Bitcoin’s perception is shifting slightly away from being a speculative tech asset and more towards being seen as digital gold, but the nuances of this transition remain. According to correlation data analyzed against the 30-day moving average, Bitcoin currently shows a strong correlation of 0.70 with gold, while its correlation with the Nasdaq 100 has dropped to 0.53. Correlation coefficients range from 1 (perfect positive correlation) to -1 (perfect negative correlation), and Bitcoin's current data suggests it behaves more like a safe-haven asset than a high-beta tech stock. Meanwhile, global uncertainty is rising. Earlier this month, the U.S. raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. The move has led to fewer cargo shipments and major retailers like Walmart warning of possible shortages and price hikes, Bloomberg reported. It’s reminiscent of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The strengthening link between bitcoin and gold comes at a time when investors are increasingly looking for assets that can withstand inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions. As bitcoin approaches new highs, its evolving story could continue to attract the attention of both traditional finance and crypto investors. *This is not investment advice.

How Remittix Is Set To Surpass Ripple and Cardano,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/xrp-market-share-under-threat-how-remittix-is-set-to-surpass-ripple-and-cardano,"Cardano investors have long viewed Ripple's XRP as the unchallenged leader in blockchain-based cross-border payments by utilizing its XRP Ledger to facilitate fast, cost-effective transactions for financial institutions everywhere. However, its market leadership is now being challenged as Remittix (RTX) , the up-and-coming PayFi protocol, gains traction with its revolutionary crypto-to-fiat payment solutions, targeting the $190 trillion global remittance market. While Cardano (ADA) also has been experiencing pressure from stagnating prices and dwindling volumes, Remittix's simple combination of blockchain speed with fiat ease is making news among investors and analysts. Let’s dive into why experts are forecasting RTX to outpace both XRP and Cardano in 2025, redefining the future of global finance. Ripple Dispels IPO Rumors, Focuses on Financial Health and Innovation Ripple President Monica Long dispelled speculation of a 2025 initial public offering (IPO) during an interview with CNBC , reaffirming the company has no intention to go public. With billions of dollars in cash reserves, Long emphasized that Ripple has no need to raise capital or boost market exposure through an IPO, a stance echoed by CEO Brad Garlinghouse following the company's 2023 SEC settlement. This news, as highly publicized on X, underscores Ripple's faith in its financial stability and strategic direction of expanding its XRP Ledger and payment solutions, such as its collaboration with Cardano for the Midnight airdrop , as it goes on to gain adoption in the world financial system. XRP is currently at $2.22 , 23% up since April 15, as technical analysis suggests a long-term W-formation with a target of $5.85. The token recently retested its all-time high of $3.40 before consolidating at the 0.618 Fibonacci level ($2.22), now support. Changelly analysts highlight XRP's 6-year bullish triangle pattern, with a breakout expected toward $7 by 2027 if it can hold above $2.81 by the end of 2025. Can Cardano Outshine Rivals To Creep Into Top 5 spot? Cardano (ADA) is picking up new momentum, fueled by renewed investor optimism and major technological improvements. As of today, ADA is at $0.696 with a market capitalization of $27.65 billion, placed 9th on CoinMarketCap. New advancements like the BitcoinOS bridge for trustless Bitcoin integration and the ADA EU MiCA-approved USDM stablecoin have strengthened Cardano's ecosystem . Additionally, scalability improvements through Hydra and Leios upgrades—towards 1 million TPS—might put Cardano in a league to rival industry leaders like Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana (SOL), though beating them remains an uphill climb. Cardano, however, is being challenged by newer projects like Remittix (RTX) and meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE). Remittix's PayFi platform has collected over $14.6 million targeting the global remittance market with instant crypto-to-fiat offerings that could challenge ADA's payment ambitions. Cardano must use its DeFi and governance enhancements, like the upcoming Chang Upgrade, to stay in the running. Without greater adoption and real-world traction, Cardano will likely fall behind in the evolving crypto landscape. Remittix: Disrupting Global Payments through Zero-Fee Crypto Settlements The talk about payment coins mostly revolves around XRP yet Remittix introduces a new model in cross-border payments by utilizing its PayFi protocol. The decentralized network of this system allows bank transactions from cryptocurrencies which supports payments in more than 40 different currencies while reducing fees from 6.25% to 0.8%. The successful presale demonstrates that Remittix possesses transformative financial potential. The project has raised over $14.6 million by selling 529 million RTX tokens. Strategic tokenomics serves as a defining characteristic that separates Remittix from other payment coins. The token distribution gives precedence to liquidity pools along with staking rewards that provide participants with an annual percentage yield of 18%. The Remittix ecosystem continues to expand rapidly because the company has established new partnerships to incorporate another 30,000 remittance agents worldwide. Through its API update, the protocol provides businesses with the option to convert crypto payments into local fiat currency within minutes which XRP and other similar assets currently lack. Act now because the presale token distribution is about to reach its limit. Cardano and XRP investors are presented with arguably the best chance to gain access to a disruptive financial protocol at its initial phase in 2025.

Altcoins like PENGU, XMR, DEEP, etc., and a few more have been attracting double-digit gains, while some are experiencing minor losses. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has sustained above $94,000 as the global trading volume has begun to recover yet again. With the start of the American trade, the buying pressure is increasing and hence, with the rise in positive sentiments, the BTC price is believed to rise above the crucial resistance levels. A few days before, the bulls utilized all their strength to elevate the BTC price above the consolidation around $85,000. The volume increased from $15 billion to $55 billion, which later began to drop gradually to close to $20 billion. In the times when the spot retail traders have refrained from entering a fresh trade, the whales have begun aggressive accumulation. Ever since the latest rebound, the whales seem to have smelled a fresh bullish case and hence have increased their accumulation. The data from Glassnode indicates the whales have been aggressively accumulating over the past few days. The number of wallets with a balance over 1000 BTC witnessed a sudden rise from 17.2K to 17.3K, indicating the whales are foreseeing a bullish trajectory for the token. The whales are buying BTC like never before, which suggests a massive price action could be on the horizon. The new whales appear to be more aggressive than the old ones, substantiating the bullish claim. Is Bitcoin (BTC) Price on Its Way to $100K? After breaking above the falling wedge, the BTC price surged extensively and surpassed the local resistance at $88,500 and entered a pivotal range between $94,170 and $94,900. The bulls are working hard to keep the rally restricted within the range. Once the bulls accumulate the required strength, the token is expected to trigger a fresh upswing, elevating the levels beyond $100K. The daily chart of Bitcoin is progressive as the price is closely consolidating around the gains, experiencing equal bullish and bearish pressure. The RSI is about to enter the overbought zone, and the CMF has been maintaining a decent ascending trend. This suggests a significant inflow of money onto the platform. Hence, hinting towards a rise in bullish sentiments within the market. Once the Bitcoin (BTC) price rises above the pivotal resistance at $98,500 to $99,000, rising above $100,000 is imminent.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XMR,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 15:08:05

The US Dollar’s recent performance, marked by a notable dollar selloff , has captured significant attention. Many are wondering if this signals a long-term shift or just a temporary blip. Leading financial institutions are weighing in, and their perspectives offer valuable insights into the potential direction of the Forex market . One such view comes from Wells Fargo, suggesting that the recent weakness in the greenback might be nothing more than a passing phase. Understanding the Recent Dollar Selloff The US Dollar, often considered a safe-haven asset, experienced a period of decline against several major currencies recently. This dollar selloff wasn’t without reason. Several factors converged to pressure the greenback: Shifting Interest Rate Expectations: Market participants began anticipating that the Federal Reserve might be closer to cutting interest rates than previously thought, or that other central banks might maintain higher rates for longer, narrowing the yield advantage the dollar held. Improving Global Economic Sentiment: Signs of economic recovery or resilience outside the US can reduce the demand for the dollar as a safe haven, encouraging investment in other regions. Inflation Data: Cooler inflation reports in the US sometimes lead to expectations of less aggressive monetary policy, which can weigh on the dollar. Technical Factors: Currency markets are also influenced by trading patterns and technical indicators, which can amplify momentum once a trend starts. This confluence of factors created the conditions for the recent depreciation of the US Dollar against a basket of currencies. Wells Fargo Outlook : Why a Temporary Anomaly ? Amidst the talk of the dollar’s potential peak, Wells Fargo analysts presented a contrarian view. Their Wells Fargo outlook points to the recent selloff as a ‘temporary anomaly’, suggesting that the underlying fundamentals still favor the US Dollar in the medium term. Their reasoning is grounded in several key observations: Relative Economic Strength: While other economies may show signs of improvement, the US economy often demonstrates a stronger or more consistent growth trajectory compared to many peers, attracting capital flows. Persistent Inflation & Fed Response: Despite some cooling, inflation might remain sticky, potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for longer than the market currently expects. This would reinstate the dollar’s yield advantage. Global Uncertainty: Geopolitical risks and economic challenges in other parts of the world can quickly reignite demand for the dollar as a safe asset, reversing risk-on sentiment that pressures the dollar. Capital Flows: The depth and liquidity of US financial markets continue to attract significant international investment, providing underlying support for the currency. Wells Fargo’s perspective is that the market might be overly optimistic about rate cuts or underestimating the US economy’s resilience and the potential for global headwinds, all of which could support the dollar. Navigating the Forex Market : Implications for Investors Understanding the dynamics of the Forex market is vital for investors, regardless of their primary focus. Currency movements impact everything from international trade to the profitability of multinational corporations and the relative value of assets like cryptocurrencies. Benefits of a Weaker Dollar (if it were sustained): Can make US exports cheaper, potentially boosting American companies. Increases the value of foreign earnings for US-based companies. Often coincides with increased appetite for risk assets, including potentially cryptocurrencies, as investors seek higher returns outside of traditional safe havens. Challenges of a Stronger Dollar (as Wells Fargo anticipates returning): Makes US exports more expensive, potentially hurting competitiveness. Can pressure the earnings of US companies with significant international operations when converting foreign profits back to dollars. May lead to tighter global financial conditions, particularly for countries or companies with dollar-denominated debt. Can sometimes correlate with decreased demand for risk assets like crypto, as a strong dollar might signal a preference for safety or higher yields in dollar-based investments. For crypto investors, monitoring the dollar’s trend is key to understanding broader market sentiment and potential capital flows. What Drives the US Dollar Forecast ? Key Factors to Watch Predicting currency movements is complex, but several factors are consistently central to any US Dollar forecast . Keeping an eye on these indicators can help investors anticipate potential shifts: Factor Why it Matters for USD Federal Reserve Monetary Policy Interest rate decisions and commentary significantly impact the dollar’s yield attractiveness relative to other currencies. Inflation Data (CPI, PCE) Inflation levels influence the Fed’s policy decisions; high inflation might require tighter policy (USD positive), low inflation might allow easing (USD negative). Economic Growth Data (GDP, Jobs) Strong US economic performance generally supports the dollar by attracting investment. Geopolitical Events Global instability often increases demand for the dollar as a safe-haven currency. Trade Balances & Capital Flows Persistent trade deficits or shifts in international investment can influence supply and demand for the dollar. These factors interact in complex ways, making the US Dollar forecast a constantly evolving picture. Making Sense of the USD Prediction : Actionable Insights Given Wells Fargo’s view that the recent weakness is temporary and a stronger dollar could return, what are some actionable insights for investors? 1. Stay Informed on Macro Data: Pay close attention to US economic releases, particularly inflation and employment figures, and listen to Federal Reserve commentary. These are primary drivers of the USD prediction . 2. Understand Correlations: Observe how different asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, have historically reacted to periods of dollar strength and weakness. While correlations can change, understanding past behavior provides context. 3. Consider Diversification: Relying too heavily on a single currency’s direction can be risky. Diversification across different asset classes and potentially geographies can help mitigate currency risk. 4. Don’t Overreact to Short-Term Moves: Wells Fargo’s view emphasizes the ‘temporary’ nature of the selloff. This highlights the importance of distinguishing between short-term market noise and longer-term trends based on fundamental analysis. 5. Assess Your Investment Goals: Your exposure to currency risk should align with your overall investment objectives and risk tolerance. If significant international exposure exists, understanding currency dynamics is paramount. Summary: The Dollar’s Potential Rebound The recent dollar selloff has been a significant market event, but according to the Wells Fargo outlook , it may not signal a lasting decline. Their analysis suggests the move was a temporary anomaly , and fundamental factors like relative economic strength and potential Fed policy paths could support a return to dollar strength. Navigating the complex Forex market requires understanding these drivers and their potential impact on various investments, including digital assets. While no US Dollar forecast is guaranteed, Wells Fargo’s USD prediction offers a compelling perspective that challenges the narrative of a permanently weaker greenback, urging investors to consider the possibility of a dollar rebound driven by underlying economic realities.

Experts May Have A Different Opinion,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/is-solana-the-best-crypto-to-buy-for-altcoin-season-experts-may-have-a-different-opinion,"As the crypto world gears up for a resurgence of the altcoin season, Solana (SOL) has been among the top contenders for best crypto to buy, drawing investors to its speedy blockchain and growing ecosystem. Is Solana truly the top cryptocurrency to bet on this anticipated boom, though? While its low fees and scalability make it a favorite, other analysts feel that there are other altcoins that offer more upside or something unique. In this piece, we dive into Solana's strengths, compare it with other top prospects, and learn what the analysts are saying regarding the largest opportunity of the altcoin season. Solana Looking For $215 Breakout as Institutional Demand Increases; Is SOL The Best Crypto To Buy Now? Solana (SOL) has risen to $150 , a 10% weekly increase with trading volume jumping 32%. This follows steady recovery from the April low at $105, with the altcoin now hitting major resistance at $150. Technical analysts cite the formation of a morning star pattern above the 50-day EMA, with SOL potentially being pushed to $215 if it crosses the $163 level . Institutional investors are doubling their wagers on Solana as Galaxy Digital swaps $105 million of Ethereum positions for SOL. The action indicates more confidence in the Solana ecosystem, which recorded 1.49 billion transactions last month – 42 times Ethereum's volume . JPMorgan estimates a Solana ETF will attract $6 billion inflows when cleared by the SEC and may ignite even further appreciation. Despite recent uncertainty, SOL remains a staking giant yielding 8.3% returns, three times Ethereum's return. Analysts project year-end price targets of $212, with optimistic estimates of $482 as DeFi and NFT continue to rise in popularity. Near-term resistance at $150 may lead to consolidation prior to the next leg higher.

This isn’t just another statistic; it’s a stark reminder of the persistent security challenges within the digital asset space. When such significant amounts are compromised, the ripple effects can be felt across the market, influencing everything from investor confidence to the price action of seemingly unrelated cryptocurrencies. Understanding the Massive Bitcoin Hack Blockchain security analyst ZachXBT , known for his on-chain investigative work, brought this alarming incident to light via a post on the social media platform X. According to his findings, a specific address, identified by its prefix ‘bc1qcr’, was targeted, leading to the unauthorized withdrawal of 3,520 Bitcoin. At the time of the report, this sum was valued at approximately $330.7 million, marking one of the largest single thefts reported recently. While the exact vector of the hack remains undisclosed in the initial report, large-scale breaches often exploit vulnerabilities in wallets, exchanges, or associated infrastructure. The speed and scale of this particular theft highlight the sophisticated nature of modern crypto attackers. The Laundering Strategy: Why Monero? Following the successful theft, the attackers wasted no time in attempting to obscure the origin of the stolen funds. ZachXBT ‘s analysis revealed a rapid and multi-faceted approach to crypto laundering . The 3,520 BTC was quickly moved across more than six different instant exchanges. The key step in the laundering process was the conversion of the stolen Bitcoin into Monero (XMR). Why Monero? Enhanced Privacy: Monero is a leading privacy coin designed to make transactions untraceable and unlinkable. It uses advanced cryptographic techniques like ring signatures, ring confidential transactions (RingCT), and stealth addresses. Obfuscation: Unlike Bitcoin’s transparent ledger where transactions can be traced, Monero’s privacy features make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to follow the flow of funds once they enter the network. Liquidity: Monero has sufficient liquidity on various exchanges, allowing for large conversions without immediately raising red flags or causing excessive slippage (though large sudden demand can impact price, as seen here). This choice underscores the ongoing challenge for law enforcement and blockchain analytics firms when combating illicit activities in the crypto space. While tools for tracing Bitcoin transactions are becoming more sophisticated, privacy coins like Monero offer a significant hurdle. The Market Reaction: Monero Price Soars The sudden, large-scale demand for Monero created a significant market reaction. As the hackers dumped vast amounts of Bitcoin (or converted it) and simultaneously bought Monero, the balance of supply and demand for XMR was dramatically altered. This influx of buying pressure directly led to a sharp increase in the Monero price . According to data from CoinMarketCap referenced in the initial report, XMR experienced a notable surge, trading around $300.56 and showing an impressive gain of 31% within a 24-hour period. This kind of rapid price movement is unusual for a mature cryptocurrency like Monero and is a clear indicator of a major external event influencing the market. This incident serves as a potent example of how large illicit financial flows can distort market dynamics, even in the relatively large cryptocurrency market. What Does This Mean for Crypto Security? This event highlights several critical aspects regarding crypto security and the broader ecosystem: Vulnerability Remains: Despite advancements, centralized points of failure (like exchanges or large custodial wallets) remain attractive targets for sophisticated attackers. The Role of On-Chain Analysts: The swift identification and tracking of the stolen funds by individuals like ZachXBT are crucial for transparency and potential recovery efforts, demonstrating the power of public blockchain analysis. Privacy Coin Debate: The use of Monero for laundering reignites discussions about the dual nature of privacy coins – offering legitimate financial privacy for users but also facilitating illicit activities. Exchange Responsibility: Instant exchanges used in the laundering process face scrutiny regarding their KYC/AML procedures and their ability to detect and prevent such large-scale conversions of potentially stolen funds. For individual users and businesses, this is a reminder to prioritize robust security practices, including using hardware wallets, enabling two-factor authentication, and being wary of phishing attempts. Challenges in Tracing and Recovery While ZachXBT successfully traced the Bitcoin to the point of conversion into Monero across various exchanges, the nature of Monero makes tracing the funds *after* the conversion significantly harder. This is a major challenge for law enforcement attempting to seize or recover the stolen assets. Recovery efforts typically rely on cooperation from exchanges where funds might eventually be moved or cashed out. However, if the funds remain within the Monero network or are moved to decentralized platforms or mixers, the trail effectively goes cold. This incident underscores the cat-and-mouse game between cybercriminals leveraging privacy tools and investigators attempting to follow the money trail in the digital age. Conclusion: A Sobering Reminder The $330 million Bitcoin hack and subsequent crypto laundering operation using Monero, as exposed by ZachXBT , is a significant event that touches upon several core issues in the cryptocurrency space: the persistent threat of large-scale theft, the role of privacy coins in obscuring financial flows, and the immediate impact of illicit activity on market prices like the surge seen in Monero price . It serves as a sobering reminder that while the crypto market offers innovation and opportunity, it also faces considerable challenges related to security and illicit finance. The work of on-chain analysts is invaluable in shedding light on these events, but the path to recovery and prevention remains complex, emphasizing the ongoing need for vigilance and robust crypto security measures across the ecosystem.

However, another contender might steal the spotlight first. XRP is showing signs of a strong rally ahead of Ethereum. Delve into why traders believe XRP is set to lead the charge and what key factors are driving this momentum. Discover which digital assets are primed for significant gains. Ethereum: Recent Pressure and Key Levels Signal Rebound Potential Ethereum declined 5.30% over the past month and fell 31.87% in the last six months. A brief 13.22% rise in the past week indicates a momentary recovery but does not alter the overall downward trend. Short-term movements have been mixed, revealing caution and opportunity in a volatile environment. Current trading sees prices moving between $1538.94 and $2325.86, with support at $1255.61 and resistance at $2829.45. While bulls show some strength in pushing prices higher, bears remain dominant below key resistance levels. Trading within these boundaries could yield gains if market demand strengthens and sentiment improves. XRP: Six-Month Surge Fuels Bullish Setup XRP performance over the last month shows a modest gain of about 3.37%, while a striking 331.73% surge over six months reveals strong upward momentum. Recent weekly movement exceeded 9.81%, pointing to increasing investor interest and revitalized market energy. The price history hints at a solid accumulation phase that set the stage for pronounced growth across timeframes. Current price action falls within a range of $1.66 to $2.77. The nearest support sits at $1.23 and resistance at $3.45, with a second resistance at $4.56. Bulls appear to steer the market with an RSI approaching 60, suggesting a moderately clear uptrend. Traders might look for entry opportunities near support while targeting the resistance zones for gains. Conclusion ETH is expected to bounce back soon. However, XRP might see a rise before that happens. Traders are keeping a close eye on these movements. XRP's potential for a quick surge is high, possibly driven by specific, favorable conditions. Meanwhile, ETH retains strong fundamentals, suggesting a recovery in the near term. Both coins present viable opportunities, but XRP appears to be on the brink of a notable rise.

Image source: Coinstats The Arbitrum airdrop snapshot occurred on Feb 6, 2023, and eligible participants started claiming on Mar 23, 2023. The claiming period ended on Sep 24, 2023. The airdrop granted 11.5% of the total supply to eligible users, 1.1% to DAOs operating in the Arbitrum ecosystems, and 44% to employees and Offchain Labs investors. The 44% is subject to lock-up periods and a vesting schedule. The rest was sent to the Arbitrum DAO treasury. On Sep 11, 2023, it fell to its all-time low at $0.7453. Bitcoin halving and crypto ETF hype helped the coin recover from October. By the end of the year, it had risen to $1.4. The run continued into 2024. On Jan 12, it reached its all-time high at $2.40. Per Coinmarketcap data, ARB broke below its listing price in June 2024. On August 5, 2024, it registered a new all-time low of $0.4317 It then recovered in September, reaching a high of $0.67.

Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM Are Heating Up Fast!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/cryptos-next-720k-star-bitcoin-xrp-and-magacoinfinance-com-are-heating-up-fast/,"In a market where fortunes are built on early entry and smart conviction, two names are setting themselves apart from the crowd: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM and Solana . With momentum building fast, both projects are now at the center of investor speculation—and many are asking the same question: could one of them become crypto’s next $555K breakout? While Solana continues to expand its dominance, MAGACOINFINANCE is stepping into the spotlight with all the signs of an early-stage giant in the making. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quickly Becoming the Most Watched Early-Stage Contender There’s a moment when a project shifts from being “just another token” to something that investors can’t stop talking about. That’s where MAGACOINFINANCE is right now. With consistent community growth, real engagement, and a roadmap that’s not just theoretical—it’s being delivered—this token is gaining recognition the right way. It’s not noise. It’s structure. And structure is exactly what separates lasting tokens from temporary trends. Whether you’re looking at wallet adoption, user activity, or sentiment across trusted crypto spaces, the trend is clear: MAGACOINFINANCE is no longer a secret. Rising Contenders: Optimism, Arbitrum, Sei, and Litecoin Optimism continues to thrive as Ethereum’s go-to Layer-2 scaling solution. Its rapid adoption and reduced fees make it a developer favorite. Arbitrum stands alongside it with even deeper dApp activity and increasing traction among power users who demand speed and low friction. Sei is positioning itself as a high-performance infrastructure layer focused on trading and speed-sensitive applications. It’s early, but its architecture is drawing attention. Litecoin remains a steady performer. Simple, fast, and battle-tested—it continues to offer utility where stability matters most. While each of these projects is making its mark, only MAGACOINFINANCE still has the full weight of early-stage potential—and the upside that comes with it. Final Word $555K might sound ambitious—but crypto has shown time and again that well-timed conviction can turn small stakes into market legends. Solana is proving its leadership. MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is proving it’s next in line. If you’re watching crypto’s next star, you’re already looking in the right direction.

It has jumped for ten consecutive days, marking its longest streak since March 3. IOTA ( IOTA ) jumped to a high of $0.2415, its highest level in over two months, and 85% above its lowest swing in April. The token is gearing towards its biggest upgrade in its history. In a note last week, the developers said that the Rebased upgrade and hard fork will happen on Monday, May 5. This upgrade will introduce several features that will benefit both developers and investors. IOTA investors will benefit from the introduction of staking, which will let them earn between 10% and 15%. You might also like: ‘Collateral of last resort’: Bitcoin price faces a $482 billion catalyst Staking will become possible because IOTA will adopt a delegated proof-of-stake network, with over 150 validators, including Ankr, Cosmostation, Nansen, Twinstake, and Hacken. IOTA’s developers will also benefit, as the network will introduce Move-based smart contracts. These contracts will enable developers to build decentralized applications in industries like gaming, non-fungible tokens, and decentralized finance. These smart contracts will let IOTA’s network compete with other networks like Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Tron ( TRX ). This, in turn, will help generate income for the network. Some of the fees collected will be burned, making it deflationary. IOTA’s 50,000 transactions per second throughput will surpass that of many other networks. In a note, the developers said that two dApps have already launched on the Rebased testnet. Swirl is the first liquid staking network, while Pools Finance is the first decentralized exchange network. IOTA price technical analysis IOTA price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the IOTA price has rebounded strongly over the past few days. Most of these gains followed the announcement of the Rebased upgrade roadmap. The coin has broken above the upper side of the falling wedge chart pattern, a popular bullish signal. It has also moved above the 50-day moving average and the key resistance level at $0.2095, the highest swing on March 26. Therefore, the IOTA token will likely continue rising as bulls target the next key resistance at $0.4235, the highest swing on January 17. This price is about 95% above the current level. A drop below the support at $0.15 would invalidate the bullish forecast.

Analysts believe it is only a matter of time before the flagship cryptocurrency retakes $100,000. BTC was last at this level at the beginning of February. BTC dipped to a low of $92,899 during the ongoing session but recovered to register an increase of over 1% to trade at its current level. Bitcoin Upside Could Halt At $100,000 Bitcoin’s (BTC) recovery could stall at $100,000 despite ETF inflows worth $3 billion. Market watchers and analysts are questioning if high ETF inflows have always marked a top for the flagship cryptocurrency. BTC has should bullishness and resilience, recovering from a multi-month low of $74,500. The recovery was fueled by growing investor appetite for spot Bitcoin ETFs, which registered over $3 billion in net weekly inflows, the most since December 2024. Analysts are looking at whether high spot Bitcoin ETF inflows mean the price is getting closer to a local top by analyzing historical data. The analysts discovered that while there have been instances where significant inflows have coincided with or preceded price peaks, it has not always been the case. According to the available historical data, Bitcoin ETFs saw record inflows of over $1 billion on March 12. These inflows preceded Bitcoin’s new all-time high of around $73,300, suggesting a potential top signal. Similarly, daily inflows notched up another high on June 3, 2024, coinciding with BTC’s rally from $67,000 to $72,000, supporting the idea that substantial ETF inflows precede local tops. However, November 2024 saw weekly inflows hit $3.38 billion as BTC surged from one all-time high to another. However, this did not immediately translate to a price top. Instead, the price rallied to cross $100,000 and set a new all-time high. Michael Saylor’s Strategy Purchases Another 15,355 BTC Michael Saylor’s Strategy has topped up its massive Bitcoin holdings, announcing the purchase of 15,355 BTC as the flagship cryptocurrency surged past $90,000. The company announced on April 28 that it acquired its latest Bitcoin stash between April 21 and 27. The acquisition cost Strategy $1.42 billion at an average price of $92,737 per coin, taking the company’s total holdings to 535,555 BTC , worth over $50 billion. The latest purchase is the largest since March when the company purchased 22,048 BTC for $1.92 billion. Strategy co-founder confirmed the purchase on X, stating the firm has achieved a BTC yield of 13.7% year-to-date. “$MSTR has acquired 15,355 BTC for ~$1.42 billion at ~$92,737 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 13.7% YTD 2025. As of 4/27/2025, we hodl 553,555 $BTC acquired for ~$37.90 billion at ~$68,459 per bitcoin.” Grayscale Tops Bitcoin ETFs In Revenue Despite registering significant outflows since January 2024, Grayscale’s GBTC has maintained its dominance over other Bitcoin ETFs, generating more revenue than all other spot Bitcoin ETFs combined. Its dominance comes despite charging fees up to seven times higher than its competitors. Nate Geraci, President of the ETF Store, stated on X, “Nearly 16mos after spot BTC ETFs launched, GBTC still making more $$$ than all of the other ETFs combined... And it's not even close.” Grayscale generates $268.5 million in annual revenue with a 1.5% expense ratio applied to $17.9 billion in assets under management. Meanwhile, all other US Bitcoin ETFs generate little over $211 million from a total of $89 billion in assets under management. GBTC’s dominance comes despite losing over half its holdings since spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January 2024, highlighting how fee structures have shaped the fund’s economics, regardless of market share. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed $95,000 as it started the week in positive territory. However, the price dipped below $95,000 as sellers continued to lower. The flagship cryptocurrency’s price action remains tepid compared to last week’s dramatic surge, which saw it reclaim $90,000. BTC has shown tremendous resilience despite selling pressure, holding firm above $90,000 despite selling pressure. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs registered over $3 billion in net inflows for the week ending April 25, registering their strongest performance since November 2024. ETF data reveals a resurgence in investor interest after weeks of mixed performances. BlackRock’s IBIT led the pack with $240 million in daily inflows, maintaining its position as the largest Bitcoin ETF. Fidelity’s FBTC notched up $108 million, while ARKB (ARK 21Shares) saw $11.39 million in daily inflows. Grayscale’s BTC registered $19.87 million in inflows, but its flagship GBTC product registered outflows worth $7.53 million. Analysts believe BTC is poised to break above $100,000 as new capital flows into the market. “If this trend continues, Bitcoin should have little difficulty breaking through the $100,000 level. While early days, it was a similar surge in inflows during October and November that fueled the previous aggressive rally.” BTC’s price action turned positive last weekend as it registered an increase of almost 1% on Saturday and a marginal increase on Sunday to reclaim $85,000 and settle at $85,224. Monday saw a substantial uptick as the price registered an increase of almost 3% to cross $87,000 and settle at $87,508. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rallied nearly 7%, surging past $90,000 and settling at $93,749. However, the rally lost momentum on Wednesday after encountering volatility and selling pressure. Despite this, the flagship cryptocurrency registered a marginal increase and settled at $93,749. Source: TradingView BTC fell to an intraday low of $91,693 on Thursday as sellers attempted to overwhelm buyers. However, the price rebounded from this level to claim $94,000 and settle at $94,009. The price continued to push higher on Friday, rising almost 1% to $94,776. Price action turned bearish over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday, and fell 0.99% on Sunday to slip below $94,000 and settle at $93,802. BTC has recovered during the ongoing session and reached an intraday high of $95,656 before declining to its current level, up almost 1%.

As the industry becomes increasingly focused on individual trader needs, the firm is placing customization, strategic flexibility, and tiered account management at the forefront of its model. The recent introduction of premium account tiers and bespoke trading services positions Northern Markets to better serve clients whose needs go beyond standard brokerage features. This move comes as investor preferences evolve, demanding more control, better access, and curated experiences from their trading platforms in a more competitive market. “Clients today expect more than basic execution, they’re looking for structured, goal-oriented experiences tailored to their trading behavior,” said Northern Markets spokesperson, Justin Cope. “We’re responding by building services that adapt to their long-term strategies, rather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach.” Client-Centric Design for Experienced Traders At the center of this initiative is a series of newly unveiled premium accounts aimed at high-net-worth individuals and advanced traders. Accounts such as The Exclusive Club, Luxury Lifestyle, and The Ultimate VIP offer curated trading environments. Each level includes advanced strategy options, faster withdrawal handling, and direct support from seasoned financial specialists. In contrast to typical brokerage models that segment users solely by trading volume, Northern Markets’ high-tier accounts are structured around lifestyle and investment goals. Traders are offered access to customized financial planning tools, one-on-one consultations, and tailored account structures that adjust as their strategies evolve and portfolios grow. Meanwhile, clients at entry and mid-tier levels continue to benefit from diverse asset exposure, including forex, indices, stocks, commodities, and cryptocurrencies, all accessible through a single login across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. Shifting Toward Tailored Experiences The firm’s expansion into bespoke services is reflective of a larger trend across financial services: the move from transactional platforms to long-term financial partners. Northern Markets’ operational model focuses on delivering a comprehensive experience, from real-time execution to portfolio support and educational access. Resources available to users include trading insights, strategy development tools, and educational content designed to increase user fluency in different market conditions. This is particularly valuable for users navigating complex market environments or transitioning from passive investing to active trading as their financial goals mature. “Our goal is to create a space where both new and experienced traders can operate with clarity and purpose,” the company’s spokesperson, Justin Cope, added. “From educational tools to elite-tier customization, we want our services to evolve alongside our clients and meet their changing needs.” Aligning with Ambition, Not Just Capital Beyond financial thresholds, Northern Markets is emphasizing its readiness to adapt based on client intent. Those seeking to upgrade to custom solutions, regardless of experience, can request tailored support through the firm’s account services team. This includes options for risk management integration, withdrawal prioritization, and platform access planning. The approach also reinforces transparency, with users guided clearly through each tier and benefit without unexpected fees or hidden conditions.

But while machines are generating more data and services than ever before, that value still flows to a handful of centralized platforms and corporations. DePINs (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) level the playing field. Instead of relying on a single company to own and operate the physical infrastructure we use daily, DePINs enable communities to build and run these networks themselves, using blockchain to coordinate machines, verify activity, and distribute rewards fairly among participants. It’s a powerful shift: infrastructure is owned and operated by the people who use it. And this shift needs a blockchain purpose-built for the real world. Total peaq addresses | Source: Dune Analytics Unlike general-purpose chains, peaq was designed from the ground up to meet the needs of DePINs, offering native features for identity, machine coordination, and real-world data validation. → Explore what makes peaq different In this article, we’ll explore why DePINs need their own dedicated blockchain, how general-purpose chains fall short, and why peaq is uniquely equipped to support this new era of real-world Web3 apps. The problem with general-purpose blockchains Many DePIN projects today begin on general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, or Polygon. These networks are battle-tested and widely adopted, but they weren’t built with the physical world in mind. That creates real friction for DePIN builders—general-purpose blockchains and their ecosystems were designed for digital assets, not real-world devices. When it comes to managing fleets of machines, processing real-world data, or enabling seamless user interactions with hardware, these chains often fall short. The more physical infrastructure you try to onboard, the more those shortcomings begin to show. Here are a few of the most common challenges: Lack of standardization across devices and interactions DePINs rely on seamless coordination between thousands—sometimes millions—of machines. But general-purpose chains offer no standardized frameworks for things like device identity, access control, or time-based coordination. Without shared protocols, builders are forced to create their own ad-hoc solutions, making it harder to scale networks or ensure reliable real-world performance. Latency and scalability limitations Machines operate in real time. General-purpose chains often can’t keep up with the speed and volume of physical-world transactions, especially as networks scale—and chains for real machines cannot afford any downtime. Poor integration with real-world devices and data Connecting hardware to a blockchain isn’t straightforward. Most chains lack native tools for device identity, data validation, or time-sensitive coordination. Lack of native incentives and financial infrastructure General-purpose chains do nothing to boost the DePINs’ innate rewards mechanisms and don’t provide any DeFi frameworks that would capitalize on DePINs’ unique value proposition. Limited customization for physical assets DePINs often need specialized logic, security models, or governance structures. General-purpose chains offer flexibility—but not the kind that’s tailored for physical infrastructure. As a result, DePIN builders are forced to cobble together workarounds, rely heavily on off-chain systems, or compromise on performance. That limits the real-world impact of what these networks can achieve. Why DePINs need a dedicated Layer 1 Unlike DeFi or NFTs, DePINs are doing more than moving assets on a screen. They coordinate real-world machines, processing physical data, and managing interactions between devices, users, and infrastructure. That brings a new set of requirements that most blockchains simply weren’t built to handle. Imagine trying to run a network of autonomous delivery drones that need to verify their location, log actions in real time, and interact with other machines around them. If the underlying blockchain can’t process those updates fast enough or in synchronicity—or doesn’t support real-world data validation natively—then the entire system risks delays, errors, or loss of trust. A dedicated Layer 1 removes those limitations. When the architecture is designed for physical infrastructure from the start, it can optimize for the kinds of interactions DePINs rely on: low-latency updates between machines, scalable data handling at the edge, and built-in support for identity, coordination, timing, and trust. We’ve seen this pattern in other parts of technology. Vertical software outperforms generic tools because it’s purpose-built for the specific needs of a user. In the same way, a Layer 1 tailored to DePINs can unlock entirely new business models that wouldn’t be feasible otherwise. Meet peaq: the Layer 1 built for DePINs peaq was purpose-built to support decentralized infrastructure in the physical world; it’s not retrofitted for DePINs, it’s engineered around them. At its core, peaq is a Layer 1 that functions like an operating system for the Machine Economy , empowering real-world apps to coordinate machines, manage data, and distribute value in a decentralized way. Most importantly: peaq isn’t a pitch. It’s already happening. peaq Daily Transactions | Source: Dune Analytics Since launching, peaq has secured collaborations with global enterprises and innovators who see the potential of DePINs to reshape industries. What makes peaq uniquely equipped for DePINs is its native stack of DePIN-specific features, including: peaq ID provides machines with self-sovereign identities, enabling them to authenticate and interact securely and independently across networks. Universal Machine Time is the first on-chain implementation of Precision Time Protocol, ensuring machines operate with ultra-precise, synchronized timing—crucial for real-world coordination and automation. peaq verify is a three-tiered data verification framework that ensures integrity in DePIN data using cryptographic signatures, machine learning, and trusted oracles. Together, these features allow DePINs to coordinate machines, verify real-world actions, and maintain trustless integrity without centralized intermediaries. As the peaq function stack develops, DePINs will have more and more of their architecture pre-built, enabling them to deploy and scale faster. Beyond these and other core Modular DePIN Functions, peaq also offers full interoperability with other Web3 ecosystems and permissionless deployment. Builders can launch, scale, and evolve their DePINs without needing approval or relying on proprietary infrastructure. This standardization enables a unique feature that peaq refers to as machine composability: A device’s ability to contribute to multiple DePINs. For example, a self-driving car can provide rides or do deliveries while collecting navigation and traffic data via DePINs on peaq. Another key benefit is the network effect that comes with a full-on focus on a specific sector. On peaq, a new DePIN joins dozens of other similar-minded projects, which unlocks a wide array of synergies, such as the recent partnership between SkyX and Quakecore , which gives both projects more valuable data to work with. The same goes for the community, with any new DePIN launching into a crowd of DePIN enthusiasts and early adopters. peaq’s economic model is similarly built to boost DePINs, and it’s now developing its Machine DeFi ecosystem, which will bring to life new and innovative DeFi tools focused on real-world value. This grants DePINs additional opportunities to create value and expands the utility of their tokens. Real-World Business Value of DePINs on peaq Across sectors like weather data, environmental monitoring, agriculture, and connectivity, DePINs building on peaq are creating tangible value by tapping into communities, distributing ownership, and solving problems traditional infrastructure has left behind. Here are two projects leading that charge: SkyX: Decentralizing Global Weather Data SkyX is building a decentralized network of smart weather stations to crowdsource hyper-local meteorological data from around the world. Industries like agriculture, aviation, and logistics rely on weather insights, but many regions suffer from poor coverage and centralized bottlenecks. SKY-100 Weather Device | Source: SkyX SkyX empowers anyone to deploy a weather station, collect valuable data, and earn rewards in SKY tokens. Their data fuels a decentralized platform with AI-powered analytics and natural language interfaces (like SkyXGPT) for both consumer and enterprise use. Follow SkyX on X . Farmsent: Rewiring the Global Food Supply Chain Farmsent is building a Web3 marketplace that connects farmers directly with retailers, cutting out centralized middlemen and restoring value to the people who grow our food. With over 160,000 farmers onboarded across Indonesia and Colombia, Farmsent is already tracking shipments of coffee, avocado, and palm sugar across four countries. It combines this marketplace with a sensor-based DePIN that ensures full traceability of food products from soil to shelf. Farmsent Global Presence | Source: Farmsent On peaq, Farmsent uses peaq ID for farmers and farm devices, stores data on-chain, and deploys smart contracts for transparent rewards and logistics. Its token will launch natively on the network, forming the backbone of its growing agricultural data economy. Follow Farmsent on X . A New Era of Infrastructure The projects above are more than examples of technical innovation. They signal a fundamental shift in how infrastructure is built, governed, and rewarded. As the DePIN model grows, entire industries are poised to transform. Community-owned energy grids, autonomous mobility fleets, and decentralized data networks will become the norm. Beyond economic impact, DePINs advance digital sovereignty. Power moves from centralized platforms to the people who build and use the infrastructure. The value generated by machines and networks flows back to participants, not intermediaries. peaq provides the foundation for this future. Its architecture and ecosystem are designed to support builders, developers, and communities ready to lead the shift toward a more open, equitable model of infrastructure.

Source: Finbold As powerful a bullish signal as that is, one noted cryptocurrency technical analyst is positing that a monthly close above $0.20 could lead to a huge move to the upside. Channel up pattern suggests Dogecoin price rebound is around the corner A close above $0.20 would place Dogecoin prices significantly above the lower trendline of a long-term channel up chart pattern , as showcased by cryptocurrency researcher Ali Martinez in an April 28 X post . Previous bounces off of this key support trendline have lead to significant upward moves. Martinez believes that such a close would lead to a rise to the 0.739 Fibonacci retracement level, which would see Dogecoin price surpass the previous all-time high (ATH) of $0.74, some 312.21% above current prices. If #Dogecoin $DOGE can secure a monthly close above $0.20, it could pave the way for a rally toward its all-time high of $0.74.

Dogecoin also saw its millionaire count soar on account of positive price action caused by Elon Musk’s announcement that he would be winding down his DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency). With market-wide dynamics increasingly favorable, there is a distinct possibility that the meme coin could rally according to the scenario outlined by Martinez.

Opening on May 1 for non-US institutional investors, the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund aims to deliver a 4% to 8% annualized net return, according to a press release on Monday. Among those backing the fund, Abu Dhabi-based Aspen Digital said yield will initially be generated through basis trading, with lending and options strategies to be used in the future. The so-called bitcoin basis trade involves capitalizing on the spread between futures and spot markets. It became popular at the tail end of 2024 as hedge funds notched a record high of $14.2 billion in BTC short positions, whilst simultaneously buying spot bitcoin ETF shares. The strategy produces yields depending on the spread between both markets, but isn't immune to risk. For instance, if an entity was short $1 billion on a BTC futures product and the price of BTC was to wildly surge, that entity would need to keep adding margin to avoid liquidation. Also, as the trade becomes more crowded, the spread and subsequent yield could become very thin. This has already led to a number of hedge funds exiting the trade early this year, with the short figure on Chicago Mercantile Exchange now standing at $8.4 billion, down from $14.2 billion four months prior. Coinbase’s new product stirs memories of former crypto lender BlockFi's yield platform, which opened in 2019 but ultimately failed alongside crashing prices in 2022. BlockFi’s fund, however, differed from Coinbase’s latest product in that it generated its yield through lending, rather than a lower-risk basis trade.",Markets|Coinbase|News,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-28 15:53:40

BNB Chain shows a robust activity, consistently ranking third in daily transactions, active addresses, and TVL, while leading in the number of DApps. The blockchain’s weakest point is its revenue, which still lags compared to competitors. Altcoin price action has been underwhelming for much of the 2023-2026 cycle, pushing many crypto traders to focus primarily on Bitcoin. However, with moderate optimism returning to the markets, a closer look reveals that not all altcoins are struggling. In fact, the total altcoin market cap remains solidly above $1 trillion — $1.17 trillion, to be exact — and its 9% surge over the past week offers a glimmer of hope. Among the major altcoins, BNB Chain ( BNB ) stands out for its relative strength and stability. Currently ranked as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, behind BTC, ETH, USDT, and XRP, BNB is valued at around $89 billion. Some analysts see it as one of the most resilient altcoins in the current cycle. As João Wedson, the founder of Alphractal, pointed out , using data from the cryptocurrency drawdown heatmap: “While most altcoins have suffered drops of up to -98.5% from their all-time highs, BNB stands out alongside BTC as one of the least affected cryptocurrencies — and more impressively, it's one of the few that has reached a new all-time high this cycle.” Price drawdown heatmap by crypto. Source: Joao Wedson, CryptoQuant For Wedson, this resilience isn't just about price action — it’s also backed by solid foundations, such as BNB Chain’s well-developed ecosystem and BNB’s rising role in DeFi. He calls BNB “one of the rare altcoins with real utility, strong fundamentals, and growing adoption, making it the strongest-performing altcoin alongside BTC.” Is BNB really the most resilient altcoin? Looking solely at price performance among top smart contract platforms’ coins tells a more nuanced story. BNB has indeed reached a new all-time high during this cycle, but so have XRP ( XRP ), TRX ( TRX ), and SOL ( SOL ) — though in Solana's case, the new high barely surpassed its 2021 peak by just 1%. When comparing current prices to their previous cycle highs (mostly from May or November 2021), BNB is now down only about 10%. That’s significantly better than ETH ( ETH ), which is down 63%, and Solana, down 40%. However, XRP (+19%) and TRX (+49%) have performed even better. BNB/USD, ETH/USD, XRP/USD, SOL/USD, TRX/USD 1-day chart. Source: Marie Poteriaieva, TradingView One of BNB’s monetary advantages lies in its low dilution risk. According to Messari’s Market Cap/Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) ratio, 96.51% of BNB’s supply is already in circulation. That’s in line with Ethereum (99.93%) and TRX (99.96%), indicating a relatively low risk of future token inflation. In contrast, Solana (86.33%) and especially XRP (58.33%) could face significant future dilution. While BNB’s price performance has been relatively strong, it alone doesn't entirely justify its reputation for resilience; fundamentals offer deeper insight. BNB Chain activity drives the altcoin’s value Beyond speculation, BNB’s value is defined by its use in BNB Chain — an umbrella term now used to define both BNB Smart Chain (the original blockchain) and the Beacon Chain (used for governance and staking). BNB Chain specializes in gaming, DeFi, launchpads, and other large-scale consumer DApps. More recently, it also got into the memecoins game , soaking up some of Solana’s volume. Being the key altcoin on the leading centralized exchange also helps. According to Messari , BNB Chain processes around 4 million daily transactions on average, ahead of Ethereum (1 million), XRP Ledger (1.8 million), but behind Tron (5.5 million) and far behind Solana (54 million non-vote transactions daily). In terms of daily active addresses, BNB Chain also performs well with about 1.1 million, beating Ethereum (384,800) and XRP Ledger (55,600), but trailing Tron (2.4 million) and Solana (3.7 million). Where BNB Chain really shines is in the number of DApps. According to DappRadar , BNB Chain supports 5,686 DApps — more than Ethereum (4,987), with Polygon (2,402) trailing in third. This reinforces Wedson’s assertion of a “massive” BNB ecosystem and places BNB Chain in a strong position to lead the charge once Web3 fully matures. BNB Chain also ranks 3rd in total value locked (TVL) in DeFi, with $5.8 billion, behind Ethereum ($50.5 billion) and Solana ($8 billion), according to DefiLlama . The blockchain seems to pay special attention to developing its DeFi activity. On March 24, its DEX trading volume even managed to briefly outpace all other blockchains, hitting a weekly total of $14.3 billion. Related: ‘Vitalik: An Ethereum Story’ is less about crypto and more about being human BNB Chain revenue has room for growth Blockchain revenue plays a crucial role in its long-term sustainability and growth. It is commonly assessed through the total transaction fees generated. In 2024, Ethereum led the pack with $2.5 billion in fees, followed by Tron ($2.1 billion), Bitcoin ($923 million), and Solana ($751 million), according to CoinGecko . BNB Chain closed the top 5 with $194 million. Since XRP has little utility , its blockchain’s revenues were only $1.1 million. So far in 2025, the revenue rankings are shifting, but BNB Chain remains 5th. In the past 30 days, Tron has taken the lead with $272 million in fees, followed by Solana ($34.7 million), Ethereum ($20.8 million), and BNB Chain ($17.1 million), per Messari data. Overall, while BNB may not always top the charts across every metric, it consistently holds a respectable third place among the leading smart contract platforms. Its healthy activity metrics contribute to maintaining relative price stability within the sector. The blockchain’s revenue remains its weakest point compared to competitors. However, if the promise of Web3 is realized and adoption accelerates, BNB Chain’s dominance in the DApp space could become its biggest strength.

MUTM Leads With Utility and 4,900% Surge Potential",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-3-undervalued-cryptos-in-april-mutm-leads-with-utility-and-4900-surge-potential/,"In a market where established tokens often steal the spotlight, it pays to look for undervalued opportunities with real upside. Analysts and traders scanning crypto charts have flagged Chainlink, Polygon, and Mutuum Finance as some of the most overlooked names this April. While LINK and MATIC offer solid fundamentals, one DeFi cryptocurrency stands out with a clear utility model and next big crypto potential that could drive a 4,900% surge before major exchange listings kick in. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink has built its reputation as the go-to oracle network, securely feeding off-chain data into smart contracts. Despite powering some of the largest DeFi and NFT platforms, LINK’s price has lagged relative to its on-chain usage. Technical indicators suggest that current levels aren’t reflecting the network’s true demand. As developers continue to integrate its price feeds, Chainlink remains a strong candidate for those wondering what cryptocurrency to invest in, even if its upside is more modest compared to newer projects. Polygon (MATIC) Polygon’s MATIC token has carved out a niche as an Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution. The network’s low-fee environment has attracted gaming, DeFi, and NFT applications, yet MATIC’s market price still trades well below the value implied by its expanding user base. With demand for fast, cost-effective transactions growing, Polygon’s fundamentals look ripe for a rebound. Investors seeking top cryptocurrencies to buy now may find this project appealing, though its potential gain is eclipsed by protocols with sharper token-demand mechanics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Standing above both, Mutuum Finance combines decentralized lending, borrowing, and an upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin into one cohesive ecosystem. Priced at just $0.025 in its presale, MUTM gives early supporters access to a best crypto to buy now candidate built for both yield and token demand. The protocol’s dual lending models—pool-based and direct peer agreements—ensure broad appeal, while a revenue-driven tokenomics design channels fee income back into open-market buybacks of MUTM. Mutuum’s presale has already raised over $7.1 million, with more than 425 million tokens sold and 9,000+ holders on board. This strong start underlines growing confidence in a project that rewards participation rather than speculation. With each new presale round, the price increases—locking in MUTM at $0.025 won’t be an option for much longer. With eleven phases in total and half of the current round already claimed, investors have a limited window to secure tokens at the lowest price, creating genuine urgency for anyone deciding which crypto to buy today for long-term gains. Analysts forecast that MUTM could reach as high as $1.25 within weeks of listing on major exchanges—a 4,900% increase from the presale price. This projection is grounded in concrete mechanics: as lending volume ramps up and borrowing pairs grow, fee revenue fuels continuous buybacks. To illustrate, a $1,000 stake at $0.025 could translate into $50,000 in a matter of weeks. Such returns are rare outside of early-stage offerings with real utility baked in. Mutuum’s dashboard is already live and features a leaderboard showcasing the top 50 token holders. Those who hold their position on the list will earn bonus MUTM rewards, creating a clear incentive for long-term commitment. This program boosts engagement and attracts dedicated participants, laying the groundwork for stronger demand once MUTM hits major exchanges. In an environment where many ask what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in, Mutuum Finance’s blend of active token demand, yield mechanics, and stablecoin innovation stands out. While Chainlink and Polygon remain solid picks, their upside is capped by more traditional token models. MUTM’s surge potential is rooted in user-driven revenue flows and a presale structure that rewards early believers. For those mapping out crypto predictions this spring, the message is clear: undervalued bridging tokens like LINK and MATIC can offer stability, but Mutuum Finance delivers a combination of utility and explosive growth potential. Securing MUTM at $0.025 before the next phase closes may be one of the smartest moves available, positioning investors to capitalize on what could be the most significant altcoin rally since the last cycle.

The payments giant is working with crypto exchange OKX to roll out the ""OKX Card,"" aimed at linking crypto trading and Web3 activities with everyday spending. Meanwhile, merchants will soon be able to settle transactions directly in stablecoins such as Circle’s USDC, thanks to collaborations with Nuvei and Circle. Paxos will help extend this functionality to other supported stablecoins like USDP. “When it comes to blockchain and digital assets, the benefits for mainstream use cases are clear,” Jorn Lambert, chief product officer at Mastercard, said in a statement. “To realize its potential, we need to make it as easy for merchants to receive stablecoin payments and for consumers to use them. We believe in the potential of stablecoins to streamline payments and commerce across the value chain. Unlocking this is core to how we navigate the rapidly changing world, giving people and businesses the freedom they want by providing the choices they deserve,” he said. Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar, have been gradually moving beyond trading venues into mainstream payments. Mastercard’s initiative covers the full range of stablecoin use cases, from wallet enablement and card issuance to merchant settlement and on-chain remittances. The company has previously partnered with crypto exchanges like Kraken, Binance and Crypto.com to allow users to pay with stablecoins via traditional cards. Last year, it rolled out Mastercard Crypto Credential , a service designed to simplify sending digital assets across borders using verified usernames rather than complex wallet addresses. In 2023, Mastercard launched its Multi-Token Network (MTN) which is being leveraged to facilitate real-time settlements and redemptions of tokenized assets. Ondo Finance, in February, became the first provider to bring real-world assets to the network.

New Analysis Signals Massive Rally Incoming,https://timestabloid.com/is-xrp-heading-to-27-new-analysis-signals-massive-rally-incoming/,"Crypto market analyst EGRAG Crypto has shared an exciting new forecast for XRP enthusiasts, suggesting that major developments could unfold within the next six months. In a detailed post on X, EGRAG outlined a technical roadmap for XRP relative to Bitcoin (BTC), pointing to a potentially explosive move ahead that could drive XRP prices significantly higher. EGRAG Crypto , known for his detailed and methodical chart analyses, reiterated that he has consistently discussed the possibility of a hot summer across the broader crypto space, particularly highlighting XRP and altcoins. His latest analysis builds on this theme, offering critical technical levels that traders and investors should monitor closely as the market heats up. #XRP / #BTC – MAX 6 Months Left to Valhalla! I have posted many discussions about a hot summer ahead in the crypto world and specifically in #XRP and #Alts . The chart below suggests the following: 1⃣ Closing below the 21 EMA on 2 Weeks Time Frame, isn't favorable for us,… pic.twitter.com/TW6q8Ti5lM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 27, 2025 Key Levels and Technical Signals According to EGRAG, the current price action between XRP and BTC carries profound implications for what may unfold in the coming months. He noted that on the two-week time frame, a close below the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) would not be ideal for XRP’s short-term momentum. However, he emphasized that even if this occurs, XRP must remain above the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level, which stands at 0.00001552 BTC. Maintaining support at this level would keep the bullish structure intact. Conversely, a decisive close above the 0.786 Fibonacci level (0.000029 BTC) would serve as an early bullish signal. Such a move would suggest that the larger technical formation is in play and could accelerate XRP’s momentum relative to Bitcoin. EGRAG points to the Fib 1.0 level (0.00044 BTC) as the ultimate confirmation threshold. If XRP/BTC crosses this level, it would mark a major breakout , setting the stage for substantial price appreciation. Potential Upside: XRP’s Path to Valhalla If XRP follows through on the technical formation EGRAG Crypto has mapped out, the rewards could be substantial. The measured target based on Fibonacci projections lies between the 1.414 and 1.618 levels. Translating these projections into USD terms, EGRAG suggests that XRP could range from approximately $9.50 to $27.00 , depending on Bitcoin’s performance during the same timeframe. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 EGRAG also pointed out an important dynamic to watch: whether XRP gains strength against Bitcoin due to XRP’s price increasing or Bitcoin’s price decreasing relative to XRP. Either scenario would play a pivotal role in validating the bullish breakout pattern he has outlined. Observing the interplay between XRP/USD and BTC/USD in the months ahead will be essential for assessing the likelihood of this projected rally. The Clock Is Ticking With a maximum of six months left before this critical window potentially closes, EGRAG Crypto’s analysis has energized the XRP community. As the broader crypto market enters what many expect to be a high-volatility period this summer, XRP is increasingly seen as a strong candidate for standout performance among altcoins. While technical analysis always carries an element of uncertainty, EGRAG’s detailed approach offers a structured and thoughtful roadmap for XRP followers to track. As he highlighted, maintaining vigilance around key support and resistance levels will be crucial for navigating the next pivotal moves in XRP’s journey to what he calls “Valhalla.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

These ETFs, set to launch soon, reflect growing institutional interest in regulated crypto investments. While this marks another step forward for XRP, the blockchain space is buzzing with new projects aiming to redefine industry standards. Among them, Ruvi AI is emerging as a standout contender. Ruvi AI’s Innovative Approach Ruvi AI has quickly distinguished itself with its fresh approach to blockchain technology. Unlike many crypto projects focused solely on tokens, Ruvi AI brings artificial intelligence into the equation. By integrating AI with blockchain, the platform aims to tackle real-world challenges in industries like healthcare, logistics, and financial services. Its ability to provide predictive tools and actionable insights through a secure and transparent decentralized framework highlights its groundbreaking potential. This project is built with functionality at its core, aiming to solve inefficiencies and optimize operations across various sectors. By demonstrating practical applications, Ruvi AI appeals to both investors and enterprises looking for blockchain solutions that go beyond digital assets. Successful Presale Signals Strong Demand Ruvi AI’s presale success underscores the appetite for high-utility projects. The initiative sold over 10 million tokens within just a few days, raising $100,000 and sparking excitement about its prospects. Early participants also gained access to its beta platform, showcasing the platform’s advanced AI tools and real-world applications. This immediate traction positions Ruvi AI as a leader among emerging blockchain ventures. Its focus on delivering tangible benefits rather than relying on speculative hype sets it apart in a crowded marketplace. VIP Tiers With Jaw-Dropping ROI Potential Ruvi AI’s tokenomics are designed to reward early adopters significantly. Investors can participate in their presale through VIP tiers, with each tier offering substantial bonuses and growth potential. For beginners eager to test the waters, VIP Tier 2 is the perfect starting point. A $500 investment secures 50,000 tokens at a price of $0.01 each, along with a 40% bonus that adds an additional 20,000 tokens, bringing the total to 70,000. At the planned listing price of $0.07, these tokens would already be worth $4,900, translating to an ROI of 880%. Should Ruvi AI achieve its long-term goal of $1 per token, the value would catapult to $70,000, delivering a 13,900% ROI on the original investment. Meanwhile, high-stakes investors can explore VIP Tier 5 to unlock the highest level of returns. A $5,000 contribution guarantees 500,000 tokens, doubled to 1,000,000 tokens through a 100% bonus. Even at the listing price of $0.07, this portfolio would instantly grow to $70,000. Looking further ahead, with Ruvi AI’s $1 token milestone, the investment would surge to a whopping $1,000,000, delivering an unparalleled ROI of 19,900%. A New Era for Blockchain Innovation Ruvi AI’s rise coincides with increasing regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency sector, setting the stage for meaningful innovation. Projects that emphasize utility and transparency are increasingly favored, paving the way for Ruvi AI’s comprehensive approach to thrive. While Ripple’s XRP rides the wave of its ETF-related momentum, Ruvi AI’s focus on innovative applications may chart a new direction for blockchain’s evolution. By blending the power of AI with decentralized technology, Ruvi AI offers a glimpse of what’s possible as the industry matures. With a strong start and a vision for real-world impact, Ruvi AI is determined to play a significant role in shaping the future of blockchain. Investors looking for projects rooted in practicality and growth potential may find a compelling opportunity in this rising star.

Amp (AMP) is a decentralized collateral token facilitating fast and secure payment transactions on the Flexa network.

In addition, the currency gained up to 0.73% of a boost in the day. Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to showcase support for the buyers. Is AMP a good investment? AMP has been struggling with a bearish trend for the past few months. Despite this, its strong fundamentals suggest it could be a solid long-term investment. Crypto analysts suggest that the coming weeks will steadily increase the cryptocurrency’s value. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of 2025, potentially pushing AMP above $0.00694. However, conducting your research and seeking professional financial advice is recommended. Why is AMP up? AMP’s price has increased today. Additionally, the coin has experienced a considerable gain of 0.73% over the last 24 hours. The price is trading at $0.00410, which is just below the average range as the bears remained in the lead during the past week. Will AMP reach $0.010? AMP’s resistance level is at $0.005, yet a break above this level is possible if sufficient buying momentum builds. A break near or above $0.010 will require a more robust push but isn’t impossible, as the coin achieved this level on December 3, 2024. What will AMP price target be in 2025? The highest price target for AMP in 2025 is $0.00694. Will AMP ever reach $1? Amp has never spiked above the $0.12 level. Even this price mark was observed only once at the start of the token’s launch, and AMP has never seen this level again. It seems highly unlikely for AMP to achieve $1 soon. Will AMP reach $10? According to the price prediction, AMP will not achieve this level in the next 10 years until something unusual happens. Considering AMP’s current market cap of only $423.6 million, the scenario seems almost impossible. What will AMP be worth in 2030? The highest price of AMP in 2030 is expected to be around $0.02622. Does AMP have a good long-term Future? Amp is trading near its average price level if observed over the longest price period levels. It can be a good long-term investment, as its price is expected to double in 2026 and reach $0.03008 by 2031. Recent news/opinions on AMP AMP’s parent foundation, Ampera, compared the traditional debit card payment process with the blockchain-based payment process. It said credit card fraud increased by 7% last year. Transaction fees are from 1.5% to 3% per transaction, and a chargeback can cost merchants up to two times the original transaction. Amp-powered FlexaHQ offers a much faster and safer, fraud-proof payment system, according to the company’s claims. Paying with a credit or debit card may seem easy, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. – Credit card fraud increased by 7% in 2024. – Transaction fees are often 1.5%-3% per purchase. – A single chargeback can cost merchants 2x the original transaction. @FlexaHQ … https://t.co/FvxOLLyXhK — Ampera (@ampera_xyz) March 28, 2025 After rebranding to Ampera, the Ampera Foundation is again rebranding to Acronym Foundation, focusing on developing two products: Anvil and Ampera.

A potential bearish Shark Harmonic is forming, and if confirmed, could lead to a sharp corrective move lower. Bulls must reclaim major resistance quickly to avoid a broader downturn. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is trading at a critical high-timeframe resistance area where multiple technical confluences are coming into play. The current setup features a structural resistance zone backed by volume profile resistance and Fibonacci retracement levels. A bearish Shark Harmonic pattern is emerging that could heavily influence Bitcoin’s next directional move if validated. Key technical points Bitcoin has returned inside a major descending channel, suggesting a bearish retest at resistance. A bearish Shark Harmonic is developing, hinting at a strong downside move if price rejects the current zone. Key resistance at 96,400 must be broken decisively to flip the outlook bullish; otherwise, risks of a deeper pullback remain elevated. BTCUSDT (1D) Chart Source: TradingView Detailed technical discussion Bitcoin previously broke above its long-standing channel but quickly failed to sustain the breakout. The subsequent impulsive move back below the channel indicates that price action has found acceptance once again inside the range, suggesting that the current rally may be nothing more than a bearish retest of resistance before further downside. Adding weight to the bearish scenario is the formation of a Shark Harmonic pattern. The structure of this harmonic is textbook, with the C-leg forming off a major swing low (A point) and the current price action surging into the D zone, a classic reversal area. If price rejects this area, it would confirm the harmonic and activate downside targets. You might also like: How Winner Mining could help users earn up to $10,000 a day The critical level to watch is the $96,400 region, which aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, a major point of control on volume profiles, and key structural resistance. A clean breakout above this zone with strong volume would invalidate the bearish harmonic and suggest renewed bullish momentum. Until then, sellers retain the advantage. What to expect in the coming price action Bitcoin’s immediate outlook hinges on its reaction to the $96,400 resistance zone. If bulls can force a breakout above this critical level and sustain it with strong volume, the bearish harmonic setup would be invalidated, and Bitcoin could reclaim bullish momentum, aiming for higher highs. However, failure to break above and a rejection from current levels would confirm the bearish Shark Harmonic, targeting a move toward the $60,000 region, and possibly deeper. Traders should expect heightened volatility around this zone as Bitcoin decides its next major trend.

The move aims to support the expansion of Bitcoin ( BTC ) layer-2 technology across the Middle East and Asia. The foundation will use ADGM’s Distributed Ledger Technology Foundations framework , which is recognized for its flexibility. Kyle Ellicott, interim Executive Director of the Stacks Asia DLT Foundation, said the decision was based on ADGM’s support for blockchain innovation and alignment with the Stacks ( STX ) ecosystem’s goals. Stacks is a Bitcoin layer-2 platform that extends Bitcoin’s functionality without changing its core network. Its expansion into ADGM follows regulatory approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, strengthening its regulatory position.

Ellicott said the foundation will use its base in ADGM to connect activities between Asia-Pacific and the UAE, with Hong Kong serving as a hub. The group will focus on promoting Bitcoin programmability and supporting innovation in Bitcoin DeFi applications. The foundation also plans to build on the recent launch of sBTC , a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset on the Stacks mainnet. sBTC allows users to participate in decentralized finance activities like lending and trading while keeping Bitcoin’s security model. Hamad Sayah Al Mazrouei, CEO of ADGM Registration Authority, said Stacks’ registration shows the region’s growing role in digital assets and Bitcoin layer-2 development.

Historically, such a transition has marked the beginning of renewed strength for cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP. With conditions resembling previous cycles, investors are increasingly watching to see whether XRP could again deliver outsized gains. Patterns from the Past Between late 2018 and 2020, gold experienced a powerful rise, gaining 72% to reach an all-time high of $2,075. At the time, the cryptocurrency market, including XRP, remained under pressure. However, once gold began to lose steam in August 2020, capital started to shift, setting the stage for a significant crypto resurgence. Despite price suppression from Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP surged by more than 1,000% during the following months. It rose from $0.1751 to $1.96 by April 2021, highlighting how shifts in traditional markets can influence digital asset performance. The current setup, with gold appearing to retreat from recent highs, suggests a similar environment may be developing. Emerging Momentum for Cryptocurrencies Gold’s rally since October 2023 has been remarkable. It has appreciated by 89% since then, reaching a new record of $3,500 by April 2025. Throughout this ascent, cryptocurrencies struggled to gain traction, with Bitcoin facing resistance near $80,000 for months and XRP battling to maintain support above $2. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, a recent 5% decline sent gold’s price down to approximately $3,300. At the same time, Bitcoin has staged an impressive rebound, rising above $90,000 for the first time since March. The asset is trading just below $95,000 and showing positive signs. Analysts, including Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, interpret this development as an early indication of capital rotation away from traditional safe havens and into risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Technical indicators reinforce this narrative. Gold’s monthly Relative Strength Index (RSI) now stands at 85, reflecting the same overbought conditions observed before its last major correction. XRP has also experienced some gains, as it is currently trading at $2.2, up 5.94% from last week. The crypto market has been anticipating an XRP surge since the SEC dropped its lawsuit against Ripple , and Gold’s decline could pave the way for this price rally. Building Toward a Breakout? While XRP has not experienced surges as high as Bitcoin, history shows that it often lags before rapid expansions once conditions align. The digital asset is already outperforming Ethereum , and if it can replicate the performance seen during the 2020–2021 cycle, its price could reach as high as $24.

The latest jump takes the price of the HINU token to $0.00017026. The HINU token’s price has steadily increased since the pre-launch phase began on April 1. Husky Inu (HINU) Registers Latest Price Jump Husky Inu (HINU) began the week with a price jump, taking it to $0.00017026. The next increase is scheduled to take place in 1 day and 9 hours and will take the price to $0.00017075. The HINU token was priced at $0.00015000 at the beginning of the pre-launch phase. The pre-launch phase follows a dynamic pricing model that sees the token price increase every two days. The pre-launch phase ends immediately once the HINU tokens sell out. The table below demonstrates how the price of the HINU token has been increasing during the pre-launch phase.

Compounded Husky Inu Gets Closer To Major Milestone Husky Inu’s (HINU) latest price jump comes when the crypto market is consolidating under the $3 trillion mark. Cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), are on the verge of reclaiming key levels. BTC is trading around $94,000 as it looks to cross $95,000 and push towards $100,000. Meanwhile, ETH is up over 8% during the week as it attempts to reclaim $1,800. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is trading around $146. Meanwhile, Husky Inu is close to yet another milestone as interest in the project rises. The project has raised $747,687 so far, and is getting closer to the $750,000 milestone. Pre-Launch Phase Going Strong Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase officially began on April 1, 2025, allowing the project to continue its fundraising efforts as the launch date draws closer. The pre-launch phase is the next strategic step in the Husky Inu roadmap, designed to raise additional capital to fund ongoing development, platform improvements, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. If and when Husky Inu reaches its fundraising goal or the presale tokens sell out, the price of the HINU token will jump directly to the next Big Phase stage. The Big Phase stage comprises four states, each with a fixed price point. Earlier prices will no longer be available once the project moves to the next stage. Any investor entering the project at this stage will purchase the HINU token at higher tiered rates.

This popular indicator compares the momentum of shorter timeframes against a longer one to gauge the strength of price movements. Meanwhile, the BBTrend indicator, which analyzes the relationship between two sets of Bollinger Bands, has continued rising and is about to move above the zero line.

Strong investor confidence in decentralized finance emerges from the active market demand for MUTM tokens. Cardano (ADA) on the other hand has accumulated $379 million worth of value during seven weeks and expects to break out of its bearish trend. Experts do not believe Cardano will achieve a value of $5 during its upcoming three-month period since its growth pace remains gradual. The defined tokenomics framework of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) indicates promising acceleration that will surpass Cardano’s ascent. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the crypto market by attracting increasing investor focus because of its abundant opportunities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Ignites Demand The 11-stage presale of MUTM rocks phase 4 as it sells its tokens for $0.025 each. The increasing number of investors buys MUTM tokens now because they understand the upcoming phase 5 raise to $0.03 will increase their investment by 20%.

The platform recently launched a dashboard display to monitor the leading 50 holders to provides bonus tokens as a reward system. A CertiK smart contract audit of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently concluded which will bring results to social media channels to boost investor confidence. Sellers need to act urgently due to intense market demand during Phase 4. Cardano (ADA) Faces Uphill Battle Cardano (ADA) has broken through its symmetrical triangular trend as $379 million worth of tokens moved off exchanges during seven weeks. This accumulation, 40 times higher than in 2020, fuels optimism for a 27% rise to $0.81. Experienced analysts expect Cardano (ADA) will struggle to reach a $5 price level with potential resistance emerging at $0.70. Because of its slow-moving Bitcoin DeFi story and ETF preparation activities it will not provide massive price jumps during the upcoming three months. Cardano’s technical resilience is notable, but its momentum lags behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s structured ascent. The market demands speed, and Cardano’s gradual pace falls short. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Redefines DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates a loan service that generates earnings through mtTokens that gain interest as time passes. The platform operates a buy-and-distribute system that uses revenue to repurchase tokens which benefits stakers and ensures price stability. The presale participants will benefit from a $100,000 prize giveaway which divides the money between ten people who receive $10,000 worth of tokens each. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out from Cardano’s multiple objectives through its direct practical value and instant financial gain mechanism. The presale structure of the platform rewards its early investors with substantial gains which makes it highly attractive in the crypto space. Phase 4 approaches its maximum capacity while time continues running against it. Seizing the DeFi Edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains stronger performance than Cardano (ADA) because of its precise DeFi application and its quick moving presale advance. The $3 target projected for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in 2025 seems achievable because of its practical usefulness and strong investor enthusiasm as opposed to Cardano’s $5 distant vision. The crypto market primarily values flexible systems which makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of its key players. The moment to acquire MUTM in phase 4 offers $0.025 spot per token.

The story of someone who saw something early, took a small bet, and watched it grow into a life-changing opportunity. With fresh capital flowing back into the market, many are now looking for that next big move. And right now, that move could be MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . Backed by growing speculation from Solana and XRP investors, this project is being picked up on radar screens across Telegram channels, private groups, and trader dashboards—and for good reason. The mechanics, momentum, and community growth are starting to align in a way that feels unmistakably early. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Positioning Itself for Something Bigger Most new tokens fade into the noise within weeks. MAGACOINFINANCE is defying that pattern. With structured rollouts, transparent leadership, and increasingly active wallet metrics, it’s drawing the attention of traders who know how to spot staying power. The real story? It’s not being driven by marketing stunts—it’s being built on trust and traction. The team is delivering. The roadmap is being followed. And the early believers are doubling down, not cashing out. This is the kind of project that doesn’t shout—it shows. What’s Drawing Solana and XRP Holders? Solana investors are drawn to speed, execution, and scalable tech. They’re used to backing platforms with explosive potential and measurable development. MAGACOINFINANCE is delivering those same signals—just at a much earlier stage. XRP holders, who’ve weathered years of regulation and stuck to their thesis, recognize structural discipline when they see it. With MAGACOINFINANCE , they’re seeing the same clarity, community strength, and long-term vision they bet on with XRP. Heavyweights Still Leading: Ethereum, Chainlink, Sei, and Bitcoin Ethereum remains the bedrock of blockchain development. With the continued rise of Layer-2s and on-chain innovation, it’s as important as ever to the crypto economy. Chainlink is the unseen force behind much of crypto’s functionality. From price feeds to data bridges, its oracles are everywhere—and essential. Sei is being talked about more frequently as an emerging, performance-first chain. Its design around high-frequency trading is gaining traction among technical builders. Bitcoin , as always, is the anchor. Whether you’re a maximalist or not, there’s no denying its place as the foundation of every major market cycle. But when it comes to early-stage upside? That spotlight’s swinging toward MAGACOINFINANCE . Final Word Can $400 really become $730K? In crypto, that kind of leap has happened before—and it always starts with conviction in the early phase.

Highlighting both caution and opportunity, the analysis centers around the digital asset’s current price action and critical levels that must be surpassed to maintain bullish momentum. According to the analyst, XRP is showing signs of weakness. The asset is below the upper edge of the Bull Market Support Band, and it could experience a bearish turn if it remains there. “For XRP to confirm that we haven’t reached a bottom yet, we need to close above $2.33 and $2.45,” he stated, pointing to these specific resistance levels as essential for dispelling bearish sentiment. The Bull Market Support Band, which the analyst has previously referenced , is marked on the chart as a crucial area to monitor in the coming weeks. #XRP – Short-Term Forecast ($1.25): I anticipate some super negative reactions in the comments, but I'm simply interpreting what the charts are indicating. This is a short-term outlook, and while I am confident we may see double digits in the upcoming months, we first need to… pic.twitter.com/pLUAKCn7dC — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 26, 2025 Is XRP Falling to $1.24? The 0.702 Fibonacci retracement level, near $1.24, plays a significant role in EGRAG CRYPTO’s outlook. This level coincides with a previous breakout structure, reinforcing its importance as a key support zone if the price declines. The analyst highlighted this level as a major retest. This suggests that if the digital asset fails to break above the upper boundaries near $2.45, it could drop to that level. However, he emphasized that the broader outlook remains optimistic despite the potential for downside movement.

While recognizing the potential for market volatility, the focus remains on the structural integrity of XRP’s bullish formation established earlier in the cycle. The analyst revealed he still believes XRP will hit double-digits despite this potential bearish turn. Addressing anticipated concerns from followers, EGRAG CRYPTO made his stance clear regarding trading behavior during this period. He advised against reactive trading strategies, telling community members to accumulate tokens when prices drop instead of trying to follow trends. Experts are setting targets as high as $1,000 for the digital asset, and those who buy in early will benefit the most from the asset’s growth. The digital asset currently trades at $2.19, providing a good opportunity for anyone looking to hold for the long term. EGRAG CRYPTO’s broader message to the XRP community is patience and collective resilience. While he did not provide a target for XRP after this potential downturn, he has reiterated a $27 target for the digital asset, and his confidence in its future suggests that the bearish phase will not last.

To read full editions, subscribe . Sky Mavis has accused one of the games using its Ronin chain of “secretly” making a deal with another blockchain in violation of a preexisting agreement. The game in question, a mobile fantasy title dubbed Ragnarok: Monster World (RMW), uses both the Ronin and Cross protocols. Sky Mavis co-founder Aleksander Larsen accused RMW of being unable to keep up with increased competition since the Ronin blockchain became permissionless in February. Being a permissionless chain means game developers no longer need Sky Mavis’ approval to build on Ronin. “The team behind the game ignored our advice and has since lost favor with the community. To make matters worse, they secretly signed a deal with a separate blockchain, breaching our agreement,” Larsen wrote in a post on Saturday. “Naturally, this comes as a surprise, given the support we’ve extended to them. The trust has been broken to such a degree that we are ending our professional relationship with 0x&, the team behind Ragnarok Monster World,” Larsen continued. The Sky Mavis co-founder initially said that the game’s assets would be removed from Sky Mavis products, like Ronin Market, entirely. In a subsequent post, however, Larsen said the assets will remain on the Ronin marketplace but would lose their checkmark there — indicating a lack of endorsement from Sky Mavis. “This will be our last statement on this matter,” Larsen said . RMW’s Genesis Land Launchpad and Presale are still prominently featured on the Ronin Market’s homepage as of Monday morning (and its Landverse collection still has a gold check). RMW denied that any “secret agreement” was made and contended that it upheld all “contractual obligations” with Sky Mavis. “It is unfair to frame this situation as a ‘loss of trust’ based solely on unilateral interpretations,” RMW argued . Others have suggested that RMW’s decision was a play to remedy dwindling funds. Blockchain foundations, DAOs or leading labs typically offer substantial grants to game developers to integrate their chains — and RMW may have chosen to go “multichain” to get more funding. “We’re going to see this even more,” Moku co-founder Hantao Yuan predicted in a post about the issue. “Them moving to another ecosystem for a grant just means they have survived for now.” Blockworks has reached out to 0x& for comment.

Strategy’s $4.28B Bitcoin purchases and stock market strength have supported BTC above $90,000. A true breakout toward $100,000 will require Bitcoin to decouple from equities and stronger liquidity signals. Bitcoin ( BTC ) experienced a sharp $2,000 correction to $93,500 on April 28. This price movement closely tracked the decline in US Treasury yields, suggesting that traders were seeking the relative safety of more secure assets. While Bitcoin traders are moderately satisfied with the 6% gains achieved over the past week, there is ongoing uncertainty as to why BTC has been unable to maintain levels above $95,000. US 5-year Treasury yield (left) vs Bitcoin/USD, 15 min. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph The abrupt correction in Bitcoin’s price after reaching $95,500 mirrored the intraday performance of US Treasury yields. A decrease in yields indicates that investors are willing to accept lower returns for holding bonds, which signals increased demand for safer investments. This pattern suggests a sudden decline in risk appetite across major financial markets. China’s tariff cuts fueled optimism, but US trade concerns reversed sentiment Investors’ optimism increased over the weekend as news that China had quietly reduced tariffs to zero on selected US semiconductor and circuit board imports was reported by Newsweek on April 25. Notably, the US Russell 2000 small-cap index maintained positive momentum on April 28, remaining near its highest level in over three weeks. However, this sentiment reversed following an interview with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on CNBC, in which he placed the responsibility for a trade agreement on China. US Russell 2000 futures (left) vs. Bitcoin/USD, 1h. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Although recession risks have increased amid escalating trade tensions, many US companies are currently reporting strong first-quarter results. According to a FactSet report, 73% of these companies have posted earnings that exceeded analysts’ expectations. Bitcoin’s repeated failure to sustain levels above $95,000 appears to be linked to broader macroeconomic concerns. Additionally, the cryptocurrency’s inability to decouple from stock market trends indicates that investors are not yet convinced of Bitcoin’s effectiveness as a hedge during potential economic downturns. There are also concerns that much of the recent bullish momentum, which has kept Bitcoin’s price above $90,000, has been driven by $4.28 billion in BTC acquisitions by Strategy since mid-March. Furthermore, 97% of the previously approved common share issuance has already been utilized, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of Michael Saylor’s accumulation strategy. Bitcoin struggles as strong stock earnings contrast with macroeconomic concerns While the stock market is benefiting from a robust earnings season, Bitcoin’s price is being weighed down by perceptions of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. US existing home sales in March recorded their largest monthly decline in over two years, falling 5.9% compared to the previous month. Meanwhile, China has outlined plans to support employment and assist exporters after factories reduced production due to weak consumer demand, according to CNBC. Related: Crypto ETPs hit 3rd-largest inflows on record at $3.4B — CoinShares Given the current global economic uncertainty, a sustained rally in BTC above $100,000 will require more than a single week of strong inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly as this coincides with significant buying activity from Strategy. For investors to have confidence in a new Bitcoin all-time high in 2025, the cryptocurrency must demonstrate a clearer divergence from US stock market trends and provide further evidence that central banks will inject liquidity to prevent a crisis. At present, traders are focused on the trajectory of US interest rates and the possibility of a reversal in the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet , which could end a period of monetary tightening that has lasted for more than two years.

Here’s What Could Spark the Surge,https://cryptopotato.com/dogecoin-doge-to-match-its-ath-heres-what-could-spark-the-surge/,"TL;DR A popular analyst suggests that if Dogecoin (DOGE) closes April above $0.20, it might ignite strong bullish momentum. With Elon Musk dampening hopes for government-driven adoption, attention has shifted to the potential approval of a spot DOGE ETF, which could boost demand for the asset. Time for Another Bull Run? The OG meme coin saw its price rise by 12% in the past week, briefly exceeding $0.19. The uptick garnered the attention of numerous market observers, some of whom predicted much more impressive gains for the near future but under certain conditions. The renowned analyst Ali Martinez believes Dogecoin (DOGE) can explode to its all-time high of $0.74 if it closes the month above $0.20. “Such a breakout would signal strong bullish momentum and potentially attract increased investor interest,” he added. Trader Tardigrade and Muro also weighed in. The former claimed that DOGE reclaimed the 100 exponential moving average (EMA) “after breakdown” and envisioned a rise to as high as $0.80 in the following months. For their part, Muro believes that DOGE’s possible rally could ignite an altseason: “Once DOGE starts pumping, it would be the official signal for a legit altseason, it’s always been the altseason indicator.” Waiting for This Catalyst After the disappointment faced after Elon Musk’s rather controversial and somewhat failed attempt to really cut down on excessive government spending, an agency that has DOGE’s name in it, the Dogecoin community has started to look for o ther catalysts that could act as price boosters. One example is the potential approval of a spot DOGE ETF in the United States. Grayscale, Bitwise, and Osprey Funds are among the companies racing to launch this kind of product. The chances of a green light before the end of 2025 have been rising lately, currently standing at around 58% (per Polymarket’s data). This type of investment vehicle will offer people the chance to gain exposure to Dogecoin without having to purchase the cryptocurrency directly. As a result, it could attract additional investors and inject fresh capital into the ecosystem. The post Dogecoin (DOGE) to Match its ATH?

The crypto analyst previously made bold projections on the asset’s cycle movement amid stunning macro trends. At the time of writing, Bitcoin and other assets have experienced a significant price recovery, pushing the total market cap back above the red zone for short-term holders. A Series of Short-Term Price Actions In a recent X post , the crypto firm’s CEO wrote that prices have pulled off a recovery despite short-term risks projecting fresh movements in the coming months. Young Ju previously made a bear market call after prices tumbled from an all-time high earlier in the year. Crypto prices slumped 10% afterwards, but are now above the mark with similar figures. Young Ju noted that he would discard the cycle theory if a new all-time high is recorded before Q4 2025. Crypto traders utilize market cycles to predict price movements and participants’ sentiment. Last year, the bull cycle spiked to a series of new highs for the digital asset leader, and a much larger growth was expected this year. However, flash dips hinged on President Trump’s sweeping tariffs wiped out a chunk of gains. Admittedly, a digital asset market without cycles will be different from moments in the last decade. For Young Ju, this will favor “permabulls” that project that asset’s only upward momentum. These bulls projected a $150k price at the end of the year, and with recent inflows, if sustained, it could hit the mark. Furthermore, he added that if the short-term Bitcoin price reaches $100,000, his previous bear cycle forecast was wrong, although mixed trading has been recorded over the last 30 days. Bitcoin Price Rebounds After Downward Pressure This week, Bitcoin price gained significant traction, notching over double-digit inflows. The asset trades for $92,371, bolstering the total market cap to above $2.88 trillion. Previously, the consistent dip below $90k led analysts like Young Ju to suggest a prevailing bear market. According to his analysis, the Realized Cap saw growth, but the Market Cap remained stagnant, signaling bearish trends. “ In short: when small capital drives prices up, it’s a bull market. When even large capital can’t push prices upward, it’s a bear. Current data clearly points to the latter. Sell pressure could ease anytime, but historically, real reversals take at least six months—so a short-term rally seems unlikely,” he added.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-28 17:42:00

Indicators suggest these tokens may be on the verge of a breakthrough. This could potentially signal a rebound in their values. Learn which coins might be primed for growth in the coming days and what signs to watch closely. Avalanche Price Trends: Monthly Gains Amid Six-Month Decline Avalanche showed a modest recovery over the past month with a 7.34% rise, while the six-month performance reflected an 18.65% drop. Price movements have been volatile, with short-term gains unable to fully counter the longer-term downturn. The fluctuations indicate a market that has made recent progress but continues to face persistent bearish pressure over the half-year period. Currently trading between $14.37 and $24.15, the coin finds its nearest resistance at $29.52 and support at $9.96. Price action is mixed, with the 12.04% weekly gain indicating some bullish interest. There is no clear trend at the moment, suggesting cautious trading within these key levels, with careful stop placement near support. Polkadot: Mixed Monthly Decline and Short-Term Recovery Support Key Levels Polkadot experienced a 3.74% decline over the past month and a 1.67% decrease over the last six months. The recent weekly gain of 6.46% suggests a short-term rebound, but the overall mid-term trend remains weak. Price movement has been confined within a narrow range, indicating cautious market sentiment and balanced pressure. DOT is currently trading between $3.38 and $4.96, with key support at $2.73 and resistance at $5.89. Additional support and resistance levels are set at $1.15 and $7.47, respectively. Bulls and bears are sharing control, and no clear trend has developed yet. Traders may find opportunities by entering near support levels and targeting resistance zones. Conclusion AVAX and DOT are currently challenging significant resistance levels. A breakthrough could lead to a price recovery. The coins have shown resilience and adaptability. Investors should watch closely for potential upward movements. Steady progress might signal a positive trend for the market. Both coins have key roles and their performance can influence broader market sentiments. The upcoming days may be crucial. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This exciting development was shared by Whale Insider through a post on X, highlighting the growing mainstream interest and institutional adoption surrounding XRP. ProShares Expands Its Crypto Offerings With XRP ProShares has long been a pioneer in bringing crypto exposure to traditional financial markets, previously making headlines with its Bitcoin futures ETF. Now, by introducing ETFs directly tied to XRP, ProShares signals a strong belief in the token’s potential and its relevance in the evolving digital asset landscape. JUST IN: ProShares to launch three new $XRP tracked ETFs this week. pic.twitter.com/AiWHL3dXOI — Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) April 28, 2025 The announcement comes at a pivotal time when regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP, is beginning to materialize in several regions. After years of uncertainty tied to Ripple’s legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP is increasingly finding a favorable footing among institutional players. The launch of multiple XRP ETFs will likely bolster liquidity, increase investor access, and solidify XRP’s standing as a leading digital asset. Institutional Interest in XRP Hits New Heights The decision by ProShares to roll out not one but three XRP-tracked ETFs speaks volumes about the growing demand for XRP investment vehicles. These ETFs are expected to cater to a range of investor profiles, providing new ways for both retail and institutional participants to gain exposure to XRP without having to directly manage the digital asset. Such a move also positions XRP more competitively alongside other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which already enjoy a range of ETF products in different global markets. Analysts predict that the launch of XRP ETFs could lead to a substantial increase in trading volume and possibly a new wave of upward price momentum, especially given XRP’s historically strong community and adoption trends. A Transformational Week for XRP Whale Insider’s update underlines what many in the crypto community believe could be a landmark moment for XRP’s market evolution. ETFs generally serve to legitimize assets in the eyes of traditional investors, providing a secure, regulated, and familiar method for gaining exposure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For XRP, these new ETFs could help bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto space even further, making it easier for pension funds, asset managers, and everyday investors to include XRP in their portfolios. Additionally, by offering more accessibility and lowering the barriers to entry, ProShares’ products could unlock a significant wave of new capital inflows. With ProShares preparing to debut three XRP-tracked ETFs this week, the cryptocurrency landscape is on the verge of yet another transformative development. As more legacy financial institutions continue to embrace digital assets, XRP is positioning itself strongly at the intersection of traditional and decentralized finance. Thanks to updates from sources like Whale Insider, the crypto community remains closely attuned to these significant milestones, watching as XRP’s journey into broader institutional adoption unfolds.

43911827,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=717167,1745862410,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43911827.jpeg,"Temu, Shein respond to tariffs by raising prices for American buyers",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/temu-shein-pass-tariff-hikes-to-customers/,"Chinese e-commerce giants Shein and Temu are raising prices for U.S. shoppers, passing the burden of new tariffs directly onto them as impending tariff implementations unfold. The Trump administration moved to impose high import duties on Chinese imports, ending the “de minimis” exemption, which makes goods worth $800 or less imported to the U.S from countries like China tariff-free. However, with the new rule coming into full effect on May 2, these goods will start seeing the application of the tariffs in full force, with more duties to come in the following months. These changes have made major e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu , leveraging the de minimis exemption and a lower tariff to operate in the American market update their prices to fit the new reality. This means that U.S. buyers who once turned to these platforms for low-cost goods are now facing significantly higher prices. Shein and Temu prepare for tariffs with aggressive price increases Shein , which is also one of the world’s largest fast-fashion retailers, has quietly raised prices across its platform by as much as 377%, according to Bloomberg. The price increase is especially apparent in categories like clothing, accessories, shoes, and kitchenware. For example, some dresses that were previously priced under $10 are now listed at over $45. Accessories and seasonal items, known for being extremely cheap, have seen price hikes of two to three times their original cost. While Shein did not issue a formal public statement, company insiders cited by Bloomberg attributed the increases directly to anticipated costs from the new tariffs, coupled with elevated shipping and operational expenses. Temu, known for its long line of discounted products, is also adjusting prices upward and in some cases increasing them by twice their initial prices. Shoppers browsing electronics, kitchen gadgets, and home goods have reported price increases of up to 100% on certain listings. Temu, which has aggressively expanded in the U.S. since 2022 with ultra-low prices and heavy marketing campaigns, is now facing the challenge of maintaining its growth momentum in a higher-cost environment. In its communications with sellers and suppliers, Temu has reportedly urged partners to brace for the impact of tariffs and to adjust pricing accordingly to offset cost pressures. New U.S. tariffs target Chinese imports At the center of the price hikes are the new 120% tariffs on select Chinese goods announced by the Trump administration. The U.S. government argues that the tariff increases are necessary to curb China’s dominance in key sectors, protect American jobs, and address what it describes as unfair trade practices. Officials said the measures aim to promote domestic manufacturing and reduce U.S. dependence on Chinese supply chains. According to officials, the new duties are expected to generate billions in additional revenue for the U.S. government. Still, they will almost certainly be felt by everyday consumers in the form of higher prices. Reports suggest that companies like Shein and Temu are merely the first wave, with other major retailers expected to follow suit as the tariff regime fully kicks in. The timing could not be worse for American consumers. Temu and Shein have gained some following and repeat customers by offering products at very affordable prices, often cheaper than Amazon or Walmart.

Source: Coinstats According to Coinmarketcap, ORDi started trading in May 2023 at $25.3466. It later fell, reaching its lowest value of $2.86 in September 2023. Binance listed ORDI on November 17, 2023. However, due to a lack of clear information from Binance, there needed to be more clarity, leading many to mistakenly believe that ORDI was a direct product of the Ordinals protocol. This misunderstanding contributed to ORDI’s dramatic market performance. The meme coin saw a 40% increase in value within a single day, culminating in a 100% rise over four days. Despite these fluctuations, ORDI’s popularity surged, and by the end of 2023, its price had climbed above $50. ORDI peaked in March 2024, hitting an all-time high of $96.17. It later moved into a bear run, and by April, it had already dropped by 50%. It started recovering in November, rising above the $35 mark, and $48 in December. In 2025, the trend quickly reversed and fell below $12 in February and $7 in April.",Crypto Price Predictions|ORDI,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|ORDI,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-28 17:47:07

Apple, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft, some of the largest tech firms in the world, are set to report their earnings this week. Still, investors are concerned that current earnings expectations may be too high, given the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds.

On April 28, the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that it was “up to China” to de-escalate the trade war, suggesting that the White House is not yet ready to start making concessions.

The exploiter pilfered approximately 5.7 million USDC ( USDC ) and 1,200 Solana ( SOL ) tokens from two of Loopscale’s yield vaults on April 26, prompting the decentralized finance protocol to temporarily pause its lending markets . The following day, the hacker sent a message on the Etherscan blockchain scanner “indicat[ing] a willingness to return the exploited funds in exchange for a bounty,” Loopscale said in an April 27 X post. “We are agreeable to collaborating with you to reach a white hat agreement. However, we would like to negotiate the bounty percentage; our expectation is 20%,” the hacker said. “To demonstrate our commitment to a cooperative approach, we will immediately return the 5,000 wSOL funds following the transmission of this message,” they added. Negotiations are ongoing for the remaining funds, according to the public messaging exchange on Etherscan. Messages exchanged with the Loopscale hacker.

The Loopscale exploit only impacted the protocol’s USDC and SOL vaults, with losses representing around 12% of its total value locked (TVL), Loopscale co-founder Mary Gooneratne said in an April 26 X post. Source: Loopscale In the aftermath of the attack, Loopscale temporarily halted lending but has since “re-enabled loan repayments, top-ups, and loop closing,” it said in an X post. “All other app functions (including Vault withdrawals) are still temporarily restricted while we investigate and ensure mitigation of this exploit,” Loopscale said . Launched on April 10, Loopscale is a DeFi lending protocol that aims to improve capital efficiency by directly matching lenders and borrowers. Additionally, Loopscale facilitates specialized lending markets, such as “structured credit, receivables financing, and undercollateralized lending,” it said in an April announcement shared with Cointelegraph.

As of April 28, 2025, the company reported that more than 7.7 tons of gold, equivalent to 246,523.33 troy ounces, are securely backing the tokens. Tether Reports XAU₮ Grows Amid Shifting Monetary Landscape, Releases its First Attestation for Q1 2025, More Than 7.7 Tons of Physical Gold Backing the Token in Circulation Read more @tethergold https://t.co/GM2ngyVFO6 — Tether (@Tether_to) April 28, 2025 Tether’s XAUT Surpasses $770M, Driven by Demand for Inflation Hedges XAUT, each representing one ounce of London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)-certified gold, continues to hold its position as the highest market-cap tokenized gold product available. The physical gold is stored in a dedicated vault within world-class facilities in Switzerland, with strict controls governing the acquisition and storage processes. These measures include rigorous counterparty selection, certificate verification, and periodic gold assays conducted under the supervision of an auditor. According to Tether, the market capitalization of XAUT now stands at $770 million, with the price per token recorded at $3,123.57 at the end of Q1. On April 21, 2025, XAUT reached an all-time high of $3,423, marking a 9.6% increase since the quarter’s close. The company emphasized that while the price of gold remains subject to volatility, the key measure for XAU₮ remains the quantity of inventory held in reserve. Tether attributes the growth of XAUT to a surge in demand for inflation-resistant assets, driven by rising geopolitical tensions, economic uncertainty, and concerns over new international trade tariffs. This trend is part of a broader pattern, with global central banks, particularly among BRICS nations, accumulating gold at record rates. According to the World Gold Council , central banks purchased 1,044.6 metric tons of gold in 2024, reinforcing gold’s strategic role in diversifying away from U.S. dollar dependency. XAUT issuance is governed by strict procedures, including the use of London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)-certified gold bars, with regular audits and stringent verification standards in place. Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, commented on the release, stating, “Tether Gold continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of gold as a store of value, especially in times of economic uncertainty.“ He further added that “With XAUT, we’re offering users the ability to access the security of physical gold in a digital form—secure, easily transferrable, and backed 1:1 by fully held gold reserves.” Tether also acknowledged the enduring familiarity of gold among populations facing economic instability, noting that while Bitcoin may represent the future of digital finance, gold remains a trusted safety reserve for many around the world.

Recently regulated in El Salvador , Tether Gold has entered a new era under a more robust compliance framework, offering a blockchain-based alternative for secure physical gold ownership. Tether stated that while XAUT’s value remains subject to market volatility, the focus is firmly on the quantity of gold reserves, now totaling 7.7 tons. To maintain transparency, the company continues working closely with U.S. and international law enforcement agencies and is collaborating with a Big Four accounting firm on an independent audit of its reserves. At the policy level, Tether has engaged with U.S. lawmakers, including Representatives Bryan Steil and French Hill, to help shape the regulation of stablecoins. CEO Paolo Ardoino also indicated the firm’s involvement with additional legislative efforts intended to formalize the stablecoin sector.

One of the largest crypto-prediction sites, Polymarket , currently offers a 79% chance of Liberal hopeful Mark Carney becoming Canada’s next Prime Minister. More than $75 million has been wagered, a measure of the huge level of public interest in the election. This political betting boom underscores the increasing prominence of decentralized prediction markets in monitoring election sentiment. Crypto traders, attracted by the prospect of making money from actual events, are increasingly using platforms such as Polymarket to place their political bets. Reversal of Fortunes After Trudeau’s Exit The upbeat odds for Carney represent a significant turnabout for the Liberal Party following January’s resignation of former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trudeau was under increasing criticism of the government’s response to Canada’s housing affordability crisis, inflation concerns, and tensions with the United States, reducing public support sharply. When U.S. President Donald Trump escalated the trade tensions with a 25% tariff imposed on Canadian imports in March, Canadian national sentiment shifted. Trump’s repeated jabs, his reference to Canada as the “51st state” of the United States, and his derisive tagging of Trudeau as a “governor” all helped fuel a surge of nationalist sentiments that appear to have paid off for the Liberals. Carney, a former Bank of Canada governor and Bank of England governor, set himself up as a steady, middle-ground figure with the skill to guide Canada through periods of economic doubt. His technocratic persona is diametrically opposed to Conservative rival Pierre Poilievre’s brand of populism. Trump’s Influence and Growing Anti-Poilievre Sentiment Public reaction to American belligerence was quick. At NHL games and other high-profile sporting events, boos rang out during performances of the U.S. national anthem, a phenomenon of increasing irritation. Voters began associating Poilievre with Trump-style politics, something that has been damaging in a country where Trump remains highly unpopular. Surveys combined with Polymarket’s betting data show that a large number of undecided voters supported Carney in the last few days leading up to the election. Analysts believe Trump’s interference actually served the Liberal Party’s interests inadvertently, firming up its voter base. As votes continue to trickle in, everyone holds their breath in anticipation of whether crypto markets’ predictions will converge with the actual count, rendering Mark Carney’s rise to Canada’s highest political office a virtual certainty.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-28 17:55:10

This breakout is supported by higher trading volume, showing strong interest. The RSI at 56.20 indicates room for further growth. The 50-day EMA is about to cross above the 200-day EMA, signaling short-term strength. If Ethereum holds above $1,882, it could rise to $2,500 or more. High Price : $2,500 (key resistance level) Low Price : $1,467 (recent low before breakout) Average Price : $1,882 (current consolidation level) Why ETH Price Will Surge in Q2-2025? Pectra Upgrade Launching May 7: Ethereum will roll out the Pectra upgrade, a merge of the Prague and Electra upgrades. Vitalik Buterin Proposes RISC-V : Ethereum’s co-founder has suggested replacing the EVM bytecode with the RISC-V instruction set, making Ethereum more adaptable, efficient, and future-ready. Base Layer Activity Drops: Despite innovations, Ethereum collected just 3.18 ETH in blob fees, with average gas fees at $0.16 in April, the lowest since 2020. This has raised sustainability concerns but is also making the network more accessible. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 If Ethereum manages to stay above this support, it could gradually rise towards $2,400 or more by the end of 2025, especially if the market becomes more positive. However, Ethereum will face resistance around $2,500, so it may take time to break through this level. The Ethereum price is expected to maintain its upward trajectory and form higher highs. Furthermore, with increased adoption, newer upgrades, and network growth, the ETH coin price can smash the $5k mark and hit a new all-time high of $5,925. Conversely, rising uncertainty or any unfavorable global economic events could pull the ETH price toward its annual low of $2,917. Considering the market sentiments, the average price could settle at around $3,392.

Foreign central banks cut US Treasury holdings to 23%, a 22-year low, as gold reserves hit 18%. Bitcoin soared in 2020 from $9,000 to $60,000 amid similar trends, hinting at a similar outcome in 2025. The global financial tides are shifting significantly, and Bitcoin (BTC) price could greatly benefit from it. Recent data indicates that US Treasury funds saw $19 billion in net inflows last week, exceeding the 2020 pandemic peak of $14 billion, with the 4-week moving average rising to $7 billion—the highest since March 2023. US Treasurys inflow chart. Source: X.com The 30-year US Treasury yield fell by 30 basis points from its April peak, indicating a rise in bond prices as investors are willing to accept lower returns in exchange for the safety of these bonds. This surge in demand for Treasurys as a safe-haven asset boosts market liquidity and stability while lowering US borrowing costs. However, foreign central banks have pivoted, cutting Treasury holdings to 23% of US government debt, a 22-year low. This suggests that while private investors were possibly driving inflows, foreign central banks are stepping back, possibly due to the ongoing tariff dispute with the US. Foreign central banks’ gold and treasury holdings. Source: X.com At the same time, gold’s share of global reserves has surged to 18% , a 26-year high, up 8% since 2015, with China doubling its gold reserves to 7.1% since 2023. This global de-dollarization trend mirrors a pattern that favors Bitcoin. During the 2020 pandemic, when US Treasury inflows spiked amid COVID-19 uncertainty, Bitcoin soared from $9,000 to nearly $60,000 by early 2021, with gold’s share of global reserves rising by 14.5% in 18 months. The current environment, marked by a stabilizing bond market and a central bank’s gold rush, implies a similar trigger for Bitcoin’s next bullish move. In 2023, when US Treasury yields rose amid recession fears, Bitcoin gained 47% in a month while the Nasdaq dropped 8.7%. With yields easing and central banks signaling a lack of faith in the US dollar, Bitcoin’s appeal as a global store of value improves. However, Bitcoin’s bullish narrative could falter if global markets enter a recession in 2025. This is due to investors’ decision to prioritize liquidity and traditional safe-haven assets like cash or US Treasurys during economic downturns, as noted last week, over speculative assets like Bitcoin.

Known across the crypto community for his unwavering bullish stance on XRP, EGRAG’s latest forecast has caught many by surprise. In a post shared on social media platform X, the analyst warned that the current market structure could push XRP into a significant short-term decline before any meaningful recovery unfolds. EGRAG CRYPTO Warns Of Potential Drop Toward $1.24 Before Rally According to EGRAG CRYPTO, the immediate technical outlook for XRP points to the possibility of a sharp correction. Backing up his forecast, EGRAG CRYPTO shared a detailed price chart showing the current position within a broader bull market structure. The chart shows how XRP is currently trading below the bull market support band. Notably, XRP’s position below the bull market support band has dragged on for over month, ever since it broke below in the middle of March. The longer XRP continues to trade below this band, the higher the possibility of a significant retest. Related Reading: XRP Surpasses Ethereum In This Major Metric After Outperforming For 6 Months EGRAG CRYPTO noted that the XRP price has failed so far to reclaim the $2.33 and $2.45 resistance zones, which sit at the upper edge of the bull market support band on the daily timeframe chart. He explained that as long as the price continues to trade under the $2.33 and $2.45 thresholds, bears could remain in control and drag the asset lower toward the 0.702 Fib extension level. In terms of a price target, this 0.702 Fib is currently sitting at $1.24, which means the price could crash towards this level before rebounding above the bull market support band. Interestingly, this $1.24 zone coincides with an important breakout structure from November 2024, which served as the launchpad for XRP’s rally to $3.4. Consequently, retesting this zone could serve as a validation of prior breakout strength and ultimately fuel a more sustainable long-term uptrend. EGRAG CRYPTO’s Advice: Accumulate XRP Instead Of Panic Selling Despite his short-term bearish tone, EGRAG urged holders not to panic or make emotional decisions. Addressing concerns he anticipated from followers, he made it clear that he does not advise selling XRP to try and time a lower re-entry. Instead, he encouraged the community to continue accumulating during the predicted dip, rather than chasing short-term market trends.

In another analysis, EGRAG CRYPTO predicted a long-term XRP price target of $27. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.27, up by 5.13% and 7.26% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively. This comes as a response to ProShares securing SEC approval to launch three XRP Futures ETFs on April 30. Similarly, the first XRP Spot ETF was recently launched by crypto asset manager Hashdex in Brazil.

The latest Sui (SUI) forecast puts its price targets as high as $10.38 for 2025, driven by ETF filings, new DeFi builds, and global partnerships. Meanwhile, the Solana (SOL) price update shows a strong bounce to $139.88, boosted by Firedancer, a new mobile launch, and its addition to the U.S. Crypto Reserve. Both are still counted among the top crypto performers, even with the market cooling off. But Web3 ai isn’t depending on price to prove itself. Bear Market-Proof Tech: Why Web3 ai Thrives Even When Prices Drop . While other projects rely on hype or TVL, Web3 ai runs on actual usage, AI trading assistants, cross-chain data feeds, and real-time ROI models. These tools don’t care if the market’s red or green. They’re built to help traders win either way. That’s the kind of utility that doesn’t pause for a bull market to get going. Web3 ai: Utility That Doesn’t Care About Market Mood Web3 ai is built different. It’s not here to ride the hype train or chase the next bull wave. Its value comes from tools that actually work, AI trading assistants, portfolio optimizers, ROI predictors, scam detectors, and cross-chain data feeds. These features don’t rely on green charts. They help users make better decisions in any market. That’s why it stands out while others stall. Most platforms tank when volume drops. Web3 ai thrives because traders use it regardless of price direction. It’s one of the few plays where the bear market might actually boost visibility. For users tracking top crypto performers, this isn’t just another listing, it’s infrastructure that supports those tokens. The $WAI presale is built for long-term positioning. It runs through 50 stages, starting at just $0.0003 and capping at $0.003267. With a listing price set at $0.005242, early entries are looking at a projected 1,747% ROI. That’s not based on sentiment, it’s backed by real token utility inside a live working product. In a space filled with speculation, Web3 ai is earning its spot among top crypto performers through actual results. It doesn’t need to wait for the next pump. If you’re building for the next cycle, or surviving this one, this is the kind of toolset that gives you an edge. It’s not just “AI in crypto.” It’s AI doing the work. Whether the market’s up or down, that’s something traders can always use. Sui (SUI) Forecast: ETF Buzz, DeFi Growth, and Big Price Targets The latest Sui (SUI) forecast shows the project building real momentum. A Spot ETF filing from Canary Capital pushed SUI up 8% in March, and new partnerships with names like Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Ant Digital are drawing serious institutional eyes. DeFi is expanding too, Momentum’s ve(3,3) DEX is live, and Sui’s gaming ecosystem is growing fast with titles like Code of Joker: Evolutions and SuiPlay. Price-wise, things are lining up. Sui (SUI) forecast projections put the short-term target near $2.86, with mid-range calls as high as $7.21 by May. Long-term, SUI could hit $10.38 in 2025 if momentum holds. RSI is neutral and fear levels are low, which suggests room to move. With a strong roadmap and tech behind it, SUI isn’t just trending, it’s showing it can hold value while scaling. If you’re tracking mid-cap growth plays, this one should be on your radar. Solana (SOL) Price Update: Firedancer, Phones, and Federal Attention The latest Solana (SOL) price update has SOL sitting around $139.88, bouncing off a recent dip near $119. Firedancer, a new validator client built by Jump Crypto, is set to boost scalability later this year. Plus, Solana Mobile is rolling out its second smartphone, Seeker, which is already attracting dApps to its native app store. These moves are giving the network fresh momentum heading into Q2. What’s more, Solana was included in the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, marking a big nod from regulators. Institutional interest is also heating up, with Upexi planning to raise $100 million to accumulate SOL. Forecasts now point to short-term targets around $145, with year-end calls hitting $315.86 if traction continues. If you’re tracking chains with active devs and real use cases, this Solana (SOL) price update shows it’s still one of the top networks to watch this cycle. Key Insights Sui (SUI) forecast points to a strong year ahead, with mid-term targets as high as $7.21 and institutional backing growing fast. Over on Solana, the latest Solana (SOL) price update reflects major upgrades like Firedancer, new mobile launches, and inclusion in the U.S. Crypto Reserve, solid moves that keep it in the top tier of active chains. But while both projects are building on-chain momentum, Web3 ai is winning off-chain, by solving real problems with real tools. Its AI-driven trading stack works no matter what the market looks like. That’s the edge. Web3 ai isn’t chasing hype, it’s helping traders act smarter, even when prices drop. In a cycle that’s shifting toward utility and sustainability, this is the kind of tech that earns its spot. If you’re tracking real potential in any market, Web3 ai is the kind of project that can outperform when others stall. Utility like this doesn’t wait.

43912033,https://nulltx.com/?p=148406,1745863248,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Unstaked vs Solana and XRP: The $0.006695 AI-Powered Crypto Set to Lead 2025,https://nulltx.com/unstaked-vs-solana-and-xrp-the-0-006695-ai-powered-crypto-set-to-lead-2025/,"Solana Heads for $160, XRP Drops 40%, but Unstaked’s $0.006695 Token Could Be the 2025 Crypto Gamechanger Ownership in Web3 is shifting beyond just holding coins. Today, it’s about influencing systems, shaping communities, and using assets that act independently. While Solana and XRP each bring strong foundations, one through technical resilience and the other through enterprise partnerships, neither combines AI, ownership, and performance like Unstaked does. With the soon-to-launch Agent Customization Marketplace, Unstaked brings a new model to AI crypto. Here, AI agents are not just functional; they become collectible, upgradeable, and tied to real-world engagement. This approach makes Unstaked AI crypto a standout candidate among projects likely to define the next phase of digital ownership, especially for those looking ahead to crypto’s future in 2025. XRP Sheds 40% from Highs: Can Utility Alone Revive It? XRP’s value has dropped more than 40% from its recent highs, raising concerns over whether Ripple’s strong real-world use case can still drive investor confidence. Although Ripple continues to expand global partnerships and remains active in cross-border payments, XRP’s price has not been able to sustain gains. The absence of clear new catalysts and ongoing legal uncertainty has only added to the pressure. Whale activity has slowed down, too, and daily trading volumes show weaker speculative interest. As a result, market behavior hints at caution. For XRP to bounce back meaningfully, a change in sentiment and possibly a clearer regulatory environment would be necessary. Until that shift happens, analysts suggest sideways trading or further pullbacks are likely. XRP’s fundamentals remain a strength, but perception will be critical in shaping its short-term path. Solana Clears $140: Is $160 Within Reach? Solana recently surged 10%, pushing through the $140 mark and setting up a possible move toward $160. Technical signals support this outlook. The RSI has moved closer to overbought territory, while consistent buying pressure has kept SOL prices above the $140 support. Increasing DEX activity and positive sentiment around layer-1 blockchains also fuel Solana’s current momentum. Short-term forecasts suggest consolidation near $136 could happen, but a continued rally would likely test the $160 resistance soon. If $160 breaks, the next targets could include $138 and $145. However, staying above $115 remains key to keeping Solana’s current bullish structure intact. While the upside potential looks promising, traders remain cautious for any signs of pullback or exhaustion in the rally. Unstaked’s NFT Customization Marketplace Could Spark the Next AI Craze Unstaked is preparing to shift how NFTs are seen by linking them to real-world behavior, upgrades, and performance metrics. At the core of this new vision is the Agent Customization Marketplace, where users will personalize AI agents with visual styles, skill upgrades, and NFT enhancements. This is not just about appearance. Each upgrade can influence how an agent performs on social media platforms like X and Telegram. It can also impact how much $UNSD the agent earns or how much governance power it holds in the Unstaked ecosystem. Unlike static NFT projects, Unstaked agents are active, AI-driven entities that interact and evolve. Tying NFT ownership to real-time engagement opens the door for secondary markets based on actual utility, not just digital art. Right now, Unstaked’s $UNSD token is in presale Stage 2 , priced at just $0.006695 . With an expected launch value near $0.1819 , early buyers are gaining access at a major discount. This structure gives Unstaked a fresh position among the most promising crypto projects for 2025, offering a blend of AI, real utility, and customizable assets. Looking ahead, the Agent Marketplace is scheduled for rollout in Q4 2025. Once this AI crypto project is launched, it could redefine NFT ownership from simply holding artwork to managing living, evolving AI agents. Those who move early to build and customize the best-performing agents could unlock powerful new value streams, making Unstaked a project to watch closely. From Use Cases to Customization: A New Way to Evaluate Crypto Projects Today, performance and adaptability are fast becoming the true measures of a project’s strength. XRP’s real-world partnerships still provide an important foundation, and Solana’s recent rally signals technical strength. Yet, Unstaked offers something different: a future where ownership is active, measurable, and personalized. By connecting NFT upgrades to on-chain agent performance, Unstaked gives users the ability to create assets that grow, interact, and deliver rewards over time. For those focused beyond short-term market moves and looking for projects that reward ongoing engagement, Unstaked provides a strong structure combining AI, NFTs, and decentralized incentives. It is a model that could define the next stage of crypto growth.

43912034,https://nulltx.com/?p=148418,1745863254,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Top Crypto Coins to Invest In: Cold Wallet, ADA, LINK, & SHIB 2025",https://nulltx.com/top-crypto-coins-to-invest-in-cold-wallet-ada-link-shib-2025/,"Top Crypto Coins To Invest In Right Now: What You Need to Know About These 4 Projects If you’ve been watching the crypto markets closely, you know that the opportunities in 2025 are anything but boring. With new use cases and stronger narratives shaping investor sentiment, the right coins are showing real signs of traction, not just in terms of hype, but actual adoption. That’s exactly why smart capital is flowing into projects that combine utility, innovation, and strong community backing. Whether you’re into privacy-first wallets, decentralized infrastructure, or meme-fueled momentum, this list pulls together four bold bets you can research right now. These are not just names you’ve heard before; they’re building for real usage in this cycle. And if you’re wondering where the next wave of upside might come from, this is a solid place to start. So let’s jump into the top crypto coins to invest in, starting with one of the most talked-about presales of the year: Cold Wallet. 1. Cold Wallet: Privacy-First Tech With 4,900% ROI Potential Cold Wallet is a crypto wallet that functions like cold storage without sacrificing online convenience. It’s designed to protect user privacy at every level, hiding IP addresses, removing trackers, and preventing behavioral profiling by default. Built with zero-knowledge proof technology, it allows users to verify balances, make private transactions, and interact with DeFi without exposing wallet data. Unlike other wallets that leave digital trails, Cold Wallet erases them before they form. This makes it ideal not just for casual users, but also for professionals and institutions who need discreet and secure asset management tools. The utility token $CWT ties directly into the wallet’s core functions, governance, feature access, and loyalty rewards. The presale starts at just $0.00714, with a projected launch price of $0.0351, offering an estimated 4,900% ROI. Cold Wallet’s roadmap includes multi-chain support, governance portals, and mobile/web rollouts by early 2026. As a product, it fills a massive privacy gap in crypto. As a token, it’s backed by real functionality and adoption potential. If you’re scanning the market for top crypto coins to invest in that bring actual innovation and not just marketing, Cold Wallet delivers on both security and upside. 2. Cardano: On-Chain Governance and Layer-3 Potential Cardano is back in the spotlight with the Plomin hard fork just around the corner. This major upgrade will finally activate full on-chain governance, letting ADA holders vote on protocol changes and even the upcoming Cardano Constitution. It’s a big deal, especially for those who’ve held ADA waiting for governance to move from theory to practice. In parallel, the Voltaire phase is progressing with community-based voting and treasury management. With more focus on decentralization and active user control, Cardano is aligning with the kind of utility long-term holders want to see. On the price front, ADA is currently sitting around $0.64, with technical indicators pointing to a potential 27% surge if it breaks past its symmetrical triangle resistance. Analysts are even projecting a 13x return if Bitcoin hits $250K this cycle. Combine that with new initiatives around wallet upgrades, privacy integrations, and community-driven development, and ADA becomes one of the most balanced top crypto coins to invest in this year. It’s got traction, it’s got updates, and more importantly, it’s got roadmap execution finally picking up pace. 3. Chainlink: Real-World Use Cases and Price Potential Chainlink is pushing deeper into real-world asset integration, and that’s a big reason why it stands out right now. It’s already powering projects like Coinbase’s Project Diamond and working with Fireblocks and Taurus to support stablecoin issuance and cross-chain functionality. Chainlink’s Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is now live on Hedera, expanding developer capabilities for building truly cross-chain applications. With PayPal and Venmo recently adding LINK to their platforms, retail access is also getting a strong push. This combination of enterprise-grade integration and user-friendly exposure makes Chainlink a strong name among the top crypto coins to invest in. The price of LINK is currently around $13.37, and analysts are eyeing a breakout if it clears the $12.90 resistance. Projections suggest it could climb toward $26 in the near term. With growing demand from institutions and increasing utility across blockchain ecosystems, LINK is moving beyond its earlier narrative. It’s no longer just about oracles, it’s about infrastructure for global finance. With strong fundamentals plus new partnerships rolling in, Chainlink continues to build the momentum that investors look for when narrowing down their picks for top crypto coins to invest in. 4. Shiba Inu: Burn Strategy, Price Momentum, and Layer-3 Hype Shiba Inu is proving it’s not just a meme anymore. In just the past 24 hours, SHIB’s burn rate shot up 825%, removing over 26 million tokens from circulation. The burn isn’t just symbolic; it’s backed by transaction volume on Shibarium, its Layer-2 solution, which has already contributed to over 881 million tokens being burned. There’s also buzz around a potential Layer-3 upgrade, which is expected to improve scalability and increase the privacy features of the ecosystem. That’s adding momentum on both the investor and developer side. As of now, SHIB trades at $0.00001255, and some forecasts see it hitting $0.000025 by late April, almost a 95% jump. It faces some heavy resistance around $0.000014 to $0.000019, but with nearly 88% of holders currently bullish, sentiment is clearly skewed to the upside. What’s more, the SHIB team is actively warning users about fake TREAT tokens and reinforcing that their ecosystem remains Ethereum-based. That kind of ecosystem clarity is helping SHIB regain credibility. If you’re looking at top crypto coins to invest in with strong community backing and aggressive tokenomics, Shiba Inu should be on your radar. Wrapping It Up Crypto isn’t short on narratives this year, but that doesn’t mean every project deserves your attention. What separates potential from noise is real product delivery, meaningful use cases, and strong economic models. That’s what makes Cold Wallet, Cardano, Chainlink, and Shiba Inu standout names in the hunt for top crypto coins to invest in. Each brings something distinct to the table: Cold Wallet with unmatched privacy tech, Cardano with governance milestones, Chainlink with real-world integrations, and SHIB with utility-fueled tokenomics. Right now, Cold Wallet’s presale ROI, estimated at nearly 4,900%, is turning heads, especially with privacy taking center stage in Web3. Cardano’s governance tools are going live. Chainlink is securing heavyweight partnerships. Shiba Inu’s burn mechanics translate into real price moves. These aren’t speculative hopes; they’re project moves you can track. Whether you’re here for the returns or the tech, these are the top crypto coins to invest in that deserve a close look before the next leg up. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

Swiss National Chairman Slams Bitcoin Reserve Push Swiss National Chairman Martin Schlegel has ruled out holding Bitcoin as part of Switzerland’s central bank reserves as he believes “cryptocurrency cannot currently fulfil the requirements for our currency reserves.” “For cryptocurrencies, market liquidity, even if it may seem ok at times, is especially during crises naturally called into question. Cryptocurrencies are also known for their high volatility, which is a risk for long-term value preservation,” Schlegel reportedly said at the bank’s General Assembly meeting on Friday. Schlegel’s comments were prompted by increasing pressure from local crypto pundits to create a Bitcoin reserve. Campaigner Luzius Meisser, a board member of crypto broker Bitcoin Suisse, said in a Reuters interview that adding bitcoin to Switzerland’s treasury “makes more sense as the world shifts towards a multipolar order.” Meisser claimed that the move should be made urgently as the dollar and the euro are “weakening”. Europe To Follow The U.S. With Bitcoin Reserve? This is not the first time Schlegel has nixed the idea of incorporating Bitcoin reserves into the Swiss central bank’s coffers. Just last month, he reportedly said he doesn’t want to make Bitcoin a reserve asset in Switzerland, citing a lack of stability, liquidity, and security. Despite Switzerland’s increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies, with various Swiss banks offering customers cryptocurrency-related services, the Swiss National Bank’s leadership remains firmly cautious. This development mirrors Europe’s broader stance. In January, ECB President Christine Lagarde dismissed Bitcoin as “unsafe,” asserting , “I’m confident that Bitcoins will not enter the reserves of any of the central banks.” By contrast, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month to create a strategic BTC reserve funded not through purchases but by retaining seized crypto assets. The EO order authorizes the Treasury and Commerce Departments to explore budget-neutral ways to increase those holdings. White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks indicated that the order also establishes a separate Digital Asset Stockpile made up of non-Bitcoin crypto assets confiscated in legal proceedings. ​At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $94,249, down 1.2% in the last 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. The apex crypto still remains 13.5% below its all-time high of almost $109,000, set on January 20, ahead of Trump’s inauguration as U.S. President.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|swiss,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-28 18:01:31

Despite widespread excitement over the weekend, it has now been confirmed that the rumored April 30 launch date was based on outdated information, not on any recent regulatory approval. Misinformation Sparks Confusion The confusion began when several cryptocurrency media outlets published stories claiming the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved ProShares’ XRP ETFs . These reports referenced a regulatory filing originally submitted on April 15, which was incorrectly portrayed as a fresh development. The outdated document triggered a wave of misinformation on social media. UPDATE: a lot people posting/reporting that @ProShares will be launching XRP ETFs on April 30th. We’ve confirmed that’s not the case. We don’t have a confirmed launch date yet but we believe they will launch — and likely launch in the short or possibly medium term. — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) April 28, 2025 No Confirmed Launch Date Yet While ProShares did initially aim for an April 30 target when it filed earlier this year , that date was always provisional. Bloomberg has now clarified that no definitive launch date has been set for the XRP futures ETFs as of Monday. Although expectations remain that these products will eventually debut , investors should be prepared for possible delays, with a launch potentially occurring either in the short or medium term.

ProShares, along with other major firms like Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, WisdomTree, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton, are all awaiting SEC decisions on their filings. Later this year, SEC Chair Paul Atkins is expected to weigh heavily on whether these spot products move forward, a decision that could have major implications for XRP’s market presence. For now, the XRP ETF dream remains alive — but not quite as immediate as some had hoped. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Saylor stated that the risks associated with bitcoin have largely been eliminated. He emphasized that when banks officially endorse bitcoin and experts agree on its value, demand will surge to the point where everyone will want to buy it, no one will need to sell it, and it will become unaffordable for many investors. This outlook reflects growing institutional acceptance of bitcoin and suggests a bullish future for the digital asset. This is an AI-generated article powered by DeepNewz, curated by The Defiant.

Early Monday morning, XMR skyrocketed from $232 to $331 in about eight hours. In a post on the social media platform X, top on-chain investigator ZachXBT told his 851,000 followers that the spike in XMR appeared to coincide with a “suspicious” transfer out of a Bitcoin wallet. ZachXBT says the BTC was immediately exchanged for Monero, sparking the rally for XMR. “Nine hours ago a suspicious transfer was made from a potential victim for 3520 BTC ($330.7M) Theft address bc1qcrypchnrdx87jnal5e5m849fw460t4gk7vz55g Shortly after the funds began to be laundered via 6+ instant exchanges and was swapped for XMR causing the XMR price to spike 50%.” ZachXBT says the evidence is quite overwhelming that the transfer and subsequent swap to XMR was a hack because the victim was a user of large US exchanges, lost millions to fees, and made a very sudden transfer of $330 million. “that’s how you know it’s likely a theft longtime Bitcoin holder >is a Gemini, River, Coinbase, etc user >$330M suddenly moved today and transferred in small increments to instant exchanges, creating hundreds of orders >gonna lose multiple 7 figs to fees / inefficient for normal person to buy like this” At time of writing, XMR has retraced from its massive rally, currently trading at $263.

Instead, it will come with the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade, which is set to happen later in the year. Stańczak disclosed this on X, noting that while debates are ongoing in the Ethereum forum about the EOF, it was never part of the community plan to include it in the Pectra upgrade. He said: “The current EOF discussion is NOT related to the upcoming Pectra upgrade, scheduled for May 7th. The Pectra upgrade does not include EOF, nor intended to include EOF. Everything on Pectra is going as planned for the May 7th release.” The Ethereum Foundation executive added that the Fusaka upgrade has not been scheduled yet, but it is likely to happen between Q3 and Q4, with September or October being the target. His statement comes amidst the ongoing debate about EOF on the Ethereum community on Twitter. While the Pectra upgrade is expected to improve Ethereum’s user experience in several ways, Fusaka comes with more technical and significant upgrades. Beyond the EOF, other Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) scheduled for inclusion in Fusaka include scaling updates, including EIP-7594 Peer Data Availability Sampling and EIP-7892 Blob Parameters Only Hardfork. Fusaka is a fusion of Fulu and Osaka network upgrades. What is EOF? The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the execution software for the Ethereum network, and the EOF is a series of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that seek to make several changes to the EVM. These proposed changes are expected to improve how EVM analyzes the Ethereum smart contracts and make transaction execution more efficient. According to pseudonymous Ethereum developer Logarithmic Rex in a 2023 post, the purpose of EOF is to ensure that EVM can analyze smart contracts before deploying them on-chain. This ensures they meet all the parameters before being deployed instead of the current system, where each instruction in a smart contract is tested chronologically as they are being deployed. He said: “Once EOF has been built into the protocol, the EVM will have a map of what each smart contract will look like. It will know where the code is and can therefore check all of it beforehand and then we can stop checking after every single instruction.” The developer added at the time that the EOF is important for Ethereum to achieve its goal of becoming a mature computing platform. Strong opposition to EOF in the Ethereum community However, many in the Ethereum community oppose the EOF, noting that it is too complex and does not have any obvious benefit to the network and its users. This has led to a series of debates between stakeholders pushing for it and those against it. Several stakeholders who have opposed it include developer Pascal Caversaccio , who published an article saying its complexity outweighs the necessity, and Paradigm chief technical officer Georgios Kostantopoulos. Even a former Ethereum developer, now at Solana, jokingly advised that Ethereum developers should focus heavily on the EOF so that they will have less time to compete with Solana on the things that actually matter. Opposition to Ethereum EOF is very strong (Source: ETHPulse) This strong opposition is also reflected in a poll held on the subject on ETHPulse . The poll shows that 85% of voters are against the idea, while 98.3% of registered ETH votes also said “No” to it. For many of those opposing, ETH’s struggling price is evidence that this should not be a priority. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is POL price up today? Following overall buying demand in the market, POL price is aiming for a push toward $0.25 level. However, it faces a consolidation. What is the POL price prediction for 2025? The Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the POL price to record a maximum level of $1.57. Will POL price touch $1? Yes, POL price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2025. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will POL Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and POL gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030.

Starting January 16, Jio integrated JioCoin into its JioSphere browser following a collaboration with Polygon Labs to incorporate Web3 and blockchain technologies. POL price prediction April 2025 Following Donald Trump’s election victory, the crypto market witnessed a robust price surge. However, the recent announcement on Tariffs has triggered bearish pressure in the altcoin market. However, analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices following the crash. We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.17 and a maximum price of $0.35, with an average of $0.28 in April. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction April 2025 $0.17 $0.28 $0.35 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. However, with the ongoing volatility amid the cryptocurrency market crash, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 50.27% from its ATH of $ 294.33.

The RSI is cooling off from near-overbought levels, suggesting a potential minor pullback before continuation. A bullish ascending channel pattern has been visible since mid-March. If SOL holds above $144 support, it may target $160 and $181 next. However, a break below $144 could trigger a deeper correction. Potential High: $181 Average Price Range: $150–$160 Potential Low: $144 Solana Price Prediction 2025 Solana’s weekly transaction fees have plunged to 92.35% from the January peak of $0.0327, hitting a six-month low of $0.0025. This marks the lowest level since September 2024. Consistency in this could open the doors for more projects being built on the Solana network. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250. Considering the present market sentiment, the SOL crypto could settle with an average trading price of around $325.

43912391,https://cryptonews.com/?p=355586,1745864003,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png,Caitlin Long Slams Fed’s Secret Rule Giving Big Banks a Stablecoin Edge,https://cryptonews.com/news/caitlin-long-fed-bias-big-bank-stablecoins/,"Key Takeaways: Banks are still banned from holding crypto, stifling blockchain adoption. Senator Lummis links the US Fed to Operation Chokepoint 2.0 crackdown. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, accused the US Federal Reserve of pretending to support crypto while quietly favoring big banks. The banking executive said the Fed rescinded four restrictive policies but left a key one in place from January 7, 2023, when the Biden administration pushed anti-crypto measures. Why Did the Fed Keep One Key Anti-Crypto Rule? According to a detailed April 27 thread on X, Caitlin Long explained that a key US Fed rule is quietly making it difficult for banks to get directly involved in crypto. 1/ I'VE BEEN THINKING about why the Fed left in place one of its anti- #crypto statements while rescinding all 4 others. The one it left in place was issued in coordination w/ the Biden White House's anti-crypto statement on January 27, 2023. Link here: https://t.co/VntoUEBn9L https://t.co/n2p2aD3WI3 — Caitlin Long (@CaitlinLong_) April 27, 2025 She broke it down into three simple points. First, banks are not allowed to hold crypto for themselves, not even to cover small transaction fees, like gas fees needed to process blockchain transactions. Second, banks are not allowed to create stablecoins on open, public blockchains like Ethereum. Third, the Fed still strongly prefers private blockchains controlled by big banks, even though other regulators like the OCC and FDIC have moved away from that idea. Long warns that this gives big banks a major advantage. They can launch private stablecoins while everyone else must wait for the new stablecoin bill to take effect. 5/ Next, let's turn to the Fed keeping its old policy that banks can't touch #crypto directly (as principal). This blocks banks from making markets in BTC, ETH, SOL, etc (something the WallSt banks want to do), but it also does something more insidious to banks in crypto custody: — Caitlin Long (@CaitlinLong_) April 27, 2025 The rule creates deeper problems for banks offering crypto custody services. When providing custody, banks must estimate gas fees before executing on-chain transactions. If fees increase above their estimate, the transaction fails. Current rules prevent banks from paying these extra fees themselves, creating a major operational problem. Custodians typically break large balances into smaller ones as a safety measure. But these internal transfers also require gas fees that banks can’t cover, effectively pushing them away from the custody business entirely. Are Private Blockchains the Fed’s Hidden Agenda? This debate started after the US Federal Reserve, on April 24, announced the withdrawal of major pieces of guidance that had discouraged banks from engaging with crypto and stablecoins. First, the Fed rescinded its 2022 letter requiring banks to notify before starting crypto activities. Second, it withdrew two 2023 statements warning banks against working with potentially fraudulent crypto entities. Finally, it canceled a 2023 letter restricting state banks from issuing stablecoins. @federalreserve announces the withdrawal of guidance for banks related to their crypto-asset and dollar token activities and related changes to its expectations for these activities: https://t.co/v1MwuswOlE — Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) April 24, 2025 The Fed originally implemented these rules to protect financial stability, consumers, and banking system integrity. The move was seen as the Federal Reserve’s first big step on crypto under the Trump administration, which has promised to make the US more crypto-friendly and to support innovation. The announcement received mixed reactions. Michael Saylor, the founder of Strategy (the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin), welcomed the announcement as he noted that banks were now free to support Bitcoin . Long offered a completely different view. She argued that the Fed’s move was mainly a PR spin that fooled many “smart people.” She pointed out that the Fed’s press release listed all guidance it dropped but strategically avoided mentioning what it kept in place. 9/ The Fed definitely won on PR spin–its press release listed a long list of guidance it rescinded but omitted ANY mention of the guidance it kept. That duped *a lot* of smart people, understandably. Y'all *SHOULD* be angry now that you know the truth. https://t.co/S9jJ6LrZJM — Caitlin Long (@CaitlinLong_) April 27, 2025 Long also noted the White House praised the Fed’s actions, seemingly unaware of what actually happened. She suggested this raises questions about what the White House expected, what the Fed promised to do, and current Fed-White House relations. Could State Laws Undermine the Fed’s Control Over Crypto? While Long focuses on the Fed’s technical restrictions, the battle extends to Congress as well. The clash between federal control and state-level innovation continues to intensify. US Senator Cynthia Lummis warns the crypto industry not to celebrate too early after the Federal Reserve has pulled back some crypto rules. Lummis, often called “crypto’s savior” and “Bitcoin’s Godmother,” strongly supports crypto innovation. She led efforts like the BITCOIN Act and the Strategic Reserve Bill, both introduced in July 2024. (1/5) The Federal Reserve’s actions yesterday withdrawing crypto guidance are just lip service. Here’s why: — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) April 25, 2025 In a detailed X post, Lummis said the Fed’s move is mostly “lip service,” echoing Long’s concerns. She explained that the Fed continues using “reputational risk” to control banks unfairly. Lummis highlighted that Section 9(13), an important part of the Fed’s policies, remains in place. The Fed still labels Bitcoin and digital assets as “unsafe and unsound.” Finally, she reminded everyone that many people behind the earlier crypto crackdown (Operation Chokepoint 2.0) still shape policy today. I will continue to hold the Fed accountable until the digital asset industry gets more than a life jacket, Chair Powell—they need a fair shake. — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) April 25, 2025 Lummis plans to keep fighting and will hold Fed Chair Jerome Powell accountable until the crypto industry gets real, lasting support. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could the Fed’s policies inadvertently accelerate crypto adoption outside traditional banking systems? The Fed’s restrictions on banks offering crypto services can push users toward DeFi platforms like Aave (for lending/borrowing), Uniswap, and PancakeSwap. These platforms enable self-custody and peer-to-peer transactions, bypassing banks entirely. What role do state-level crypto initiatives play in countering the Fed’s restrictive policies? States like Wyoming, where Caitlin Long’s Custodia Bank is chartered, are leading efforts to attract blockchain businesses. Wyoming’s Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) framework, for instance, allows banks like Custodia to offer digital asset custody and transactional services while avoiding some of the Federal Reserve’s strictest regulations. Why is the Fed favoring private blockchains, and who benefits? The Fed prefers private blockchains for their control and privacy. Unlike public chains, these networks limit access to trusted players, mainly large banks. For example, JP Morgan’s stablecoin, the JPM Coin, operates on a permissioned network, while Mastercard’s Multi-Token (MTN) leverages the payment network’s private chain. Both fit the Fed’s strict rules, keeping settlements secured and regulated.

The stablecoin will operate on the ADI blockchain, according to The National, and will be issued by FAB, the UAE’s largest bank, pending regulatory approval, the companies said in a joint statement Monday. The digital currency will be used by consumers, businesses, and institutions, supporting emerging applications like machine-to-machine transactions and artificial intelligence-driven processes. “This new stablecoin represents a transformative step forward and will revolutionise the way both consumers and businesses engage with trusted blockchain payments in the UAE,” said Hana Al Rostamani, group chief executive of FAB. Stablecoins , typically pegged to fiat currencies, offer a more stable digital asset compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Their value is anchored to currencies, government treasuries, or commodities such as gold, providing a less volatile alternative for digital transactions.

In March 2023, it launched the “Digital Dirham” initiative. Last year, the bank introduced regulations for stablecoins, aiming to create a clear operational framework for the sector. To reinforce this strategy, the central bank recently unveiled a new symbol for the digital dirham. Mohamed Alsuwaidi, Managing Director and Group CEO of ADQ, said the launch marks “a pivotal step” in strengthening the UAE’s digital infrastructure. “As we move towards an increasingly digital and connected economy, the stablecoin will provide a solution that is secure, efficient and scalable,” Alsuwaidi said. The ADI blockchain, developed by the ADI Foundation, will serve as the backbone for the new stablecoin. The foundation has established partnerships with governments in over 20 countries to expand its compliant blockchain distribution network. The UAE has been building momentum in the digital asset space. The Abu Dhabi Global Market and Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority have already implemented frameworks for regulating cryptocurrencies. In December, AE Coin became the first regulated digital currency approved in the UAE. Meanwhile, Tether, issuer of USDT ( USDT ) — the world’s largest stablecoin — also received approval last August to develop a stablecoin in the region. The new dirham-backed stablecoin is expected to have a “significant impact” across finance, commerce, and trade, the companies said.

ProShares received silent approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before proceeding with the ETFs. The XRP ETFs are futures-based rather than spot because the latter, which requires actual crypto holdings, requires more regulatory approval. The three ETFs include the Ultra XRP ETF (2x leverage), the Short XRP ETF, and the Ultra Short XRP ETF (-2x leverage). The SEC gave silent approval for the ETFs because it did not make any objections. A futures ETF merely tracks the price of an asset without having a one-to-one backing of the actual asset. The XRP ETFs allow investors to both leverage and short the XRP price. These are very convenient options to have as a trader, allowing retail speculators to short the XRP price without needing a complicated futures platform. Although XRP ETFs are futures-based, meaning actual XRP does not back their price, plans are in place to introduce spot-based XRP ETFs soon. ProShares initially announced the ETFs in January and received tacit approval from the SEC, which did not object to the futures market within the allotted time. CME Group also announced that it would launch XRP futures on its platform and add them to its growing list of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which already include Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. XRP spot-based ETFs, meanwhile, are still awaiting approval from the SEC. ProShares has an XRP spot ETF waiting for approval, along with other companies, including Bitwise, 21Shares, and Grayscale. With the latest announcement of three ProShares XRP ETFs, there are now 4 XRP tracking ETFs in America. The first company to list an XRP ETF was Teucrium Investment Advisors, a firm based in Vermont. Polymarket, meanwhile, has increased the odds of an XRP spot ETF approval in December 2025, with odds rising from 68% to 78%. This change is likely influenced by the announcement of ProShares’ futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Polymarket allows participants to trade on various future events, thus creating a useful prediction market to analyse world events. The SEC and Ripple have recently settled their lawsuits , providing some stimulus for prediction market bets on the spot-based ETF. However, creating a spot-based ETF for an advanced crypto market like Ripple proves to be a complicated process for regulators. ProShares also has an Ethereum futures-based ETF called ProShares Ether Strategy ETF, which was launched in 2023. There exists a wave of interest in XRP from institutional investors. Numerous companies, including Bitwise and 21Shares, have applied for a spot-based XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). Interest in XRP has increased following the SEC’s settlement with Ripple Labs.

If Yes, Here’s Where it May Lead to! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After the latest rise in the market sentiment, the top tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have been consolidating within a tight range. It continues to command significant attention, mainly due to its robust price performance and substantial on-chain activity since the start of the month. Currently, the SOL price is trading around $146.96, facing a loss of 1.44% over the past 24 hours. However, this modest pullback comes on the heels of a remarkable rally of over $64 from its monthly low of $96.59 to a high of $156.05. The current price action appears to be bearish influence, but the SOL price remains well above its early April levels, underpinning broader market support. Solana’s total value locked (TVL) stands at $8.54 billion with a 24-hr trading volume of $3.67 billion and open interest at $1.11 billion, pointing to a thriving ecosystem with sustained engagement from both DeFi and derivatives markets. Besides, April has brought enormous capital flows for Solana. Over 37.4 million SOL, worth nearly $52.76 million, was transferred out of Binance a few days back, which indicates huge whale activity and fund redistribution within the Solana ecosystem. Will such large-scale withdrawals tighten exchange liquidity and impact the short-term SOL price dynamics? The above chart shows the Solana price is trading within a perfect cup and handle pattern and just bounced off the support of the parallel channel. The price is heading slowly towards the resistance as the bears seem to have had enough dominance over the token. However, the bulls have kept the trend elevated and, in turn, have kept the bullish hopes alive. The DMI levels and the ADX have squeezed, which suggests a strong price action is on the horizon, considering the historical chart patterns. On the other hand, the weekly MACD shows a drop in the selling pressure while the levels are heading for a bullish crossover. Hence, a rise above $200 appears to be imminent in the coming month. Solana’s fundamentals are strong, underpinned by whale engagement and a fast-growing DeFi ecosystem. After this significant recovery and DEX volume dominance over Ethereum, SOL is attracting sustained attention from both traders and long-term holders.

With Bitcoin charging toward $95,000 and Ethereum reclaiming its smart contract dominance, the market’s pulse has never been stronger. But here’s where things get even spicier: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission just greenlit ProShares to launch XRP futures ETFs, set to roll out on April 30. This stamp of regulatory approval is sending a loud, clear message—institutional capital isn’t just flirting with crypto anymore. It’s diving in. The XRP ETF approval is bigger than just Ripple. It’s a signal that regulatory barriers are finally starting to crumble, opening doors for diversified crypto asset classes. It’s also waking up traditional financial players who once sat on the sidelines. Now, with clearer lanes, projects that actually solve real-world problems are poised to steal the show. No gimmicks, no hopium—just blockchain platforms delivering tech that institutions can bet on. This is where Qubetics , Hedera, and Cosmos come into play. While meme coins and hype machines still grab headlines, these three are building the pipes and highways that Web3 and digital finance will run on. Qubetics ($TICS) in particular is carving out a lane that even the biggest Layer 1s missed—true interoperability and real-world asset tokenization at scale. Early backers are already locking in their positions, knowing full well the road ahead belongs to the builders, not the noisemakers. Qubetics ($TICS): Leading the Charge Among the Most Potential Crypto Projects Qubetics isn’t playing catch-up—it’s playing a whole different game. Its Interoperability feature is a real-world solution for a digital economy desperate for seamless movement of data, assets, and value. Businesses, professionals, and everyday users can now operate across blockchains without the mind-numbing complexity usually involved. That alone makes Qubetics the go-to bridge between legacy finance and decentralized systems. Presale Performance and ROI Projections The Qubetics crypto presale is where serious momentum is brewing. In its 32nd stage, Qubetics has already sold more than 510 million $TICS tokens to over 25,400 early buyers, raising a stunning $16.5 million in presale contributions. Right now, $TICS is priced at $0.2093 per token—but that won’t last forever. Early adopters who jumped in at just $0.01? They’re already staring down a 1993% return. And the runway isn’t over yet. Buyers entering now could be looking at: At $1 after presale, a 377% ROI. At $5, a 2,288% ROI. At $6, a 2,766% ROI. At $10? A beastly 4,677% ROI. And post-mainnet launch, if $15 is achieved, a mind-blowing 7,066% ROI. The doors to this presale opportunity aren’t closed yet—but they aren’t staying wide open forever either. Hedera (HBAR): A Heavyweight Among the Most Potential Crypto Projects Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) doesn’t move like the typical Layer 1s. Powered by its proprietary Hashgraph consensus mechanism, Hedera delivers speed, security, and scalability that outclasses traditional blockchains. It’s not about dreams; it’s about enterprise-grade execution. HBAR’s current price sits near $0.197 , and while broader market volatility stirs the pot, Hedera keeps building. Nasdaq’s pending ETF application linked to HBAR only cements Hedera’s growing influence. Institutional doors are creaking open, and Hedera is standing right in the front row, ready to walk through. Technical analysis shows cautious optimism—consolidation near key resistance, a strengthening RSI, and MACD signals suggesting upward potential. Whether for decentralized applications, smart contracts, or real-world enterprise adoption, Hedera’s fundamentals scream “undervalued giant.” Cosmos (ATOM): A Quiet Titan Among the Most Potential Crypto Projects Cosmos (ATOM) isn’t just another name in the crowd—it’s the backbone for what Web3 was supposed to become: interoperable, composable, and sovereign. Cosmos’s Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) Protocol is the lifeline that allows separate blockchains to talk, trade, and transact. ATOM is trading around $4.46, modest compared to its all-time highs, but don’t mistake quiet for weakness. Projects like dYdX are migrating to Cosmos, recognizing the freedom, speed, and modularity the network offers. Cosmos isn’t chasing clout. It’s building the digital freeway others will drive on. With its emphasis on sovereignty for app-specific chains and value flow across the Cosmos Hub, ATOM remains one of the most potential crypto assets before mass adoption catches up. Final Thoughts The tides are shifting fast. With XRP ETFs opening the door for mainstream capital and regulatory confidence building by the day, the time for speculation is closing. Qubetics, Hedera, and Cosmos aren’t chasing fleeting trends — they’re laying the groundwork for the next decade of blockchain and digital finance. Those who recognize the most potential crypto projects early don’t just witness change — they ride it all the way to the front lines. Qubetics’ interoperability, Hedera’s enterprise strength, and Cosmos’s multi-chain future aren’t waiting for permission. Neither should those looking to be part of what’s coming next. The window is still open, but not for long.

On April 28, Stańczak posted on X confirming that while the specific rollout date remains to be decided, the team is looking to late 2025. The upgrade is set to include the controversial EVM Object Format (EOF) upgrade, which has sparked extensive debate within the developer community. Understanding the EVM Object Format (EOF) The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) powers all Ethereum smart contracts. The upcoming EOF upgrade proposes a major shift: introducing a versioned, structured container format for smart contract bytecode. EOF will replace the current free-form bytecode with a defined structure featuring: A header with the 0xEF00 hexadecimal value and a version number A section table with metadata Code and optional data segmented sections This change is aimed at making it more efficient, impose code and data separation, and support future upgrades in a neater way. Supporters vs. Critics EOF contains 12 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) and guarantees benefits like easier contract upgrades, improved security, and a more organized system. But not everyone agrees. Developer Pascal Caversaccio warned in a March post on Ethereum Magicians that EOF complicates the EVM by introducing new semantics, altering most opcodes, and necessitating substantial tooling changes, which could come with fresh vulnerabilities. He argued that the same goals could be achieved with smaller, less invasive upgrades without overhauling the base of the EVM. Moreover, maintaining the legacy EVM along with the new EOF framework might be a long-term support headache. Increase in Community Resistance Community sentiment towards EOF is varied but relatively conservative. A poll on the Ethereum governance platform ETHPulse showed that 39 voters who own nearly 17,745 ETH oppose the EOF upgrade, while seven voters with less than 300 ETH voted for it. Some developers also had more general concerns: Is it prudent to undertake significant changes to the EVM in the first place? A stable EVM, they contend, is critical to developing strong tooling and applications. With the Fusaka hard fork looming, Ethereum is having one of its most impactful debates regarding protocol evolution and future stability.",Ethereum|Blockchain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|ZRX|FORKS,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-28 19:18:00
43914972,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=30425,1745867982,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,"Supra Transforms Blockchain Automation, Economics & Cross-Chain Interoperability With New Innovations",https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/supra-transforms-blockchain-automation-economics-cross-chain-interoperability-with-new-innovations/,"Layer-1 blockchain Supra has announced the public testnet debut of two key innovations it believes are critical to fulfill its ambitions of becoming the leading execution hub for cross-chain decentralized finance. They include AutoFi, a system-level automation engine that’s designed to execute DeFi transactions instantly, without delays, and SupraNova, an interoperability protocol that facilitates trustless communication between L1 networks without relying on risky blockchain bridges. First announced last month, AutoFi is a novel solution that aims to address some of the biggest challenges in DeFi, such as transaction slippage, front-running attacks by validators and execution delays. The big innovation here is its system-level automation, which makes it possible for smart contracts to execute with zero-block delays . In other words, transactions can be completed instantly, within the same block, the moment the contract’s conditions have been met. Built natively into the Supra stack, AutoFi represents a significant advance for DeFi. It will allow users to execute sophisticated trading strategies with laser-like precision, ensuring they can capitalize on market opportunities with unprecedented accuracy. It’s the latest in a string of exciting innovations that set Supra apart from other blockchains. Supra is also the first L1 to feature integrated oracle price feeds and verifiable on-chain randomness , while it’s powered by a Moonshot consensus mechanism that supports up to 500,000 transactions per second with sub-second latency, making it one of the fastest networks in the business. Streamlined transactions and sustainable economics Supra believes AutoFi is a game-changer for three reasons. The obvious benefit is increased fairness, as AutoFi eliminates the opportunity for others to manipulate transactions. More broadly speaking, it will also help to enable a new era of artificial intelligence-powered agents that can execute advanced DeFi strategies on behalf of users. The third major benefit is how AutoFi will help to boost Supra’s blockchain economics, redistributing revenue it generates across its ecosystem in a way that incentivizes growth. Supra’s team explained that 25% of transaction fees will go to the DeFi dApps they originate from, while another 25% is allocated to the node operators for maintaining the network. The other 50% will be redirected to Supra’s treasury, ensuring it will always have funds available to provide liquidity to the ecosystem and support other protocols building on its network. AutoFi derives its revenue from automation task fees, which are recurring fees charged to users who register automated DeFi actions. In addition, the system features a competitive bidding mechanism, where users can bid for the rights to execute high-value actions such as liquidations. Supra co-founder and Chief Business Officer Jon Jones likens the system to Google AdSense. “Instead of just charging for blockspace, we’re monetizing execution priority in real time, opening up entirely new, sustainable revenue models,” he pointed out. The result will be a self-sustaining and anti-inflationary economic loop, and Supra is so confident in the model that it believes it will be able to wean itself off block rewards within just two years. Trustless L1-to-L1 Communications With these capabilities in place, Supra is now turning its attention to cross-chain interoperability. SupraNova will launch its testnet on April 29, and is said to be the first truly bridgeless protocol for cross-chain communications, It eliminates the bridge by recomputing external chains’ consensus mechanisms natively and directly on its L1 network. When a user attempts a cross-chain transaction on a supported chain, it generates a cryptographic proof of that event and submits it to Supra. SupraNova will then verify this transaction by recomputing the source blockchain’s consensus to ensure its validity, without any need for external validators, relays or multi-sigs. In this way, it ensures full preservation of the source chain’s consensus and the security guarantees it provides. Surpa Chief Executive Joshua Tobkin said SupraNova allows blockchains to communicate with one another without any of the risks posed by bridges, which have lost billions of dollars over the years due to exploits. “It doesn’t rely on external multi-sigs or wrappers, removing the biggest vulnerabilities in interoperability,” he said. For now, the public testnet of SurpaNova only supports Ethereum transactions, but will soon expand to include EVM-compatible proof-of-stake networks. It will then move to embrace MoveVM-based networks and ultimately, numerous other L1s and L2s.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-28 19:19:42
43914325,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153384,1745868044,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,EUR/USD Forecast Soars: Standard Chartered Predicts Weaker US Dollar,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eur-usd-forecast-soars/,"For those tracking the pulse of global markets, especially in the cryptocurrency space where macro trends often dictate sentiment, a significant shift in the US Dollar forecast can have ripple effects. Standard Chartered, a major player in the financial world, has just released an updated view that’s catching attention: they see the U.S. dollar weakening, leading them to raise their target for the EUR/USD currency pair. Understanding the Revised EUR/USD Forecast What exactly does Standard Chartered’s revised EUR/USD forecast mean? In simple terms, they now expect the Euro to strengthen against the U.S. Dollar more than they previously did. Their new target is 1.16. This forecast is a notable change and reflects a shift in their assessment of the economic forces at play globally, particularly concerning the relative strength of the Eurozone and U.S. economies, and the monetary policy paths of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed). Think of the EUR/USD pair like a seesaw. When the forecast goes up (like to 1.16), it means Standard Chartered believes the Euro side of the seesaw will go up, and the U.S. Dollar side will go down. A move from, say, 1.10 to 1.16 represents a significant percentage shift in value. Why the Weaker US Dollar Forecast ? Insights from Standard Chartered Standard Chartered’s decision to adjust its US Dollar forecast downward isn’t arbitrary. It’s based on a detailed analysis of various economic indicators and potential future scenarios. While specific details from their report would provide the full picture, common factors that lead banks to predict a weaker dollar include: Federal Reserve Policy: Expectations of interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve can make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors seeking yield compared to currencies where rates might remain higher or be cut less aggressively. Inflation Trends: Changes in inflation expectations in the U.S. relative to other regions can influence central bank actions and currency valuations. Economic Growth Differentials: If growth prospects in the Eurozone improve relative to the U.S., it can support the Euro. Fiscal Policy & Debt: Concerns about U.S. government debt levels or fiscal spending could weigh on the dollar long-term. Global Risk Sentiment: In times of increased global stability or ‘risk-on’ sentiment, investors may move away from the traditionally safe-haven U.S. Dollar towards other assets or currencies. Their updated view suggests that one or more of these factors are aligning in a way that points to a less favorable environment for the U.S. Dollar’s strength moving forward. Breaking Down the Standard Chartered Forecast The core of the recent news is the specific target provided by the Standard Chartered forecast : 1.16 for the EUR/USD pair. This isn’t just a directional call (dollar weaker); it’s a concrete price level they anticipate the pair could reach within their forecast horizon (often 6-12 months, though the specific timeframe would be in their report). This number serves as a benchmark for market participants. Key aspects of the Standard Chartered forecast likely include: Specific Timeframe: When do they expect 1.16 to be reached? Is it by year-end, mid-next year? This detail is crucial for traders and investors. Underlying Assumptions: What specific Fed rate cuts, ECB actions, or growth numbers are they assuming to arrive at 1.16? Risk Factors: What could go wrong with their forecast? Unexpected economic data, geopolitical events, or policy shifts could invalidate their view. A forecast like this from a major institution provides a data point that traders and analysts incorporate into their own models and strategies, contributing to the overall Forex market analysis landscape. Implications for Forex Market Analysis and Beyond A revised forecast from a major bank like Standard Chartered impacts the broader Forex market analysis in several ways: Market Sentiment: It can influence how other traders and analysts view the pair. If multiple institutions start revising their targets upwards for EUR/USD, it can create a self-reinforcing trend. Trading Strategies: Traders might adjust their positions based on this new information. Those holding long USD positions might reconsider, while those looking to buy EUR might see this as supportive data. Corporate Hedging: Businesses involved in international trade between the U.S. and the Eurozone might adjust their hedging strategies based on the expectation of a stronger Euro or weaker Dollar. This development is a key piece of the puzzle in understanding the current dynamics shaping the world of currency trading. The Broader Macro Outlook and its Crypto Connection So, how does this connect to the cryptocurrency world, which is our primary focus? The Macro outlook is increasingly important for crypto investors. Here’s why a weaker U.S. Dollar forecast matters: Inverse Correlation Potential: Historically, there has sometimes been an inverse relationship between the strength of the U.S. Dollar (measured by the DXY index) and the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. When the dollar weakens, assets perceived as alternatives or ‘risk-on’ assets, like crypto, can sometimes benefit. Liquidity: Factors that lead to a weaker dollar (like potential Fed easing) often correlate with increased global liquidity. More liquidity can find its way into risk assets, including crypto. Inflation Hedge Narrative: While debated, some investors view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies, including the dollar. A weaker dollar could reinforce this narrative for some. Global Investment Flows: A weaker dollar can make U.S. assets (including potentially U.S.-listed crypto funds or companies) relatively cheaper for foreign investors holding other currencies, potentially increasing demand. While the link isn’t always direct or guaranteed, understanding the forces driving major currency pairs like EUR/USD provides valuable context for the broader financial environment that crypto operates within. Standard Chartered’s forecast is a signal about these underlying economic forces. What to Watch Next Based on this Standard Chartered forecast and the general Macro outlook , here are a few things market participants, including crypto enthusiasts, might want to keep an eye on: U.S. Economic Data: Pay attention to inflation reports, jobs numbers, and GDP growth. Stronger or weaker data than expected can influence the Fed’s decisions and the dollar’s path. Federal Reserve Commentary: Statements and speeches from Fed officials about their monetary policy intentions are critical. ECB Actions: The European Central Bank’s stance on interest rates and stimulus will impact the Euro’s strength. Geopolitical Events: Global events can quickly change risk sentiment and currency flows. DXY Index: Watch the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar against a basket of major currencies. A falling DXY would align with StanChart’s forecast. Staying informed on these traditional financial indicators provides a more complete picture of the forces influencing the entire market landscape, including digital assets. Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Tides Standard Chartered’s updated EUR/USD forecast to 1.16, driven by an expectation of a weaker US Dollar forecast , is a key development in the global financial markets. This expert Standard Chartered forecast provides a valuable data point for anyone engaged in Forex market analysis and offers insights into the prevailing Macro outlook . While the direct impact on cryptocurrency prices is debated and complex, understanding these macro shifts is crucial for navigating the broader investment environment. As major institutions adjust their views on core currency pairs, it signals potential changes in liquidity, risk appetite, and relative asset attractiveness that can, and often do, spill over into the crypto market. Keeping an eye on these traditional market indicators remains a smart strategy for the informed crypto investor.

However, unlike a spot ETF, which would hold XRP directly, ProShares’ offerings will provide exposure through derivatives, a structure that has raised eyebrows among analysts. “This is NOT a spot XRP ETF,” noted ETF expert Nate Geraci in a post on X. “It will actually be several leveraged and inverse ETFs obtaining XRP exposure via derivatives.” Still No Spot XRP ETF The products include the Ultra XRP ETF, offering a 2x leverage on the daily returns of XRP future prices, the Short XRP ETF, offering inverse exposure, which will enable investors to profit from XRP’s price decline, and the Ultra Short XRP ETF, providing nearly twice the inverse (-2x) of the cryptocurrency’s daily performance. The SEC’s decision to permit leveraged products before a spot ETF is unusual, as most crypto ETFs, including Bitcoin and Ethereum funds, followed the opposite trajectory. “Now, why are these being allowed before spot?” asked a perplexed Geraci. Earlier this month, the regulator authorized the first-ever leveraged XRP product: Vermont-based Teucrium’s 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP), trading on NYSE Arca. Some market watchers have speculated that this sequence of events, first, Teucrium’s XXRP and now ProShares’ XRP ETF, could be a sign that the financial markets watchdog might be more comfortable signing off on derivatives-based exposure instead of direct custody of crypto assets. “It might relate to regulatory comfort levels with derivatives versus holding the underlying asset directly,” said a user on X, answering Geraci’s question. “Or perhaps the demand for leveraged products is being tested before a spot ETF is considered.” The approval also comes just weeks after the SEC settled its high-profile lawsuit against Ripple Labs, the company behind the token. The case dragged on for years and ended with a $50 million fine, far less than the SEC’s original demands, effectively clearing a major regulatory hurdle for the cryptocurrency. Historic Milestone ProShares, which manages over $60 billion in assets, is no stranger to crypto-based financial products, having made history in 2021 when it launched the first Bitcoin futures ETF (BITO). Its entry into the XRP space brings considerable clout and credibility. Arthur, an XRP-focused commentator on X, called it a “historic milestone” for XRP’s integration into mainstream finance, opening the doors for easier access by banks, institutional investors, as well as retail traders. “XRP is entering the big leagues,” he claimed , ticking off the various benefits that should come with the ETF, including regulatory validation and the possibility of “massive capital inflows.” Meanwhile, in the markets, the token climbed 4.6% in the last 24 hours and is currently trading around $2.28 after ranging between $2.17 and $2.29. Zooming out to a weekly view, it gained 7.4%, slightly underperforming the rest of the crypto market’s 8.2% rise in that period. Additionally, XRP registered a 5% uptick across the previous 30 days, continuing a broader trend that has seen it surge more than 335% over the last year.

As XRP eyes a major comeback, altcoins like Lightchain AI, Polygon, and Dogecoin could deliver 2500% gains before it reaches the $5 mark. Table of Contents XRP: Price trends and recovery prospects Altcoins poised for growth Joining Lightchain AI XRP appears to be gaining traction in the crypto market, signaling a possible resurgence. However, three other altcoins have the potential to offer greater returns. Lightchain AI, currently priced below $0.007, has captured investor interest thanks to its unique technology and presale results, raising over $19.6 million. Additionally, coins like Polygon (POL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are positioned for significant growth, creating potential opportunities for investors to achieve substantial gains before XRP crosses the $5 threshold. XRP: Price trends and recovery prospects XRP is currently trading at around $2.30. Analysts have differing projections, some expect a slight increase to $2.84, while others expect a jump to $3.77 by the end of the year. More bullish predictions point to $5.81 or $10, depending on regulatory developments and institutional uptake. These projections also take into account factors like XRP ETF approvals, heightened RippleNet usage by financial institutions, and a successful outcome to Ripple’s legal troubles. Short-term fluctuations are normal, but XRP’s long-term potential is strong, depending on developments in technology and overall market trends.

Source: CoinGecko At the same time, meme coin market volume soared to $8.42 billion, marking a 14% jump despite a general downturn that saw the total meme coin market cap fall 3.7% to $59 billion. Source: CoinGecko Over the past 30 days, FARTCOIN has rocketed an astounding 170%, firmly establishing itself as the best performer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. FARTCOIN’s price currently sits at $1.16, edging closer to key resistance points at $1.27 and $1.52. If momentum holds, a breakout toward $1.92 or even $2 is within reach, a dramatic turnaround considering the token crashed to $0.20 just two months ago. FARTCOIN’s Massive Comeback: From Crash to Dominance Just a few weeks ago, FARTCOIN was battling to recover from a painful crash that dragged its price down to $0.20. Fast forward to today, and the story has undergone a dramatic change. At the end of March, FARTCOIN’s open Interest barely hovered around $100 million. Now, fueled by growing trader confidence and bullish technical setups, open Interest is nearing $250 million, resulting from the influx of new capital and leveraged positions. If the Open Interest continues to expand, it would solidify the uptrend and likely push FARTCOIN toward the much-anticipated $2 mark. Supporting this momentum, the MACD on the daily chart has produced a golden cross, a bullish technical event where the short-term EMA crosses above the long-term EMA. Meanwhile, the RSI remains above 64, indicating strong but not yet overextended bullish momentum. From a structural standpoint, FARTCOIN is also exhibiting a U-shaped recovery pattern, a classic formation that indicates a trend reversal and strength. Additionally, the Supertrend indicator flashed a buy alert, further confirming the positive trend. If FARTCOIN manages to breach the $1.27 and $1.52 barriers, it could pave the way for a swift rally to $1.92 and even $2, provided liquidity remains strong and traders resist the urge to take large profits. Yet caution remains essential. If momentum stalls, FARTCOIN could revisit support levels around $0.86, near the 0.618 golden pocket ratio. A larger pullback would only be confirmed if the token drops below the key $0.20 support from last month. For now, however, the bulls remain firmly in control, with technicals and market sentiment aligning toward continued upside. Meme Coin Mania on Solana: FARTCOIN Leads the Charge FARTCOIN’s rise isn’t happening in isolation; it’s part of a broader resurgence of meme coins on the Solana blockchain. After its 21% rally over the past 24 hours, FARTCOIN’s market cap has climbed to $1.08 billion, leapfrogging Bonk to become the second-largest meme coin on the Solana network. Behind it sits only the TRUMP token, although the gap is narrowing rapidly. While momentum remains robust, technical caution indicators are emerging. RSI is nearing overbought territory, and FARTCOIN’s price is pressing against the upper edge of its Bollinger Bands, often a sign that a cooling-off period could be imminent. Meanwhile, Bonk is staging a comeback of its own . Rising 8% to $0.00001366 with trading volume more than doubling to $165.77 million, Bonk is pressing against key resistance at $0.000014. Should it break out, a move toward $0.00001565 or beyond is likely, according to current price predictions. Additionally, smart money movements are further strengthening FARTCOIN’s bullish outlook. A smart trader who made $4.9M on $Fartcoin spent 563K $USDT to buy 488K $Fartcoin again in the past hour and now holds 2.12M $Fartcoin ($2.48M). This trader first aped into $Fartcoin when its market cap was $32M, making $4.9M by buying low and selling high.… pic.twitter.com/pTuUvewFnL — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 28, 2025 According to Lookonchain, a trader who previously turned a $32 million market cap buy into a $4.9 million profit has reinvested heavily, purchasing 488,000 FARTCOIN for 563,000 USDT. This trader now holds 2.12 million FARTCOIN valued at $2.48 million, showing strong conviction and the potential for further price appreciation. In all, FARTCOIN’s blend of technical strength, on-chain accumulation, smart money backing, and meme coin narrative momentum paints an exciting picture. While risks of short-term volatility remain, the mid- to long-term outlook appears firmly tilted in favor of the bulls, setting the stage for what could be FARTCOIN’s most explosive rally yet.

The company announced earlier today that it is working with Fireblocks, a leading Ethereum infrastructure provider, to build a new tool allowing asset managers to tokenize any fund on its platform. Calastone and Fireblocks To Expand with Blockchain Integration According to the announcement, Calastone has decided to integrate Fireblocks’ blockchain infrastructure into its system. The integration will allow Calastone to connect with Web3-native distributors and offer fund tokenization. Calastone will still handle key business functions like issuing funds, running administration, and ensuring compliance with the rules. Fireblocks will provide the tool’s blockchain “backbone.” Users can deploy Calastone smart contracts on popular blockchains like Ethereum (ETH) and Polygon (POL). In a recent statement, Ana Santillan, head of EMEA financial institutions at Fireblocks, said this initiative is a big step forward and a “textbook example” of how crypto can remove old, slow processes. Tokenization Sees Growing Interest Calastone’s move comes as more big players explore the potential of tokenization. Major industry players like BlackRock, Janus Henderson, JPMorgan, and Ondo Finace are already working on projects in this area. This comes as tokenization can make financial services faster, cheaper, and more transparent. It also makes it easier to trade assets across different markets and systems. Tokenization could change how private loans, government bonds, and other financial products are managed. According to an on-chain platform, the total value of tokenized assets, including dollar-backed stablecoins, is currently worth $21.61 billion. Last October, a report from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) predicted that Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization could reach over $600 billion in assets under management (AUM) by 2030. This shows that tokenized assets are seen as a transformative force and are becoming an important part of the financial market. By working with Fireblocks, Calastone aims to connect traditional financial markets with blockchain technology. The company also plans to maintain strong standards in compliance, security, and operations while reaching a new group of digital-first investors. Calastone’s Role in Financial Services Calastone, based in London, has been helping financial companies since 2007. The contract offers services like sending orders, handling payments, and reporting financial information for big organizations. Calastone also helps move mutual funds, money market funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Its network connects over 4,500 companies, including fund managers, service providers, and sellers. With its new partnership with Fireblocks, Calastone is getting ready to connect traditional finance with blockchain markets.

Standard Chartered estimates a Bitcoin price target in the $110,000–$120,000 zone by Q2 2025. Positive funding rates point to a potential long squeeze to $90,500. Bitcoin’s (BTC) weekly close near $94,000 delivered an impressive year-over-year total return of 53.61%. Since the last halving in 2024, the market has shifted from the early 2024 euphoric phase to a ""mature bull trend"" based on onchain growth, rather than speculative frenzy. Bitcoin fundamentals triumph over fear and speculation Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. pointed out that the year-on-year (YoY) realized price, a measure of the average price at which BTC was last moved, has surged 61.82%, outperforming the YoY market value to realized value’s (MVRV) decline of 8.98%. This indicates long-term holders are raising the base price faster than speculative price increases, a healthy signal for the cycle. The negative MVRV suggests that Bitcoin is trading below its fundamental value compared to a year ago, a pattern that precedes significant rallies. This compression of value leaves room for further upside, with analysts eyeing new highs above $110,000 if demand accelerates. Bitcoin valuation and price comparison chart.

Kendrick noted that a high US Treasury term premium, correlating with BTC’s price, and time-of-day trading patterns indicate US investors are seeking non-US assets since President Donald Trump’s trade war began on April 2.

Senator Josh Hawley reintroduced the legislation, which he claims will curb potential conflicts of interest among elected officials. Josh Hawley pushes for the ‘Pelosi Act’ Senator Josh Hawley is having a second go at banning members of Congress and their partners from trading stocks while in office by reintroducing the “PELOSI Act.” The legislation has gained renewed support in recent weeks since Hawley first introduced it in January 2023. The Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments (PELOSI) Act stalled under President Joe Biden’s administration for no specified reason. The former President refused to comment or act on the controversial topic during the majority of his term. The PELOSI legislation seeks to restrict members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. According to the bill, any such holdings owned by the affected parties should be stripped or placed into a blind trust within six months of assuming office. The bill specifically targets individual stock ownership and allows exceptions for diversified investments such as mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and U.S. Treasury bonds . The PELOSI Act is named after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose husband, Paul Pelosi, faced scrutiny over significant stock trades. One particularly notable transaction involved semiconductor stocks shortly before Congress took action on industry subsidies. The Pelosis have so far denied any wrongdoing, but the incident raised calls for stricter regulations on financial activities by lawmakers.​ Hawley’s proposal in 2023 also included the intention to amend the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 and reinforce the prohibition against using nonpublic information for private profit. Under the proposed legislation, any profits derived from stock trading by lawmakers would be returned to American taxpayers.​ Presidential support for the Pelosi Act Former President Joe Biden previously expressed his support for banning stock trading by sitting members of Congress. In a statement made a month before the end of his presidential term, he said, on the “more perfect union” podcast, that nobody in Congress should be able to make money in the stock market while they are elected. “I don’t know how you look your constituents in the eye and know because of the job they gave you, gave you an inside track to make more money. I think we should be changing the law,” he continued The current President Donald Trump also made his support of the movement known last week by endorsing the idea of banning congressional stock trading in an interview with Time magazine. “I watched Nancy Pelosi get rich through insider information, and I would be okay with it. If they send that to me, I would do it,” Trump said when asked about the proposal. When pressed by the reporter who asked, “You’ll sign it?” Trump responded, “Absolutely.” Trump’s endorsement could give Hawley’s bill an important political boost, particularly among Republicans who have been hesitant to pick a side on the topic. Democrats have also become increasingly vocal about the need for change. Last week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries vocalized his support for a stock trading ban for members of Congress. Calls for reform have been building for years. Multiple bipartisan bills have been introduced since 2020 to either restrict or outright ban congressional stock trading. Conducted polls also consistently show that a large majority of Americans would support such a ban, but disagreements over the scope of the rules and how they would be enforced have stalled the progress. Several Democrats and Republicans have introduced alternative proposals, some of which differ from the PELOSI Act by allowing lawmakers to retain their existing stock holdings under blind trusts rather than forcing them to divest completely once they enter office. Hawley’s approach is among the strictest and the most direct. By explicitly banning both trading and ownership of individual stocks, the PELOSI Act would close loopholes and remove any temptation or appearance of impropriety, according to his argument.

After a strong recovery from the $1,400 level earlier this month, bulls have managed to stabilize price action, but the real challenge is now unfolding. To confirm a sustainable bullish structure, Ethereum must decisively reclaim the $2,000 level in the coming days. Related Reading: Solana Will Face A Pivotal Moment In May – Bear Market Bounce Or Bull Market Dip? Market sentiment remains cautious as Ethereum consolidates below resistance while macroeconomic uncertainty continues to weigh on risk assets. Top crypto analyst Big Cheds shared insights on X, highlighting a technical concern: Ethereum is displaying a 4-hour bear divergence on the On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator, along with an upper shadow structure. With volatility expected to rise and traders closely watching for a breakout or breakdown, the coming sessions could define Ethereum’s trend for the next several weeks. Bulls need to act quickly to maintain momentum and prevent bears from regaining control. Ethereum Battles Resistance As Bulls Try To Keep Control Ethereum is starting to show early signs of a bullish structure on low time frames, giving bulls hope for a broader recovery. After pushing from the $1,400 local low, ETH has managed to hold above key moving averages and consolidate within a tight range. However, the market remains highly cautious, and selling pressure could increase quickly if bulls fail to reclaim higher levels. Momentum has shifted in Ethereum’s favor over the past few days, and several analysts are calling for a potential massive breakout if key resistance levels are breached. A confirmed breakout above $1,850 could open the door for a swift move back to the $2,000 psychological level. Nevertheless, risks remain elevated, and an opposing bearish view suggests that Ethereum could revisit the $1,300 zone if bulls lose control. Ched’s critical insights point out that Ethereum is forming a 4-hour bearish divergence on the On-Balance Volume (OBV) indicator. This, combined with the appearance of an upper shadow on local structure, signals weakening buying pressure. According to Cheds, a short position could be triggered if Ethereum loses the $1,750 support zone, which would confirm a breakdown from the current consolidation pattern.

Technical Details: Key Levels To Change Structure Ethereum is trading at $1,815 after days of tight consolidation and modest upward movement. Bulls have managed to defend the $1,750-$1,800 support range, but the real test remains ahead. To shift the broader bearish structure into a confirmed bullish trend, Ethereum must reclaim the $2,100 level. Without this breakout, any rallies are likely to be seen as temporary relief within a broader downtrend. Holding above the $1,800 level is critical in the coming days. A firm base above this zone would help build strong demand and create the conditions needed for a sustained recovery rally. Bulls are gaining some short-term momentum, but they still face a market clouded by macroeconomic uncertainty and cautious sentiment.

A recent development poised to accelerate this trend, particularly in the burgeoning markets of the Middle East and Asia, is the strategic alliance between the Stacks (STX) Asia DLT Foundation and Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). This partnership is a critical step towards fostering greater Bitcoin adoption Middle East and beyond, aiming to build a robust ecosystem for digital assets. For those watching the digital asset space, especially in regions showing increasing interest and regulatory clarity, this collaboration signals a powerful commitment to advancing the use of Bitcoin beyond simple speculation. It’s not just about individual investors; the focus is squarely on enabling large-scale, institutional participation. What is the Significance of the Stacks ADGM Partnership? At its core, the Stacks ADGM partnership is designed to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the innovative world of decentralized technologies built on Bitcoin. ADGM, known as a leading international financial centre situated in Abu Dhabi, has been proactive in establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for virtual assets. This makes it a prime location for fostering growth in the digital asset space. The Stacks Asia DLT Foundation, on the other hand, represents a layer of technology built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications without modifying Bitcoin itself. This unique position allows developers and institutions to leverage Bitcoin’s security and stability while building complex financial instruments and applications. The synergy between ADGM’s regulatory environment and Stacks’ technological capabilities creates a fertile ground for innovation. The partnership specifically targets several key areas: Promoting Institutional Adoption: Making it easier and safer for large financial institutions to engage with Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based assets. Educational Initiatives: Providing resources and programs to educate institutions, developers, and the public about the potential of Bitcoin and Stacks. Supporting the Developer Ecosystem: Fostering the growth of developers building applications on Stacks, thereby expanding the utility of Bitcoin. This strategic alliance is not merely symbolic; it represents a tangible effort to build the infrastructure and understanding necessary for digital assets to integrate with the global financial system, starting with a strong focus on the Middle East and Asia. Why is ADGM a Key Player in Crypto Regulation? Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) has emerged as a frontrunner in establishing a clear and robust framework for virtual assets. Recognizing the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, ADGM has taken a progressive stance, aiming to attract crypto businesses and talent to the region. Their regulatory approach is often cited as one of the most comprehensive globally, providing much-needed clarity and confidence for institutions and startups alike. The ADGM crypto regulation framework covers various aspects, including licensing, custody, exchange operations, and anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) requirements. This level of regulatory certainty is crucial for attracting traditional financial institutions, which operate under strict compliance mandates. By partnering with ADGM, Stacks gains access to a jurisdiction that understands and supports the growth of regulated digital asset activities. ADGM’s commitment to fostering innovation while maintaining regulatory integrity makes it an ideal partner for initiatives aimed at Institutional Bitcoin adoption . Institutions require assurances regarding legal compliance, asset security, and market integrity, all of which ADGM’s framework seeks to provide. This partnership leverages ADGM’s reputation as a trusted financial centre to build confidence in Bitcoin and Stacks-based applications among a wider audience. How Does Stacks Enable Bitcoin Adoption? Stacks is unique in the blockchain space because it aims to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications to Bitcoin, the most secure and decentralized blockchain network. While Bitcoin is primarily designed as a store of value and peer-to-peer electronic cash, it doesn’t natively support complex smart contracts like Ethereum or other platforms. The Stacks DLT Foundation supports the development and growth of the Stacks network, which operates as a layer built on top of Bitcoin. It uses a unique consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Transfer (PoX), which is tied to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work. This allows Stacks transactions and smart contract executions to be settled on the Bitcoin blockchain, inheriting its security guarantees. This technical architecture is vital for enabling Institutional Bitcoin adoption . Institutions are inherently risk-averse and prioritize security above all else. By building on Stacks, they can develop applications such as lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and security token platforms that are secured by the robustness of the Bitcoin network itself. This significantly reduces the counterparty risk and security concerns often associated with other blockchain platforms. Think of it this way: Bitcoin is the foundational layer, the digital gold standard. Stacks acts as the operating system that allows complex programs (smart contracts and dApps) to run securely on that foundation. This opens up a vast array of possibilities for financial innovation directly tied to the most secure digital asset. Driving Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: What Does it Mean? Institutional Bitcoin adoption refers to the increasing engagement of large financial entities – such as asset managers, hedge funds, pension funds, corporations, and banks – with Bitcoin and related digital assets. This is a significant shift from the early days of crypto, which were dominated by retail investors. Why is institutional adoption important? Increased Liquidity: Institutions bring substantial capital, increasing market depth and reducing volatility. Validation and Legitimacy: Their participation signals that digital assets are maturing and becoming a recognized asset class. Development of Infrastructure: Institutions demand sophisticated tools and services (custody, trading platforms, research), which drives the development of robust market infrastructure. Wider Accessibility: As institutions offer crypto products (like ETFs or managed funds), it becomes easier for more people to gain exposure. The Stacks ADGM partnership directly addresses the needs of institutions. By providing a regulated environment (ADGM) and a secure platform for building sophisticated applications on Bitcoin (Stacks), the collaboration lowers the barriers to entry for large players. Educational initiatives will further help demystify the technology and regulatory landscape for these entities. How Will This Partnership Boost Bitcoin Adoption in the Middle East and Asia? The Middle East and Asia are regions experiencing rapid economic growth and increasing technological adoption. Countries within these regions are exploring digital transformation across various sectors, including finance. This creates a fertile ground for accelerated Bitcoin adoption Middle East and across Asia. Here’s how the partnership can contribute: Regulatory Certainty: ADGM’s clear regulatory framework provides a safe harbor for businesses and investors, encouraging participation. Regional Hub: Positioning ADGM as a hub for Bitcoin and Stacks innovation can attract talent, startups, and investment to the region. Tailored Solutions: By supporting developers building on Stacks, the partnership can foster the creation of applications and services specifically tailored to the needs and preferences of markets in the Middle East and Asia. Knowledge Transfer: Educational programs can disseminate knowledge about Bitcoin and Stacks, building a skilled workforce and informed investor base. Cross-Border Collaboration: The partnership facilitates connections between players in ADGM and the broader Asian market, promoting cross-border digital asset activities. While the initial focus appears to be centered around ADGM, the influence of this partnership is expected to ripple outwards, encouraging similar developments and increasing overall Bitcoin adoption Asia . As institutions and businesses in the region see successful examples and benefit from clearer regulatory guidance originating from a reputable hub like ADGM, they are more likely to explore digital asset opportunities themselves. Exploring the Benefits of the Stacks ADGM Collaboration This partnership brings a multitude of benefits to various stakeholders: Stakeholder Key Benefits Institutions Access to regulated environment (ADGM), secure platform for Bitcoin-based assets (Stacks), educational resources, potential for new financial products. Developers Support and resources for building on Stacks, access to a growing ecosystem, potential for funding and partnerships, building on Bitcoin’s security. Retail Investors Increased market liquidity, potential for more regulated and accessible investment products over time, greater confidence in the ecosystem. ADGM/Abu Dhabi Reinforced position as a leading financial and FinTech hub, attraction of global talent and investment, fostering innovation in the local economy. Stacks Ecosystem Increased adoption and usage of the Stacks network, expansion into new markets (Middle East/Asia), validation of the technology’s potential for institutional use. Bitcoin Network Increased utility and demand as a base layer for complex applications, strengthening its position beyond just a store of value. These benefits highlight the comprehensive nature of the partnership, aiming to create a win-win scenario for everyone involved in advancing the digital asset space in the region. What Challenges Might This Partnership Face? While the outlook is largely positive, it’s important to acknowledge that challenges exist in any pioneering initiative. The path to widespread Institutional Bitcoin adoption and broader digital asset integration is not without hurdles. Potential challenges include: Regulatory Evolution: While ADGM has a strong framework, the global regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving. Keeping pace with international standards and ensuring interoperability can be complex. Education Gap: Despite educational efforts, there remains a significant knowledge gap within traditional finance regarding blockchain technology, Bitcoin, and Stacks. Bridging this gap effectively requires sustained effort. Technical Complexity: Building and integrating complex financial applications on a blockchain layer like Stacks requires specialized skills and understanding, which may not be readily available in all institutions. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of Bitcoin and other digital assets can be a deterrent for risk-averse institutions, although this is less about the partnership itself and more about the asset class. Competition: Other jurisdictions and technologies are also vying for leadership in the digital asset space, creating a competitive environment. Overcoming these challenges will require continuous collaboration, adaptation, and a long-term perspective. The success of the partnership will depend on its ability to effectively address these issues and build trust within the financial community. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you are an investor, a developer, or part of a financial institution, the Stacks ADGM partnership has implications worth considering. For Investors: Keep an eye on developments coming out of ADGM and the Stacks ecosystem. Increased institutional activity in the region could influence market dynamics. Understanding Stacks (STX) as an asset connected to Bitcoin’s utility layer could be valuable. For Developers: If you’re interested in building decentralized applications, explore the Stacks network and the Clarity smart contract language. The partnership signifies potential growth and support for developers focusing on Bitcoin-secured applications, particularly with a view towards the Middle East and Asian markets. Look out for potential grants, hackathons, or educational programs announced through this collaboration. For Financial Institutions: This partnership provides a clear signal that regulated digital asset activity is gaining traction in key financial hubs. Explore ADGM’s regulatory framework and the capabilities of the Stacks network. Engaging with the educational initiatives could be a valuable first step in understanding how to safely and compliantly participate in the digital asset space, particularly regarding Institutional Bitcoin adoption . This collaboration is paving the way for future innovation, and staying informed is key to navigating the evolving landscape. A Powerful Catalyst for Bitcoin’s Future The partnership between the Stacks DLT Foundation and ADGM is more than just a news headline; it’s a significant strategic move designed to accelerate the integration of Bitcoin into the global financial system, with a specific focus on unlocking its potential for institutions in the Middle East and Asia. By combining ADGM’s forward-thinking regulatory environment with Stacks’ innovative technology for building on Bitcoin, this collaboration addresses key barriers to Institutional Bitcoin adoption , including regulatory uncertainty and the lack of robust application layers directly tied to Bitcoin’s security. The emphasis on education and developer support is equally crucial, laying the groundwork for a sustainable ecosystem. As this partnership progresses, we can expect to see increased clarity, more sophisticated applications, and ultimately, a significant boost in Bitcoin adoption Middle East and across the broader Asian markets. This initiative is a powerful catalyst, potentially shaping the future of finance in one of the world’s most dynamic regions.

To read full editions, subscribe . Crypto investment products notched net inflows of $3.4 billion from April 21-25, a CoinShares report highlighted — the largest influx since December and the third-biggest weekly haul ever. Nearly $3.1 billion went into US spot bitcoin ETFs, according to Farside Investors data . Their Ethereum counterparts got some love too, as the $183 million of net inflows broke an eight-week outflow streak. “We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the US dollar are the reasons investors have turned towards digital assets, which are being seen as an emerging safe haven,” CoinShares’ James Butterfill noted. The key word is “emerging,” as bitcoin more recently decoupled from tech stocks (at least temporarily). BTC was trading around $94,130 at 2 pm ET — up 10.5% from a week ago. It’s difficult to sort out which type of investors these inflows are coming from. Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas noted the speed at which the bitcoin ETF inflows picked up in an X post , adding: “Prob some is basis trade back in effect, that’s the fast money that tends to come in and out [with] price.” He’s referring to hedge funds seeking to profit from the “basis spread” — the difference between BTC’s futures and spot prices. We do know from Q1 13F filings that hedge funds represent ~37% of the spot bitcoin ETP assets under management (AUM) that is held by professional investors. Outside this pro investor cohort that discloses BTC holdings in filings, however, are individual investors and smaller financial advisors that also represent “a significant portion” of the investment activity we’re seeing, Bitwise research head Ryan Rasmussen told me. “Given that, I’d assume the flows this week were primarily driven by long-term investors and a less meaningful portion was driven by hedge funds deploying the basis trade,” he added. And separately (but ETF-related), two quick clarifications as some XRP product headlines might be misleading readers: First, the proposed XRP funds by ProShares are futures-based offerings, not spot. Also, a ProShares spokesperson told me that while some have reported those going live on Wednesday, the firm has no plans to launch them then. Keep in mind, too, that CME Group isn’t set to introduce XRP futures contracts until May 19. You know we’ll offer any important crypto ETF updates to you when we have them.

With resistance mounting and volume fading, price action remains stuck in a rotational environment. A breakout or breakdown will set the tone for the next major move, but for now, the market remains constricted. Sonic ( S ) token’s price action has been confined within a clearly defined range, with a steady lack of momentum keeping traders cautious. Despite minor fluctuations, volume remains low, and key resistances continue to suppress any breakout attempts. This article will explore the current technical structure, key resistance and support levels, and the potential scenarios that could trigger the next trend. Key technical points Price action is stuck within a well-defined range with a high and low boundary. Major resistance includes the VWAP SR, 0.618 Fibonacci level, and value area high. A loss of the midpoint could trigger a cascade toward untapped liquidity below. SUSDT (1D) Chart Source: TradingView For 48 consecutive days, Sonic has consolidated within a range, creating clearly defined highs and lows. Until price breaks this structure, consolidation is expected to persist. Above the current levels, resistance remains heavy, with VWAP SR, the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement, and the value area high all aligning. Price remains suppressed below these resistances, reinforcing the likelihood of continued range-bound action. Volume remains steadily below average, another critical factor suggesting prolonged consolidation. Without a significant influx of volume, price is unlikely to escape the current range. Presently, Sonic is hovering around the midpoint of the range. Losing this midpoint would significantly increase the chances of a cascading move downward, targeting untapped liquidity pools and lower support levels. You might also like: Bitcoin faces crucial resistance as bearish shark harmonic looms The bearish scenario centers around this potential cascade: a break below the midpoint could trigger sharp downside moves as liquidity is swept. Conversely, the bullish case would require a strong reclaim of the VWAP SR resistance, confirmed by multiple closing candles. This would likely spark a move back toward the range highs, where sellers could re-enter. What to expect in the coming price action As it stands, Sonic is likely to remain trapped within its 48-day range unless major volume enters the market. A strong reclaim of the VWAP SR would strengthen the bullish case, setting up a push toward the range highs. However, a failure to hold the midpoint will likely trigger a liquidity hunt and deeper downside targets. Until a decisive breakout occurs, expect more rotational price action within the established boundaries.

Major global developments, particularly significant Geopolitical Events , can have a profound and sometimes unpredictable Crypto Market Impact . Recently, a notable announcement from Russia regarding the ongoing Russia Ukraine Conflict has captured international attention, raising questions about potential shifts in global stability and, by extension, financial markets, including crypto. Understanding the Victory Day Ceasefire Announcement According to reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced a temporary Victory Day Ceasefire . This pause in hostilities is intended to commemorate the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, a significant date observed in Russia. The announced ceasefire is expected to run from midnight on May 7–8 until midnight on May 10–11. Here are the key details: What: A temporary ceasefire announced by Russia. When: From midnight May 7–8 to midnight May 10–11. Why: To mark the 80th anniversary of Victory Day. Request to Ukraine: The Kremlin has reportedly urged Ukraine to also declare a ceasefire for the same period. While this announcement is primarily a development in the Russia Ukraine Conflict , its implications ripple outwards, influencing global sentiment and potentially contributing to Market Volatility across various asset classes. Why Geopolitical Events Matter for Crypto Cryptocurrencies, while often seen as decentralized and independent of traditional financial systems, are not immune to global political and economic forces. Here’s why Geopolitical Events like the Russia Ukraine Conflict can influence the Crypto Market Impact : Risk Sentiment: Major conflicts or geopolitical tensions increase global uncertainty. This often leads investors to move away from perceived ‘riskier’ assets, which can include cryptocurrencies, towards safer havens like gold or certain fiat currencies. Conversely, signs of de-escalation, like a ceasefire, could potentially improve risk sentiment. Economic Sanctions and Policies: Geopolitical events can trigger international sanctions, capital controls, or changes in monetary policy. These measures can affect liquidity, access to exchanges, and the overall economic environment in which crypto operates. Supply Chain and Energy Impacts: Conflicts can disrupt global supply chains and impact energy prices, leading to inflation or recessionary fears. These macroeconomic factors significantly influence investor behavior and market liquidity, directly affecting the Crypto Market Impact . Adoption and Use Cases: In times of conflict or economic instability, cryptocurrencies can see increased use for capital flight, remittances, or as a store of value, particularly in affected regions. This can drive demand but also attract regulatory scrutiny. Narrative and News Flow: Geopolitical news dominates headlines, shifting focus and capital away from other sectors, including crypto. Positive or negative developments can create rapid shifts in narrative, fueling Market Volatility . Potential Crypto Market Impact of the Victory Day Ceasefire The announcement of a temporary Victory Day Ceasefire introduces a new variable into the complex equation of the Crypto Market Impact . How might this specific development play out? It’s crucial to note that market reactions are rarely straightforward and depend on numerous factors, including: Compliance by Both Sides: Will both Russia and Ukraine fully adhere to the ceasefire? A breakdown could lead to increased uncertainty and negative market reaction. Market Interpretation: Do investors see this as a genuine step towards de-escalation or merely a temporary pause for symbolic reasons? Broader Economic Context: How does this news interact with existing macroeconomic pressures like inflation, interest rates, or recession fears? Other Global Events: Is anything else happening concurrently that might overshadow or amplify this news? Given these variables, potential market reactions could include: Scenario Potential Market Reaction (Crypto) Reasoning Ceasefire Holds & Seen Positively Cautious positive sentiment, potential minor price uplift, reduced Market Volatility temporarily. Reduced immediate geopolitical risk, perceived step towards stability. Ceasefire Breaks Down or Not Observed Increased uncertainty, potential price drop, heightened Market Volatility . Failure to de-escalate increases risk premium, negative sentiment. Ceasefire Seen as Symbolic/Insignificant Minimal or no significant reaction, focus remains on other factors. Market discounts the announcement if not seen as leading to lasting peace. This specific Victory Day Ceasefire is short-lived, suggesting its direct, long-term impact on the Crypto Market Impact might be limited unless it signals a more significant shift in the Russia Ukraine Conflict dynamics. Challenges and Uncertainties While any talk of a ceasefire might seem positive on the surface, the reality of the Russia Ukraine Conflict presents significant challenges and uncertainties that temper optimism and contribute to ongoing Market Volatility . Trust Deficit: There is a deep lack of trust between the warring parties, making any agreement fragile. Limited Duration: A three-day ceasefire is a brief pause, not a resolution. Lack of Broader Agreement: This is a unilateral announcement (with a request), not a negotiated agreement on broader peace terms. Humanitarian Concerns: Even during a ceasefire, humanitarian situations remain critical, and access might still be limited. These factors mean that while the Victory Day Ceasefire is a noteworthy event, it doesn’t necessarily signal an end to the underlying tensions or the associated Crypto Market Impact from the broader Russia Ukraine Conflict . Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the potential for Geopolitical Events to influence the Crypto Market Impact and drive Market Volatility , what should crypto investors consider? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep track of major global events, not just crypto-specific news. Understand how macroeconomics and geopolitics can affect risk assets. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Geopolitical uncertainty increases market risk. Ensure your portfolio allocation aligns with your comfort level for potential downturns. Consider Diversification: While diversification within crypto is common, also consider how crypto fits into your overall investment portfolio alongside other asset classes that might react differently to geopolitical shifts. Avoid Emotional Reactions: Rapid news cycles around conflicts can trigger fear or euphoria. Stick to your investment plan and avoid impulsive decisions based on short-term news. Long-Term Perspective: For many investors, crypto is a long-term play. While Geopolitical Events cause short-term fluctuations, the long-term thesis for blockchain technology and digital assets may remain unchanged. The Victory Day Ceasefire serves as a reminder that external factors significantly shape the investment landscape, including the world of crypto. Navigating the Crypto Market Impact of the ongoing Russia Ukraine Conflict requires vigilance and a comprehensive understanding of global dynamics. Summary: Navigating Geopolitical Ripples in Crypto The announcement of a temporary Victory Day Ceasefire by Russia in the Russia Ukraine Conflict highlights the undeniable link between Geopolitical Events and their potential Crypto Market Impact .

UAE First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), IHC, and ADQ sovereign investor will be launching a new AED-backed stablecoin regulated by the UAE Central Bank. The AED stablecoin will be issued by FAB. The trio aim to make payments locally and internationally easier. The AED stablecoin is designed to enable payment for the world where identity, governance and value flow freely, securely, and verifiably. As per the press release, the AED stablecoin will also support emerging digital use cases such as machine-to-machine and AI. Hana Al Rostamani, Group Chief Executive Officer of FAB, also stated that the new stablecoins will make a significant impact across industries and could revolutionize the use of trusted blockchain payments for UAE consumers and businesses. The FAB AED stablecoin will be built on ADI Blockchain The new stablecoin will operate on the ADI blockchain, developed in the UAE by the ADI Foundation. The network will provide a compliant distribution network for blockchain payments. ADI Foundation connects established financial systems with next-generation blockchain technology to create real-world impact, allowing citizens of emerging countries to compete and operate on a global scale, which previously would have been impossible. ADI Foundation already has strategic partnerships with governments in over 20 countries. The ADI Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping governments connect with trusted partners to advance digital transformation and blockchain adoption worldwide. Rooted in Abu Dhabi, the Foundation leverages its $120 million fund and a global network of partners to deliver blockchain solutions that enhance trust, transparency, and efficiency in key sectors such as healthcare, financial systems, sustainability, and governance.

43915144,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153258,1745869844,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Ethereum Foundation Provides Crucial Clarity on EOF’s Future: It’s Fusaka, Not Pectra",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-eof-clarification/,"Confusion can sometimes swirl within the dynamic world of cryptocurrency development, especially concerning major network upgrades. Recently, discussions around the Ethereum network and its future enhancements led to some uncertainty regarding the inclusion of the EVM Object Format (EOF) in upcoming hard forks. Fortunately, the Ethereum Foundation has stepped in to provide much-needed clarity, ensuring the community and developers are aligned on the path forward. Why the Confusion Around the Pectra Upgrade and EOF? The Ethereum community is always anticipating the next major network upgrade. The upcoming one, known as the Pectra upgrade (a portmanteau of Prague and Electra), is on the horizon. Initially, there might have been speculation or misinterpretation regarding which specific proposals, known as Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs), would be bundled into this significant hard fork. One particular EIP set causing discussion is the EVM Object Format (EOF), a collection of proposals aimed at improving the structure and validation of smart contract code on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Given the technical nature and potential impact of EOF on how smart contracts are written and executed, its inclusion in a major upgrade is a significant point of interest for developers. The debate about its readiness, complexity, and integration timeline is ongoing within the core development community. The key clarification came from Ethereum Foundation Co-Executive Director Tomasz K. Stańczak, who took to social media platform X to address the swirling rumors directly. Setting the Record Straight: EOF Belongs to Fusaka Upgrade Tomasz K. Stańczak’s message was clear and concise: the ongoing debate surrounding the EVM Object Format (EOF) is specifically tied to the planning for the Fusaka upgrade , not the imminent Pectra upgrade. This distinction is crucial for managing expectations and development efforts within the ecosystem. He explicitly stated that the Pectra upgrade, which was anticipated around May 7th (though hard fork dates can sometimes shift slightly), neither includes nor has plans to include EOF. This confirms that the scope of Pectra is focused on other important EIPs that have been finalized and deemed ready for deployment. Stańczak further clarified the tentative timeline for the Fusaka upgrade, indicating it is currently scheduled for the third or fourth quarter of the year. This later timeline provides more room for the complex discussions, refinements, and testing required for a substantial change like the EVM Object Format . What Does This Mean for the Upcoming Ethereum Upgrade (Pectra)? With EOF confirmed to be excluded, the Pectra upgrade’s scope becomes clearer. While the exact list of EIPs included in Pectra is subject to final confirmation by core developers, it is expected to build upon previous upgrades like Dencun, focusing on improvements related to staking, the EVM, and potentially other network efficiencies. The exclusion of EOF means developers don’t need to prepare for those specific code format changes for the May hard fork, allowing them to focus on the EIPs that are part of Pectra. The importance of this clarification lies in preventing unnecessary work or confusion. Developers building on Ethereum rely on accurate information about upcoming protocol changes to ensure their smart contracts, dApps, and infrastructure remain compatible and secure. Knowing that EOF is not part of Pectra allows them to allocate resources effectively. Understanding the EVM Object Format (EOF) and Why It Matters So, what exactly is the EVM Object Format (EOF) and why is there so much discussion around it? At its core, EOF is a proposed standard for structuring smart contract code on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Think of it as giving smart contracts a more defined and verifiable structure, similar to how different file formats (like PDF or JPEG) have specific structures that allow software to interpret them correctly. Key aspects and potential benefits of implementing EOF include: Improved Code Validation: EOF allows for static analysis of code before deployment, catching certain types of errors early. Version Control: It introduces versioning for contract code, making future upgrades or changes potentially easier to manage. Enhanced Security: By enforcing structure and enabling better validation, EOF can help reduce certain classes of vulnerabilities. Potential for Future Optimizations: A standardized format can pave the way for more efficient execution or analysis tools in the future. However, implementing EOF is a significant undertaking. It requires changes to the EVM itself and affects how smart contracts are compiled and deployed. This complexity is why it’s undergoing extensive debate and requires ample time for specification, testing, and community feedback before being included in a major Ethereum upgrade like Fusaka. Looking Ahead: The Road to Fusaka Upgrade With EOF now firmly placed in the scope of the Fusaka upgrade , the focus for this later hard fork (tentatively Q3/Q4) will likely include these foundational changes to the EVM. The time between Pectra and Fusaka will be crucial for core developers, client teams, and the wider community to finalize the EOF specifications, conduct rigorous testing, and prepare for the transition. This phased approach to upgrades is typical for Ethereum, allowing complex changes to be tackled incrementally, reducing risk and providing the ecosystem time to adapt. The debate around EOF will continue, but it will now be framed within the context of the Fusaka timeline, allowing for a more focused and productive discussion. Why is Official Communication from the Ethereum Foundation So Important? In a decentralized ecosystem, clear and accurate communication from trusted entities like the Ethereum Foundation is paramount. Misinformation or confusion about upgrade scopes and timelines can lead to: Incorrect development priorities for dApp teams. Unnecessary anxiety or speculation within the community. Potential compatibility issues if developers prepare for changes that aren’t happening yet. Tomasz K. Stańczak’s clarification serves as a vital reminder for everyone involved in Ethereum – from developers and node operators to users and investors – to rely on official sources for information regarding protocol upgrades. Websites like the Ethereum Foundation blog, official core developer calls, and reputable news outlets covering verified statements are the best places to stay informed. Actionable Insight: Always cross-reference information about Ethereum upgrades with official announcements from the Ethereum Foundation or core development teams. Don’t rely solely on social media chatter unless it’s from a verified core team member clarifying a point. Summary: Clarity on the Upgrade Horizon The recent clarification from the Ethereum Foundation , specifically from Tomasz K. Stańczak, has successfully dispelled confusion surrounding the inclusion of the EVM Object Format (EOF) in upcoming Ethereum upgrades. By confirming that EOF is planned for the later Fusaka upgrade (tentatively Q3/Q4) and is explicitly not part of the near-term Pectra upgrade (around May 7), the Foundation has provided valuable clarity to the ecosystem. This allows developers to focus on the known scope of Pectra while providing ample time for the community to prepare for the significant, but later, changes associated with EOF in Fusaka. Staying informed through official channels remains the best way to navigate the exciting, yet complex, roadmap of Ethereum upgrade s.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/top-xrp-proponent-feels-a-great-reset-has-arrived-heres-the-significance/,"The idea of a “Great Reset” has long hovered at the edges of financial and political discourse, often discussed as a massive transformation of the global economic structure. Now, Edo Farina, a top XRP proponent and influential voice within the cryptocurrency community, has sparked fresh conversation by declaring on X that he feels the Great Reset has arrived. Farina’s statement comes at a time of significant changes within financial markets, growing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, and increasing discussions about the future of traditional banking systems. Farina’s sentiment taps into the growing feeling among many investors and analysts that the world is experiencing a fundamental shift, not just in monetary systems, but in how value, trust, and ownership are perceived globally. His assertion, while brief, signals a deeper reflection on the evolving role of cryptocurrencies like XRP amid global financial uncertainty. I have a feeling the GREAT RESET has arrived. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) April 28, 2025 What Is the Great Reset? The term “Great Reset” gained widespread attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially after it was promoted by the World Economic Forum (WEF) as a vision for rebuilding economies and societies more equitably and sustainably. However, outside of official channels, “Great Reset” has taken on a broader and often more skeptical meaning among independent analysts and crypto proponents. Many view it as an inevitable overhaul of the financial system — a shift away from traditional fiat currencies, centralized banking, and opaque governance, toward decentralized, transparent technologies powered by blockchain. For XRP advocates like Edo Farina, the Great Reset represents an opportunity for digital assets to take center stage. XRP, in particular, is seen by many as uniquely positioned due to its speed, low transaction costs, and focus on cross-border payments . Its growing integration into traditional finance, especially amid the legal victories Ripple has achieved over the past year, places XRP at the forefront of this changing landscape. Why Farina’s Statement Matters Edo Farina’s feeling that the Great Reset has arrived is significant not merely because of his prominence, but because it reflects a larger movement within the XRP community and the crypto space at large. As global financial systems grapple with inflation, increasing debt levels, geopolitical instability, and technological disruption, cryptocurrencies are no longer on the margins — they are becoming a critical part of financial conversations in boardrooms and government agencies alike. Farina’s remark suggests that key players in the XRP ecosystem believe the transformation is not something far off in the future, but something already underway. This perspective is reinforced by a series of recent developments: the SEC’s approval of crypto-related ETFs , the continued tokenization of real-world assets, the growing interest of central banks in launching digital currencies (CBDCs), and the broad push towards integrating blockchain technology into the core of financial infrastructures. Within this context, XRP’s role becomes even more relevant. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, XRP has long targeted financial institutions as its primary user base. Ripple’s technology already enables banks and payment providers to settle cross-border transactions efficiently. As the Great Reset redefines how institutions and individuals transfer value, XRP could serve as a vital bridge between traditional finance and the emerging digital economy. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Larger Implications for the Crypto Market Farina’s assertion can also be seen as a call to action for investors and stakeholders. If the Great Reset is indeed underway, the time to strategically position oneself is now. This sentiment aligns with a broader trend within the crypto community, where early movers are increasingly seeking exposure to projects and technologies likely to thrive in a reconfigured financial world. Moreover, as trust in traditional banking systems continues to erode, decentralized solutions are gaining traction. The growing realization that blockchain can offer greater transparency, security, and efficiency than legacy systems further accelerates this shift. XRP, with its proven use cases and regulatory advancements, stands among the digital assets best poised to capitalize on these changing dynamics. However, Farina’s feeling also carries a note of caution. A Great Reset implies upheaval as much as opportunity. Markets are likely to be volatile, regulatory landscapes will continue to evolve, and competition among digital assets will intensify. In such a transformative period, informed decision-making and a keen understanding of the macroeconomic environment will be crucial. A New Financial Era May Be Here Edo Farina’s belief that the Great Reset has arrived encapsulates the profound changes currently sweeping the financial world. While some may view such a statement as dramatic, the evidence increasingly points to a systemic shift in how value is stored, transferred, and managed globally. XRP, given its unique position in bridging traditional and digital finance, could be among the key beneficiaries of this transformation. As the Great Reset continues to unfold, staying informed and strategically engaged will be vital for investors, institutions, and innovators alike. If Farina’s instincts are correct, the new financial era is not a distant event on the horizon — it is already here, reshaping the future in real-time.

In an April 25 letter to Jamieson Greer, acting director of the US Office of Government Ethics (OGE), Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts and California Democratic Senator Adam Schiff requested that officials address concerns about Trump’s memecoin after the president announced a dinner and White House tour for some of the individuals who held the most TRUMP tokens. The two senators requested that Greer provide information on safeguards and guidelines related to whether foreign actors and others could buy political influence with the president, potentially impacting his policy positions and federal pardons. “President Trump’s announcement promises exclusive access to the presidency in exchange for significant investment in one of the President’s business ventures,” wrote the two senators. “In promising such access, this proposition may implicate several federal ethics laws and constitutional prohibitions, including the federal bribery statute and emoluments clauses of the US Constitution. It also raises the troubling prospect that foreign actors are using the memecoin as a vector to buy influence with President Trump and his associates without needing to disclose their identities publicly.” April 25 letter from Sens. Warren and Schiff to OGE. Source: Sen. Schiff The letter was sent the same day Warren reportedly expressed similar concerns about Trump’s potential conflicts of interest with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to an April 25 Reuters report, the Massachusetts senator urged SEC Chair Paul Atkins to ensure that oversight of Trump’s media company was “free from undue political interference and influence from the President and his administration.” Related: Trump’s WLFI crypto investments aren’t paying off Though ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, Warren does not have the authority to direct Congress’s agenda with Democrats in the minority. Two Democrats in the Senate and House of Representatives have already called for Trump’s impeachment over his memecoin dinner. Warren added: “The American people deserve the unwavering assurance that access to the presidency is not being offered for sale to the highest bidder in exchange for the President’s own financial gain.” At the time of publication, it was unclear who among the top TRUMP memecoin holders would attend the dinner, scheduled to be held on May 22 at Trump’s golf club in Washington, DC. Speculation and analysis of users suggested that Trump supporters, including Tron founder Justin Sun, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and others, could attend, though none had been confirmed as of April 28.

The CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization excluding memecoins, exchange coins and stablecoins — was roughly flat over the same time frame. Crypto stocks like Coinbase (COIN), Strategy (MSTR) and the miners were losing modest ground after big gains last week. Notable exceptions included Janover (JNVR) and DeFi Technologies (DFTF), ahead 24% and 6.5%, respectively even as SOL — the token which both companies are aggressively accumulating — fell about 3% during the U.S. day. Meanwhile, gold rose almost 1% and the dollar index fell 0.6%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq each peaked into the green late in the session after earlier dipping more than 1%.

The launch of XRP futures by CME Group has got everyone talking, this is a big step for XRP to get into mainstream derivatives trading. This comes after XRP related projects are getting more and more attention. Ripple is solidifying itself as a major player in the crypto space but while XRP is enjoying the moment, there’s another opportunity sweeping the blockchain world. Enter Ruvi AI , a project that combines blockchain and artificial intelligence to revolutionize industries and give investors unparalleled returns. While Ripple’s utility and adoption is impressive, Ruvi AI offers something XRP can’t match—a technology driven token and impressive ROI that smart investors can’t ignore. Ruvi AI’s Presale is a Huge Success Ruvi AI has got the attention of forward thinking investors and the presale had an explosive start. Over 10 million tokens were sold in just days, with more than $100,000 raised at a base price of $0.01 per token. This is more than a good start, this is a clear indication of the market’s belief in Ruvi AI’s vision and technology. The presale offers a lot of upside to early adopters. With a confirmed listing price of $0.07, early investors are already guaranteed an 600% return when Ruvi AI hits exchanges. But the real magic is in the long term growth potential especially if the forecasted token price of $1 or more becomes a reality. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out Unlike Ripple XRP’s focus on cross border payments and network expansion, Ruvi AI is taking blockchain to uncharted territories, using AI to solve real world inefficiencies. This is not just another speculative crypto token, it’s a full blown platform to deliver tangible value across multiple industries. Ruvi AI is combining AI and blockchain to provide tools that automate labor intensive tasks, enhance business efficiencies and even optimize analytics in healthcare, drug research and creative industries. The project is going to disrupt traditional workflows, so enterprises have the tools they need to thrive in a competitive landscape. Breaking Down Ruvi AI’s VIP Tier ROI One of Ruvi AI’s unique offerings is its VIP rewards system, to maximize returns for early investors. VIP Tier 3 is a prime example of these investor friendly benefits. Investing for example $1,000 during the presale, at a token price of $0.01, this is 100,000 tokens. Ruvi AI gives its participants a 60% bonus, so that’s another 60,000 tokens for a total of 160,000 tokens. At Ruvi AI’s confirmed listing price of $0.07, this investment would already be $11,200. That’s a 1,020% ROI for those who got in early. But the real potential becomes clear when you consider the projected token price of $1. At that level, your 160,000 tokens would be worth a life changing $160,000, that’s a 15,900% ROI. This structured approach, with transparency and massive growth potential, makes Ruvi AI one of the best investment opportunities in the crypto space today. Ripple vs Ruvi AI Ripple is setting milestones with the XRP futures launch and growing interest in the XRP ecosystem. But as impressive as Ripple’s progress is, it’s largely focused on payments, trading and DeFi. Ruvi AI is going outside the financial sector to provide applications that reach into healthcare automation, creative industries and business management. So Ruvi AI is not just an investment but a game changer in the blockchain world. A Revolutionary Opportunity Ripple’s XRP futures launch may attract traders looking to speculate on its price but for those looking for meaningful returns based on innovation and utility Ruvi AI is a much stronger case. Early adopters of the Ruvi AI presale will get not just immediate ROI but the long term impact of a project that will transform industries and deliver scalable value.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has powerfully exploded through its presale phase by securing $7,100,000 from sales of 421 million tokens to 9,000 different investors. The project exists in phase 4 of its development at $0.025 and continues to attract major interest due to its lending system and deliberate token economic structure. This investor chooses Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during its ongoing presale to secure launch and future price rises since they see potential in its $2.50 projected value. The team is busy performing a Certik audit as they provide information about their progress to their social media channels. Cardano’s steady climb The surge of $379 million ADA token removals during seven weeks underscores how investors strongly believe in this cryptocurrency. The ADA price pattern demonstrates a departure from symmetrical triangles while targeting a 27% growth beyond $0.64 while confronting resistance at $0.70. Bitcoin DeFi speculation connects Cardano to $10 price targets during the next ten years. ETF speculations bring extra speculation but the distant long-term outlook remains hazy. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enables current returns because phase 4 tokens are set to increase by 20% to $0.03 during phase 5 thus providing immediate gains to the first buyers. Solana’s scaling struggles Solana (SOL) keeps working to prove its high-performance credentials despite ongoing network performance issues. SOL’s trading value stagnates since it lacks the market-boosting factors which drive Cardano up. The focused DeFi lending structure of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides stable financial operations through loans secured by supplemental collateral. The project maintains a buy-and-distribute system that produces ongoing market demand while SOL depends on general market movements for its value. The fast-moving sales of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 4 has created an immediate need for people to join 9,000 holders before the presale reaches its limit at $0.06 listing price. Mutuum Finance’s meteoric rise The DeFi sector undergoes transformation through Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The current market price of Phase 4 stands at $0.025 while Phase 5 promises to increase it by 20% to $0.03 which will give a 20% profit bonus to current investors. The tokenomics ensure a 140% ROI at launch price $0.06 while analysts predict the token will reach $2.50 raising the value by 9000 percent. The new dashboard selects top 50 holders who receive bonus tokens as a loyalty reward. Phase 4 token decline creates intense FOMO pressure among investors. The combination of passive income from lending pools and mtToken products makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) an attractive yield generation platform. Sealing the deal Mutuum Finance (MUTM) surges ahead of Cardano’s DeFi estimates and Solana’s performance issues while delivering guaranteed gains. Project urgency is apparent because of the 140% launch gain combined with the projected $2.50 price and the current 9,000 holders. Phase 4 holders will soon face price increases because phase 5 approaches with a 20% price adjustment. Active investors seeking the top altcoin solution for the year 2025 need to hurry. Users should access Mutuum Finance’s website for official subscription to the presale before official price elevations occur. For this expert analyst, the choice is as clear as day. While both SOL and ADA enjoy the luxury of being well known and established tokens, none comes close to MUTM’s potential ROI of above 9,000%. If you are looking to maximise gains in 2025, the choice has never been more clear.

In a new video update , the host of InvestAnswers tells his 565,000 YouTube subscribers that the top crypto asset by market cap should outpace gold over the coming months, as he says the precious metal looks overextended following its parabolic rally to $3,500. “If you look at the steady correlation between Bitcoin and Nasdaq, it is extremely tight because Bitcoin is considered a risk asset, [while] gold is considered a risk-off asset. But here, if you look at the Bitcoin/gold correlation, it fluctuates very heavily. Half the time, not correlated; half the time, it is correlated. So there’s no signal of direct correlation and Bitcoin has already had a great post-halving, and in fact, we had hit a new all-time high before the halving, which has never happened before with Bitcoin. But its correlation with gold remains low. Now, if I look at this chart and just like a caveman would, what do I interpret? I expect the correlation to increase with gold as the broader dynamics of the market will shift as well. I also believe gold is overbought, so I see gold mean-reverting and I see Bitcoin going up versus gold over the next six months.” Source: The Rational Root/X InvestAnswers says a summarized interpretation of his analysis would be that the flagship digital asset is lagging behind gold and will start to outpace the precious metal during the next six months. BTC is trading for $93,870 at time of writing, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours while gold is valued at $3,283 per ounce, a marginal decrease on the day.

If so, a major new initiative just landed that could be exactly what you need. Crypto giant Coinbase is making a significant move in the United Kingdom, announcing a new accelerator program specifically designed for startups operating at the intersection of crypto and AI. This isn’t just another program; it’s a strategic collaboration aimed at fostering the next wave of innovation in two of the most transformative technologies of our time. What is This New Crypto Accelerator All About? Coinbase, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, isn’t going it alone. They’ve teamed up with impressive partners: Founders Factory, a renowned global network for founders; Animoca Brands, a major player in Web3 and gaming; and Fabric Ventures, a venture capital firm focused on decentralized technology. This powerful consortium is launching a 16-week program based in the UK. The core mission? To identify, nurture, and accelerate promising startups that are building solutions leveraging both blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. Think projects that use AI to enhance blockchain security, develop smarter decentralized applications (dApps), create AI-powered trading strategies, or build intelligent agents within Web3 environments. Why Focus on Both Crypto and AI? The convergence of blockchain and AI is seen by many as a key driver for future technological advancements. Blockchain offers decentralization, transparency, and security, while AI provides intelligence, automation, and predictive capabilities. Combining these can lead to powerful new applications across various sectors, from finance and supply chain to gaming and digital identity. This program acknowledges that the most groundbreaking innovations often occur at the edges of different fields. By specifically targeting startups bridging the gap between these two complex domains, the accelerator aims to cultivate solutions that might not emerge from single-focus programs. How Will the AI Accelerator Support Startups? Being accepted into this program offers substantial benefits for early-stage companies. The 16-week intensive curriculum is designed to provide comprehensive support across critical areas: Funding: Providing essential seed capital to help startups get off the ground or reach their next milestone. Business Strategy: Offering expert guidance on market positioning, business models, and growth hacking. Product Development: Assisting teams in refining their technology, user experience, and feature sets. Fundraising Assistance: Connecting startups with potential investors and helping them prepare for future funding rounds. Mentorship & Network: Providing access to experienced mentors from Coinbase, its partners, and the wider industry network. Access to Resources: Offering technical resources, tools, and potential integration opportunities. This structured support system is crucial for startups navigating the complexities of building in nascent and rapidly evolving fields like crypto and AI. What Does This Mean for UK Startups ? The launch of this program in the UK is a significant vote of confidence in the country’s tech ecosystem. The UK has a vibrant startup scene and is increasingly positioning itself as a hub for both fintech and AI innovation. Bringing a high-profile accelerator backed by global players like Coinbase, Animoca Brands, and Fabric Ventures, alongside the established UK-based Founders Factory, provides a major boost. It offers UK-based founders a world-class opportunity without necessarily needing to relocate. It also helps attract international talent and investment to the UK shores, further solidifying its position on the global tech map. This initiative could serve as a catalyst, encouraging more entrepreneurs to explore the potential of blockchain AI and fostering a more connected and collaborative environment within the UK’s burgeoning Web3 and AI sectors. Who Should Apply? What Are the Opportunities? The program is likely seeking ambitious teams with innovative ideas that clearly demonstrate how they are combining blockchain and AI technologies to solve real problems or create new opportunities. Ideal candidates would have a working prototype or a clear vision and roadmap, along with a passionate and capable team. Examples of potential projects could include: AI-powered tools for identifying and mitigating risks in decentralized finance (DeFi). Blockchain-based platforms using AI for identity verification or fraud detection. AI agents operating within metaverse or gaming economies built on blockchain. Tools that use machine learning to optimize smart contract development or auditing. Decentralized AI marketplaces facilitated by blockchain. For startups in these areas, this accelerator represents a golden opportunity to gain visibility, secure funding, and receive expert guidance from industry leaders. Are There Challenges Ahead? While the potential is immense, startups in the crypto and AI space also face significant challenges. Regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, technical complexity, and the need for user education are just a few hurdles. The accelerator program will likely help startups navigate some of these issues through mentorship and strategic advice, but success will ultimately depend on the teams’ execution and resilience. Furthermore, integrating AI and blockchain effectively requires deep expertise in both fields, which can be a challenge for small teams. The program’s focus on providing technical and product development support will be crucial in helping founders overcome these complexities. A Step Forward for Innovation The launch of the Coinbase-backed crypto and AI accelerator in the UK is a clear signal that major players see the combined potential of these technologies. By providing dedicated support, funding, and mentorship, the program aims to accelerate the development of solutions that could shape the future of the digital economy. For UK startups working in this exciting intersection, this presents an unparalleled opportunity to turn their innovative ideas into reality and gain a foothold in the global market.

It’s like gold, right?” Lutnick said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “It was treated under the Biden administration like you were doing something wrong. Now you have that sort of in the rearview mirror, and it’ll never come back.” Lutnick, a longtime Bitcoin ( BTC ) supporter, discussed his personal journey with the cryptocurrency, which began in 2017. He emphasized Bitcoin’s rarity — capped at 21 million coins — as the key reason behind its enduring value. “It’s just a rare entity. That rarity is what creates its value,” he said, recalling how he gradually moved from studying blockchain to going “all in” on Bitcoin by 2020. Today, Lutnick plays a major role in shaping a dramatically different stance toward Bitcoin under the Trump administration. Alongside fellow Bitcoin advocate David Sacks , Lutnick helped spearhead the creation of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve — a campaign promise President Trump moved quickly to deliver. The Commerce Secretary credited Trump’s leadership and open dialogue with the media as catalysts for the administration’s fast-paced progress.

He said Bitcoin mining is a key focus. Under the program, Bitcoin miners will be able to build private power plants alongside their facilities, reducing reliance on public grids and enabling cheaper, off-grid energy sources like hydroelectric power or flare gas capture. “You’re going to see miners putting data centers right on top of gas fields,” Lutnick said. “This will turbocharge Bitcoin mining in America.” He resisted concerns that a heavy concentration of Bitcoin mining in the U.S. could threaten the network’s decentralized nature. “America is the most extraordinary business place on Earth,” Lutnick said (edited for clarity). “Figure out how to win in America, and that’s how you get to the highest highs.” Throughout the conversation, Lutnick painted a vision of Bitcoin’s future as tied directly to American entrepreneurship. He suggested that a more business-friendly environment, particularly one that welcomes Bitcoin mining and innovation, could lift not only the Bitcoin community but also those feeling left behind by the economy.

Tether Gold ( XAUT ) and Paxos Gold ( PAXG ) reached all-time highs on April 22, with Tether Gold touching $3,529 and Paxos Gold recording a peak of $3,520, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Two other gold-backed cryptocurrencies — Quorium (QGOLD) and Kinesis Gold (KAU) — have seen rises of 8.5% and 7.6% , respectively, in the past 30 days. All four tokens are up 40% or more in the past 12 months, CoinGecko data shows. Related: Tether clocks $13B in 2024 profits, US bond holdings hit all-time highs According to a report by Tether, the increased demand for XAUT is due to macroeconomic factors, such as escalating global economic uncertainty, geopolitical conflicts, and a rising demand for inflation-resistant assets. Since US President Trump’s renewed trade war, gold has increased significantly in value. On April 2, Trump’s “Liberation Day,” when the tariffs were announced, the price of one ounce of gold was $3,115. At the time of this writing, on April 28, the ounce price is at $3,335, representing a 7% jump in less than 30 days. Gold price in USD over one month.

Growing RWA market Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization — products that bring assets like precious metals, bonds, and real estate onto the blockchain — is a growing market. According to RWA.xyz, the tokenized RWA market capitalization (excluding stablecoins) stands at $21.6 billion, up 8.6% over the past 30 days. Tether Gold and Paxos Gold are examples of RWA tokenization. Each coin in both products is reportedly backed by one troy ounce of actual gold. Tether is said to store its gold reserves in Switzerland, while Paxos keeps its gold in London. Tokenized gold has been a strong crypto use case in 2025, reaching a two-year high in trading volume on April 10 . Tokenizing gold has a few advantages over more common investment instruments that provide exposure to gold. For instance, settlements through these funds are instant, enabling quick trading. In addition, some tokenized gold tokens can be used to purchase goods and services , while traditional instruments can usually be redeemed only for fiat currency.

43915714,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153338,1745871044,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,US Federal Reserve Stablecoin Policy Faces Critical Backlash from Custodia Bank CEO,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-federal-reserve-stablecoin/,"The debate around how traditional finance should interact with the burgeoning world of digital assets is heating up, and at the center of a recent storm is the US Federal Reserve and its approach to Stablecoin Policy . Caitlin Long, the founder and CEO of Custodia Bank , a digital asset bank, has publicly voiced strong criticism, arguing that the Fed’s current stance unfairly favors large financial institutions while hindering innovation and direct engagement from others in the crypto space. What is Custodia Bank’s CEO Saying About the US Federal Reserve? Caitlin Long, a well-known figure advocating for clear Crypto Regulation in the US, took to social media on April 28th to express her concerns. She acknowledged that the US Federal Reserve had recently taken a positive step by rescinding four previous supervisory letters that banks felt were overly restrictive regarding crypto-related activities. This move was seen by some as a sign of the Fed becoming more open to banks exploring digital assets. However, Caitlin Long pointed out that despite this apparent relaxation, the core issue remains unresolved. The Fed has maintained a significant statement from January 2023. This statement essentially prevents banks under the Fed’s supervision from directly holding crypto assets on their balance sheets and, crucially for the stablecoin discussion, prohibits them from issuing stablecoins on permissionless blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin. Long’s criticism centers on the perceived contradiction: while seemingly easing some rules, the Fed maintains a fundamental restriction that she believes creates an uneven playing field. She argues this specific prohibition on permissionless stablecoins disproportionately impacts institutions like Custodia Bank and potentially clears the path for larger, incumbent banks to issue stablecoins on permissioned, private networks, which may not offer the same benefits of transparency, accessibility, and innovation inherent in public blockchains. The US Federal Reserve’s Stance on Stablecoin Policy: Why the Restriction? The US Federal Reserve has consistently cited concerns about safety, soundness, and systemic risk when explaining its cautious approach to banks engaging with crypto assets and stablecoins. The January 2023 statement, officially titled “Joint Statement on Crypto-Asset Risks to Banking Organizations,” outlined these risks, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, operational risk, and legal and compliance risks. From the Fed’s perspective, preventing banks from directly holding volatile crypto assets or issuing stablecoins on potentially less-controlled permissionless networks is a necessary step to protect depositors and the financial system’s stability. The concern is that volatility in crypto markets could spill over into the traditional banking system, or that stablecoins issued on public chains could pose unique challenges for supervision and resolution in times of stress. However, critics like Caitlin Long argue that this blanket prohibition is overly broad and fails to distinguish between different types of crypto assets or stablecoin models. They contend that well-regulated banks, operating under strict oversight, should be allowed to engage with certain digital assets or issue stablecoins on permissionless chains, provided they meet rigorous risk management standards. The current Stablecoin Policy , in their view, doesn’t provide a pathway for this, effectively creating a barrier to entry for many. How Does This Policy Impact Crypto Regulation and Banks? The Fed’s stance has significant implications for the landscape of Crypto Regulation and the ability of banks to innovate. Here are some key impacts: Hindered Innovation: By restricting banks from engaging with permissionless blockchains, the policy limits their ability to leverage the full potential of this technology for issuing stablecoins or offering other digital asset services. Uneven Playing Field: As Caitlin Long points out, larger banks might find ways to work around these restrictions through subsidiaries or by focusing on permissioned networks, while smaller or crypto-native banks face significant hurdles. This could concentrate stablecoin issuance power among a few large players. Regulatory Uncertainty: While the rescinded letters offered some relief, the maintained January 2023 statement leaves banks unclear on the acceptable scope of their digital asset activities, particularly regarding stablecoins. Challenges for Crypto-Focused Institutions: Banks like Custodia Bank , specifically chartered with a focus on digital assets, face an uphill battle in obtaining necessary approvals and navigating a regulatory environment that seems wary of their core business model. The situation highlights the ongoing tension between regulators focused on traditional financial stability and innovators seeking to integrate new technologies. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a known proponent of clear crypto frameworks, has previously criticized the Fed’s approach, calling certain requirements for banks to report crypto activities “lip service” if they aren’t accompanied by clear pathways for engagement. Caitlin Long’s Call for Federal Stablecoin Legislation According to Caitlin Long , the current impasse regarding the US Federal Reserve ‘s Stablecoin Policy cannot be resolved by the Fed alone. She firmly believes that only the passage of comprehensive federal stablecoin legislation by Congress can provide the necessary clarity and mandate to alter the Fed’s restrictive position. Federal legislation could establish a clear regulatory framework specifically for stablecoins, addressing issues like reserve requirements, redemption rights, and the types of entities allowed to issue them. This could potentially override or provide exceptions to the Fed’s current prohibitions, creating a legal basis for regulated banks to issue stablecoins, including on permissionless blockchains, under specific conditions. Efforts are underway in Congress, particularly within the House Financial Services Committee, to draft and pass stablecoin legislation. However, reaching a consensus on the specifics of such a bill has proven challenging, with disagreements over issues like the role of state regulators versus federal regulators, and the types of entities eligible to issue stablecoins. The perspective shared by Caitlin Long underscores the view held by many in the crypto industry that a piecemeal approach by regulators is insufficient. They argue that a clear, nationwide legal framework is essential for the US to foster innovation in the stablecoin space while ensuring necessary consumer protection and financial stability. The Future of US Stablecoin Policy and Custodia Bank The ongoing debate between figures like Caitlin Long and the cautious stance of the US Federal Reserve is indicative of the critical juncture the US is at regarding Crypto Regulation and Stablecoin Policy . The outcome of this tension will significantly shape the future of how digital assets integrate with the traditional financial system. For institutions like Custodia Bank , which are designed to bridge these two worlds, the path forward heavily depends on regulatory clarity. While they continue to navigate the existing rules and pursue avenues like obtaining a Fed master account, the current policy environment presents substantial challenges. The ball appears to be in Congress’s court. The passage of well-crafted federal stablecoin legislation could provide the regulatory certainty that banks need to confidently enter this market, potentially leveling the playing field and fostering innovation. Without it, the current dynamics, which Caitlin Long argues favor large, established players and restrict engagement with permissionless networks, may persist. Ultimately, the goal for many is to integrate the benefits of blockchain technology and stablecoins into the regulated financial system in a safe and sound manner. The current disagreement highlights the different visions for how best to achieve this, and the significant policy decisions that still need to be made at the highest levels of government.

Strategy Continues Dramatic Bitcoin Buyup According to an April 28 filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Virginia-based software firm purchased 15,355 worth of Bitcoin valued at $92,737 each for a cumulative total of $1.42 billion. $MSTR has acquired 15,355 BTC for ~$1.42 billion at ~$92,737 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 13.7% YTD 2025.

Just last week, Strategy announced it had purchased a little more than $555 million worth of Bitcoin after briefly pausing acquisitions of the cryptocurrency earlier this month as global markets grappled with U.S. President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff policies. Despite the weakening of the U.S. dollar, Bitcoin has seen a relative boost in recent days – hovering around $94,000 as of Monday afternoon. Michael Saylor Praises Trump’s New SEC Pick Saylor, who led Strategy’s initial buyup of Bitcoin back in 2020, has long believed in Bitcoin’s potentia l. “When banks finally bless Bitcoin and the experts agree it’s a good idea, everyone will want to buy it, no one will need to sell it, and you won’t be able to afford it,” he said in an April 28 X post. Most recently, Saylor praised newly confirmed SEC chair Paul Atkins, calling him “good for Bitcoin.” Atkins, who is reported to hold up to $6 million in cryptocurrency himself, has promised to usher in a fair regulatory framework for digital assets . “Through a rational, coherent, and principled approach, we will work to ensure that the United States is the best and most secure place in the world to do business,” Atkins said during his swearing-in ceremony at the White House last week. Just exactly what those regulations will look like or how they will impact Bitcoin’s value is still unclear.

Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy are at it again, making headlines with another substantial acquisition of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. If you’re following the journey of MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings, this latest move is sure to grab your attention. What’s the Latest on MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy? Michael Saylor, the outspoken co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy (MSTR), recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a significant update regarding the company’s balance sheet strategy. MicroStrategy has once again deepened its commitment to Bitcoin by acquiring a substantial amount. Here are the key details of this latest purchase: Amount Acquired: 15,355 BTC Total Cost: $1.42 billion Average Price per Bitcoin: Approximately $92,737 This acquisition demonstrates MicroStrategy’s continued confidence in Bitcoin as a store of value and a primary treasury reserve asset. It’s a move that reinforces their position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally. Michael Saylor’s Unwavering Conviction in Bitcoin This latest purchase isn’t just a random transaction; it’s a direct reflection of Michael Saylor ‘s long-held and publicly articulated belief in Bitcoin’s potential. Saylor has been one of the most prominent corporate advocates for Bitcoin, viewing it as a superior form of money and a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. His strategy for MicroStrategy has been clear: convert excess cash and raise capital to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible. This approach has transformed MicroStrategy from primarily a business intelligence software company into a de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle for many investors. Saylor’s conviction appears unwavering, even as Bitcoin’s price experiences its characteristic volatility. Each dip or opportunity seems to be met with further accumulation, signaling a long-term, buy-and-hold strategy that spans years, not just months. How Does This Impact MSTR Stock and Investors? For many investors, buying shares of MSTR stock has become a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Due to MicroStrategy’s massive Bitcoin holdings, the price of its stock often correlates closely with the price movements of Bitcoin itself. This correlation means that MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchases can have a significant impact on investor sentiment and the company’s stock performance. When Bitcoin’s price rises, MSTR stock tends to perform well, often trading at a premium to the value of its underlying Bitcoin holdings, reflecting the market’s enthusiasm and Saylor’s premium. Conversely, downturns in the Bitcoin price can put pressure on MSTR stock. However, the company’s consistent accumulation strategy signals to the market that management remains bullish, which can help maintain investor confidence in the long term, despite short-term price fluctuations. Analyzing the Overall Bitcoin Price Position and Yield With this latest acquisition, MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin price position has grown significantly. As of April 27, 2025, the company holds a staggering amount of BTC. Let’s look at the updated figures: MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Holdings (as of April 27, 2025): Metric Value Total Bitcoin Held 553,555 BTC Total Acquisition Cost $37.9 billion Overall Average Price per BTC $68,459 Comparing the overall average acquisition price ($68,459) to the price of the latest purchase ($92,737) shows that MicroStrategy is accumulating Bitcoin at increasingly higher price levels, reflecting the market’s appreciation since they began their strategy. Michael Saylor also highlighted a key performance indicator: the Year-to-Date (YTD) 2025 Bitcoin yield. As of April 27, 2025, MicroStrategy reported a BTC yield of 13.7%. This figure likely represents the appreciation of their holdings since the beginning of 2025, demonstrating the profitability of their long-term BTC investment strategy in the current market environment. What Does This Massive BTC Investment Mean for the Market? MicroStrategy’s continuous and large-scale BTC investment strategy sends a powerful signal to the broader financial market. It validates Bitcoin as a legitimate and significant asset class for corporate treasuries and institutional investors. Benefits of MSTR’s Strategy for the Market: Increased Institutional Adoption: MicroStrategy’s pioneering role encourages other companies to consider Bitcoin. Price Support: Large purchases absorb supply, potentially supporting Bitcoin’s price. Market Validation: A publicly traded company placing significant value on Bitcoin lends credibility. Investor Education: Saylor’s public discussions educate traditional investors about Bitcoin. Potential Challenges and Considerations: Volatility Risk: MSTR’s balance sheet is heavily exposed to Bitcoin’s price swings. Concentration Risk: Holding such a large percentage of assets in one volatile asset is risky for the company. Market Influence: MSTR’s large moves can sometimes influence market sentiment, creating potential for short-term price reactions. MicroStrategy’s journey serves as a high-profile example of a company fully embracing Bitcoin, offering valuable insights for both corporate strategists and individual investors alike. Key Takeaways for Investors MicroStrategy’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation offers several lessons for investors: Conviction is Key: Believing in the long-term value of an asset like Bitcoin is crucial for weathering volatility. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): While MSTR makes large lump-sum buys, their overall strategy over time resembles DCA, accumulating at various price points. Long-Term Perspective: Their focus is on decades, not just quarters, which is essential for volatile assets. Understanding Risk: Recognize the significant risk associated with holding a highly volatile asset like Bitcoin. In Conclusion MicroStrategy’s latest acquisition of 15,355 BTC for $1.42 billion underscores the company’s unwavering commitment to its Bitcoin-centric corporate strategy. Under the leadership of Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy continues to accumulate Bitcoin, solidifying its position as a unique publicly traded entity deeply intertwined with the future of digital assets. As of April 27, 2025, their total holdings of 553,555 BTC, acquired at an overall average price of $68,459, represent a massive bet on Bitcoin’s long-term value. This strategy not only impacts MSTR stock but also serves as a significant indicator of growing institutional confidence and the evolving landscape of corporate finance in the age of digital currencies.

Like many altcoins, Worldcoin is also seeing bullish momentum, but how long will it last? Let’s find that out in detail in this Worldcoin price prediction. Table of Contents What is Worldcoin? Worldcoin price prediction Worldcoin coin price prediction: short-term outlook Worldcoin price prediction 2025 Worldcoin price prediction 2030 Since its launch, Worldcoin ( WLD ) has seen an all-time high of $11.74 back in March 2024, and since then, the price has seen a decline of 91.7%. At the time of writing, it is now trading at $1.14, with a market cap of $1.49 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $360 million. WLD 1d chart | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss WLD price prediction by giving you its short-term and long-term price forecasts and exploring whether this token can continue its bullish run.

The Worldcoin project’s goal is to create the biggest identification and financial network in the world as a public utility that grants everyone ownership. World ID, a global identity network that protects anonymity, is the foundation of the Worldcoin system. With World ID, people can utilize zero-knowledge proofs to confirm their humanity online (“Proof of Personhood”) while protecting their privacy. Users must first download World App, the first wallet app that allows users to create a World ID, to interact with the Worldcoin system. Users go to the Orb, a physical imaging device, to get their World ID Orb validated. A network of autonomous local companies known as Orb Operators runs the majority of Orbs. Multispectral sensors are used by the Orb to confirm humanness and uniqueness, and by default, all photographs are immediately erased on the device (unless Data Custody explicitly consents). Recurring distributions of free WLD tokens are available to all holders of Orb-verified World IDs. Now let’s discuss WLD price prediction for this year and in the coming years as well. Worldcoin price prediction What can be a realistic projection for the WLD token? Let’s dive into the WLD price prediction for 2025 and 2030. Worldcoin coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s Worldcoin price prediction for the near future, the token is projected to rise by 232.40% and reach $3.13 by May 25, 2025. As of Apr. 25th, 2025, the overall sentiment of the WLD price outlook has turned bullish, with 15 technical analysis indicators showing bullish signals, 9 indicating bearish trends, and 7 indicators showing neutral forecasts. Worldcoin price prediction 2025 For the remaining months of 2025, DigitalCoinPrice predicts that the WLD token’s price could fluctuate between $0.87 and $2.14, and may likely hold a yearly average of $2.07. CoinCodex projects that the WLD token can trade in the price channel of $0.941514 and $4.52 in 2025. While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark, and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Hence, it is advised to do your research before investing in WLD or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Worldcoin price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex’s Worldcoin crypto price prediction for 2030, WLD’s price could vary between $3.31 and $4.35. DigitalCoinPrice expects that WLD’s price could climb to $4.62 and $5.33 by the end of 2030. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict the WLD price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and, like all other tokens, the WLD token’s price can be highly volatile. 2030 is five years away, and many cryptocurrencies can become obsolete in that time. This is why it is hard to give a realistic price prediction for any token, including WLD. A great way for WLD to survive these five years and continue its ascent in the crypto market is to continue building its blockchain technology and partner with key players in the digital crypto space. You should research and keep yourself updated with the latest developments in the upcoming years to make an informed investment decision in the WLD token.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency, including WLD, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that the sentiment in the cryptocurrency market changes quickly, and a token that was once considered the future may also be delisted from major exchanges. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals before having any price expectations for the future of the WLD token. Will Worldcoin go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the WLD token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Worldcoin price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious, as no one can accurately predict how high or low WLD can go. Should I invest in Worldcoin? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any Worldcoin price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment, and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of their community. Hence, it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals, which may very well decide the future of the WLD token. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Crypto analysts such as Master Kenobi have suggested that the leading meme coin is primed to reach new highs. Dogecoin Price Ready To Breakout From Falling Wedge In an X post , crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade stated that the Dogecoin price is showing a breakout from a falling wedge. This came as he revealed that a bullish cross has occurred on the Stochastic Relative Strength Index (RSI) biweekly chart. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could break above the $0.2 price level on this move. Interestingly, in another X post, Trader Tardigrade predicted that the Dogeocoin price could soon outperform the Bitcoin price. The analyst revealed that the current On-Balance Volume (OBV) pattern on the DOGE/BTC chart mirrors the previous one. He added that this pattern emerged just before the leading meme coin outperformed the flagship crypto from October to December 2024. The crypto analyst remarked that given that both price action and indicators show the same pattern, he believes the Dogecoin price will soon “drastically” outperform Bitcoin. DOGE could enjoy massive gains if it replicates it price performance from October to December 2024. The meme coin had underperformed for most of 2024 but ended the year on a high as it went on to record the most year-to-date (YTD) gain among the top 10 cryptos by market cap. Trader Tardigrade also believes that another bull run may be imminent for the Dogecoin price. He revealed that DOGE has broken down to its Round Bottom in this cycle. Based on this, he asserted that a “massive” bull run is imminent for the leading meme coin. His accompanying chart showed that DOGE could reach as high as $2.8 when it records this massive bull run. Update On The DOGE Macro Chart In an X post, crypto analyst Master Kenobi provided an update on the macro chart for the Dogecoin price. He stated that the macro chart and a comparison of the current configuration with the situation in 2017 reveal that the meme coin has all the necessary ingredients for a “massive” pump. The crypto analyst also revealed that the 21-day EMA on the 3-day chart indicates that the Dogecoin price current outlook is bullish. He remarked that additional factors such as bullish divergence and the breaking of the trendline on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also reinforce this bullish outlook.

This is particularly relevant for developers and enterprises building sophisticated applications, including those in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, where reliability and security are paramount. As AI assists in generating more code faster, the potential for bugs and issues also increases significantly. Addressing this critical need, Israeli startup Lightrun has announced a substantial funding round. Lightrun Funding Fuels AI Debugging Innovation Lightrun, a company specializing in an observability platform designed to identify and remediate code issues in production environments before they cause problems, has successfully raised $70 million in Series B funding. This significant investment highlights the growing market demand for advanced AI debugging solutions. The round was co-led by new investor Accel and existing investor Insight Partners, with participation from Citi, Glilot Capital, GTM Capital, and Sorenson Capital. This brings Lightrun’s total funding to $110 million. The funding underscores not just the market gap for tools that can handle the complexity introduced by modern development practices, including extensive AI coding , but also Lightrun’s proven ability to meet this demand. While valuation wasn’t disclosed, the company’s traction with major clients like ADP, AT&T, ICE/NYSE, Inditex, Microsoft, Priceline, Salesforce, and SAP speaks volumes about its impact. Why is AI Debugging Becoming Critical? The surge in AI-assisted development tools has led to developers shipping code at an unprecedented rate. However, fixing issues when they arise remains a manual, time-consuming, and expensive process. As Lightrun CEO Ilan Peleg puts it, “Code is becoming cheap but bugs are expensive.” This challenge is amplified by the fact that a significant portion of production issues (estimated between 30% and 60%) stem from code problems, regardless of whether the code was written by humans or machines. Lightrun’s platform tackles this by offering a unique approach to code debugging directly within the integrated developer environment (IDE). Their recently launched Runtime Autonomous AI Debugger leverages AI to understand code behavior alongside code already in production, allowing for anticipation and remediation of issues before they cause disruptions. How Does Lightrun’s Software Observability Work? While many companies offer observability tools (like Datadog or App Dynamics), Lightrun aims for a deeper level of insight. They strive for what they call the “holy grail” of observability: not just monitoring code in production, but understanding its interactions and predicting potential problems with minimal interruption. Lightrun achieves this through: Monitoring code behavior as it’s being developed in the IDE. Simulating code interactions using AI to predict runtime issues. Automatically suggesting or making adjustments to prevent crashes or errors in production. Allowing developers to debug and understand code execution without redeploying or stopping the application. This capability to simulate and fix issues proactively, directly from the development environment, is what the company believes sets it apart in the crowded software observability market. Future Outlook and Market Position Lightrun’s strategic timing, particularly the launch of their AI debugging tool, resonated strongly with investors and enterprises facing the challenges of accelerated AI-driven development. Accel partner Andrei Brasoveanu noted that the company’s acceleration in the enterprise sector last year was directly linked to the impact of AI on coding practices. Looking ahead, Lightrun sees potential avenues for growth, including developing tools specifically for cybersecurity teams (given the link between bugs and security vulnerabilities) and integrating even closer with the code creation process. For now, the focus remains on strengthening their core platform and talent within the IDE space, mitigating risks to software resilience. In summary, Lightrun’s significant funding round validates the critical need for advanced AI-powered tools to manage the complexity of modern software development. By providing developers with powerful AI debugging and observability capabilities, the company is positioned to help enterprises navigate the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the era of widespread AI coding.

Related Reading: XRP Nearing Explosive Breakout—$10 Target In Sight, Expert Says Justin Sun Asserts ‘Complete Fundamental Reversal’ For JST Based on Sun’s latest post on X, the JUST decentralized finance platform based on TRON has made dramatic changes. “JST has experienced a total fundamental flip,” Sun wrote. “I think it will be the next 100x token,” he said. His statement sparked an instant 30% price rise as investors flocked to purchase the token. The crypto entrepreneur pointed to JustLend’s growth from launch as a central reason for his positive perspective. JustLend has become a leading lending platform in DeFi and was involved in the creation of the USDD stablecoin. Sun compared JST to veteran DeFi tokens AAVE and MKR, positing that JST might replicate similar growth trends. He anticipates the platform to make huge profits in future years. “I’m sure that JST’s chart will be no less stunning than TRX’s – if you catch my drift,” he added. JST (JUST) has undergone a complete fundamental reversal. I believe it will become the next 100x token. First of all, JustLend, which was incubated by JST, has already grown into one of the largest lending platforms, generating tens of millions of dollars in net profit.… — H.E. Justin Sun 🍌 (@justinsuntron) April 27, 2025 Token Price Surges Following Announcement The market responded quickly to Sun’s comments. JUST price jumped within 24 hours of his prediction, reaching $0.04310 per token. This price movement coincides with broader positive trends in cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin and other alternative coins showing strength in recent trading. Sun has been active with other price predictions as well. He recently set a $5,000 target for Ethereum and forecasted that Tron (TRX) would reach new all-time highs. JST market cap currently at $391 million. Chart: TradingView.com Revenue Plans Look To 2026 For Substantial Growth Although Justin Sun did not give a precise time when the 100X increase is likely to occur, his remarks indicated 2026 as a primary period. Based on his remarks, more than $100 million is anticipated to be earned in profit by 2026 through the DeFi ecosystem. One key component of Sun’s strategy is to use this future revenue to buy and burn JST tokens. This deflationary mechanism would decrease the token supply, maybe causing prices to rise if demand stays constant or rises. Related Reading: XRP Headed For $1,000 – CryptoGuard Exec Drops Bold Prediction Trump Connection Mentioned Amid Bold Predictions Reports suggest Sun can attend a dinner party hosted by US President Donald Trump for large holders of TRUMP tokens. According to information at hand, Sun has amassed over 14 million TRUMP tokens, which qualifies him as a large holder. If Sun’s bold forecast comes true, JST would be trading at about $4 per token, a huge jump from current prices. Such huge price jumps are not common in cryptocurrency markets even though they are often forecasted. The 100X projection is one of the more aggressive predictions in recent cryptocurrency headlines, even for an industry with volatility and hype propensity. Traders are at least reacting positively in the near term, though long-term execution will hinge on whether JustLend and the greater JUST ecosystem can provide the growth Sun projects.

According to Martinez, if DOGE price can close April above $0.20, it could start a rally to the all-time high price level of $0.74. Such a breakout move would signal strong bullish momentum and could attract more users, he said. Speaking about XRP, the analyst noted that the coin currently appears to have broken out of an inverse head-and-shoulders formation, setting a potential upside target of around $2.70 to $2.90.

The fund uses conservative basis trading strategies and third-party custody to minimize risk, targeting cautious institutional investors. This launch is part of the growing demand for compliant, low-risk Bitcoin yield products as institutional adoption continues to accelerate. According to an announcement on April 28, Coinbase Asset Management is set to launch a new Bitcoin-focused fund designed to deliver regular yield for institutional investors outside the United States. The Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund (CBYF), which is officially launching on May 1, 2025, is structured to provide an annualized net return of 4% to 8%, with yields delivered directly in Bitcoin. Coinbase Launches $1B Capacity Bitcoin Yield Fund for Institutional Clients Abroad CBYF seeks to address a growing demand among institutions for Bitcoin-based yield opportunities. Unlike assets such as Ether and Solana, which generate yields through staking, Bitcoin does not inherently offer native yield. Funds like CBYF have emerged to bridge this gap, though many existing options typically involve substantial investment and operational risks. Coinbase has structured its offering to mitigate these risks, aligning more closely with the risk appetite of institutional investors. coinbase bitcoin yield fund launching next week offering 4-8% returns btc otc desks at all time low + $3.4b inflows last week microstrat bought another 15k coins at 92k everybody wants yield but nobody got coins to give supply shock gonna hit different than u think — aixbt (@aixbt_agent) April 28, 2025 The investment strategy behind CBYF avoids high-risk Bitcoin loans and systematic call selling. Instead of moving assets out of storage for trading, Coinbase uses third-party custody integrations to minimize counterparty risk. Investors will be able to subscribe to and redeem shares using Bitcoin, with monthly opportunities for transactions provided following a five-business-day notice period. The fund’s strategy capacity is estimated at around $1 billion. Sebastian Bea, President at Coinbase Asset Management, said, “As institutional crypto adoption grows, Coinbase Asset Management provides solutions for institutional investors to engage with digital assets by blending traditional investment experience with digital acumen.” He added, “We believe the Bitcoin Yield Fund is particularly well suited to the task, given its conservative and compliant investment strategy.” The fund’s launch comes at a time when basis trades, which involve profiting from price differences between Bitcoin spot and futures markets, offer opportunities for returns, especially when Bitcoin prices are rising. However, Coinbase cautions that returns could diminish or turn negative in declining markets. While some offshore hedge funds and projects, such as Ethena, have employed similar strategies with varying levels of risk, Coinbase emphasizes that CBYF will adopt only modest leverage and maintain a focus on safeguarding client assets through Coinbase and other qualified custodians. The fund has already attracted multiple seed investors, including Aspen Digital, a digital asset manager regulated by the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) in Abu Dhabi. Aspen Digital will initially serve as an exclusive wealth distribution partner for CBYF across the UAE and Asia. The fund’s performance, however, will largely depend on market conditions. Coinbase notes that the dislocation between spot and futures prices tends to be more profitable during Bitcoin price rallies and could shrink or even result in negative returns if the market declines. Institutional Momentum Builds as Bitcoin Rebounds Coinbase pointed to rising institutional adoption as a key driver behind its new Bitcoin Yield Fund, which launches amid a strong recovery in Bitcoin’s price. Over the past week, Bitcoin climbed by more than 9%, reaching $94,000, supported by over $3 billion in ETF inflows, marking the second-highest weekly total on record, according to Farside Investors . Analysts, including Bitget Research’s Ryan Lee, suggest retail participation could surge if Bitcoin breaks above $100,000, driven by renewed media attention and fear of missing out. Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes recently predicted that Bitcoin’s climb past six figures could be imminent, citing U.S. Treasury buybacks as a possible catalyst.

A recent development from Eastern Europe has captured attention: Ukraine has proposed a significant ceasefire. This move comes as the Russia Ukraine conflict continues, highlighting ongoing efforts, however tentative, towards de-escalation. Understanding the Proposed Ukraine Ceasefire The proposal for a substantial pause in hostilities was put forth by Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha‎. According to a report shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, the proposition calls for a ceasefire lasting for at least 30 days. This duration is noteworthy, suggesting a desire for a more meaningful and prolonged halt to fighting compared to shorter tactical pauses. This specific proposal for a Ukraine ceasefire emerges in the wake of a temporary ceasefire announced by Russia. Russia’s brief truce, scheduled from May 8 to May 11, was intended to coincide with the Victory Day anniversary commemorations. While limited in scope and duration, Russia’s prior announcement perhaps created a window or context for Ukraine’s more extensive proposal. Navigating the Complexities of the Russia Ukraine Conflict The Russia Ukraine conflict has been a major source of global instability for over two years. Its impact extends far beyond the immediate region, affecting energy prices, supply chains, and international relations. Against this backdrop, any discussion of a ceasefire, regardless of its origin or likelihood of success, is a significant development. It speaks to the immense human and economic cost of the conflict and the underlying, albeit often fragile, hope for a resolution. The Quest for Geopolitical Stability Achieving geopolitical stability is crucial for global economic health. Instability creates uncertainty, which often leads investors to retreat from riskier assets. News related to potential de-escalation, like a proposed Ukraine ceasefire , can sometimes be interpreted positively by markets, signaling a potential reduction in risk. Conversely, continued conflict or failed peace initiatives reinforce uncertainty and can contribute to market volatility. For those following the cryptocurrency space, understanding the link between geopolitical stability and market movements is essential. While crypto markets have their own unique drivers, they are not immune to macro global events. Major conflicts, political crises, and shifts in international relations can influence investor sentiment and capital flows, indirectly impacting crypto prices. Potential Impact and Challenges for Peace Talks A 30-day ceasefire, if implemented, could offer several potential benefits: Humanitarian Relief: Allow for aid delivery and safe passage for civilians. De-escalation: Provide a window to reduce the intensity of fighting. Opportunity for Dialogue: Create space for potential peace talks or negotiations. However, significant challenges remain. Trust between the warring parties is low, and previous ceasefire attempts have been fragile. Implementing and monitoring a ceasefire across extensive front lines is complex. The success of this proposal, and the potential for genuine peace talks , will depend on numerous factors, including international mediation and the political will of both sides. What Does This Mean for Crypto Market Impact? While a direct, immediate correlation between this specific ceasefire proposal and crypto prices is difficult to predict, the broader theme of geopolitical stability is highly relevant. Reduced conflict risk globally is generally seen as positive for asset markets, including potentially crypto, as it encourages investment confidence. Conversely, any breakdown in ceasefire efforts or escalation in the Russia Ukraine conflict could contribute to market caution. Investors and enthusiasts in the crypto space should view such geopolitical developments as part of the wider economic backdrop that influences market sentiment and liquidity. The potential for crypto market impact stems from the overall shift in global risk appetite driven by major international events. Conclusion: A Step Towards Calm? Ukraine’s proposal for a 30-day ceasefire represents a notable moment in the ongoing Russia Ukraine conflict . Following Russia’s shorter truce, this more extended proposal highlights the persistent need for pauses in the fighting and potentially opens the door, however slightly, for future peace talks . While the path to lasting geopolitical stability in the region remains fraught with challenges, any step towards de-escalation is significant. For the global markets, including understanding the potential crypto market impact , monitoring such developments is key. Geopolitical events are powerful forces that shape the economic environment in which all assets, including cryptocurrencies, operate. This proposal, while its outcome is uncertain, is a reminder of the interconnectedness of global affairs and markets.

In a third reading on April 28 of the Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), a proposal to amend Arizona’s statutes to allow for a strategic BTC reserve, 31 members of the Arizona House voted in favor of the bill, with 25 opposed. A similar bill, SB1373, to establish a state-level digital assets reserve, passed with 37 lawmakers in favor and 19 voting nay. “This bill basically takes the approach that probably 15 other states are considering the same legislation nationwide that allows the treasurer to invest up to 10% into, probably mainly Bitcoin but other things as well,” said State Representative Jeff Weninger on SB1025. “I think this probably would start as a ‘may’ for the foreseeable future, but as things continue to pivot towards Bitcoin and these things, would have that already in place in the future.” Voting for SB1025 in the Arizona House of Representatives on April 28. Source: Arizona State Legislature The approvals bring the bills closer than any other state-level initiative in the US to getting a cryptocurrency or Bitcoin strategic reserve signed into law. Similar legislation proposed in New Hampshire passed the state’s House in April and is expected to head to the Senate for a full floor vote soon. Related: Bitcoin reserve backlash signals unrealistic industry expectations Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs announced on April 17 that she intended to veto any bill until lawmakers had a “serious, bipartisan funding solution that protects healthcare for Arizonans with disabilities.” However, with the passage of such legislation on April 24, the governor could be more open to signing SB1025 or SB1373 into law. Federal plans to establish a national crypto reserve The state-level efforts to create Bitcoin reserves come amid a push from US President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers to do the same in the federal government. Trump signed an executive order in March with a proposal for a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.” Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Trump supporter and crypto advocate, proposed that Congress pass legislation that could allow the US government to hold more than 1 million BTC , in part through crypto seized through civil or criminal forfeiture. Lawmakers have suggested Lummis’s bill was an attempt by Congress to codify Trump’s EO into law.

One name that’s still making folks shake their heads? Story (IP). Back in its prime, it was the Best Performing Crypto on everyone’s lips — and not just the die-hard crypto junkies either. Your neighbor’s cousin was probably bragging about doubling their paycheck on it. Story (IP) had a dream run, rallying almost 1000% at one point. But here’s the kicker: tons of folks sat on their hands, thinking it was too late or too risky. And boy, did that hesitation cost ‘em. Story (IP) went from being the underground darling to breaking into the big leagues almost overnight. It was the kind of rocket ship people wish they hadn’t missed. Now, flash forward to today. Story (IP) is still hanging around, but the real heart-pounding gains? Those already happened. That’s why the smartest move right now isn’t to chase an old train — it’s to find the next one before it leaves the station. Lucky for anyone paying attention, the next star’s already lighting up the sky: Qubetics ($TICS). It’s sitting in presale mode, crazy affordable, and building momentum faster than a Florida hurricane. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Real-World Crypto Applications | Best Performing Crypto 2025 Alright, buckle up. Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t some rehash of old ideas. It’s the real deal — a powerhouse designed to solve the mess most cryptos ignored. Right now, Qubetics is in its 32nd presale stage, and it’s already sold more than 510 million tokens to 25,400+ holders, raking in a jaw-dropping $16.5 million. The price? A laughably low $0.2093 per token. If you think that’s wild, get this: analysts predict $TICS could hit $1 after presale (that’s a 377% ROI), shoot up to $5 after the presale ($2288% ROI), and maybe even skyrocket to $15 after the Mainnet launch (that’s 7066% ROI, folks). And this isn’t some pie-in-the-sky dream. Qubetics is packing serious tech muscle with its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet — the kind of tool that businesses, freelancers, and everyday users are gonna eat up. Imagine running a small Etsy shop and accepting payments without getting gouged by fees. Or think about a graphic designer working gigs worldwide who finally gets paid instantly, no middlemen drama.

The development was revealed during an exclusive business event featuring keynote addresses from Donald Trump Jr., Executive Vice President of The Trump Organization; Gila Gamliel, Israel’s Minister of Innovation, Science, and Technology; and Antoni Trenchev, Co-Founder of Nexo. Optimism and Support for Crypto Innovation According to an April 28 press release shared with CryptoPotato, supported by $11 billion in assets under management, the company’s return to the U.S. comes amid renewed optimism and entrepreneurial momentum. The crypto lender will offer American retail and institutional clients access to its products, including high-yield crypto savings accounts, asset-backed credit lines, advanced trading options, and institutional-grade liquidity solutions. Nexo Co-Founder Antoni Trenchev officially confirmed the company’s relaunch in the country, “America is back — and so is Nexo.” He credited the vision and leadership of President Donald J. Trump, his administration, and his family for creating an environment where innovation is encouraged. “Nexo is returning to America — stronger, smarter, and determined to win,” he added. Donald Trump Jr. spoke on the importance of cryptocurrencies for the United States, emphasizing their role in maintaining the country’s economic leadership and technological advancement. “I think crypto is the future of finance,” said the president’s son. “We see the opportunity for the financial sector and want to ensure we bring that back to the U.S.,” he continued. He added that establishing a supportive regulatory framework would be crucial to empowering entrepreneurs and ensuring the nation’s competitiveness in the digital economy, emphasizing, “The key to everything crypto is going to be the regulatory framework.” The event, headlined by Donald Trump Jr. and Gila Gamliel, gathered prominent members of the global business community and leading figures from the investment and innovation sectors. Regulatory Challenges That Led To the Exit Nexo’s re-entry follows a challenging period marked by its gradual withdrawal from the U.S. market in December 2022. At that time, the firm cited regulatory uncertainty and conflicting guidance between state and federal authorities as the primary reasons for its exit. Despite engaging in over 18 months of discussions with regulators, the crypto lender struggled to find a solution to its problems. Efforts to comply included off-boarding clients from New York and Vermont and suspending new registrations for its Earn Interest Product in several states. Ultimately, inconsistent regulatory positions and a prolonged investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) forced Nexo to stop its American operations. The company’s return follows a similar move by OKX, which announced less than two weeks ago that it is reopening its U.S. crypto exchange and launching a new Web3 wallet for the nation’s users.

According to Whale Alert, the popular blockchain transaction tracker, a massive 250 million USDC has just been minted at the USDC Treasury. This isn’t a small amount; it’s a substantial influx of one of the most widely used stablecoins, and it naturally sparks questions about what’s driving this and what it could mean for the broader crypto market . What Exactly Happened with This 250 Million USDC Minting ? The report from Whale Alert was straightforward: a transaction showing the creation of 250,000,000 USDC . This minting event occurred at the designated treasury address controlled by Circle, the primary issuer of USDC in partnership with Coinbase through the Centre Consortium. Think of the treasury as the central hub where new USDC tokens are created when authorized parties deposit an equivalent amount of US dollars into reserved accounts. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, USDC is designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. Its stability makes it a crucial tool in the crypto ecosystem, acting as a bridge between traditional fiat currency and the dynamic world of digital assets. Why Would Someone Mint 250 Million USDC ? A minting event of this magnitude doesn’t happen without reason. The primary driver behind USDC minting is simple: demand. When individuals or institutions want to acquire a large amount of USDC , they typically deposit US dollars with Circle or authorized partners. In return, new USDC tokens are minted and issued to them. So, who would need such a large sum? Here are a few likely scenarios: Institutional Demand: Large financial institutions, hedge funds, or corporate treasuries entering or expanding their presence in the crypto market often use stablecoins like USDC to manage their positions and reduce volatility risk. A 250 million mint could signal significant institutional interest. Preparation for Buying Assets: Large players might mint USDC when they anticipate buying other cryptocurrencies. Having a large pool of stable value allows them to quickly capitalize on market movements without needing to move in and out of volatile assets or wait for traditional banking transfers. Increased Trading or Yield Farming Activity: Traders and decentralized finance (DeFi) participants require stablecoins for various strategies, including providing liquidity, lending, borrowing, or engaging in yield farming protocols. High demand in these areas can lead to increased minting. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desks: OTC desks that facilitate large crypto trades for institutions often need large amounts of stablecoins readily available to execute transactions efficiently. This particular USDC minting event strongly suggests significant capital inflow into the digital asset space, likely from sophisticated or institutional players. What Does This Influx Mean for the Crypto Market ? The minting of 250 million new USDC tokens is generally viewed as a positive signal for the crypto market . Here’s why: Increased Liquidity: More USDC in circulation means more stable value is available within the crypto ecosystem. This can facilitate larger trades and potentially reduce slippage on exchanges. Potential Buying Pressure: As mentioned, a major reason for minting large amounts of USDC is to prepare for purchasing other cryptocurrencies. This influx could precede significant buying activity, potentially driving up the prices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Indicator of Confidence: Large minting events can signal growing confidence among major investors in the potential of the crypto market , suggesting they are positioning themselves for future growth or activity. While not a direct price predictor, tracking stablecoin movements, including large mints like this 250 million USDC event, offers valuable insight into the underlying capital flows and potential future market movements. Understanding the Role of a Stablecoin Like USDC USDC is more than just a stable token; it’s a fundamental building block of the modern digital economy. As a leading stablecoin , it provides essential functions: Benefits of Using USDC: Stability: Shields users from the notorious volatility of other cryptocurrencies, making it suitable for payments, savings, and calculating value. Accessibility: Easily transferable globally, 24/7, with lower fees compared to traditional international wire transfers. Integration: Widely supported across exchanges, DeFi protocols, wallets, and payment platforms. Transparency and Audits: Circle stablecoin operations are regularly audited by reputable accounting firms to verify that the amount of USDC in circulation is backed by an equivalent amount of US dollar reserves held in segregated accounts. Challenges and Considerations: Centralization: As an asset-backed stablecoin, USDC is issued and managed by centralized entities (Circle and Coinbase). This introduces counterparty risk and potential censorship points. Regulatory Risk: Stablecoins are under increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Changes in regulation could impact USDC ‘s operation or accessibility. Reserve Management: While audited, the quality and management of the reserve assets backing USDC are crucial for maintaining its peg and require ongoing trust in the issuing entity. What Can Investors Learn from This USDC Minting Event? For participants in the crypto market , monitoring stablecoin flows provides valuable data. A large mint like 250 million USDC suggests significant capital is being prepared for deployment within the ecosystem. While you shouldn’t make investment decisions based solely on this data point, it serves as an indicator: It highlights potential areas of growing demand (institutional, trading, DeFi). It increases the overall liquidity available for trading pairs involving USDC . It reinforces the critical role of stablecoins in facilitating large-scale activity in the digital asset space. Staying informed about major stablecoin movements, alongside other market indicators, can help paint a clearer picture of the current sentiment and potential future trends in the crypto market . Looking Ahead: The Future of USDC and Stablecoin Growth The continuous large-scale minting of USDC underscores the increasing adoption and utility of stablecoins globally. As the crypto ecosystem matures and potentially attracts more institutional and mainstream users, the demand for reliable, stable digital currencies is likely to grow. Events like this 250 million USDC minting are tangible evidence of this trend in action. The Circle stablecoin continues to be a dominant force, and its growth trajectory is closely tied to the overall expansion and health of the digital asset economy. Keeping an eye on future minting and burning reports will offer ongoing insights into the pulse of the market. Conclusion: A Significant Influx for the Crypto Market The minting of 250 million USDC is a notable event reported by Whale Alert, indicating a substantial injection of stable value into the crypto ecosystem. This large-scale USDC minting points towards increased demand, likely from institutions or large traders preparing to engage further in the crypto market . As a leading stablecoin , USDC plays a vital role in providing liquidity and stability. While challenges related to centralization and regulation exist, the continued growth in Circle stablecoin supply reflects the expanding utility and adoption of digital assets globally. Monitoring such events provides valuable clues about the underlying capital flows and potential future dynamics within the digital economy.

In a new report, he said leading crypto assets could reach $120,000 by the second quarter of 2025. Kendrick revealed that shifts in investment strategies will drive this price rally. He highlighted several factors pushing Bitcoin’s price upward. Analyst Says Investors Are Moving Away from U.S. Assets In a detailed analysis, Kendrick highlighted the shift in the behavior of U.S.-based investors. He said many U.S. investors are putting less money into local assets and looking for options in other markets. Notably, Bitcoin is one of the main choices they are turning to. One important indicator reflecting this trend is the U.S. Treasury term premium. The premium is now at its highest level in 12 years and moves closely with Bitcoin’s price. The way investors trade at different times of the day also shows that U.S. investors are buying more Bitcoin. This trend grew stronger after President Donald Trump announced a new tariff policy earlier this month. After the announcement, Bitcoin’s price jumped while tech stocks dropped sharply. Investors now see Bitcoin as a safer option during uncertain times. BTC Whales Are Helping the Price Rise Standard Chartered analysts explained that large BTC holders, known as “whales,” are also helping push the asset’s price higher. These whales own more than 1,000 Bitcoins each. Recently, they have been buying more Bitcoin, showing they trust in its future growth. Kendrick noted that whales buy during market drops and rebounds. This includes major events like the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and even President Trump’s election win in November 2024. Their steady buying suggests Bitcoin’s price could keep going up. Kendrick also said another factor driving Bitcoin’s price is the growing interest from large institutions. He believes the upcoming U.S. ETFs filing will soon reveal that pension and sovereign wealth funds are increasing their Bitcoin holdings. In addition, Kendrick mentioned that new U.S. stablecoin laws could also make Bitcoin look even more trustworthy, bringing in more institutional investment. Bitcoin vs. Gold: A New Safe Haven Gold has always been considered a safe asset to invest in during economic uncertainty. However, things are changing as Bitcoin is becoming a more potent option . Kendrick revealed that funds are moving from gold ETFs into Bitcoin ETFs. This shows a growing belief in Bitcoin’s ability to protect investors during market downturns. Unlike gold, Bitcoin’s decentralized system gives it a unique advantage when the financial world is unstable.

Noting that, unlike Ether, Solana and other proof-of-stake blockchains, Bitcoin produces no passive yield, Coinbase Asset Management said in a blog post that its Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund differentiates itself from others that “require institutional allocators to take on significant investment and operational risk.” Instead, it promises a conservative strategy that “avoids riskier high-interest Bitcoin loans and systematic call selling,” Coinbase said. “Rather than move assets out of storage, Coinbase AM uses third-party custody integrations to trade, which we believe significantly reduces counterparty risk.” To continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io",,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|SOL,"{'name': 'The Defiant', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/101/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thedefiant,2025-04-28 21:26:22

Exchange Analysts Assess the Future of BTC,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-is-the-current-outlook-for-bitcoin-btc-price-exchange-analysts-assess-the-future-of-btc/,"Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex has released a new report stating that Bitcoin is currently positioned at a critical support level and the next few weeks will determine whether BTC can sustain its momentum and reach new record highs. According to the report, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience, rising more than 10% in the past week and outperforming traditional risk assets like the S&P 500. After weeks of volatility and low liquidity, Bitcoin has re-entered the lower end of the $94,000 range, a key level that previously saw it hit a new all-time high in January. Bitfinex attributes the recent recovery to a shift in macroeconomic sentiment, particularly the growing optimism that the U.S. government could implement tariff reduction measures. Such expectations have increased overall risk appetite in global markets. Related News: Are Bitcoin Holders Expecting an Upturn or a Downturn in the Current Situation? Data Revealed On-chain data also supports the positive outlook. Bitcoin has reclaimed its Short-Term Conservative Cost Basis level, currently around $92,900. This indicator is considered a critical threshold that separates bearish correction phases from renewed bullish momentum. Furthermore, the Supply Percentage in Profit metric has risen to 87.3%, indicating improved market health and increasing investor profitability. Despite the positive signs, Bitfinex warns that market sentiment has not yet reached a highly euphoric state. The coming weeks will be crucial: whether Bitcoin can maintain its recent gains will decide whether the market can start a new rally to new highs or whether a new corrective phase is on the horizon. *This is not investment advice.

Strong network upgrade catalysts and ETF developments make Ethereum and Litecoin important for traders alongside the growing interest in emerging tokens such as MAGACOIN FINANCE . Ethereum Bounces Toward $2K As Upgrade Nears During the recent days Ethereum experienced a significant price surge which propelled the cryptocurrency from its April low point at $1,386 up to its current trading range between $1,770 and $1,800. The market recovery happened after Q1 brought a steep price drop which eliminated most of 2024’s initial momentum. The upcoming Pectra upgrade scheduled for May 7 drives the market recovery of Ethereum. The upcoming major update will deliver major scalability and staking efficiency improvements which can drive Ethereum price growth in its upcoming phases. Analysts predict ETH will achieve a breakthrough to $2,000 if it establishes stable support above $1,800. Analysts track growing network activity together with improving market liquidity that demonstrates traders are becoming more active in the market. MAGACOIN FINANCE Establishes Its Place as a Top Early-Stage Altcoin Play of 2025 Early-stage altcoin investors in 2025 increasingly focus on MAGACOIN FINANCE despite Litecoin and Ethereum relying on robust fundamentals and institutional backing. The project’s rapid growth has brought in more than $7 million from investors while offering buyers a 50% discount on their purchases thus making it an attractive entry point for investors seeking early advantages. The early-stage altcoin MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the number one pick for investors to buy in 2025. The current market conditions provide broad entry opportunities yet the token sale operates swiftly while investors establish their positions before momentum reaches its peak. Early buyers who apply the current limited-time bonus code will create a realistic path to achieve 36x ROI according to analysts who base their prediction on expected launch prices and market listing developments. Investors who purchase now obtain discounted allocations before MAGACOIN FINANCE reveals itself to the public and price increases to the listing value. The opportunity is clear. The entry is now. Litecoin Pushes Higher Amid ETF Hype The cryptocurrency market has brought Litecoin back into focus after ETF-related advancements emerged. The U.S. SEC approved a new spot ETF proposal from Canary Capital which has generated speculation that LTC will become the third crypto asset to receive a U.S. ETF after Bitcoin and Ethereum. The LTC price has surged from $77 up to the $82–$85 range throughout this week while traders monitor the $85.19 technical level for potential breakthroughs. The current market momentum suggests some investors want to reach $100 but more aggressive predictions point to $130+ prices by May.

Global fund network Calastone is joining forces with blockchain technology leader Fireblocks to create a platform that could reshape how investment funds operate. This isn’t just another crypto headline; it’s about bringing the efficiency and innovation of blockchain to the massive, established world of asset management through Fund Tokenization . What is Fund Tokenization , Anyway? Think of Fund Tokenization as converting traditional investment fund units or shares into digital tokens on a blockchain. Instead of owning a piece of a fund represented by a paper certificate or a digital entry in a legacy system, you own a token on a blockchain like Ethereum or Polygon. Each token represents a fraction of the fund’s underlying assets. Why is this significant? Tokenization offers several potential advantages: Increased Efficiency: Automating processes like trading, settlement, and administration using smart contracts. Improved Liquidity: Potentially making it easier and faster to buy and sell fund units. Fractional Ownership: Enabling investors to own smaller pieces of high-value funds or assets. Enhanced Transparency: Leveraging the distributed ledger to provide a clear record of ownership and transactions. Bridging Worlds: The Calastone Fireblocks Partnership Explained This collaboration brings together two key players. Calastone is a well-established global funds transaction network, connecting asset managers, distributors, and other market participants. They process transactions worth trillions every month using their existing infrastructure. Fireblocks is a leading digital asset platform providing secure infrastructure for moving, storing, and issuing digital assets. The Calastone Fireblocks partnership aims to build a platform that leverages Calastone’s extensive network and Fireblocks’ expertise in secure digital asset technology. The goal is to allow asset managers to issue, manage, and process funds as tokens directly on blockchain networks. This creates a direct bridge between the traditional fund industry and the digital asset ecosystem, paving the way for more seamless Blockchain Finance operations within asset management. Why Are Traditional Institutions Eyeing Asset Tokenization and Institutional Crypto ? You might wonder why big financial players are suddenly interested in blockchain and tokenization. The simple answer is efficiency and potential cost savings. Traditional fund infrastructure can be complex, manual, and expensive. Processes like settlement often take days. Asset Tokenization on a blockchain can significantly reduce these times and costs. For large institutions dealing with high volumes, even small percentage savings translate into huge amounts. Furthermore, the growing maturity and regulatory clarity around digital assets are making Institutional Crypto adoption more feasible and attractive. Institutions see tokenization not just for cryptocurrencies, but as a new rail for traditional assets, offering greater control and programmability. Unlocking Potential: Benefits and Challenges of Blockchain Finance While the potential benefits of tokenizing funds are significant, it’s also important to look at the challenges. Potential Benefits: Faster Settlement: Potentially near-instantaneous settlement of fund trades compared to T+2 or T+3 in traditional markets. Reduced Operational Costs: Automation through smart contracts can lower administrative burdens. Increased Market Access: Lower barriers to entry for certain investors and easier cross-border transactions. Innovation in Fund Structures: Enabling new types of funds or investment strategies. Challenges to Address: Regulatory Clarity: Navigating different regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions for tokenized funds remains a key hurdle. Interoperability: Ensuring seamless interaction between different blockchains and traditional systems. Security: While Fireblocks specializes in security, the overall security of the blockchain network and smart contracts is paramount. Adoption Curve: Educating market participants and achieving widespread adoption across the industry. Custody Solutions: Developing robust and trusted solutions for holding tokenized fund assets. The success of platforms like the one Calastone and Fireblocks are building will depend on effectively addressing these challenges while demonstrating the tangible benefits of Blockchain Finance . What Does This Mean for the Future of Asset Management? The move by Calastone and Fireblocks is a strong signal that tokenization is not just a niche concept for cryptocurrencies, but a technology poised to integrate with mainstream finance. This platform has the potential to become a significant piece of infrastructure for the future of asset management. It suggests a future where trading fund units could be as easy as sending a token, where settlement risks are drastically reduced, and where new investment opportunities become accessible to a wider range of investors. While widespread adoption will take time, initiatives like this are crucial steps in building the necessary infrastructure and proving the concept at scale. The partnership between Calastone’s network and Fireblocks’ technology provides a compelling combination that could accelerate the adoption of tokenized funds globally.

The US stock market has opened higher, showing signs of upward momentum right from the start of trading. While you might be primarily focused on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the broader crypto landscape, movements in traditional markets like stocks often have a significant ripple effect. So, what does this positive opening in the US stock market today mean for your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive in. What’s Happening with the US Stock Market Today? The trading day kicked off with major indices posting gains. Here’s a quick look at the opening numbers: Index Change S&P 500 +0.07% NASDAQ +0% Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.2% While these initial moves might seem modest, a positive open sets the tone for the day and can reflect underlying investor sentiment. The S&P 500 , representing the performance of 500 of the largest US publicly traded companies, and the NASDAQ , heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, are particularly watched by crypto investors due to their perceived correlation with riskier assets. Understanding the Crypto Market Correlation For a long time, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies traded somewhat independently of traditional markets. However, as crypto has matured and attracted institutional investment, its price movements have shown an increasing crypto market correlation with major stock indices, especially the tech-heavy NASDAQ and the broader S&P 500. This is largely because investors often treat both tech stocks and cryptocurrencies as ‘risk-on’ assets. When economic outlook is positive and investors are feeling confident, they tend to put money into these higher-growth, potentially higher-reward assets. Conversely, during times of uncertainty or economic contraction, investors often retreat to ‘risk-off’ assets like bonds or gold, selling off stocks and crypto alike. Why the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Matter for Crypto The performance of the S&P 500 is often seen as a barometer for the overall health of the US economy and corporate profitability. A rising S&P 500 can signal strong economic conditions or positive future expectations, boosting investor confidence across the board. Similarly, the NASDAQ ‘s performance is crucial because many crypto investors are also interested in technology and innovation. The companies listed on the NASDAQ often represent the cutting edge of technology, and their performance can reflect broader market appetite for disruptive technologies, which crypto certainly falls under. A strong opening for these indices suggests that, at least for now, traditional market participants are in a ‘risk-on’ mood. This sentiment can easily spill over into the crypto markets, potentially encouraging investment and positive price action for digital assets. What Does This Positive US Stock Market Open Mean for Your Crypto Investments? A higher open in the US stock market is generally considered a positive signal for the crypto market, reinforcing the potential for a continued or strengthening crypto market correlation . Here are a few potential implications: Improved Sentiment: Positive momentum in stocks can boost overall investor confidence, making them more likely to allocate capital to riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Potential for Price Uplift: While not a direct guarantee, a strong stock market day can create a favorable environment that supports upward price movements in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Reinforced Correlation: Today’s move further highlights the interconnectedness of global markets. Crypto investors need to pay attention to macro indicators and traditional market performance. However, it’s crucial to remember that correlation is not causation. The crypto market has its own unique drivers, including technological developments, regulatory news, and specific adoption trends. While a positive stock market provides a tailwind, it doesn’t eliminate volatility or the possibility of price corrections driven by crypto-specific factors. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the positive start to the stock market today , what should crypto investors consider? Monitor the Correlation: Keep an eye on how Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies react throughout the day. Does the positive stock momentum translate into crypto gains? Watch Key Levels: Pay attention to key support and resistance levels for your crypto assets. Positive sentiment from stocks might help push prices through resistance. Stay Informed on Macro News: Continue to follow major economic announcements, Federal Reserve commentary, and global events, as these influence both traditional and crypto markets. Manage Risk: Even with positive signals, market conditions can change rapidly. Ensure your portfolio is diversified and your risk management strategy is in place. Challenges and What Could Change the Tide While the opening is positive, the market day is long, and sentiment can shift. Potential challenges include: Incoming Data: Unexpected economic data released later in the day could alter market mood. Fed Commentary: Any statements from Federal Reserve officials could impact interest rate expectations and risk appetite. Global Events: Geopolitical developments or news from other major economies can influence market direction. Crypto-Specific News: Regulatory crackdowns, exchange issues, or major hacks could cause a crypto downturn regardless of stock performance. Therefore, while the positive US stock market open is a hopeful sign, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Concluding Thoughts The US stock market today has opened on a positive note, with the S&P 500 and NASDAQ showing early strength. This development is significant for crypto investors due to the increasing crypto market correlation with traditional risk assets. A rising tide in stocks often lifts boats in the crypto market by boosting overall investor sentiment and risk appetite. While this positive start offers hopeful signs, smart investors will remain vigilant, monitor market reactions, and consider the full spectrum of factors influencing both traditional and digital asset markets.

According to data from Web3 research firm Nansen, Tether’s USDt continues to lead among US dollar-pegged stablecoins, even as competition intensifies. As of April 25, Tether ( USDT ) has a roughly 66% market share among stablecoins, compared to around 28% for USDC ( USDC ), Nansen said in the April 25 report. Ethena’s USDe stablecoin ranks a distant third, touting a market share of just over 2%. Nansen expects Tether’s lead to endure even as rivals such as USDC clock faster growth rates. “With nearly 3x as many users as Uniswap and 50+% more transactions than the next app, Tether is by and far the largest use case of onchain activity,” Nansen said. “Despite the potential dispersion in stables, we inevitably believe this is a ‘winner-takes-most’ market dynamic,” the Web3 researcher added. Tether has 66% of stablecoin market share. Source: Nansen Tether is also the most profitable stablecoin issuer , clocking nearly $14 billion in 2024 profits. The company earns revenue by accepting US dollars to mint USDT and subsequently investing those dollars into highly liquid, yield-bearing instruments such as US Treasury bills. “Given the growth of USDT and USDC, the users are clearly expressing that they do not necessarily care about the yield as they are forgoing it to Tether and Circle -they simply want access to the most liquid and ‘stable’/ least-likely-to-depeg stablecoin out there,” Nansen said. USDC has seen faster growth than USDT since November. Source: Nansen Competitive landscape Adoption of USDC has accelerated since November, when US President Donald Trump’s election victory ushered in a more favorable US regulatory environment for crypto, Nansen said. Circle’s US-regulated stablecoin has been “particularly attractive to institutions requiring regulatory clarity,” the report said. But USDC now faces “intensifying competition as major traditional financial institutions (i.e., Fidelity, PayPal, and banks) enter the market,” Nansen said, adding that stablecoins, including PayPal’s PYUSD and Ripple USD, are “rapidly gaining traction.” On April 25, payment processor Stripe tipped plans to create a new stablecoin product of its own after buying stablecoin platform Bridge last year. Despite its smaller market share, Ethena's yield-bearing USDe stablecoin remains “competitive on most fronts moving forward,” partly because of integrations across centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, the report said. Since launching in 2024, Ethena’s stablecoin has generated an average annualized yield of approximately 19%, according to Ethena’s website.

Exciting news from the world of crypto finance! Hardware wallet giant Ledger has teamed up with DeFi platform Kiln to bring stablecoin yield opportunities directly into the familiar and trusted environment of Ledger Live . This integration is set to change how many users approach earning crypto passive income . Unlock Earning Potential with Ledger Live Stablecoin Yield For years, Ledger has been synonymous with secure self-custody of digital assets. Their Ledger Live application serves as the central hub for managing various cryptocurrencies held on their hardware wallets. Now, they’re adding a powerful new dimension: the ability to earn yield on your stablecoins without ever having to transfer them out of your hardware wallet’s protection. This is a significant step towards making DeFi accessible and safer for a broader audience. The collaboration with Kiln, a leading platform in institutional staking and yield, enables this seamless integration. By leveraging established DeFi lending protocols, users can now deposit stablecoins like USDC, USDT, DAI, and USDS directly through the Ledger Live interface and start earning a return. How Does Self Custody Stablecoin Yield Work? The core principle here is maintaining self custody . Unlike depositing funds onto a centralized exchange or lending platform where you give up control of your private keys, this new feature allows you to interact with DeFi protocols directly from your Ledger device. Your private keys, which control access to your funds, never leave the hardware wallet. This significantly mitigates counterparty risk, a major concern in the crypto space. Here’s a simplified breakdown: You connect your Ledger hardware wallet to your computer or phone. You open the Ledger Live application. Within Ledger Live, you navigate to the new yield feature powered by Kiln. You select the stablecoin you wish to deposit (USDC, USDT, DAI, or USDS). You initiate the deposit transaction, which is signed securely on your Ledger device. Your stablecoins are then deployed into audited and established DeFi lending protocols facilitated by Kiln. You start earning yield, which accrues over time and can typically be tracked within Ledger Live. When you want to withdraw your funds and earned yield, you initiate the transaction via Ledger Live, and it is again signed securely on your hardware wallet, returning the assets to your self-custodied address. This process ensures that at no point do you need to trust a third party with your private keys, upholding the fundamental principle of decentralization and self-sovereignty that hardware wallets provide. What Kind of Crypto Passive Income Can You Expect? According to reports, the initial yield rates offered through this integration range from 5% to 9.9% APY. This range is competitive within the stablecoin yield landscape, offering a potentially attractive return compared to traditional savings accounts or even some centralized crypto lending platforms (which carry higher counterparty risk). The specific yield you earn can fluctuate based on market conditions within the underlying DeFi lending protocols. Demand for borrowing stablecoins drives up lending rates, while increased supply can push them down. The quoted range provides an estimate based on current market dynamics. Let’s look at the stablecoins supported: USDC (USD Coin): A widely used stablecoin issued by Circle and Coinbase, typically considered highly regulated and transparent. USDT (Tether): The largest stablecoin by market cap, though it has faced scrutiny regarding its reserves in the past. Still a dominant force in DeFi. DAI (Dai): A decentralized stablecoin collateralized by a mix of other cryptocurrencies, managed by the MakerDAO protocol. USDS (Saga Digital Dollar): A newer stablecoin project aiming for greater transparency and regulation. Offering yield on these major stablecoins provides users with flexibility based on their preference and trust in each asset. Benefits of Earning Stablecoin Yield with Ledger Live This new feature presents several compelling advantages for Ledger users interested in generating crypto passive income : Enhanced Security: The primary benefit is maintaining self custody . Your private keys remain secure on your Ledger device, drastically reducing the risk of loss due to exchange hacks or platform failures. Convenience: Earn yield directly within the familiar Ledger Live interface, eliminating the need to navigate complex DeFi protocols or third-party platforms. Accessibility: Makes DeFi yield opportunities more accessible to users who might be intimidated by direct interaction with web3 wallets and dApps. Risk Mitigation (Partial): While DeFi lending always carries inherent risks (smart contract bugs, liquidation risks for borrowers), interacting via Ledger Live and established partners like Kiln on potentially audited protocols can add layers of confidence compared to lesser-known platforms. Potential for Higher Returns: The offered rates are generally higher than traditional finance options. Are There Any Risks? Addressing DeFi Lending Concerns It’s crucial to remember that while Ledger Live and self custody enhance security against counterparty risk, interacting with DeFi lending protocols is not risk-free. Users should be aware of the following potential challenges: Smart Contract Risk: The underlying lending protocols are governed by smart contracts. Bugs or vulnerabilities in these contracts could potentially lead to loss of funds. While Kiln likely integrates with established, audited protocols, this risk can never be entirely eliminated. Yield Volatility: The 5-9.9% APY is a variable rate. It can change based on market demand for borrowing stablecoins. There’s no guarantee the rate will remain high. Protocol Insolvency: Although less common with major lending protocols, there’s a theoretical risk that if borrowers default on a massive scale or other systemic issues arise within the protocol, lenders could face losses. Stablecoin De-pegging Risk: While stablecoins aim to maintain a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, extreme market conditions or issues with the stablecoin issuer could cause a temporary or permanent de-pegging, affecting the value of your principal. Users should do their own research (DYOR) into the specific protocols used and understand these risks before depositing funds. Getting Started: Actionable Insights If you’re a Ledger user with stablecoins and are interested in this feature, here’s what you might need to do: Ensure your Ledger Live application and Ledger device firmware are updated to the latest versions. Check the ‘Discover’ or ‘Market’ section within Ledger Live for the integrated Kiln/Stablecoin Yield feature. Read through the specific terms, conditions, and risk disclosures presented within the application for the yield service. Transfer the supported stablecoins (USDC, USDT, DAI, USDS) to your Ledger address. Follow the steps within Ledger Live to deposit your chosen stablecoin into the yield protocol. Remember that confirming the transaction will require interaction with your Ledger hardware wallet. Monitor your earned yield and principal directly within the Ledger Live interface. Start with a small amount you are comfortable risking to understand the process and observe the yield fluctuations before committing larger sums. Conclusion: A Secure Path to Crypto Passive Income? The integration of stablecoin yield farming directly into Ledger Live via the partnership with Kiln represents a significant step forward for making crypto passive income more accessible and potentially more secure for mainstream users. By allowing users to earn competitive rates on their stablecoins while maintaining full self custody through their hardware wallet, Ledger is bridging the gap between the security of hardware wallets and the opportunities within DeFi lending . While the risks inherent in DeFi protocols themselves remain, this integration drastically reduces counterparty risk and simplifies the user experience. For Ledger users holding stablecoins, this new feature offers a compelling way to potentially grow their assets without compromising on the core principle of digital asset ownership.

While this is great for the market as a whole, there’s even more to be excited about. It is Ruvi AI , the project that isn’t just riding the wave of optimism; it’s creating a path for investors to make big returns. If you want to take full advantage of the market’s momentum, Ruvi AI has the kind of growth potential to outperform even the top cryptos. With a presale in full swing and a defined bonus structure, Ruvi AI is for investors ready to strike. Market Trends Indicate Opportunity SUI’s recent performance shows how trends can move the market, from rising prices to growing interest in DeFi. SUI’s price increase is a result of renewed confidence driven by ecosystem growth and fundamental developments like higher trading volumes and stronger infrastructure. This means a broader market trend where innovation and utility is driving success. Ruvi AI fits into this narrative, an advanced combination of blockchain and AI to solve real world problems. As the market is in an optimistic phase, Ruvi AI stands out not just for innovation but for the potential to reward early investors big time. Ruvi AI’s VIP Tier Bonuses Ruvi AI is getting a lot of attention with its structured presale bonuses from VIP Tier 1 to Tier 5. VIP 2 is a great entry point for new investors. With a $500 investment during the presale they get 50,000 tokens at $0.01 each. VIP Tier 2 gives them a 40% bonus automatically so they get 20,000 more tokens for a total of 70,000 tokens. When Ruvi AI lists at $0.07 that $500 investment will be worth $4,900, a 10x return. But it doesn’t stop there. If Ruvi AI reaches its projected token value of $1 that same investment will be worth $70,000, a 11,900% return. Get in early. Ruvi AI goes beyond traditional investment structures by introducing leaderboard rewards. This feature encourages active participation and creates a strong community. For example the investors who end up on the leaderboard will not only get governance rights but also additional tokens. This not only incentivizes involvement but builds a tight knit community of early adopters. Each leaderboard entrant becomes part of Ruvi AI’s success story. Why Ruvi AI While SUI’s performance is great, it’s a reminder of the kind of opportunities the crypto market can bring. But Ruvi AI offers more. It connects blockchain with AI to solve problems across industries, healthcare, automation and creative analytics. So its value isn’t just speculative, it’s tied to real world applications and use cases. Ruvi AI’s presale aligns with the growing market sentiment that rewards utility and innovation. Projects that ensure usability and deliver measurable results are becoming the favorite of both institutional and retail investors. Timing is Everything Ruvi AI is in the sweet spot of this moving landscape, with presale bonuses, leaderboard rewards and token projections that set it apart. If the early ROI of Ruvi AI’s presale is anything to go by, those who move fast will get big returns. Ruvi AI is not just an investment, it’s a strategic opportunity to be part of something big because of the price hikes and community rewards. The crypto space is hot but Ruvi AI is not a flash in the pan. It’s a calculated chance to be part of a project with the vision and structure to deliver short and long term value. If you want to make the most of this bull run, Ruvi AI is waiting for you. Get in now.

Investor Optimism Fuels Momentum, But One ETH Rival Still Looks Like A More Solid Bet",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/will-ethereum-eth-reach-3000-soon-investor-optimism-fuels-momentum-but-one-eth-rival-still-looks-like-a-more-solid-bet/,"Ethereum (ETH) regains momentum during its recovery from $1,564 to rise above the fundamental support at $2000. Technical analysis signals a potential rise towards $2800 if breakout momentum occurs after rallying 14.6% in the last 7 days. Ethereum stands to achieve its $3,000 goal in 2025 because of the upcoming Pectra upgrade as well as increasing interest after the Bitcoin halving event. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a top contender through its successful presale achievement of $7.1 million and acquisition of 9,000 owners. The structured DeFi model of this platform presents users with a promising opportunity to earn more returns. Does this rising asset possess enough potential to surpass Ethereum’s growth trajectory? Ethereum’s (ETH) Path to $3,000 The values of Ethereum show strength as the cryptocurrency holds its position above $1750 which stands as an essential benchmark for bullish market views. An analysis of the MACD shows negative signals yet the RSI indicator signals market space that could trigger buying actions from investors. The market can potentially surge to $1,800 and subsequently move toward $2500 if $2000 breaks and macroeconomic factors remain favorable. The Pectra upgrade looms as a catalyst, promising lower fees and faster transactions. Market activity shows little change because traders are being patient as they wait for an indicator of market momentum. The short-term forecast for Ethereum is complicated by Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI) network competition combined with delayed upgrades which reduces the likelihood of reaching $3,000 at this time. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to gain popularity in phase 4 among its 11-stage presale where tokens sell at $0.025 apiece. The project accumulated $7.1 million when 421 million tokens reached the hands of 9,000 investors who showed strong market interest. During Phase 5 investors will receive a 20% profit as the price rises from $0.025 to $0.03. After listing at $0.06 the product offers investors a 140% return on investment. After the launch date analysts predict a token value of $2.50 which provides early investors with a 9,900% return on investment. Certik has audited smart contracts and the team plans to reveal those audit results to social channels to enhance investor trust. Innovative Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers unique decentralized lending services through its platform that allows users to obtain passive revenue while securing access to cash through loans backed by excess collateral. Users can transfer their mtTokens along with mtETH between different DeFi platforms because they generate interest. The platform obtains revenue to repurchase tokens through its buy-and-distribute mechanism which benefits stakers by creating sustained token demand. The platform just launched an executive dashboard which demonstrates the top 50 investors who obtain reward tokens by sustaining their rankings that encourages community bonding. Phase 4 starts to sell rapidly therefore investors need to purchase shares at this time to benefit from price appreciation. Seizing DeFi’s Future The projected $3,000 value for Ethereum requires resistance breakdown alongside software improvements while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a more ambitious opportunity. The project secured its position as a top DeFi leader when its presale successfully generated $7.1 million from investors who experienced a 140% launch return. After its launch the projected $2.50 price will produce explosive growth which will surpass Ethereum’s steady price increase. Investors seeking high-yield opportunities should explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now. Visit Mutuum Finance to join phase 4 before it closes.

43919197,https://blockworks.co/news/lawsuit-crypto-firms-confidential-info-sharing,1745877611,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,‘All sizzle and no steak:’ 2 rival crypto firms duke it out in a court case,https://blockworks.co/news/lawsuit-crypto-firms-confidential-info-sharing,"If you haven’t heard, there’s a huge court battle playing out between two HR and payroll services rivals, Rippling and Deel (they’re both suing each other). So, what does this have to do with our industry? Well, there’s a separate ongoing court case happening between two crypto companies. It’s a little complicated, so bear with me. In December of last year — so before Rippling filed its suit — Toku accused its rival firm, Liquifi, and its new general counsel, Benjamin Snipes, of stealing thousands of files containing sensitive business information after Snipes left Toku on not-so-pleasant terms. The lawsuit claims that Snipes wanted a promotion at Toku but didn’t get it, so he quit to work for a firm outside of crypto, only to pop up at Liquifi a couple of months later. (In Snipes’s affidavit, he confirmed he temporarily left crypto after Toku, calling it a “toxic work environment.”) Coincidence? Toku doesn’t seem to think so. And, from what I’ve heard, these firms operate in a very small subsection of crypto. There are four big players: Toku, Liquifi, Magna and Pulley. Then there are a few smaller firms that may have some overlap. Toku is a platform built for tax and payroll compliance through a crypto lens, while Liquifi seeks to automate token vesting (in their words, building the “Carta of crypto”) so you can see where the two compete. On one hand, we have Toku arguing that it found — through an investigation — that Snipes downloaded company documents before his “heated departure.” Since then, Toku alleges that the two have used the information for their business and engaged in “a campaign of outright lies about Toku in the marketplace.” A person familiar with the sector told me that Benjamin Snipes also applied for a demo at Magna back in September of last year, which would have been right before Snipes joined Liquifi. According to his LinkedIn, Liquifi officially onboarded Snipes in October 2024. Snipes confirmed that to me. He added that the demo happened before he spoke with Liquifi, explaining that he was just consulting at the time. According to court documents, Snipes was “terminated” from Liquifi in the wake of the lawsuit. Toku, he said, “hurt” his reputation, which has since made it difficult for him to find work. Liquifi, meanwhile, says that Toku’s “claims are all sizzle and no steak.” Instead, it says that it was once a takeover target for Toku, but the relationship soured after those talks fell through. Now here’s the thing: The case, while filed back in December, is still in discovery (which is when both sides exchange relevant information ahead of a potential trial to prepare for arguments). But Toku was handed a defeat on Friday when a judge denied its motion to grant a preliminary injunction, which would have essentially handcuffed Liquifi. However, the case is still ongoing. “The court’s verdict speaks loudly: It rejected outright all of the relief sought by Toku against Liquifi at this preliminary injunction stage, validating and confirming what we have always known. Liquifi has always stood for fair competition and innovation over litigation,” Liquifi told me. “For months, we remained silent out of respect for the legal process. The court has now seen through Toku’s storytelling and we are pleased to move forward and stay focused on our product, customers and partners.” Meanwhile, Toku told me: “The allegations presented in this filing are disturbing and provide shocking documentary evidence of Liquifi and Deel’s behavior in this matter. It’s even more troubling that this information only scratches the surface as we are in early stages of litigation. We will continue to learn about what happened and how files stolen from Toku were used in a failed attempt to destroy our business.” “The true nature of their unethical and appalling actions has still not been fully uncovered. We take the protection of our trade secrets and confidentiality very seriously and are committed to pursuing the appropriate steps to deliver justice as the process moves forward,” a Toku spokesperson told me. Prior to the court decision on Friday, Toku — in its attempt to convince a judge to rule in its favor on the motion — filed a 74-page brief bringing another player into the mix. This is where Deel comes into play. Liquifi and Deel entered into a partnership last year, the court documents claimed. “Liquifi is one of the vendor options for the small percentage of Deel’s customers that require token management, a service we do not offer. Working with a skilled vendor to provide complementary services to our product suite is not only standard industry practice, but good business sense,” a Deel spokesperson told me. Deel and Toku are unlikely competitors: competing not on the crypto level, but as employer of record service providers (which is when a service provider acts as the legal employer for a company’s employees when they’re based in a different country and the company doesn’t have a legal entity). Deel, according to the filings, sought to “crush” Toku. The alleged spy , Keith O’Brien, was also mentioned in the filing after reportedly applying to work at the firm four times. “O’Brien’s quest for a Toku position halted approximately when he began his ‘spying’ at Rippling on behalf of Deel,” the filing said. I asked Deel about O’Brien and its mention in the ongoing case, to which a spokesperson told me: “We cannot comment on another company’s litigation but understand that the court denied Toku’s request for a preliminary injunction last Friday.” “Liquifi has many other partners. This is clearly an attempt to attach a months-old lawsuit to a completely unrelated news cycle. And it’s worth noting that Quinn Emmanuel, the law firm in this case, also represents a company in active litigation against Deel,” they added. Liquifi, in its response document, didn’t dispute that Deel wanted to “crush” Toku, but noted in a footnote it didn’t mean that Liquifi would use confidential information to do so. And, according to the filings, “the parties entered into a search-and-destroy Protocol that will wipe all Toku documents from Liquifi’s systems, meaning that there is no risk of Liquifi accessing any documents on a going-forward basis.​​” As for how this case plays out, it’s early yet.

The company said today it will offer merchants the choice to accept stablecoin payments. To make that possible, Mastercard is teaming up with the payments processor Nuvei and the coin issuers Circle and Paxos. This shift came after U.S. lawmakers introduced the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act . The bipartisan bill passed a Senate committee in March and seeks to set ground rules for dollar-pegged crypto tokens. Standard Chartered Bank, in a recent note, said the global stablecoin market could rise to $2 trillion within three years once the legislation takes effect. “With increasing global regulatory clarity, stablecoins are evolving from crypto trading tools to essential solutions that bring efficiency and programmability to payments, disbursements, and remittances,” the payment processor said in its press release . Mastercard will work with OKX to launch a new card Alongside the settlement option, Mastercard disclosed a plan with the crypto exchange OKX to issue a new card. The payment processor already works with MetaMask, Kraken, Gemini, Bybit, Crypto.com, Binance, Monavate, and Bleap. The OKX Card by Mastercard will give customers direct access to their crypto balances. OKX said connecting its trading platform and Web3 tools to Mastercard’s network should make it easier to use stablecoins for everyday shopping. The firm has revealed plans to enable stablecoin spending using traditional cards at more than 150 million merchant locations. On the business side, settlement is expanding through Nuvei and Circle. Merchants will be able to receive proceeds in Circle’s USD Coin, regardless of which payment method shoppers choose at checkout. A similar path is being prepared for tokens issued by Paxos. To smooth cross-border transfers, Mastercard has rolled out Crypto Credential . Users on partner exchanges such as Wirex, Bit2Me, Lirium, Notabene, Coins.ph, and Mercado Bitcoin can send or receive digital money with simple usernames. The payment processor also introduced the Multi-Token Network, or MTN, that ties ordinary deposit accounts to tokenized assets. Partners, including Ondo Finance, plus banks such as JPMorgan and Standard Chartered, are connected to MTN to test stablecoin and other digital assets.

Launched in 2020, XAUT is a digital asset pegged to the price of one ounce of physical gold. According to the new press release from Tether, each token represents direct ownership of gold bars held in secured Swiss vaults. Says Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether, “Tether Gold continues to demonstrate the strength and resilience of gold as a store of value, especially in times of economic uncertainty. With XAUT, we’re offering users the ability to access the security of physical gold in a digital form—secure, easily transferable, and backed 1:1 by fully held gold reserves. It’s part of our broader commitment to building financial tools that combine the best of traditional assets with the efficiency of blockchain technology.” The disclosure comes amid ongoing scrutiny over stablecoin reserve transparency throughout the cryptocurrency industry. The company added that third-party custodians regularly audit its gold reserves to ensure they match the number of XAUT tokens in circulation. Tether has not disclosed specific details about its vault locations, citing security concerns. Last month, Tether hired a new chief financial officer (CFO) and committed to completing a full audit.

What to watch: — Ron Hammond (@RonwHammond) April 28, 2025 According to the Blockchain Association’s Sr. Director of Government Relations and Institutional Engagement, Ron Hammond, it appears that “the other crypto legislative priority of market structure will be released in the coming days” in a bid to bring forward “clear regulation and registration” for the crypto sector. While no speakers have been announced for the May 6 committee hearing, Hammond alleges that there will be “many in and out of the crypto industry who will have a wide variety of views on the bill.” “Unlike past efforts though, this bill has a very good chance of getting signed into law, so text matters,” Hammond says. U.S. Crypto Regulation Begins To Shift News of the upcoming hearing comes just one week after newly-confirmed United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Paul Atkins reaffirmed his commitment to enacting balanced crypto regulations at his April 21 swearing-in ceremony. “Through a rational, coherent, and principled approach, we will work to ensure that the United States is the best and most secure place in the world to do business,” Atkins said. Atkins’ confirmation as SEC head marks a stark shift away from the agency’s previous regulation-by-enforcement approach to cryptocurrencies under former SEC chair Gary Gensler. In recent months, the federal regulator has dropped lawsuits against several key players in the crypto industry including Kraken, Coinbase, and more. Congress, who reconvened on Monday after a two-week recess, will likely focus their efforts on Trump’s consequential budget bill before hashing out the details of digital asset legislation.

Just as the network evolved through The Merge, another significant step is on the horizon: the Fusaka upgrade. This next major Ethereum upgrade is generating considerable discussion, primarily due to the inclusion of the EVM Object Format, known as EOF. Let’s break down what this means for the future of Ethereum smart contracts and the network as a whole. Understanding the Ethereum Upgrade Landscape: What is Fusaka? The Fusaka upgrade is the next planned hard fork for the Ethereum network, following previous upgrades like Shanghai/Capella and Cancun/Deneb. These upgrades are crucial for introducing new features, improving performance, and enhancing the security of the blockchain. While the exact contents of Fusaka are still being finalized, a key component announced by the Ethereum Foundation’s Tomasz Kajetan Stańczak is the EVM Object Format (EOF). The target timeline for this major Fusaka upgrade is currently set for late 2025, specifically in Q3 or Q4. Deep Dive into EOF Ethereum: The EVM Object Format Explained So, what exactly is EOF Ethereum ? At its core, EOF is a proposed standard for structuring the bytecode of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Think of bytecode as the low-level instructions that the EVM executes when you interact with a smart contract. Currently, Ethereum smart contract bytecode exists as a raw, unstructured sequence of bytes. EOF aims to change this by introducing a defined format with headers and sections. This new structure is intended to bring several advantages, primarily centered around improving the efficiency and predictability of code execution on the EVM. By giving the bytecode a clear format, the network can perform static analysis more easily, meaning it can check certain properties of the code *before* it’s executed. This can lead to better tooling for developers and potentially safer smart contracts. Unpacking the Benefits of the EVM Upgrade The proposed EVM upgrade via EOF brings several key benefits: Improved Static Analysis: With a structured format, tools can more reliably inspect contract code without executing it. This helps identify potential issues early. Enhanced Code Verification: The structure allows for easier verification that the bytecode is well-formed and adheres to certain rules, reducing the risk of deploying malformed contracts. Simplified Future EVM Changes: By having a standardized format, introducing future opcodes (EVM instructions) or features becomes less complex, as they can be designed to work within the EOF structure. Potential for Gas Efficiency: While not a direct, guaranteed outcome for all contracts, the improved structure and analysis capabilities could pave the way for future gas cost optimizations. Enhanced Security (Dynamic Jumps): A specific security improvement tied to EOF is the phasing out of certain dynamic jump instructions. These instructions, which allow contract execution to jump to arbitrary points in the code based on runtime data, have historically been a source of vulnerabilities. Restricting or removing them makes the control flow of smart contracts more predictable and thus more secure. These benefits collectively aim to make the EVM a more robust, predictable, and secure environment for running complex applications. Are There Downsides? Criticisms of the Fusaka Upgrade Despite the intended benefits, the inclusion of EOF in the Fusaka upgrade hasn’t been met with universal acclaim. Some developers have voiced criticism, arguing that the EOF specification introduces unnecessary complexity. The process of converting existing contracts to the new format or developing new contracts with EOF requires adjustments and learning. Critics suggest that the complexity added might outweigh the benefits for certain use cases or could slow down development for some teams. This perspective highlights the ongoing tension in blockchain development between introducing powerful new features and maintaining simplicity and ease of use for the developer community. It’s a valid point of discussion within the Ethereum ecosystem as the upgrade progresses. Impact on Ethereum Smart Contracts and Developers For developers working with Ethereum smart contracts , the EOF upgrade represents a significant shift. While existing contracts deployed before the upgrade will likely remain functional (backward compatibility is a priority), new contracts or updates to existing ones will need to conform to the EOF standard. This requires developers to update their tooling and potentially adjust their coding practices. Actionable Insights for Developers: Stay informed about the final EOF specification as it evolves. Begin exploring development tools and libraries that support EOF. Consider how your existing contracts might be affected if you plan future updates. Participate in testing on Ethereum testnets once EOF implementations are available. For users, the impact will be less direct initially. The benefits of improved efficiency and security will manifest over time as more contracts adopt the new format. However, awareness of major network changes is always valuable for anyone interacting with the network. Pros and Cons of the EOF Upgrade To summarize the discussion, here’s a quick look at the potential upsides and downsides of the EOF component of the Fusaka upgrade: Pros Cons Improved EVM Efficiency Adds complexity for developers Enhanced Security (e.g., restricting dynamic jumps) Requires tooling updates Better Static Analysis of Code Potential learning curve for existing teams Simplified Future EVM Development Criticism of being ‘over-engineered’ Easier Code Verification Looking Ahead to Late 2025 The Q3 or Q4 2025 timeline for the Fusaka upgrade, including the significant EOF changes, gives the community time to prepare. Network upgrades on Ethereum are complex processes involving extensive research, development, testing, and coordination across various client teams and stakeholders. The timeline is a target and subject to change based on the progress of development and testing. Conclusion: A Step Towards a More Refined EVM The Fusaka upgrade and its central component, the EVM Object Format (EOF), represent a crucial step in the ongoing refinement of the Ethereum network. While introducing new complexities for developers, the potential benefits in terms of EVM efficiency, smart contract security, and the long-term maintainability of the network are significant. As the target date in late 2025 approaches, the focus will be on testing, tooling development, and ensuring a smooth transition for the ecosystem. This Ethereum upgrade underscores the network’s commitment to continuous improvement, aiming to provide a more robust and secure platform for decentralized applications and Ethereum smart contracts .
