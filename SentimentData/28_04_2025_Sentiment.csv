Between market rallies and wild presale activity, everyone’s got their eye on that next crypto to explode. While some tokens ride the hype, others build tech that solves real-world pain points—and that’s where things get real interesting. Take Qubetics, for example. It’s not just riding the wave. It’s making it. With over 509 million $TICS tokens sold, 25,200+ holders, and more than $16.4 million raised in crypto presale stage 31, this isn’t just hype—it’s traction. At just $0.1902 per $TICS, some folks are loading up for what could be a breakout year. Now, let’s not forget Maker and Binance. Both powerhouses in their own lanes. Maker’s locking horns with real-world asset backing, while Binance keeps expanding its empire across regions and regulations. But Qubetics? It’s rewriting the rulebook. What’s coming next is a look at how each of these three could be the next crypto to explode, where they stand right now, and why one of them might just flip the script on blockchain as to know it. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain Utility in 2025 Qubetics isn’t trying to copy what came before—it’s filling the gaps left wide open. Built for everyday people, business pros, and devs, its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet and Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace put real usability in your hands. Qubetics is rolling out a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, a feature making waves across blockchain forums and crypto Reddit. Why does it matter? Because converting physical or traditional assets (like property deeds, invoices, or contracts) into secure digital tokens is unlocking new economies. Unlike past attempts that lacked user-friendly execution, Qubetics keeps things intuitive. Here’s what sets it apart: Seamless access via its multi-chain wallet Built-in security audits and compliance layers Tools tailored for freelancers, SMBs, and global firms On-chain transparency for legal clarity and dispute resolution Quick asset liquidity with minimal middlemen Beyond its marketplace, Qubetics’ presale stats alone scream traction: Stage: 31 $TICS Token Price: $0.1902 Tokens Sold: 509M+ Holders: 25,200+ Raised: $16.4M+ Some blockchain analysts have weighed in too. With mainnet launch around the corner, $TICS at $1 could yield a 425% ROI, $5 brings 2527%, and if it hits $15—you’re staring at 7783% ROI. But here’s the kicker—Qubetics is focused on function over fanfare. Add in cross-chain compatibility, mobile-ready features, and dev-friendly APIs, and this thing’s not just surviving—it’s building. Maker: Solid, Stable, and All About Real-World Assets Maker’s always played the long game. One of the OGs in decentralized finance (DeFi), MakerDAO’s bread and butter is Dai—the algorithmic stablecoin backed by collateralized assets. But in 2025, Maker’s doing more than keeping things stable—it’s doubling down on Real-World Asset (RWA) integration. Recent reports on MakerDAO’s Endgame Plan reveal the protocol is actively working with fintech partners to onboard traditional assets like bonds, invoices, and real estate-backed instruments into the ecosystem. Still, it’s not without hurdles. Regulatory uncertainties, rising competition in stablecoins, and limited user interface innovation have held it back from being that next crypto to explode. While it’s trustworthy and proven, the lack of everyday user appeal may keep it more niche than mass-market. Yet for those looking at risk-minimized exposure in the blockchain space? Maker’s still a heavyweight. Binance: The CeFi Titan Keeping the Pressure On Binance is like that tech billionaire who just won’t sit down. Love it or hate it, Binance is everywhere. From NFTs to DeFi to its own BNB Chain, it’s more than just an exchange now—it’s infrastructure. And here’s what’s got folks buzzing in 2025: BNB Greenfield, a decentralized storage and data solution that’s gaining traction among Web3 app builders. Binance is pushing to dominate beyond just buying/selling crypto—now it wants to own how data flows across blockchain. But it’s not all smooth sailing. Centralized exchange tokens like BNB are facing pressure from DeFi protocols and regulatory authorities. Questions around asset custody and internal governance transparency still loom. Still, BNB remains a top-5 token by market cap and consistently ranks in high daily trading volumes. If Binance keeps innovating while navigating the legal maze? It might just reclaim the crown as the next crypto to explode. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: Why It Matters One of the hottest topics in 2025? Real-world asset tokenization. Here’s why it’s taking over headlines: Makes global trade frictionless Enables partial ownership of expensive assets (like real estate) Provides transparent, immutable records on-chain Opens access to financing for underserved markets Cuts out middlemen and legal complexity Qubetics is going all-in on this. While others are talking theory, Qubetics has built the pipes. From its cross-chain compatibility to legal-grade smart contracts, it’s turning buzzwords into blueprints. For businesses in Central Asia or small-time operators in Canada? This kind of infrastructure is a game-changer. Real-world tokenization isn’t just a feature—it’s the future of finance. And Qubetics isn’t waiting around. Conclusion Crypto hype comes and goes, but tech that solves actual problems? That’s where the gold’s at. Qubetics is digging into that goldmine with a tokenization platform and tools that actually work. Maker’s playing it smart and secure, and Binance? Well, it’s still the big dog making bold moves. Looking at the facts, traction, and what’s being built—not just talked about—Qubetics might just be the next crypto to explode . Don’t sit on the sidelines watching others scoop up what could be one of blockchain’s biggest plays in 2025. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics Frequently Asked Questions What is Qubetics’ Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace? It’s a platform that turns real-world assets like contracts and property into secure, tradable digital tokens. How does $TICS compare to Maker’s Dai in 2025? $TICS offers growth potential and real-world use cases, while Dai focuses on price stability through collateral. Is Binance still a safe bet after regulatory challenges? Yes, Binance has regained momentum by securing licenses in 15+ countries and launching new Web3 solutions. What’s the current price of Qubetics $TICS token? As of Stage 31, $TICS is priced at $0.1902 with over 509 million tokens sold. Which crypto project is solving real business problems in 2025? Qubetics leads with tools like a multi-chain wallet and asset tokenization for global SMBs.

According to SMQKE, Digital Commodities Capital Corp. (CSE: RIPP), a publicly traded company, has officially confirmed holding XRP in its corporate treasury, marking the first public disclosure of XRP holdings by a listed firm. The company’s announcement revealed that it currently holds 103,000 XRP and is exploring further exposure to Ripple-affiliated assets and technologies. SMQKE noted that this moment signals a shift in how institutional players position XRP.

Digital Commodities… pic.twitter.com/AQzejOTR9g — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 25, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Unlocks Institutional Interest The announcement follows the March 24, 2025, settlement between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which ended a years-long legal dispute. Digital Commodities Capital described the settlement as a pivotal moment that delivered long-awaited regulatory clarity to the digital asset space. According to the company, this clarity enables more balanced engagement between innovators and regulators and strengthens the legal framework for classifying utility-driven tokens like XRP. In this context, SMQKE pointed out that institutions were already preparing for this outcome, even as retail investors grew uncertain during the litigation period. Strategic Long-Term Positioning Around XRP Digital Commodities Capital’s CEO, Brayden Sutton, stated that the company believes in the future of compliant, utility-based digital assets and identified XRP as a prime example. The confirmed holdings are part of a broader strategy to build long-term value through diversified digital assets. Sutton also indicated that the company is actively reviewing further investment opportunities within Ripple’s ecosystem . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SMQKE interpreted this as a clear sign that XRP is being taken seriously by strategic capital allocators, not just as a speculative asset, but as part of long-term institutional investment theses. A Precedent That May Influence Other Institutions SMQKE emphasized that this is more than a single corporate action. It is a precedent that could influence other publicly traded entities to disclose their XRP positions or consider adding the asset to their portfolios. According to the post, XRP is entering a new phase where its role in digital finance is acknowledged not only by early adopters but by formal institutions operating under public market oversight. The researcher concluded that XRP has never lost its value proposition among those who understand long-term fundamentals and that its official recognition by a public company marks the beginning of broader institutional engagement.

Van de Poppe stated that altcoins are showing signs of recovery after a four-year historical bear market. According to the analyst, investor expectations have been seriously shaken over the past 3 months. However, current indicators show that the market is green. Van de Poppe said that many factors that move the markets come from outside the cryptocurrency sector. Van de Poppe stated that the increase in liquidity has a direct upward effect on Bitcoin. He said that as the money supply (M2) expands, the prices of rare assets like Bitcoin are expected to rise. The analyst stated that China has started quantitative easing (QE), Europe has lowered interest rates and the US is preparing to increase the money supply with interest rate cuts, and that these steps create a strong driving force for risky assets. Related News: SEC Approves Highly Anticipated XRP ETF - Price Reacts - Not Yet Approved Spot ETF on the Horizon Now According to Van de Poppe, the peak in gold in the short term and the increase in risk appetite create a positive environment for Bitcoin and altcoins. The analyst stated that Bitcoin is supported by developments such as ETF approval and Donald Trump becoming the US President, and that these factors create a new wave of liquidity. Van de Poppe, who said that gold has outperformed the S&P 500 by 20% since 2022, argued that despite this, the markets are now starting to lose their upward momentum in gold. He predicted that the next 12-18 months could offer a strong performance for risky assets. Van de Poppe stated that the CNH/USD (Chinese Yuan/US Dollar) parity has a decisive effect on the altcoin market. Past data shows that major rallies begin in altcoin markets when the CNH/USD parity bottoms. Recalling the examples of 2016 and 2019, the analyst pointed out that the yuan has bottomed after the sharp declines experienced recently. He claimed that this development could open the door to a new period of rise in the altcoin market. Van de Poppe stated that macroeconomic factors have replaced the traditional four-year market cycle approach, and that liquidity and global economic conditions will now be more at the forefront. He stated that a serious revival could occur in altcoins as the Chinese Yuan strengthens and gold prices correct. *This is not investment advice.

Livingston said miners currently produce around 450 BTC per day or approximately 13,500 BTC per month, but Strategy acquired 379,800 BTC in the last six months. This translates to the firm purchasing roughly 2,087 BTC per day — far in excess of daily miner output. The author added: ""When Bitcoin becomes this scarce, access to Bitcoin will require paying a premium. Lending against Bitcoin will cost more. Borrowing Bitcoin will become a luxury business reserved for nation-states and corporate whales, and Strategy will control the bottleneck."" ""BTC's global cost of capital will no longer be set by 'the market.' It will be set by the gravitational policies of the first Bitcoin superpower: Strategy,"" Livingston continued. The author's prediction of a Bitcoin supply crunch translates into much higher BTC prices if Strategy can continue its pace of BTC acquisitions while market demand for the supply-capped digital asset grows among institutional and retail investors. The Bitcoin miner reserve, a metric tracking the total amount of BTC held in miner wallets, continues to decline.

Critics of the company warn that the debt-based approach to BTC acquisition could sink Strategy financially if a prolonged BTC bear market takes effect and also warn of greater systemic risks to BTC from such a high concentration of the digital currency held by a single entity.

Ammous argued that institutions like BlackRock and Strategy holding high concentrations of BTC could not engineer a hard fork increasing Bitcoin's maximum supply, as it would massively devalue their holdings, which, at the end of the day, belong to shareholders with the power to divest.

Analysts expect Bitcoin to gain an additional 40% by the end of the year Select altcoins are showing a positive bias on improving crypto sentiment. Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose more than 10% this week as buyers made a strong comeback, pushing the price to the overhead resistance at $95,000. Although buyers are struggling to clear the overhead hurdle, a positive sign is that they have not given up much ground to the bears. The sharp up move is backed by solid buying in the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which witnessed inflows of $3.06 billion , according to Farside Investors data. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a post on X that it was really notable to see “HOW FAST the flows can go from 1st gear to 5th gear.” Crypto market data daily view.

Sina’s Bitcoin Quantile Model projects Bitcoin to reach between $130,000 and $163,000 before the end of 2025. Anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 had an even bigger target of more than $200,000 for Bitcoin in Q4 of this year. Could Bitcoin maintain its momentum and rise above the overhead resistance? Let’s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that look strong in the near term. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the crucial $95,000 level. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($88,619) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone indicate that bulls are in command. A close above $95,000 could propel the BTC/USDT pair to $100,000 and eventually to $107,000. Sellers are expected to aggressively defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA is the critical near-term support to watch out for because a break below it brings the large $95,000 to $73,777 range into play. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 4-hour chart shows the bears are fiercely defending the $95,000 level but are struggling to sink the pair below the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it enhances the prospects of a break above $95,000. The pair could then surge to $100,000. Instead, if the price maintains below the 20-EMA, the pair could tumble to the 50-simple moving average. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it could pull the pair to $86,000. Sui price prediction Sui ( SUI ) has been facing resistance near $3.90, but the shallow pullback suggests that the bulls are in no hurry to dump their positions. SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price stays above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $3.14, the bulls will make another attempt to shove the SUI/USDT pair above $3.90. If they can pull it off, the pair may skyrocket to $4.25 and then to $5. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $3.14, it signals the start of a deeper correction toward the 50% retracement level of $2.94. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $2.94 and the 20-day EMA ($2.69). SUI/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the pair is finding support at the 20-EMA, but the sellers are active at higher levels. The bears will again attempt to sink the pair below the 20-EMA. If they succeed, the pair could slump to $3.14. Buyers will have to swiftly push the price above the $3.81 to $3.90 overhead resistance zone if they want to retain the advantage. If they do that, the pair could start the next leg of the up move to $4.25. Avalanche price prediction Avalanche ( AVAX ) has been range-bound between $23.50 and $15.27 for the past few days. In a range, traders usually buy near the support and sell close to the resistance. AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Although buyers have failed to push the price above $23.50, a positive sign is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That increases the likelihood of a break above $23.50. If that happens, the AVAX/USDT pair will complete a double-bottom pattern, which has a target objective of $31.73. This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. The pair may then remain stuck inside the range for a few more days. AVAX/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has been consolidating in a narrow range between $21.60 and $23.10 for some time. That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher. If buyers propel the price above $23.10, the pair could surge to $25. There is resistance at $23.50, but it is likely to be crossed. Alternatively, a drop below $21.60 signals that the bulls have given up. That may pull the price down to $19.50.

TRUMP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView A rally above $16 is attracting sellers, but a shallow pullback suggests that every minor dip is being purchased. If buyers drive the price above $16, the TRUMP/USDT pair may reach $17.69, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. However, if buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair could skyrocket to $19.60 and then to $22.40. Conversely, a deeper pullback suggests that the short-term bulls are booking profits. The zone between $11.56 and $12.45 is expected to act as a solid support. If the price rebounds off the support zone, the pair may swing between $11.56 and $16 for some time. Selling could accelerate if the pair breaks below the 20-day EMA ($10.73). TRUMP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair turned down from $16 but is finding support near the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. That suggests the bulls are active at lower levels. Buyers will try to push the price above the $16 overhead resistance, starting the next leg of the uptrend. Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-EMA suggests that the bullish momentum has weakened. The pair may then slump to $14 and later to the solid support near $12. Sellers will be back in the driver’s seat on a drop below $11.50. Bittensor price prediction Bittensor ( TAO ) broke and closed above the downtrend line on April 20, suggesting that the bears are losing their grip. TAO/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The up move is facing resistance at $375, but the pullback is expected to find support at the 20-day EMA ($298). A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA signals a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. The bulls will then attempt to drive the TAO/USDT pair above $375. If they succeed, the next stop may be $495. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the downtrend line, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the breakout. The pair then risks falling to $222. TAO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pullback is finding support at the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. Buyers will try to resume the up move by pushing the price above the $375 resistance. If they manage to do that, the pair could reach $425. Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to sink the price below the 20-EMA, opening the doors for a drop to the 50-SMA and later to the downtrend line. A break below the downtrend line tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

That’s exactly where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out. Still priced at just $0.025, this DeFi project is starting to generate serious attention, and analysts are now pointing to a possible 2,000% return as its utility rolls out and adoption scales. With most new tokens offering hype but no real backing, MUTM is doing the opposite—quietly building an ecosystem that makes decentralized finance more accessible, more flexible, and more rewarding for everyone involved. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Low-cap crypto assets often get overlooked—but when utility meets timing, they tend to outperform. Mutuum Finance is still in its presale phase, yet it has already attracted nearly 9,000 participants and raised over $7 million. More than 420 million tokens have been sold to date, and momentum is building fast as the current pricing window begins to narrow. Every new presale phase increases the token price, and many investors are stepping in now to lock in their allocation before the next jump to $0.03. At the heart of Mutuum’s architecture is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Users who deposit crypto assets into the system receive mtTokens, which represent their deposits and grow in value over time by accruing interest. These tokens can be held, transferred, or used within other decentralized applications, making them more than just placeholders—they’re active earning tools. On the borrowing side, the system is designed to protect both users and the protocol itself. Borrowers must provide more collateral than the loan value, following a strict Loan-to-Value (LTV) threshold. This model ensures long-term sustainability and positions Mutuum as a protocol with structure, not guesswork. One of the standout features for long-term holders is the platform’s revenue alignment model. Instead of constantly issuing new tokens to reward users, Mutuum channels a portion of its revenue back into buying MUTM directly from the market. These tokens are then redistributed to ecosystem participants—especially mtToken holders, who are rewarded for their involvement. This system not only avoids the pitfalls of inflationary emissions, but also creates sustained demand over time—a key driver in token appreciation and yield generation. At the current rate of $0.025 per token, a $1,000 investment would grant access to 40,000 MUTM tokens. When forecasts come to fruition and MUTM climbs to $0.50, that position would be worth $20,000—a 20x increase. Stretch that further toward the projected 2,000% growth, and the potential multiplies even more. This isn’t just a numbers game; it’s a strategy. With real utility, strong community growth, and protocol revenue working behind the scenes, this token has ingredients many established cryptocurrencies are still missing. The team behind Mutuum has already announced that a beta version of the platform will be released around the time of token launch, giving users an immediate opportunity to engage with its features. Additionally, the platform’s overcollateralized stablecoin is in development, allowing users to borrow against their assets without needing to sell them—adding another layer of usability and flexibility. Once live, MUTM is expected to be listed on multiple exchanges, opening the door to broader access and significantly increasing its exposure across the crypto market. Mutuum Finance is doing what many low-priced tokens don’t—it’s delivering structure, smart mechanics, and meaningful growth potential. For those looking into the best crypto to invest in for long-term gains, MUTM is emerging as a strong candidate. At just a fraction of a dollar, with strong utility, passive income mechanisms, and a clear path forward, it represents more than just another presale. It’s a project with real legs—and the potential to change portfolios in the months ahead.

While Bitcoin and Solana are prime examples of how small, early investments can multiply into life-changing returns, today’s spotlight is shifting to a new name: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . This token isn’t promising overnight riches—but what it is offering is the combination of timing, structure, and momentum that defined the earliest days of both Bitcoin and Solana. That’s why early adopters are watching closely. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining the Kind of Early-Stage Traction That Matters What makes a project stand out in its first phase? Consistent delivery, growing wallet activity, and conversations that go beyond the hype. That’s exactly what MAGACOINFINANCE is doing—and why it’s earning a spot on investor shortlists across the board. The token isn’t just climbing—it’s gaining credibility. Community channels are growing by the hour. Early holders are sticking around, not selling. And its roadmap is being checked off in real-time. It’s the kind of build-up that looks eerily similar to the patterns Bitcoin and Solana showed before they took off. Notable Competitors Still in the Mix: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin, and Litecoin Uniswap remains dominant in decentralized trading, with unmatched liquidity and smart contract simplicity. But its market cap suggests its biggest run may already be behind it. Polkadot is still pushing boundaries in blockchain interoperability, and its parachain system is driving useful experimentation—but it’s a maturing network. Bitcoin , of course, still leads the market. But at its current stage, it’s a store of value, not a surprise mover. Litecoin continues to be a reliable transactional coin, with low fees and broad integration. However, it’s largely seen as stable rather than explosive. Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE still lives in the discovery zone—and that’s where the most growth often hides. Final Word Can MAGACOINFINANCE.COM turn a small investment into millions? Time will tell—but the elements are all there: strong launch, growing trust, and market timing that feels exactly right. Bitcoin and Solana proved that the early mover gets the biggest reward. The next one could already be here.

The US President said that the accompanying tax reduction will focus on those earning less than $200,000 per year. ""It will be a bonanza for America. The External Revenue Service is happening,"" Trump wrote in an April 27 Truth Social post . Source: Donald Trump President Trump previously floated the idea of eliminating the federal income tax collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and replacing revenues from income taxes with tariffs collected on imported goods. The US President's April 27 Truth Social post revealed the first concrete details of the proposed plan since Trump and members of his cabinet began touting comprehensive tax reform in October 2024. Bitcoin treasury firms driving $200 trillion hyperbitcoinization — Adam Back Investment firms with Bitcoin-focused treasuries are front-running global Bitcoin adoption , which may see the world’s first cryptocurrency soar to a $200 trillion market capitalization in the coming decade. Institutions and governments worldwide are starting to recognize the unique monetary properties of Bitcoin ( BTC ), according to Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream and the inventor of Hashcash. “$MSTR and other treasury companies are an arbitrage of the dislocation between the bitcoin future and todays fiat world,” Back wrote in an April 26 X post. “A sustainable and scalable $100-$200 trillion trade front-running hyperbitcoinization. scalable enough for most big listed companies to move to btc treasury,” he added. Hyperbitcoinization refers to the theoretical future where Bitcoin soars to become the largest global currency, replacing fiat money due to its inflationary economics and growing distrust in the legacy financial system. Source: Adam Back Bitcoin’s price outpacing fiat money inflation remains the main driver of global hyperbitcoinization, Back said, adding: “Some people think treasury strategy is a temporary glitch. i’m saying no it's a logical and sustainable arbitrage. but not for ever, the driver is bitcoin price going up over 4 year periods faster than interest and inflation.” US crypto rules like “floor is lava” game without lights — Hester Peirce SEC Commissioner and head of the crypto task force , Hester Peirce, says US financial firms are navigating crypto in a way that’s similar to playing the children’s game “the floor is lava,” but in the dark. “It is time that we find a way to end this game. We need to turn on the lights and build some walkways over the lava pit,” Peirce said at the SEC “Know Your Custodian” roundtable event on April 25. Peirce explained that SEC registrants are forced to approach crypto-related activities like “the floor is lava,” where the aim is to jump from one piece of furniture to the next without touching the ground, except here, touching crypto directly is the lava. “A D.C. version of this game is our regulatory approach to crypto assets, and crypto asset custody in particular,” she said. Peirce said that, much like in the game, firms wanting to engage with crypto must avoid directly holding it due to unclear regulatory rules. “To engage in crypto-related activities, SEC-registrants have had to hop from one poorly illuminated regulatory space to the next, all while ensuring that they never touch any crypto asset,” Peirce said.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XRP|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-27 22:10:43

Over the course of the year, the IC3 recorded over 140,000 complaints linked to cryptocurrency, which led to staggering financial losses of $9.3 billion. Alarming Trend A significant portion of these losses came from individuals aged 60 and above, who filed roughly 33,000 complaints and suffered a combined total of $2.8 billion in losses. This age group also saw the largest increase in both reported complaints and financial harm. The IC3’s report also noted a dramatic year-over-year increase in losses – 66% higher than in 2023, when total losses amounted to $5.6 billion. Investment scams involving cryptocurrency were the primary source of these losses, but the report also highlighted other schemes such as sextortion, where criminals manipulate personal content to coerce victims into sending money, and fraud involving crypto ATMs. Additionally, ransomware attacks, which had been a recurring issue, showed a 9% rise in 2024, thereby posing a growing threat to critical infrastructure. Overall, fraud and crypto scams were the most significant contributors to the rise in reported cybercrimes, with older individuals particularly vulnerable to these high-stakes digital fraud schemes. On the other hand, pig butchering scams, which were once mainly targeted at older adults, are now increasingly affecting younger individuals, particularly those aged 30 to 49. A recent study by Cyvers examined 150 major crypto platforms, revealing over 200,000 scam incidents and $5.5 billion in losses in 2024. The research focused on Ethereum-based scams and uncovered significant fraud across various platforms, including major exchanges, a crypto-friendly bank, and institutional trading platforms. The scale of impact varied, but the trend is clear: younger people are becoming the prime victims. Operation Level Up ‘Operation Level Up’ was thus initiated with the assistance of FBI agents and the US Secret Service to address the growing issue of cryptocurrency investment fraud. Pig butchering involves fraudsters building online relationships with victims and convincing them to invest in a fraudulent cryptocurrency platform. As a result of this operation, a total of 4,323 individuals affected by cryptocurrency investment fraud were informed of the scam. Of these victims, 76% were unaware they had fallen victim to fraud. The estimated financial savings for these victims amounted to $285.6 million. Additionally, 42 victims were referred to an FBI victim specialist for support regarding potential suicidal thoughts.

Bitwise CEO Drops Jaw-Dropping New Prediction,https://thecoinrise.com/50-trillion-bitcoin-boom-bitwise-ceo-drops-jaw-dropping-new-prediction/,"Hunter Horsley, Bitwise CEO, has dropped a bold prediction concerning Bitcoin (BTC). Horsley says Bitcoin can hit a $50 trillion valuation if it assumes the role of a digital alternative to the U.S fiat. Bitcoin Positioned Beyond Gold as a Global Value Store In an update shared on X, Horsley maintained that BTC’s worth is much more than that of gold, a traditional store of value. He notes that BTC is more like U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar, which, when aggregated, are valued at approximately $50 trillion. Bitcoin is an apolitical, digital monetary asset. The right comparison may be not just Gold (~$23T) — But also Treasuries and USD (~$50T). When people want to digitally store value, the latter is often the way. — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) April 26, 2025 The estimated value of gold is about $23 trillion globally, but Horsley highlights that Bitcoin has more advantages as it exists online. He insists that the coin remains the preferred way investors store “value” in today’s financial world. According to the Bitwise CEO, some features that make Bitcoin appealing are that it is “an apolitical digital monetary asset.” That is, it is not tied to anyone, country, or government. The decentralized feature sets Bitcoin out as an asset. The message behind Horsley’s update is to highlight the possibility of Bitcoin if countries worldwide progressively adopt digital value storage. Bitwise’s Growing BTC Bet Reflects Horsley’s Conviction Horsley has always been bullish about BTC. His stance aligns with the principle of Bitwise. The asset management company under Horsley’s leadership has increased Bitwise’s BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF), BITB, to over 39,000 BTC. Bitwise’s Bitcoin holding has been estimated at approximately $3.67 billion. Hence, Horsley’s stance on the potential of Bitcoin is based on a position of knowledge. Clearly, Bitcoin has grown from competing with gold or chasing technology stocks to positioning itself as a notable force in the financial world . How Bitwise’s CEO’s prediction materializes remains an event to look forward to in the financial world. Bitcoin’s Rising Institutional Adoption Fuels Optimism As of this writing, the coin was trading at $94,118.85 with a market capitalization of $1.86 trillion. This positions it as the leading digital asset in the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin’s appeal has led to growing institutional adoption from firms like Metaplanet, Semler Scientific , and Strategy.

Bitcoin, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM, and Ethereum Are Heating Up!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-580-turn-into-1-9-million-bitcoin-magacoinfinance-com-and-ethereum-are-heating-up/,"In a market known for once-in-a-generation wins, timing is everything. Catching the right project at the right moment is how legends are made. And now, early investors are wondering whether MAGACOINFINANCE.COM could be that next major play—the kind of early entry that shifts portfolios entirely. There’s no question this token is attracting serious attention. From organic growth to mounting analyst discussions, this isn’t another project trying to go viral overnight. It’s one that’s quietly gaining power—and smart investors are noticing. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Steam While Others Stall Not every token launch is worth watching—but this one is. MAGACOINFINANCE has been steadily building momentum with real traction: growing wallet counts, strong retention rates, and increasing visibility in investor forums. It’s not relying on influencers or hype cycles. Instead, it’s executing with purpose—developing a community-first ecosystem that’s attracting early believers and long-term thinkers alike. There’s a seriousness to its rollout that sets it apart from the typical short-burst memecoins. More importantly, it’s doing this at a moment when the market is hungry for new momentum. With attention shifting toward early-stage entries that could define the next run, MAGACOINFINANCE is standing right in the spotlight. Other Solid Projects—But With Limited Early Entry: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin Uniswap remains a key player in the decentralized exchange space. Its model for token swaps and liquidity pools has changed how people trade—but it’s now a well-known giant, with much of its explosive upside already realized. Polkadot is doing valuable work around interoperability and multi-chain scaling. It’s vital to Web3 innovation—but as a large-cap asset, its growth arc is longer and more gradual. Bitcoin Cash continues to serve those focused on simple, peer-to-peer digital payments. It has strong utility and global adoption—but few would describe it as an “undiscovered” asset. Litecoin is one of the oldest altcoins still standing. It remains relevant, especially for fast, low-cost transactions—but it’s also fully matured in its current form. These projects are dependable—but they’re no longer in their early days. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is just beginning its ascent. Final Thought Can $750 really become $1.2 million? It depends on the project. It depends on timing. And it depends on execution. Right now, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is hitting all three. The structure is there. The interest is growing. And the window is still wide open—for now. If history has taught us anything, it’s that those who move early often move the farthest.

Meme coins require minimal capital investment to build a sizable positions, yet promise explosive initial gains, which continue to attract millions of buyers from all over the world into meme assets to date. One of the up-and-coming contenders within the meme coins market this year is CartelFi . But does this newcomer have what it takes to uncrown some of the more established names within this space like Shiba Inu? Let’s explore. CartelFi vs Shiba Inu: which one offers better utility? Shiba Inu has long been touted as the “Dogecoin killer”. It gained famed as a community-driven meme coin upon launch in 2020. Over the years, it has grown its ecosystem to include ShibaSwap, a decentralised exchange, and other tokens as well like LEASH and BONE. Shiba Inu continues to thrive on a vibrant community and speculative trading, but its utility remains rather limited. CartelFi, on the other hand, is more innovative. It’s fully committed to becoming more than just a meme coin. CartelFi is marketing itself as a platform with a mission. It wants to help the community transform its idle meme coins into yield-generating assets, branding itself as “the ultimate staking cartel.” This means that instead of letting meme coins idle in wallets, they get to put them to work and set up a new source of passive income with CartelFi. It’s a unique approach that bridges the gap between meme culture and decentralised finance (DeFi), offering real utility and value to users. Click here if you’d like to learn more about CartelFi and its native meme coin. CartelFi vs Shiba Inu: which one has better growth potential? CartelFi may be a better pick than Shiba Inu in 2025 also because it’s currently in its early stages only, which makes it a prime opportunity for investors looking to get in on the ground floor. CartelFi presale has attracted massive interest, raising more than $1 million in within a matter of weeks. This momentum indicates strong investor confidence and potential a bright future ahead. Note that meme coins are broadly known to offer explosive initial gains. This narrative makes CartelFi all the more exciting to own than Shiba Inu as the latter has been around for years. So, it’s reasonable to believe that it has already had its moment in the sun. However, CartelFi is yet to realise that explosive growth, indicating building an early position in it today could prove rather lucrative for investors as we proceed through the remainder of 2025. All in all, CartelFi’s innovative approach, strong growth potential, and focus on utility make it a standout in the crowded world of meme coins. For investors looking to merge the fun of meme coins with an added benefit of yield generation, CartelFi is the clear winner.

Amid wild market movements for TRUMP, a Georgia senator has labeled the invitation an impeachable offense. Meanwhile, a shift in sentiment sees investors turn to PepeX , a project looking to revolutionize the memecoin space. Georgia senator slams Trump’s memecoin dinner It’s an impeachable offense, US Senator Jon Ossoff from Georgia said. Ossoff said this as he publicly criticized President Donald Trump’s reported gala dinner for top 220 investors of his $TRUMP memecoin. The lawmaker criticized the move as “selling access,” noting that the event set for May 22 could be grounds for impeachment proceedings against the president. This is the latest controversy around the TRUMP token, which launched in January 2025 amid market euphoria on Trump’s election win and inauguration. Critics point to TRUMP soaring amid the dinner news as a scenario that will only enrich these few whales and insiders. The criticism, which has come from other congressional lawmakers and the crypto circle as well, see the president’s involvement as a conflict of interest and a dangerous precedent. Notably, the token’s creators hold 80% of supply. Memecoin investors buy PepeX While analysts suggest TRUMP memecoin could be worth watching, investors keen on other opportunities are flocking to PepeX. The AI-powered memecoin launchpad, which seeks to challenge Pump.fun and others in the market, has raised over $1.6 million in its presale. PepeX, targeted for multi chain use, eyes a user-friendly platform for memecoins creation. Its main selling point is it’s focus on community rather than token creators and a few top whales. The platform’s AI-powered technology provides a fair token distribution. It caps creators at 5% of supply while allocating 95% to the public. PepeX also includes anti-sniping tech and real-time transparency tools like bubble maps. This means the platform removes the potential for manipulation and rugs, which have dominated Pump.fun launches. Moreover, only 0.04% of Pump.fun participants profitable.

PepeX is here to let YOU tokenize your way through the chaos. 🚀Forget tech stocks, PepeX is where AI-powered tokens and degen plays meet.

According to the PepeX whitepaper , the planned public launch is in Q3 2025. The roadmap includes key milestones such as decentralized AI launchpad, DEX partnerships and staking. Its presale, with tokens priced at $0.0243, offered early birds up to 332% in presale returns. This has many looking to buy early before the 90-day ICO ends. Overall crypto-friendly environment under President Donald Trump Despite the controversy around TRUMP, the broader crypto landscape is experiencing a notable shift under President Trump’s administration. Since his campaign for election in 2024, Trump has increasingly taken a pro-crypto stance. The industry supported him and other leaders amid the push for clarity in the regulation of digital assets, with the signing executive orders to promote cryptocurrencies among key developments in 2025. On April 25, 2025, new SEC chair Paul Atkins said the agency was ready to work with Trump’s administration and Congress to support efforts for regulatory clarity.

The bank’s indirect Bitcoin exposure via stocks reached $356 million, raising sell pressure risk amid a global trade war and recession concerns. Abu Dhabi’s $437 million spot Bitcoin ETF stake shows sovereign wealth funds see Bitcoin as a hedge. Norges Bank, Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund, reported a $40 billion loss in the first quarter of 2025, with most of the decline caused by a drop in the value of US-listed technology companies. Norges Bank also indirectly owned 3,821 BTC through its stock market investments by the end of 2024, presenting a potential sell pressure risk to Bitcoin, especially when considering the socio-political uncertainty and the risk of an economic recession caused by the global trade war. In such times, could Norges Bank increase its investments in Bitcoin-related companies or even buy spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a way to hedge risk? For now, it seems unlikely that Norway’s investment fund would consider buying a Bitcoin ETF, especially since the fund does not hold any gold. Besides stocks and bonds, Norges Bank invests in real estate, including retail, industrial, renewable energy, and logistics properties worldwide. Norway sold all of the central bank’s gold by early 2004, when gold was trading below $400. Since then, gold has outperformed the S&P 500 by 280%. Equities now make up 71.4% of the fund’s total investments, so if the global trade war continues, significant losses could occur. Gold/USD (orange) vs. S&P 500. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Norges Bank investments generated $222 billion in profits in 2024, and its stock market portfolio dropped by only 1.6% in the first quarter of 2025. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund is “mainly index-driven,” according to CEO Nicolai Tangen, specifically following the FTSE Global All Cap Index. Although this index includes over 7,100 stocks from both developed and emerging markets, it is based on market capitalization, which means 65% of the exposure is to North American companies. But, according to Norges Bank Deputy CEO Trond Grande, there is some flexibility for active investment, and their exposure to US-listed tech stocks has been below the benchmark for the past 18 months. Some of these holdings, such as Strategy, Mara Holdings, Coinbase, and Riot Platforms, hold large amounts of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on their balance sheets. As a result, even if not intentional, the sovereign wealth fund had a $356 million indirect exposure to Bitcoin at the end of 2024. FTSE Global All Cap (purple) vs. FTSE + 10% Bitcoin (green). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Data shows a 5% hypothetical allocation in Bitcoin back in 2018 would have boosted the fund’s equities benchmark performance by 56%. Buying Bitcoin ETFs seems unlikely, but indirect exposure remains possible Technically, it seems unlikely that Norges Bank could buy into the spot Bitcoin ETF without changing the fund’s mandate. However, increasing exposure to companies with significant Bitcoin holdings appears possible. Still, there is no sign of such a move, although Nicolai Tangen stated on April 24 that the fund will increase investments in US stocks.

Similarly, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board held $321 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs, showing the growing use of cryptocurrency as a hedge.

Cardano just rolled out a governance framework update that aims to sharpen its community-led innovation. Meanwhile, Litecoin celebrated its latest halving with a modest uptick in hash rate and community engagement, reminding everyone it’s still swinging in the heavyweight division of payments-focused coins. But amidst the buzz, a new heavyweight contender is emerging: Qubetic s. It isn’t just another blockchain play. With over $16.4 million raised and more than 509 million $TICS tokens sold to over 25,200 holders, this one’s building tools real folks and businesses need—starting with a decentralized VPN. At $0.1902 per token in its 31st presale stage, Qubetics is not just solving blockchain’s old headaches; it’s crafting new paths for the future of digital finance. Let’s dive into what makes Qubetics, Cardano, and Litecoin each worth watching and how one of them could end up being your ticket to the best crypto to get rich. Qubetics ($TICS): A Real-World Blockchain With Utility that Hits Home Here’s the deal. Crypto ain’t just about charts and candle patterns anymore. It’s about solving problems—real ones. And Qubetics is out here treating blockchain like a Swiss Army knife. Whether you’re a professional handling sensitive data or a small business owner dealing with sketchy internet providers, this one hits different. The standout? Its built-in decentralized VPN. Imagine ditching shady VPN services and replacing them with one that’s on-chain, secure, and anonymous by design. It’s not just smart—it’s what the ecosystem’s been crying out for. And it doesn’t stop there. What’s Popping Right Now? Qubetics is in Stage 31 of its crypto presale . $0.1902 per $TICS token. Over 509 million tokens sold. More than 25,200 holders. Over $16.4 million raised. With tech that simplifies cross-border payments, creates secure file transfers, and decentralizes cloud services, Qubetics isn’t following trends. It’s setting them. The QubeQode IDE & Business Simplicity This isn’t just a playground for coders. Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE is designed for devs, professionals, and even non-tech folks who want in on blockchain without wrestling code like a python in the jungle. Add in lower transaction fees and scalable infrastructure, and you’ve got something built for the long haul. The Buzz from Analysts Look, folks in the know are calling out numbers like $1, $5, even $15 post-mainnet. That’s up to a 7783% return. Of course, this ain’t financial advice—it’s simply what’s out there in credible circles. Why It Could Be the Best Crypto to Get Rich When you’re looking for the best crypto to get rich, utility and early entry matter. Qubetics isn’t just a whitepaper dream. It’s a functional, scalable project that’s making tech smoother and privacy tighter. Cardano (ADA): Smart Contracts Meet Real-World Governance Cardano’s been around the block—literally. It was one of the earliest Proof-of-Stake champions and has long pitched itself as an academically serious blockchain. In 2025, Cardano isn’t chasing hype. It’s refining the fundamentals. Cardano just activated an upgrade to its Voltaire governance model, putting more power directly in the hands of ADA holders. Community voting, treasury allocation, and even on-chain proposals are seeing streamlined improvements. That’s real decentralization, not just lip service. With over 1,200 dApps currently built on Cardano and a dev community that’s growing like it’s on Miracle-Gro, ADA keeps climbing the ranks. Its low transaction fees, energy efficiency, and secure Haskell-based coding environment keep it appealing. Education systems, agricultural supply chains, and even digital ID solutions in emerging markets are actively integrating with Cardano tech. This isn’t fantasy—it’s happening. It’s not the fastest mover, but it’s steady and consistent. For those scoping out the best crypto to get rich with a balance of safety and innovation, ADA earns its seat at the table. Litecoin (LTC): The OG Payments Coin Still Holding It Down Don’t let the quiet demeanor fool you—Litecoin’s a beast that’s aged like fine whiskey. It’s got roots going back to 2011, and while many have come and gone, LTC is still here, doing its thing. Litecoin’s August 2024 halving event is already showing its ripple effects. The hash rate is up, miner activity is steady, and LTC has crept back into payment gateway headlines. With transaction speed sitting at around 2.5 minutes per block, it still lives up to its “silver to Bitcoin’s gold” nickname. While newer blockchains chase the shiny DeFi narrative, Litecoin keeps it simple: be fast, cheap, and reliable. Whether it’s cross-border remittance, ecommerce checkout, or ATM withdrawals, LTC is quietly powering real transactions every day. It’s accepted at thousands of merchants globally, from retail stores to online platforms. Payment processors keep integrating it. Litecoin is that old-school friend who never asks for the spotlight but always shows up. If you’re betting on dependability and wide acceptance, Litecoin’s got the goods. It’s not flashy, but it works—and sometimes, that’s exactly what pays off. What’s a Decentralized VPN and Why Should Anyone Care? A decentralized VPN flips the script on traditional ones. No central authority. No single point of failure. Just pure peer-to-peer privacy. Here’s why this matters: Traditional VPNs can be hacked or surveilled. Centralized systems log your data—even if they swear they don’t. Governments can block access or demand logs. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN changes the game: User data isn’t stored—ever. Connections route anonymously through a mesh network. It’s blockchain-backed, meaning secure and transparent without compromising privacy. Great for business use, remote work, or just surfing without big brother peeking in. This isn’t some side project—it’s a core piece of Qubetics’ infrastructure. And that’s what makes it a serious contender when folks talk about the best crypto to get rich. Conclusion: Who’s the Best Bet? Cardano’s playing the long game with governance and academic rigor. Litecoin’s old-school but steady, with widespread real-world usage. But Qubetics? That one’s rewriting the rules—solving the problems that’ve tripped up other chains and doing it with tools people can actually use. The best crypto to get rich in 2025 might not be the loudest one. It’s the one laying down real-world foundations—one decentralized VPN, secure payment system, and developer IDE at a time. Want in before the crowd catches on? This might be your shot.

Earlier this month, the BTC mining hotspot of Irkutsk unveiled the nation’s first-ever year-round ban on crypto mining in the southern part of the oblast. This move came just months after Moscow imposed a wintertime ban on crypto mining in 10 Russian and Russian-controlled regions until 2031. Russian Gas Alternative for Irkutsk Bitcoin Miners? Per the Russian news agency Interfax , the Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev has urged major players in the mining market to join forces with oil and gas companies. A Gazprom Neft oil refinery. (Source: Neftehim [CC BY-SA 3.0]) He said that the parties should unite to build data centers that use “alternative fuel sources.” Kobzev made the comments during an April 25 address on the state of affairs in the region. He claimed that the Irkutsk government was “not against mining as a phenomenon.” However, he reasserted claims that miners need to overcome electricity shortages. And he said his government had a duty to ensure residents and enterprises in the region enjoyed uninterrupted electricity supplies. Kobzev said: “The regional government is ready to act as a platform to coordinate interaction between mining operators and enterprises working in the oil and gas production sector. There are already successful cases of firms building data centers powered by autonomous generation. These firms use associated gas.” Iran, Russia agree on 55 bcm of gas supplies, nuclear plant funding https://t.co/cP4vZjiySE https://t.co/cP4vZjiySE — Reuters (@Reuters) April 25, 2025 Russian oil firms have been working with crypto miners on associated gas-related pilots since the start of the current decade. Some of the nation’s biggest BTC miners and oil firms, including BitRiver and Gazprom Neft, started working together in 2022. Irkutsk’s Governor Igor Kobzev meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2019, in a photograph released by the Kremlin’s press service. Russia Starting to Feel Crypto Mining Boom Downside? Russia has seen one of the world’s biggest booms in Bitcoin and altcoin mining in recent years. With many miners forced out of China, Russian miners have claimed that taxing their industry could bring Moscow hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of revenue. But this growth has taken a toll on many areas’ energy grids. The Ministry of Energy is reportedly mulling issuing three more regional mining bans as networks in some areas begin to suffer. Other parts of the country claim they have surplus power that they can use to power miners’ rigs. But Kobzev appears keen to keep miners in southern Irkutsk away from public grids at all costs. He pledged to support associated gas-powered crypto mining initiatives “in every possible way.” He also said that such a partnership could help improve the Irkutsk environment by reducing flaring. Could BTC Miners Switch to Russian Gas Power? When drilling for crude oil, producers often release pockets of natural (associated) gas. If drillers do not have any infrastructure that lets them capture this gas, they must instead burn it using flare stacks. Many industries are hesitant about using associated gas, as it tends to produce intense but irregular bursts of energy, rather than uninterrupted flows. Russia said it arrested a man suspected in the murder of a senior military official near Moscow and claimed that a car bomb had been activated remotely from Ukraine. https://t.co/Gut35SJH0z — Bloomberg (@business) April 26, 2025 Some Russian miners, however, say that they are happy to use this model of energy flow, provided they can pay discounted rates. Kobzev was optimistic about the said that a failure to stamp out crypto mining-related energy problems could see the capacity deficit in southeastern Siberia hit just shy of 3GW by 2030. But critics say that efforts to ban crypto mining in southern Irkutsk have instead resulted in a rise in illegal and quasi-legal operations. Some claim that rising Bitcoin prices have also played a role, with miners now increasingly reluctant to turn off their rigs.

RIPPLE’S MONICA LONG JUST LIT UP CNBC WITH MASSIVE UPDATES. We have extracted every key quote you need to see from her interview — broken down for you: On XRP: “XRP serves a couple different roles… within the blockchain, the XRP Ledger, it’s the native asset, so you… pic.twitter.com/QGkcPHM6fB — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 25, 2025 XRP: A Critical Component of Ripple’s Strategy Monica Long emphasized XRP’s essential role within the XRP Ledger, explaining that it is required for transaction fees and account reserves. She stated, “XRP serves a couple different roles… within the blockchain, the XRP Ledger, it’s the native asset, so you need it for gas fees, you need it for the reserve account minimum, and so as there’s more users and more use cases built on XRP Ledger, that asset will always be needed.” She also discussed XRP’s function in liquidity provisioning on XRPL. “Within that exchange… if a trading pair doesn’t have liquidity between it, it auto-bridges, goes between XRP for efficiency, speed, and cost… so that will be an increasingly important use case as more activity comes to the blockchain.” Long confirmed that Ripple continues to use XRP as part of its payments offering depending on customer needs, adding, “It’s kind of dependent on customer use case.” XRPL: Designed for Functionality and Innovation Long described the XRP Ledger as an early attempt to improve Bitcoin’s limitations. “The original XRP Ledger launched as… Bitcoin 2.0… in their brains, they were thinking of Bitcoin as this ingenious invention, how can we improve upon scalability and tinker with the consensus model so that you could enable things like an exchange within the blockchain itself.” She reinforced the company’s long-term alignment with XRPL development, noting, “The whole company started because three developers created the XRP Ledger… and so we’ve always had a belief in building use cases that would make use of the efficiency within XRP Ledger.” Ripple continues to enhance the ledger, including adding lending protocols and a multi-purpose token amendment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple USD (RLUSD) and Institutional Stablecoin Demand On the subject of stablecoins, Long explained the rationale behind Ripple’s decision to launch RLUSD, citing its relevance to Ripple’s cross-border payments business. She highlighted RLUSD’s utility and availability. “It’s quick, right, you can get effectively the equivalent of a dollar in digital version… and then 24 by 7 availability… as opposed to using this kind of real-time rail for stablecoins.” Long said the stablecoin market is projected to exceed $3 trillion , adding that Ripple focuses on institutional usage. One area gaining momentum is using stablecoins as collateral: “One that I think is getting more and more attention is using [stablecoins] as an asset for collateral for trading in the more traditional institutional world… this is one that’s definitely spiking for us.” Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Long also addressed Ripple’s relationship with the banking sector. Recalling the early years, she said, “In 2014… we knocked on the doors of banks and we explained… you could do cross-border payments on a blockchain and it would be near instant, almost free… they were like, slam the door in our face.” But today, she said, banks are far more receptive. “They have embraced it a lot more.” She clarified that Ripple’s role is to serve as an intermediary, and acknowledged how regulatory shifts make banks more willing to engage with blockchain services. Long concluded with a critique of legacy financial systems. “When you talk to the banks, the effort to run those products, it’s kind of shocking, a lot of the backend process is still manual or it’s paperwork, it’s just all this stuff that could be automated and just made more efficient with technology.” As All Things XRP noted in his coverage of the interview, Ripple is no longer operating in a limited capacity. Under Long’s leadership, it is positioning itself to help build the infrastructure underpinning the next phase of institutional finance.

Back argued that investment firms allocating their treasuries to BTC are leading the charge in global adoption, a trend he believes could drive the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization to $200 trillion within the next decade. Back contends that companies are using Bitcoin treasury strategies as a rational and long-term arbitrage Adam Back, also the creator of Hashcash, claimed that organizations and governments worldwide were beginning to acknowledge the special monetary qualities of BTC. Back further shared an X post to illustrate this on April 26, stating that treasury firms like Strategy were taking advantage of the gap between the current fiat world and the future of BTC. He continued after this, elaborating that a scalable and sustainable front-running hyperbitcoinization with a $100–200 trillion trade value had enough scalability for most large listed companies to switch to BTC Treasury. Hyperbitcoinization is the term used to describe the hypothetical scenario in which BTC surpasses fiat money as the most widely used currency in the world due to its inflationary economics and the growing mistrust of the established financial system. According to Back, the primary cause of global hyperbitcoinization was still the price of BTC exceeding the inflation of fiat money. Following this, he claimed that some believed that treasury strategy was a passing trend. In response, he argued that it was a sustainable and rational arbitrage. Additionally, based on his argument, BTC prices have increased over the past four years more quickly than interest and inflation, but this trend is temporary. Interestingly, Back made these remarks almost two months after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order creating a national Bitcoin reserve using BTC that was forfeited in criminal cases involving the government. More international companies may decide to adopt BTC following the current appealing conditions Reports suggest that firms like Strategy — the largest corporate holder of BTC — could inspire others to follow suit if they continue expanding their Bitcoin treasuries. According to Michael Saylor , Strategy’s co-founder, the company’s Bitcoin treasury has made over $5.1 billion in profit since the start of 2025, demonstrating the strategy’s profitability. Likewise, Japanese investment giant Metaplanet — aka “Asia’s MicroStrategy” — has adopted the same strategy after April 24, when it surpassed more than 5,000 BTC in its reserves. Furthermore, according to Metaplanet, this was not the end; by 2026, it plans to acquire 21,000 BTC, making it the largest corporate Bitcoin owner in Asia. Furthermore, another thing that would have made it easier for international companies like Strategy to follow suit was the US Federal Reserve’s decision to remove its 2022 guidance that banks shouldn’t deal with cryptos. With this reversal, U.S. financial institutions might feel more comfortable embracing Bitcoin. In reaction to the withdrawal of the guidance, Saylor stated that banks were now free to start supporting BTC. Moreover, Iliya Kalchev, a Nexo dispatch analyst, revealed that banks would now be subjected to regular supervision, indicating a more liberal regulatory framework for integrating digital assets.

While giants like XRP and Bitcoin continue to dominate the headlines, early traders are shifting their focus toward a fresh lineup of altcoins with far greater upside potential heading into 2025. Many long-term XRP holders who saw early success are now reallocating part of their portfolios into smaller, high-traction tokens that could multiply faster in the next cycle. It’s not a rejection of the big caps—it’s a rotation into opportunities that haven’t fully played out yet. New Altcoins Are Catching Smart Money Attention While Bitcoin and XRP continue to offer stability and scale, they’re no longer the undiscovered gems they once were. That role is now being filled by emerging players that combine strong narratives, lean supply models, and rapid community growth. Among the most mentioned right now is MAGACOIN FINANCE —a politically themed altcoin that’s carving out space with bold branding and strategic market entry. With consistent early-stage demand and growing visibility on trackers and social platforms, it’s being discussed as one of the few tokens that hasn’t yet priced in future interest. Investors aren’t just looking at charts—they’re watching wallet activity, search volume, and rotating capital flows. What they’re seeing is that the real action is happening before listings ever begin. Why Traders Are Reallocating Altcoins are inherently higher risk, but that’s exactly what makes them attractive to seasoned traders who’ve already done well with XRP or Bitcoin. They’re not betting on speculation—they’re positioning for volatility they can control. The altcoins getting the most traction right now often check a few critical boxes: a memorable name, early-stage scarcity, increasing coverage from crypto media. Those who once turned $1K into six figures with XRP are now scanning for projects with similar setups—structured entries, social-driven exposure, and room to run. Final Thoughts The $1K-to-$1M tagline may sound ambitious, but in crypto, narratives move markets—and right now, the narrative is shifting. While Bitcoin and XRP maintain their legacy status, many traders are betting big on smaller tokens with disruptive potential. Whether it’s a cultural movement like MAGACOIN FINANCE or another sleeper pick waiting for its moment, the real returns often come from acting before the hype—not after. As always, timing matters. For those with eyes on what’s next, this altcoin wave might be the most exciting play of the year.

In fact, the smartest crypto plays usually begin in silence. Today, while Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) continue to gain strength, a growing number of seasoned investors are locking into MAGACOINFINANCE —a project showing all the right early-stage signs. It’s already surging—and it hasn’t even hit the exchanges yet. What’s fueling MAGACOINFINANCE’s rapid rise Bonus access is still active: Strategic buyers are locking in during the final moments of private entry. Listings are approaching fast: Once live on exchanges, the opportunity for first-mover advantage disappears. Visibility is surging: The token is now on radar inside altcoin analyst circles and private investor communities. Access is still limited: This isn’t mass-market yet. That’s why early positioning matters. MAGACOINFINANCE is earning bold projections MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just climbing—it’s accelerating. With a capped supply and rapidly rising interest, market analysts now place it in the best crypto potential for Q2—supported by its clean structure, momentum, and strategic launch timing. Why SOL, XRP, KAS, and OP won’t offer this entry again Solana (SOL) , XRP , Kaspa (KAS) , and Optimism (OP) are well-established. Their early discovery moments are long past. MAGACOINFINANCE is now trending as a contender among top early-stage altcoins. Final thoughts on MAGACOINFINANCE Every major coin had its quiet beginning— Bitcoin , XRP , and Solana were once ignored. Today, MAGACOINFINANCE is in that same position: building fast, rising confidently, and offering timing that rarely lasts. This is the phase where smart money moves.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 245,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on Bonk ( BONK ) following the altcoin’s breakout of an accumulation zone on the three-day chart. The trader shares a chart suggesting that BONK can rally to as high as $0.0000262 after taking out its resistance at $0.0000142. “BONK is going much higher (I have a bag). Looks good on the charts as well. Think I’m going to add to my position if I get a small dip.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, BONK is trading for $0.0000182. Turning to the native asset of the non-fungible token (NFT) project Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ), the trader says the altcoin needs to print a bullish higher low setup at around $0.0065 to start reversing its multi-month downtrend. Otherwise, Altcoin Sherpa warns that PENGU may drop to as low as $0.004. “Coins like PENGU got rekt the last several months but are showing some signs of life. The true test is going to be where the next low is and how the reaction is. The trend is still bearish, so don’t be so quick to catch knives. That said, we could see some reversal if the environment continues to ease up.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that PENGU may soar to as high as $0.014 if the altcoin manages to establish a higher low. At time of writing, PENGU is worth $0.00985. As for the broader altcoin market, the analyst warns that most coins are still in a high-time-frame downtrend and that the gains witnessed this month could be erased. However, Altcoin Sherpa notes that it is now within the realm of possibility for altcoins to start carving a major cycle bottom en route to a bullish reversal. “To be clear, I’m pretty bullish overall and think that we’re going higher and the next major dip is a BUY THE DIP situation. HOWEVER, most alts still are in bearish market structures (see TAO) and continuation of that trend is down. I think we go higher for everything, but just a careful reminder that these sh*tcoins are still in bearish trends and have made lower highs, lower lows. I do think that we’re doing better, though.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Bitcoin’s weakening correlation with stocks highlights its growing independence as an asset. Bullish institutional investor positioning contrasts with retail traders’ caution, supporting a rally above $100,000. Bitcoin ( BTC ) gained 11% between April 20 and April 26, demonstrating resilience by holding near its two-month high around $94,000. This relief rally followed signals from the Trump administration about easing import tariffs, as well as strong corporate earnings reports. Investor confidence in Bitcoin was further boosted by a record $3.1 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over five days. However, a key BTC derivatives indicator showed signs of bearish momentum, raising questions about whether the $100,000 target is still realistic. Perpetual Bitcoin futures contracts are favored by retail traders because their prices closely track the spot market. A positive funding rate means that buyers pay to maintain their positions, so a reversal in this rate is typically linked to bearish trends. Bitcoin perpetual futures annualized funding rate. Source: Laevitas.ch The sharp negative funding rates recorded on April 26 are highly unusual during bull markets, as they indicate stronger demand from sellers. This metric has been volatile since April 14, but sellers were caught off guard as Bitcoin’s price climbed above $94,000. Since April 21, over $450 million in BTC short positions have been liquidated . Some of the renewed confidence and Bitcoin’s price strength can be attributed to the S&P 500’s 7.1% weekly gain. However, despite this optimism, US President Donald Trump reportedly said on April 25 that negotiations would depend on China making concessions, causing traders to question the sustainability of recent gains. Companies are now reporting first-quarter earnings from before the escalation of the trade war, so the factors driving the stock market and Bitcoin are different. In fact, Bitcoin’s price is no longer closely correlated with the S&P 500. 30-day correlation: S&P 500 vs Bitcoin/USD. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Currently, the 30-day correlation between the S&P 500 and Bitcoin stands at 29%, well below the 60% level seen from March to mid-April. While this lower correlation does not mean a complete decoupling, since investor sentiment is still influenced by macroeconomic factors, it does show that Bitcoin is not simply a proxy for technology stocks. Bitcoin’s status as an independent asset has strengthened Gold’s inability to maintain its bullish momentum after reaching an all-time high of $3,500 on April 22 was also seen as significant for Bitcoin’s status as an independent asset class. Some traders had questioned the “digital gold” narrative, but the longer BTC remains above $90,000, the more confidence investors may have, potentially paving the way for further gains. The increased demand for bearish leverage in perpetual BTC futures does not align with the sentiment of professional traders. Monthly Bitcoin futures contracts avoid fluctuating funding rates, so traders know their leverage costs in advance. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch On April 26, the two-month Bitcoin futures premium (basis rate) rose to its highest level in seven weeks, indicating greater interest in bullish positions. At 6.5%, this metric remains within the neutral 5% to 10% range, but is moving away from bearish territory. The disconnect between leverage demand in perpetual futures and monthly BTC contracts is not unusual. Even if retail traders remain cautious, substantial accumulation by institutions could be enough to push Bitcoin’s price above $100,000 in the near future.

A move past this point could push the Ethereum price toward $1,720 or even $1,800. However, if it fails to break through, the Ethereum price might fall back to $1,550. The Ethereum price is currently trading above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, which is a positive sign. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also above 50, suggesting bullish momentum. But if the Ethereum price drops below $1,605, it could test lower support levels. Overall, the Ethereum price is at a critical point, and traders are closely monitoring these key levels. Chainlink Technical Analysis Shows Mixed Market Signals Chainlink is currently holding above $12.50, a key support level. If it breaks past $14.58, analysts suggest it could climb to $26. This potential rise is closely tied to Bitcoin's price movements. Currently, 53% of LINK holders are at a loss, which may influence market sentiment. Technical indicators like MACD and Bull Bear Power show early signs of a possible upward trend. However, a drop below $12.50 could lead to further declines. Chainlink technical analysis indicates that maintaining support above $13.20 is crucial for a bullish outlook. Market sentiment remains mixed, with many holders near their break-even points. Overall, Chainlink technical analysis suggests cautious optimism, but key resistance levels must be overcome. Continued monitoring of Chainlink technical analysis will be essential for anticipating future price movements.

For those tired of switching between tools and still missing the mark, Web3 ai combines everything into one AI-backed dashboard. From basic trades to advanced strategies, this system makes smarter trading easier and more accessible for everyone in the market. Smart Crypto Picks for 2025 Web3 ai is shaping up to be more than just another AI-powered platform—it’s offering practical tools that matter. Features like real-time signals, portfolio rebalancing, and advanced risk models it deliver what traders need. That’s why many are already calling it the best crypto for 2025. While Ethereum price remains above $1,600 with a bullish RSI, and Chainlink technical analysis holds firm above $12.50, both coins still depend on key resistance levels. For those looking beyond price charts, this platform sets a clear example of what smart trading can look like.

43882814,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/pi-network-and-avalanche-are-growing-cold-wallets-privacy-presale-could-50x-in-2025,1745800166,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/43882814.jpeg,Pi Network and Avalanche Are Growing; Cold Wallet’s Privacy Presale Could 50x In 2025,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/pi-network-and-avalanche-are-growing-cold-wallets-privacy-presale-could-50x-in-2025,"Crypto investors chasing the next breakout are watching Pi Coin and Avalanche closely. Pi jumped 35% after a Chainlink integration, fueling speculation it could hit $3. The move suggests stronger utility and could pave the way for listings on top-tier exchanges. Meanwhile, AVAX is approaching a crucial resistance near $21, with analysts calling for a bullish reversal if volume supports a clean breakout. But while both are driven by momentum and speculation, Cold Wallet is offering something far more rare: a real solution to a growing problem. It is the only Web3 wallet that collects zero data: no IP logs, no analytics, no behavioral tracking. And it is now in Batch 1 of its presale at just $0.007. With a projected launch price near $0.35171, early buyers are looking at a potential 4,900% ROI. In a market that thrives on visibility, Cold Wallet is the one product built to keep you truly invisible, and that is starting to matter more than ever. Pi Coin Surges 35% After Chainlink Deal, Could $3 Be Next? Pi Coin jumped 35% this week after announcing a key integration with Chainlink, pushing its price to around $0.74. The collaboration allows Pi to access real-time data through Chainlink’s oracle system, which helps decentralized applications use accurate price feeds. Analysts believe this could support Pi’s adoption and may lead to listings on larger exchanges such as Binance. Market reaction was immediate. Pi rose from $0.63 to $0.78 in just hours after the update, before stabilizing slightly lower. The surge comes despite a broader monthly decline of over 40%, showing renewed investor interest in the project. Some forecasts now suggest Pi could climb to $3 in the short term, with more ambitious targets placed even higher. The project’s growing ecosystem and strong user base add to that momentum. For traders eyeing emerging altcoins with real use cases and expanding integrations, Pi’s recent moves may signal a return to the spotlight. AVAX Nears Key Resistance: Analyst Says $21 Breakout Could Trigger Full Reversal Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining attention as analyst Crypto Rand highlights a possible bullish reversal if the asset breaks above the $21 level. According to his analysis, AVAX is approaching a critical resistance zone where several technical indicators are converging. A clean move through this price point could mark the start of a broader upward trend. AVAX has faced pressure in recent weeks, but current price action is holding steady near multiple resistance levels. Crypto Rand’s outlook has caught the eye of traders looking for early signals in a still-uncertain market. If AVAX successfully clears the $21 threshold, it may attract renewed buying interest and shift market sentiment. However, the move would need to be supported by rising volume to confirm the trend reversal. AVAX’s current price structure keeps it on the radar for investors seeking assets with short-term upside potential and favorable technical setups. This Wallet Doesn’t Track You, Can’t Profile You, and Still Works Flawlessly; Cold Wallet Is What Web3 Promised Most crypto wallets claim to offer privacy, but nearly all of them collect something: your IP, your activity patterns, even the apps you connect to. Cold Wallet does none of that. It is the only Web3 wallet designed from the start to gather zero metadata. No trackers, no behavior logs, and no background surveillance. Just pure, private access to your crypto, with every layer built to protect, not observe. Cold Wallet uses zero-knowledge cryptography to make sure no one, including the wallet itself, can see your transactions, your wallet balance, or even when you log in. There is no backend logging your behavior, no analytics code quietly watching you. You stay invisible by default. Right now, Cold Wallet is in Batch 1 of its presale, priced at just $0.007. With a confirmed listing price around $0.35171, that’s an estimated 4,900% ROI if you move early. What makes Cold Wallet stand out is that it doesn’t just promise privacy, it runs on it. In a market where every app wants your data, Cold Wallet wants none of it. If you’re serious about protecting your crypto footprint, this is your moment to get in early, before everyone else realizes what real privacy in Web3 should look like. Why Cold Wallet Could Be the Smartest Long-Term Bet Pi and AVAX are gaining attention, but their stories depend on external momentum, new listings, resistance breakouts, and favorable sentiment. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, is rising for a different reason: it solves what every trader eventually realizes is a critical flaw. Today’s wallets leak data. They log behavior. They silently track everything. Cold Wallet fixes that with zero-knowledge infrastructure and a design that forgets you on purpose. It is not just for experts. It runs like an app, but protects like a vault. And right now, with a presale entry at $0.007 and a listing estimate of ~$0.35171, the opportunity is both technical and financial. That is a potential 4,900% gain on a product already built for the regulation-heavy, surveillance-heavy Web3 era that is quickly arriving. Pi might trend. AVAX might reverse. However, the Cold Wallet is where privacy becomes a performance. For investors who think long-term, this is more than an asset, and it is an edge.

Reports suggest TRUMPTAR is gearing up for listings on several major crypto exchanges. Such exposure is expected to attract millions of investors, likely driving a sharp increase in the coin’s value. Already, projections suggest a potential price surge of over 9,000% within the next few days. Currently, TRUMPTAR is only available for trading on decentralized Solana platforms such as Jup.ag and Raydium.io . Early buyers, who have access to the coin before wider exchange listings, stand to benefit the most from the anticipated price movement. The memecoin launched with an initial liquidity of over $6,000 — a notable figure compared to many new entries in the space. How to Purchase TRUMPTAR Early Investors interested in buying TRUMPTAR before its first centralized exchange (CEX) listings can do so on Raydium.io or Jup.ag . To buy, users need to connect a compatible wallet like Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom. They then swap Solana (SOL) for Trump Ends Tariffs by entering the contract address — w7h5t9MrJ77Cu2VCf2apxaMSK1KFkPf6fWNJ7uee144 — into the receiving field. For those without a compatible wallet, setting one up takes only a few minutes. Solana can be transferred from major exchanges like Coinbase or Binance to the wallet to make the purchase. If TRUMPTAR follows the trajectory of previous viral memecoins, early investors could see returns similar to those who got in early on SHIB and DOGE, potentially creating a new generation of crypto millionaires in record time. Solana Memecoin Craze Gains Momentum With larger memecoins like SHIB, DOGE, and DogWifHat (WIF) struggling to maintain momentum in recent weeks, many investors are turning their attention to emerging Solana memecoins such as TRUMPTAR. Despite having no inherent value or utility, these new tokens are attracting speculative investors hoping to capitalize on rapid price growth. The excitement around TRUMPTAR highlights the ongoing appetite for high-risk, high-reward opportunities in the crypto market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It’s Still $0.025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-undervalued-crypto-to-buy-now-with-real-world-use-and-2500-roi-potential-its-still-0-025/,"In a sea of overpriced tokens and short-lived trends, spotting an undervalued cryptocurrency that actually delivers something useful is a rare advantage. Most investors tend to chase what’s already pumped, but some are now turning their attention to projects that are still early, still building, and still offering massive upside. One name keeps coming up in those conversations: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Still priced at just $0.025, MUTM is gaining momentum as a real-world decentralized finance (DeFi) solution—not another meme coin or hype-based token. With analysts pointing to a potential 2,500% return in the coming year, long-term crypto investors are locking in early positions before the price climbs in upcoming presale phases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is built around a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that enables users to lend and borrow digital assets directly, without the need for third-party involvement. Users can lend assets to earn passive yield or borrow against their crypto without selling—providing access to capital while keeping long-term exposure. The platform uses secure, transparent smart contracts to manage the entire process. Unlike many projects that try to imitate popular platforms, Mutuum built its own system from the ground up. The platform features a revenue-driven approach, allocating a portion of its earnings to purchase MUTM tokens directly from the open market. These tokens are then shared with users who hold mtTokens, which represent their deposit positions. This model supports long-term engagement by channeling platform activity into meaningful value redistribution. By directing protocol-generated revenue toward token repurchases and user rewards, Mutuum creates a system where active participants benefit directly from ecosystem growth—an approach that has drawn attention from more experienced investors. One feature setting Mutuum apart is the development of its own overcollateralized stablecoin. Minted through excess collateral locked in the system, this stablecoin offers a way to unlock liquidity without abandoning long-term holdings. It will play a major role in Mutuum’s borrowing system, adding another layer of utility to the ecosystem. Yield generation is also straightforward. When users deposit assets into the protocol, they receive mtTokens, which continuously accumulate interest based on platform activity. These tokens are flexible—users can hold them, redeem them, or use them in other decentralized finance applications. That means real passive income potential, not just speculation. MUTM has a total supply of 4 billion tokens, and the ongoing presale has already seen 420 million tokens sold and over $7 million raised. With nearly 9,000 holders already participating, demand is climbing as the price prepares to rise to $0.03 in the next phase. There are 11 phases total, each offering a higher price point than the last. This creates a natural pressure to get in early. Once the token goes live and major exchange listings kick in, exposure will likely grow exponentially. Combined with the buy-and-redistribute model, this setup is already driving strong FOMO from those watching the presale closely. Let’s run the numbers on what this could look like in practice. An investment of $1,800 at the current price of $0.025 would secure 72,000 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $0.65, that same position would grow to $46,800. And when MUTM climbs closer to the $1 mark over time, you’re looking at a portfolio worth $72,000—all from getting in early, before the broader market catches on. MUTM checks all the right boxes: utility, transparent tokenomics, community traction, and room to grow. It isn’t relying on hype or influencer tweets. Instead, it’s building tools that actually matter in decentralized finance. This isn’t about catching a short-term pump. It’s about identifying a project early—before exchange listings, before media buzz, and before the crowd catches on. With solid fundamentals and a realistic path to real-world use, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may just be the best cryptocurrency to invest in now for those chasing long-term growth and real yield. And at $0.025, it’s still early enough to make every dollar count.

43885138,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=716772,1745805019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43885138.jpeg,Term Finance recovers $1M after oracle bug triggers $1.6M liquidation loss,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/term-finance-recovers-1m-after-loss/,"The Ethereum-based lending platform Term Finance said it had recovered nearly one million dollars after a misconfigured price oracle caused erroneous liquidations in its Treehouse (tETH) market. The issue began when a new ETH oracle provided incorrect price data to the system. This caused automatic liquidations, approximately $1.6 million worth of positions. Term Finance clarified in a post on X that the incident was not a hack, no smart contracts were involved, and no users were attacked, explaining that a technical bug in the configuration of the new oracle caused the issue. The episode again shows how vital oracle feeds are to the DeFi ecosystem. Even tiny things can be catastrophic when it comes to smart contracts. Term finance recovers half of lost funds Term Finance immediately pressed to recover the missing assets. Of the 918 ETH lost in total, they recovered 556 ETH. In particular, 223.197 ETH, valued at around $400,000, was seized by the platform internally. Another 333 ETH, worth roughly $600,000, was returned after what Term called “negotiations.” It also remains unknown who was included in the negotiation or on what terms the pact was made. The company has not yet disclosed additional information regarding the method. With the recovery attempts, the remaining loss is now 362.03 ETH — approximately $650,000 at today’s market rates. That’s much less damaging than the one before, and it takes some pressure off Term Finance and its community. The website did not acknowledge this until media coverage surfaced, and the company has since declared that it will conduct a thorough review of its Oracle integration process to avoid such problems in the future. It also suggested that users affected by the bad liquidations might be eligible for further compensation, though no formal decision had been made. Weekend crypto attacks spark industry scrutiny The Term Finance incident wasn’t crypto’s only bad news over the weekend. The DeFi industry was rocked by a chain of attacks, highlighting the continued risk. Impermax Finance said Saturday that a flash loan attack hit its V3 pools. The exploit siphoned more than $150,000 out of the protocol, according to the blockchain security firm TenArmor. Impermax apologized to users and said a full post-mortem would be released soon. For its part, another Solana DeFi platform, Loopscale , lost $5.8 million in an exploit. Attackers took advantage of security holes, contributing to a growing tally of DeFi losses this year. A centralized platform is also not an exception. Crypto exchange Bitget revealed a $20 million loss after hackers exploited a market connected to an obscure token. Bitget said it had discovered eight accounts suspected of being involved in the scheme and would seek legal action against those behind them. The most recent attacks underline how insecure even the biggest players are. The data suggests that very little is recovered from many hacks. Take Bybit CEO Ben Zhou, for example; He disclosed recently that just 3.84% of stolen funds from their February heist had been frozen. Nearly 28% of the stolen funds — worth millions of dollars — have already gone “dark,” flowing into mixers and peer-to-peer networks, where they become impossible to trace. It was a rare victory compared to many other cases in which victims come up empty-handed. And yet, the incident displays a fundamental weakness in the overall security standards and risk management practices in the DeFi industry. The larger DeFi becomes, the higher the stakes and some projects may soon regret not budgeting more for technical failures.

Bitcoin and XRP have long held the spotlight, but one new name is entering the conversation with speed and structure: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . With market momentum building and investor eyes scanning for 2025’s big play, these three names are emerging not just as short-term picks—but as long-term strategies for real wealth growth. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Shaping Up to Be a High-Conviction Wealth Play Some tokens explode and fade. Others build the foundations quietly—and then take over. MAGACOINFINANCE appears to be the latter. It’s not just early—it’s early and executing. Wallets are growing daily, the community is expanding with real participation, and analyst mentions are starting to include MAGACOINFINANCE in serious wealth-building forecasts. What stands out is the way this project has avoided fluff. No overhype, no over-promising—just a clear, growing platform with the potential to rival the early days of Bitcoin-style entry points. For investors with long-term vision, this may be one of the last tokens still early enough to move on. Rising in Parallel: Ethereum, Polygon, Tron, and Arbitrum Ethereum continues to dominate smart contract innovation. Its Layer-2 integrations and network upgrades keep it vital across every use case. Polygon is Ethereum’s trusted scaling engine, pushing transaction speeds and onboarding major real-world partners—from corporations to institutions. Tron keeps volume high and transaction costs low, especially in Asia and among fintech products. It’s one of the most adopted blockchains for payments. Arbitrum is leading the Ethereum Layer-2 conversation, providing scalability and seamless user experiences for decentralized app developers. Each of these platforms is strong—but their early breakout phase is largely behind them. MAGACOINFINANCE , however, is just entering it. Final Word Looking ahead to 2025, the names that may define the year are already taking shape. Bitcoin and XRP continue to prove why they’re essential. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is starting to look like the next big crypto story in the making. The time to find tomorrow’s wealth builders is now—before they become today’s headlines.

When momentum builds, it builds fast—and the market is buzzing about two names that are setting the pace: Solana and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . One is a proven powerhouse gaining fresh traction. The other is a bold new contender that’s turning heads before the mainstream even notices. This is the moment investors dream about—when a project moves from early whispers to loud watchlist alerts. And right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is doing exactly that. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Picking Up Speed With Zero Gimmicks Some tokens go viral for a week. MAGACOINFINANCE is doing something far more sustainable—it’s building. The excitement isn’t artificial. It’s the result of measured execution, steady wallet adoption, and growing attention from research-driven investors. Community channels are growing daily. Social conversations are shifting from “What is this?” to “How early am I?” And perhaps most importantly, the token is showing signs of real structure: transparent development, active leadership, and a clear roadmap that people can actually follow. Momentum is no longer speculative—it’s visible. Solana Stays Hot With Performance and Expansion Solana has been here before—and it’s coming back stronger. Known for its lightning-fast processing and low transaction costs, Solana’s recent uptick isn’t just another rally—it’s tied to actual expansion across apps, integrations, and ecosystem upgrades. With developer activity on the rise and major apps continuing to choose Solana as their foundation, the token is once again showing that it can capture serious volume when the market warms up. Also Trending: NEAR Protocol, Chainlink, Ethereum, and Aave NEAR Protocol is gaining respect for its fast-growing development community and user-focused scalability. It’s quietly becoming a platform of choice for app builders and startups entering Web3. Chainlink continues to be indispensable. As smart contract platforms demand secure, off-chain data inputs, Chainlink remains the most trusted source in the oracle space. Ethereum is still the beating heart of blockchain infrastructure. Layer-2 growth, staking upgrades, and enterprise engagement keep it at the center of any serious discussion. Aave stands tall in on-chain lending and asset management. With continued innovation and flexibility, it’s a staple for those looking to build financial primitives on-chain. These projects are strong, yes—but they’re also established. The excitement now? It’s centered around MAGACOINFINANCE , where early means opportunity—and opportunity is shrinking fast. Final Word $10,000 in 30 days? It’s ambitious—but not unheard of in crypto. Timing is everything. Solana is proving it still has fire. MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is showing it’s more than talk—it’s motion. This might be your window—before the rest of the market catches up.

Feist, who had the blockchain’s “ danksharding ” data storage solution named after him, put forward EIP-9698 on April 27, which would introduce a “deterministic gas limit growth schedule” starting at epoch 369017, or around June 1. The proposal would gradually increase the gas limit by a factor of 10 for roughly two years, or 164,250 epochs, when one final tenfold increase would occur. Ethereum clients would need to vote on the proposal for it to take effect, Feist said. “By introducing a predictable exponential growth pattern as a client default, this EIP encourages a sustainable and transparent gas limit trajectory, aligned with expected advancements in hardware and protocol efficiency,” he added. As Ethereum can occasionally reach up to 20 TPS in blocks dominated by simple transactions, a 100x gas limit increase could theoretically increase Ethereum’s TPS to 2,000. Feist’s proposal would better position Ethereum to compete with the likes of Solana, which currently processes a non-vote TPS between 800 to 1,050 and has a theoretical TPS of 65,000. Source: Fabda.eth The EIP would expand the current gas limit of 36 million to 3.6 billion, potentially allowing around 6,000 transactions to fit into Ethereum blocks. Feist’s proposal comes after Ethereum validators agreed to raise the gas limit from 30 million to 36 million in February. Before that, the last change to Ethereum’s gas limit occurred in August 2021 under the London hard fork, where the figure was roughly doubled from 15 million to 30 million. Daily change in Ethereum Average Gas Limit over the last five years. Source: YCharts Feist acknowledged that a rapid increase in the gas limit under his proposal may stress less-optimized nodes and increase block propagation times. “However, the exponential schedule with very gradual increments per epoch gives node operators and developers ample time to adapt and optimize,” he said. Related: Ethereum community members propose new fee structure for the app layer EIP-9698 marks the Ethereum community’s latest effort to boost scalability at the base layer after predominantly focusing on scaling through layer 2 solutions in recent years. Critics of Ethereum’s layer-2 focused strategy claim that it has fragmented the ecosystem into several siloed chains with little interoperability, leading to a worse user experience. EIP-9678 looks to increase gas limit Ethereum developers are also looking to test a fourfold increase of Ethereum’s gas limit in the Fusaka hard fork under EIP-9678. Fusaka has been flagged as possibly going online in late 2025, while the next major Ethereum upgrade, Pectra, is scheduled to go live on the mainnet in May.

A wallet named “GASW,” created on March 6, 2025, just bought 48 million Pi coins — and none of them are locked. This could mean that a major player, like a company, institution, or even a government, is getting involved. Other Positive Catalysts: Binance, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, has shared new listing guidelines that have caught the attention of the crypto world — especially fans of Pi Coin. Since the platform now has more direct rules for adding new tokens, many believe this could open the door for Pi Coin to be listed on Binance soon. Meanwhile, the Pi Network team recently shared a roadmap for their migration process to improve transparency and respond to user concerns. However, the update left many disappointed, as it didn’t include details like how many users are still waiting or how many accounts can be migrated each day.

A group of RTFKT users led by Jagdeep Cheema claimed in the proposed class suit filed in a Brooklyn federal court on April 25 that they suffered “significant damages” as a result of Nike touting its sneaker-themed NFTs to gain investors, then shuttering the platform. The suit claimed the NFTs were unregistered securities, as Nike sold them without registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It accused the company of using “its iconic brand and marketing prowess to hype, promote, and prop up the unregistered securities that RTFKT sold.” “Because the Nike NFTs derived their value from the success of a given promoter and project — here, Nike and its marketing efforts — investors purchased this digital asset with the hope that its value would increase in the future as the project grows in popularity based on the Nike brand,” the lawsuit argued. The class suit claimed investors suffered damages due to Nike shutting its NFT platform. Source: CourtListener The lawsuit asks for $5 million in damages, claiming Nike broke consumer protection laws and violated various state unfair trade and competition laws. A US court hasn’t definitively ruled on whether NFTs are securities. Still, in an April 9 letter to the SEC, marketplace OpenSea urged the regulator to exclude NFTs from federal securities laws, arguing they don’t meet the legal definition of a security. In its case against Nike, the class group said that the court doesn’t necessarily need to rule on the legal status of NFTs to address the complaint. NFT market value dips In 2021, Nike acquired the NFT firm RTFKT Studios, which created virtual sneakers. According to the complaint, holders of the resulting Nike NFTs were told the tokens could be traded peer-to-peer on the secondary market and used to complete challenges and quests that could lead to rewards. Nike’s crypto kick NFT collection was changing hands for an average of 3.5 Ether ( ETH ), or around $8,000 when they were first listed on April 18, 2022, but were trading for around 0.009 Ether, or roughly $16 as of April 21, according to OpenSea. Nike NFTs have seen a sharp drop in value since they were first listed. Source: OpenSea Nike shut down RTFKT in January , which the class suit claims decimated investors when “prices plunged and did not recover,” and also took away the chance to take part in the challenges and quests, which the group argued was a primary reason for purchasing the tokens. Related: RTFKT’s CloneX avatars reappear after issue blacks out NFTs The overall NFT market dropped sharply in the first quarter of 2025, with sales plunging 63% year-over-year, to $1.5 billion in total sales from January to March 2025, down from $4.1 billion during the same period in 2024.

This ETF is expected to go live on April 30th, 2025. While it’s not a spot ETF — which tracks the actual price of XRP — it’s still a huge step forward for XRP’s recognition on Wall Street. The ETF approval comes just a few years after Ripple, the company behind XRP, was locked in a long legal battle with the SEC. Now, XRP is moving from courtrooms to trading floors, joining the ranks of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which already have both futures and spot ETFs. Some investors were unsure at first, asking, “Why futures and not spot?” But futures ETFs are often the first step. This was the path for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and experts believe a spot XRP ETF could be next. Futures trading allows big institutional investors to take positions on XRP, whether the market goes up or down — a common and healthy part of mature financial markets.

And the good news doesn’t stop there. In Brazil, the XRP H11 ETF has just launched on the country’s main stock exchange, making it the first XRP-focused ETF in the world. This global momentum suggests XRP is no longer being left behind. Just a few years ago, XRP was under heavy legal scrutiny. Now, it’s being listed on international exchanges, with regulated investment products opening the door for more adoption. From being targeted by regulators to becoming a favorite of institutional investors — XRP is clearly turning the page.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 02:54:52
