Between market rallies and wild presale activity, everyone’s got their eye on that next crypto to explode. While some tokens ride the hype, others build tech that solves real-world pain points—and that’s where things get real interesting. Take Qubetics, for example. It’s not just riding the wave. It’s making it. With over 509 million $TICS tokens sold, 25,200+ holders, and more than $16.4 million raised in crypto presale stage 31, this isn’t just hype—it’s traction. At just $0.1902 per $TICS, some folks are loading up for what could be a breakout year. Now, let’s not forget Maker and Binance. Both powerhouses in their own lanes. Maker’s locking horns with real-world asset backing, while Binance keeps expanding its empire across regions and regulations. But Qubetics? It’s rewriting the rulebook. What’s coming next is a look at how each of these three could be the next crypto to explode, where they stand right now, and why one of them might just flip the script on blockchain as to know it. Qubetics: Redefining Blockchain Utility in 2025 Qubetics isn’t trying to copy what came before—it’s filling the gaps left wide open. Built for everyday people, business pros, and devs, its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet and Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace put real usability in your hands. Qubetics is rolling out a Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, a feature making waves across blockchain forums and crypto Reddit. Why does it matter? Because converting physical or traditional assets (like property deeds, invoices, or contracts) into secure digital tokens is unlocking new economies. Unlike past attempts that lacked user-friendly execution, Qubetics keeps things intuitive. Here’s what sets it apart: Seamless access via its multi-chain wallet Built-in security audits and compliance layers Tools tailored for freelancers, SMBs, and global firms On-chain transparency for legal clarity and dispute resolution Quick asset liquidity with minimal middlemen Beyond its marketplace, Qubetics’ presale stats alone scream traction: Stage: 31 $TICS Token Price: $0.1902 Tokens Sold: 509M+ Holders: 25,200+ Raised: $16.4M+ Some blockchain analysts have weighed in too. With mainnet launch around the corner, $TICS at $1 could yield a 425% ROI, $5 brings 2527%, and if it hits $15—you’re staring at 7783% ROI. But here’s the kicker—Qubetics is focused on function over fanfare. Add in cross-chain compatibility, mobile-ready features, and dev-friendly APIs, and this thing’s not just surviving—it’s building. Maker: Solid, Stable, and All About Real-World Assets Maker’s always played the long game. One of the OGs in decentralized finance (DeFi), MakerDAO’s bread and butter is Dai—the algorithmic stablecoin backed by collateralized assets. But in 2025, Maker’s doing more than keeping things stable—it’s doubling down on Real-World Asset (RWA) integration. Recent reports on MakerDAO’s Endgame Plan reveal the protocol is actively working with fintech partners to onboard traditional assets like bonds, invoices, and real estate-backed instruments into the ecosystem. Still, it’s not without hurdles. Regulatory uncertainties, rising competition in stablecoins, and limited user interface innovation have held it back from being that next crypto to explode. While it’s trustworthy and proven, the lack of everyday user appeal may keep it more niche than mass-market. Yet for those looking at risk-minimized exposure in the blockchain space? Maker’s still a heavyweight. Binance: The CeFi Titan Keeping the Pressure On Binance is like that tech billionaire who just won’t sit down. Love it or hate it, Binance is everywhere. From NFTs to DeFi to its own BNB Chain, it’s more than just an exchange now—it’s infrastructure. And here’s what’s got folks buzzing in 2025: BNB Greenfield, a decentralized storage and data solution that’s gaining traction among Web3 app builders. Binance is pushing to dominate beyond just buying/selling crypto—now it wants to own how data flows across blockchain. But it’s not all smooth sailing. Centralized exchange tokens like BNB are facing pressure from DeFi protocols and regulatory authorities. Questions around asset custody and internal governance transparency still loom. Still, BNB remains a top-5 token by market cap and consistently ranks in high daily trading volumes. If Binance keeps innovating while navigating the legal maze? It might just reclaim the crown as the next crypto to explode. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: Why It Matters One of the hottest topics in 2025? Real-world asset tokenization. Here’s why it’s taking over headlines: Makes global trade frictionless Enables partial ownership of expensive assets (like real estate) Provides transparent, immutable records on-chain Opens access to financing for underserved markets Cuts out middlemen and legal complexity Qubetics is going all-in on this. While others are talking theory, Qubetics has built the pipes. From its cross-chain compatibility to legal-grade smart contracts, it’s turning buzzwords into blueprints. For businesses in Central Asia or small-time operators in Canada? This kind of infrastructure is a game-changer. Real-world tokenization isn’t just a feature—it’s the future of finance. And Qubetics isn’t waiting around. Conclusion Crypto hype comes and goes, but tech that solves actual problems? That’s where the gold’s at. Qubetics is digging into that goldmine with a tokenization platform and tools that actually work. Maker’s playing it smart and secure, and Binance? Well, it’s still the big dog making bold moves. Looking at the facts, traction, and what’s being built—not just talked about—Qubetics might just be the next crypto to explode . Don’t sit on the sidelines watching others scoop up what could be one of blockchain’s biggest plays in 2025. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com Presale: https://buy.qubetics.com Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://x.com/qubetics Frequently Asked Questions What is Qubetics’ Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace? It’s a platform that turns real-world assets like contracts and property into secure, tradable digital tokens. How does $TICS compare to Maker’s Dai in 2025? $TICS offers growth potential and real-world use cases, while Dai focuses on price stability through collateral. Is Binance still a safe bet after regulatory challenges? Yes, Binance has regained momentum by securing licenses in 15+ countries and launching new Web3 solutions. What’s the current price of Qubetics $TICS token? As of Stage 31, $TICS is priced at $0.1902 with over 509 million tokens sold. Which crypto project is solving real business problems in 2025? Qubetics leads with tools like a multi-chain wallet and asset tokenization for global SMBs.

According to SMQKE, Digital Commodities Capital Corp. (CSE: RIPP), a publicly traded company, has officially confirmed holding XRP in its corporate treasury, marking the first public disclosure of XRP holdings by a listed firm. The company’s announcement revealed that it currently holds 103,000 XRP and is exploring further exposure to Ripple-affiliated assets and technologies. SMQKE noted that this moment signals a shift in how institutional players position XRP.

Digital Commodities… pic.twitter.com/AQzejOTR9g — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 25, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Unlocks Institutional Interest The announcement follows the March 24, 2025, settlement between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which ended a years-long legal dispute. Digital Commodities Capital described the settlement as a pivotal moment that delivered long-awaited regulatory clarity to the digital asset space. According to the company, this clarity enables more balanced engagement between innovators and regulators and strengthens the legal framework for classifying utility-driven tokens like XRP. In this context, SMQKE pointed out that institutions were already preparing for this outcome, even as retail investors grew uncertain during the litigation period. Strategic Long-Term Positioning Around XRP Digital Commodities Capital’s CEO, Brayden Sutton, stated that the company believes in the future of compliant, utility-based digital assets and identified XRP as a prime example. The confirmed holdings are part of a broader strategy to build long-term value through diversified digital assets. Sutton also indicated that the company is actively reviewing further investment opportunities within Ripple’s ecosystem . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 SMQKE interpreted this as a clear sign that XRP is being taken seriously by strategic capital allocators, not just as a speculative asset, but as part of long-term institutional investment theses. A Precedent That May Influence Other Institutions SMQKE emphasized that this is more than a single corporate action. It is a precedent that could influence other publicly traded entities to disclose their XRP positions or consider adding the asset to their portfolios. According to the post, XRP is entering a new phase where its role in digital finance is acknowledged not only by early adopters but by formal institutions operating under public market oversight. The researcher concluded that XRP has never lost its value proposition among those who understand long-term fundamentals and that its official recognition by a public company marks the beginning of broader institutional engagement.

Van de Poppe stated that altcoins are showing signs of recovery after a four-year historical bear market. According to the analyst, investor expectations have been seriously shaken over the past 3 months. However, current indicators show that the market is green. Van de Poppe said that many factors that move the markets come from outside the cryptocurrency sector. Van de Poppe stated that the increase in liquidity has a direct upward effect on Bitcoin. He said that as the money supply (M2) expands, the prices of rare assets like Bitcoin are expected to rise. The analyst stated that China has started quantitative easing (QE), Europe has lowered interest rates and the US is preparing to increase the money supply with interest rate cuts, and that these steps create a strong driving force for risky assets. Related News: SEC Approves Highly Anticipated XRP ETF - Price Reacts - Not Yet Approved Spot ETF on the Horizon Now According to Van de Poppe, the peak in gold in the short term and the increase in risk appetite create a positive environment for Bitcoin and altcoins. The analyst stated that Bitcoin is supported by developments such as ETF approval and Donald Trump becoming the US President, and that these factors create a new wave of liquidity. Van de Poppe, who said that gold has outperformed the S&P 500 by 20% since 2022, argued that despite this, the markets are now starting to lose their upward momentum in gold. He predicted that the next 12-18 months could offer a strong performance for risky assets. Van de Poppe stated that the CNH/USD (Chinese Yuan/US Dollar) parity has a decisive effect on the altcoin market. Past data shows that major rallies begin in altcoin markets when the CNH/USD parity bottoms. Recalling the examples of 2016 and 2019, the analyst pointed out that the yuan has bottomed after the sharp declines experienced recently. He claimed that this development could open the door to a new period of rise in the altcoin market. Van de Poppe stated that macroeconomic factors have replaced the traditional four-year market cycle approach, and that liquidity and global economic conditions will now be more at the forefront. He stated that a serious revival could occur in altcoins as the Chinese Yuan strengthens and gold prices correct. *This is not investment advice.

Livingston said miners currently produce around 450 BTC per day or approximately 13,500 BTC per month, but Strategy acquired 379,800 BTC in the last six months. This translates to the firm purchasing roughly 2,087 BTC per day — far in excess of daily miner output. The author added: ""When Bitcoin becomes this scarce, access to Bitcoin will require paying a premium. Lending against Bitcoin will cost more. Borrowing Bitcoin will become a luxury business reserved for nation-states and corporate whales, and Strategy will control the bottleneck."" ""BTC's global cost of capital will no longer be set by 'the market.' It will be set by the gravitational policies of the first Bitcoin superpower: Strategy,"" Livingston continued. The author's prediction of a Bitcoin supply crunch translates into much higher BTC prices if Strategy can continue its pace of BTC acquisitions while market demand for the supply-capped digital asset grows among institutional and retail investors. The Bitcoin miner reserve, a metric tracking the total amount of BTC held in miner wallets, continues to decline.

Critics of the company warn that the debt-based approach to BTC acquisition could sink Strategy financially if a prolonged BTC bear market takes effect and also warn of greater systemic risks to BTC from such a high concentration of the digital currency held by a single entity.

Ammous argued that institutions like BlackRock and Strategy holding high concentrations of BTC could not engineer a hard fork increasing Bitcoin's maximum supply, as it would massively devalue their holdings, which, at the end of the day, belong to shareholders with the power to divest.

Analysts expect Bitcoin to gain an additional 40% by the end of the year Select altcoins are showing a positive bias on improving crypto sentiment. Bitcoin ( BTC ) rose more than 10% this week as buyers made a strong comeback, pushing the price to the overhead resistance at $95,000. Although buyers are struggling to clear the overhead hurdle, a positive sign is that they have not given up much ground to the bears. The sharp up move is backed by solid buying in the US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which witnessed inflows of $3.06 billion , according to Farside Investors data. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said in a post on X that it was really notable to see “HOW FAST the flows can go from 1st gear to 5th gear.” Crypto market data daily view.

Sina’s Bitcoin Quantile Model projects Bitcoin to reach between $130,000 and $163,000 before the end of 2025. Anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 had an even bigger target of more than $200,000 for Bitcoin in Q4 of this year. Could Bitcoin maintain its momentum and rise above the overhead resistance? Let’s study the charts of the cryptocurrencies that look strong in the near term. Bitcoin price prediction Bitcoin has been witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears near the crucial $95,000 level. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($88,619) and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought zone indicate that bulls are in command. A close above $95,000 could propel the BTC/USDT pair to $100,000 and eventually to $107,000. Sellers are expected to aggressively defend the zone between $107,000 and $109,588. The 20-day EMA is the critical near-term support to watch out for because a break below it brings the large $95,000 to $73,777 range into play. BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 4-hour chart shows the bears are fiercely defending the $95,000 level but are struggling to sink the pair below the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off the 20-EMA, it enhances the prospects of a break above $95,000. The pair could then surge to $100,000. Instead, if the price maintains below the 20-EMA, the pair could tumble to the 50-simple moving average. This is an important level for the bulls to defend because a break below it could pull the pair to $86,000. Sui price prediction Sui ( SUI ) has been facing resistance near $3.90, but the shallow pullback suggests that the bulls are in no hurry to dump their positions. SUI/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView If the price stays above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $3.14, the bulls will make another attempt to shove the SUI/USDT pair above $3.90. If they can pull it off, the pair may skyrocket to $4.25 and then to $5. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below $3.14, it signals the start of a deeper correction toward the 50% retracement level of $2.94. Buyers are expected to fiercely defend the zone between $2.94 and the 20-day EMA ($2.69). SUI/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the pair is finding support at the 20-EMA, but the sellers are active at higher levels. The bears will again attempt to sink the pair below the 20-EMA. If they succeed, the pair could slump to $3.14. Buyers will have to swiftly push the price above the $3.81 to $3.90 overhead resistance zone if they want to retain the advantage. If they do that, the pair could start the next leg of the up move to $4.25. Avalanche price prediction Avalanche ( AVAX ) has been range-bound between $23.50 and $15.27 for the past few days. In a range, traders usually buy near the support and sell close to the resistance. AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Although buyers have failed to push the price above $23.50, a positive sign is that they have not ceded much ground to the bears. That increases the likelihood of a break above $23.50. If that happens, the AVAX/USDT pair will complete a double-bottom pattern, which has a target objective of $31.73. This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages. The pair may then remain stuck inside the range for a few more days. AVAX/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair has been consolidating in a narrow range between $21.60 and $23.10 for some time. That suggests the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate another leg higher. If buyers propel the price above $23.10, the pair could surge to $25. There is resistance at $23.50, but it is likely to be crossed. Alternatively, a drop below $21.60 signals that the bulls have given up. That may pull the price down to $19.50.

TRUMP/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView A rally above $16 is attracting sellers, but a shallow pullback suggests that every minor dip is being purchased. If buyers drive the price above $16, the TRUMP/USDT pair may reach $17.69, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense. However, if buyers bulldoze their way through, the pair could skyrocket to $19.60 and then to $22.40. Conversely, a deeper pullback suggests that the short-term bulls are booking profits. The zone between $11.56 and $12.45 is expected to act as a solid support. If the price rebounds off the support zone, the pair may swing between $11.56 and $16 for some time. Selling could accelerate if the pair breaks below the 20-day EMA ($10.73). TRUMP/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pair turned down from $16 but is finding support near the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. That suggests the bulls are active at lower levels. Buyers will try to push the price above the $16 overhead resistance, starting the next leg of the uptrend. Contrarily, a break and close below the 20-EMA suggests that the bullish momentum has weakened. The pair may then slump to $14 and later to the solid support near $12. Sellers will be back in the driver’s seat on a drop below $11.50. Bittensor price prediction Bittensor ( TAO ) broke and closed above the downtrend line on April 20, suggesting that the bears are losing their grip. TAO/USDT daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The up move is facing resistance at $375, but the pullback is expected to find support at the 20-day EMA ($298). A solid bounce off the 20-day EMA signals a change in sentiment from selling on rallies to buying on dips. The bulls will then attempt to drive the TAO/USDT pair above $375. If they succeed, the next stop may be $495. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the downtrend line, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the breakout. The pair then risks falling to $222. TAO/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The pullback is finding support at the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart. Buyers will try to resume the up move by pushing the price above the $375 resistance. If they manage to do that, the pair could reach $425. Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to sink the price below the 20-EMA, opening the doors for a drop to the 50-SMA and later to the downtrend line. A break below the downtrend line tilts the advantage in favor of the bears. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

That’s exactly where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out. Still priced at just $0.025, this DeFi project is starting to generate serious attention, and analysts are now pointing to a possible 2,000% return as its utility rolls out and adoption scales. With most new tokens offering hype but no real backing, MUTM is doing the opposite—quietly building an ecosystem that makes decentralized finance more accessible, more flexible, and more rewarding for everyone involved. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Low-cap crypto assets often get overlooked—but when utility meets timing, they tend to outperform. Mutuum Finance is still in its presale phase, yet it has already attracted nearly 9,000 participants and raised over $7 million. More than 420 million tokens have been sold to date, and momentum is building fast as the current pricing window begins to narrow. Every new presale phase increases the token price, and many investors are stepping in now to lock in their allocation before the next jump to $0.03. At the heart of Mutuum’s architecture is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Users who deposit crypto assets into the system receive mtTokens, which represent their deposits and grow in value over time by accruing interest. These tokens can be held, transferred, or used within other decentralized applications, making them more than just placeholders—they’re active earning tools. On the borrowing side, the system is designed to protect both users and the protocol itself. Borrowers must provide more collateral than the loan value, following a strict Loan-to-Value (LTV) threshold. This model ensures long-term sustainability and positions Mutuum as a protocol with structure, not guesswork. One of the standout features for long-term holders is the platform’s revenue alignment model. Instead of constantly issuing new tokens to reward users, Mutuum channels a portion of its revenue back into buying MUTM directly from the market. These tokens are then redistributed to ecosystem participants—especially mtToken holders, who are rewarded for their involvement. This system not only avoids the pitfalls of inflationary emissions, but also creates sustained demand over time—a key driver in token appreciation and yield generation. At the current rate of $0.025 per token, a $1,000 investment would grant access to 40,000 MUTM tokens. When forecasts come to fruition and MUTM climbs to $0.50, that position would be worth $20,000—a 20x increase. Stretch that further toward the projected 2,000% growth, and the potential multiplies even more. This isn’t just a numbers game; it’s a strategy. With real utility, strong community growth, and protocol revenue working behind the scenes, this token has ingredients many established cryptocurrencies are still missing. The team behind Mutuum has already announced that a beta version of the platform will be released around the time of token launch, giving users an immediate opportunity to engage with its features. Additionally, the platform’s overcollateralized stablecoin is in development, allowing users to borrow against their assets without needing to sell them—adding another layer of usability and flexibility. Once live, MUTM is expected to be listed on multiple exchanges, opening the door to broader access and significantly increasing its exposure across the crypto market. Mutuum Finance is doing what many low-priced tokens don’t—it’s delivering structure, smart mechanics, and meaningful growth potential. For those looking into the best crypto to invest in for long-term gains, MUTM is emerging as a strong candidate. At just a fraction of a dollar, with strong utility, passive income mechanisms, and a clear path forward, it represents more than just another presale. It’s a project with real legs—and the potential to change portfolios in the months ahead.

While Bitcoin and Solana are prime examples of how small, early investments can multiply into life-changing returns, today’s spotlight is shifting to a new name: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . This token isn’t promising overnight riches—but what it is offering is the combination of timing, structure, and momentum that defined the earliest days of both Bitcoin and Solana. That’s why early adopters are watching closely. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining the Kind of Early-Stage Traction That Matters What makes a project stand out in its first phase? Consistent delivery, growing wallet activity, and conversations that go beyond the hype. That’s exactly what MAGACOINFINANCE is doing—and why it’s earning a spot on investor shortlists across the board. The token isn’t just climbing—it’s gaining credibility. Community channels are growing by the hour. Early holders are sticking around, not selling. And its roadmap is being checked off in real-time. It’s the kind of build-up that looks eerily similar to the patterns Bitcoin and Solana showed before they took off. Notable Competitors Still in the Mix: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin, and Litecoin Uniswap remains dominant in decentralized trading, with unmatched liquidity and smart contract simplicity. But its market cap suggests its biggest run may already be behind it. Polkadot is still pushing boundaries in blockchain interoperability, and its parachain system is driving useful experimentation—but it’s a maturing network. Bitcoin , of course, still leads the market. But at its current stage, it’s a store of value, not a surprise mover. Litecoin continues to be a reliable transactional coin, with low fees and broad integration. However, it’s largely seen as stable rather than explosive. Meanwhile, MAGACOINFINANCE still lives in the discovery zone—and that’s where the most growth often hides. Final Word Can MAGACOINFINANCE.COM turn a small investment into millions? Time will tell—but the elements are all there: strong launch, growing trust, and market timing that feels exactly right. Bitcoin and Solana proved that the early mover gets the biggest reward. The next one could already be here.

The US President said that the accompanying tax reduction will focus on those earning less than $200,000 per year. ""It will be a bonanza for America. The External Revenue Service is happening,"" Trump wrote in an April 27 Truth Social post . Source: Donald Trump President Trump previously floated the idea of eliminating the federal income tax collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and replacing revenues from income taxes with tariffs collected on imported goods. The US President's April 27 Truth Social post revealed the first concrete details of the proposed plan since Trump and members of his cabinet began touting comprehensive tax reform in October 2024. Bitcoin treasury firms driving $200 trillion hyperbitcoinization — Adam Back Investment firms with Bitcoin-focused treasuries are front-running global Bitcoin adoption , which may see the world’s first cryptocurrency soar to a $200 trillion market capitalization in the coming decade. Institutions and governments worldwide are starting to recognize the unique monetary properties of Bitcoin ( BTC ), according to Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream and the inventor of Hashcash. “$MSTR and other treasury companies are an arbitrage of the dislocation between the bitcoin future and todays fiat world,” Back wrote in an April 26 X post. “A sustainable and scalable $100-$200 trillion trade front-running hyperbitcoinization. scalable enough for most big listed companies to move to btc treasury,” he added. Hyperbitcoinization refers to the theoretical future where Bitcoin soars to become the largest global currency, replacing fiat money due to its inflationary economics and growing distrust in the legacy financial system. Source: Adam Back Bitcoin’s price outpacing fiat money inflation remains the main driver of global hyperbitcoinization, Back said, adding: “Some people think treasury strategy is a temporary glitch. i’m saying no it's a logical and sustainable arbitrage. but not for ever, the driver is bitcoin price going up over 4 year periods faster than interest and inflation.” US crypto rules like “floor is lava” game without lights — Hester Peirce SEC Commissioner and head of the crypto task force , Hester Peirce, says US financial firms are navigating crypto in a way that’s similar to playing the children’s game “the floor is lava,” but in the dark. “It is time that we find a way to end this game. We need to turn on the lights and build some walkways over the lava pit,” Peirce said at the SEC “Know Your Custodian” roundtable event on April 25. Peirce explained that SEC registrants are forced to approach crypto-related activities like “the floor is lava,” where the aim is to jump from one piece of furniture to the next without touching the ground, except here, touching crypto directly is the lava. “A D.C. version of this game is our regulatory approach to crypto assets, and crypto asset custody in particular,” she said. Peirce said that, much like in the game, firms wanting to engage with crypto must avoid directly holding it due to unclear regulatory rules. “To engage in crypto-related activities, SEC-registrants have had to hop from one poorly illuminated regulatory space to the next, all while ensuring that they never touch any crypto asset,” Peirce said.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|UNI|USDT|XRP|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|FDUSD|TON|USDC|ENA|ZK|WLD|OM|KAVA|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-27 22:10:43

Over the course of the year, the IC3 recorded over 140,000 complaints linked to cryptocurrency, which led to staggering financial losses of $9.3 billion. Alarming Trend A significant portion of these losses came from individuals aged 60 and above, who filed roughly 33,000 complaints and suffered a combined total of $2.8 billion in losses. This age group also saw the largest increase in both reported complaints and financial harm. The IC3’s report also noted a dramatic year-over-year increase in losses – 66% higher than in 2023, when total losses amounted to $5.6 billion. Investment scams involving cryptocurrency were the primary source of these losses, but the report also highlighted other schemes such as sextortion, where criminals manipulate personal content to coerce victims into sending money, and fraud involving crypto ATMs. Additionally, ransomware attacks, which had been a recurring issue, showed a 9% rise in 2024, thereby posing a growing threat to critical infrastructure. Overall, fraud and crypto scams were the most significant contributors to the rise in reported cybercrimes, with older individuals particularly vulnerable to these high-stakes digital fraud schemes. On the other hand, pig butchering scams, which were once mainly targeted at older adults, are now increasingly affecting younger individuals, particularly those aged 30 to 49. A recent study by Cyvers examined 150 major crypto platforms, revealing over 200,000 scam incidents and $5.5 billion in losses in 2024. The research focused on Ethereum-based scams and uncovered significant fraud across various platforms, including major exchanges, a crypto-friendly bank, and institutional trading platforms. The scale of impact varied, but the trend is clear: younger people are becoming the prime victims. Operation Level Up ‘Operation Level Up’ was thus initiated with the assistance of FBI agents and the US Secret Service to address the growing issue of cryptocurrency investment fraud. Pig butchering involves fraudsters building online relationships with victims and convincing them to invest in a fraudulent cryptocurrency platform. As a result of this operation, a total of 4,323 individuals affected by cryptocurrency investment fraud were informed of the scam. Of these victims, 76% were unaware they had fallen victim to fraud. The estimated financial savings for these victims amounted to $285.6 million. Additionally, 42 victims were referred to an FBI victim specialist for support regarding potential suicidal thoughts.

Bitwise CEO Drops Jaw-Dropping New Prediction,https://thecoinrise.com/50-trillion-bitcoin-boom-bitwise-ceo-drops-jaw-dropping-new-prediction/,"Hunter Horsley, Bitwise CEO, has dropped a bold prediction concerning Bitcoin (BTC). Horsley says Bitcoin can hit a $50 trillion valuation if it assumes the role of a digital alternative to the U.S fiat. Bitcoin Positioned Beyond Gold as a Global Value Store In an update shared on X, Horsley maintained that BTC’s worth is much more than that of gold, a traditional store of value. He notes that BTC is more like U.S. Treasuries and the U.S. dollar, which, when aggregated, are valued at approximately $50 trillion. Bitcoin is an apolitical, digital monetary asset. The right comparison may be not just Gold (~$23T) — But also Treasuries and USD (~$50T). When people want to digitally store value, the latter is often the way. — Hunter Horsley (@HHorsley) April 26, 2025 The estimated value of gold is about $23 trillion globally, but Horsley highlights that Bitcoin has more advantages as it exists online. He insists that the coin remains the preferred way investors store “value” in today’s financial world. According to the Bitwise CEO, some features that make Bitcoin appealing are that it is “an apolitical digital monetary asset.” That is, it is not tied to anyone, country, or government. The decentralized feature sets Bitcoin out as an asset. The message behind Horsley’s update is to highlight the possibility of Bitcoin if countries worldwide progressively adopt digital value storage. Bitwise’s Growing BTC Bet Reflects Horsley’s Conviction Horsley has always been bullish about BTC. His stance aligns with the principle of Bitwise. The asset management company under Horsley’s leadership has increased Bitwise’s BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF), BITB, to over 39,000 BTC. Bitwise’s Bitcoin holding has been estimated at approximately $3.67 billion. Hence, Horsley’s stance on the potential of Bitcoin is based on a position of knowledge. Clearly, Bitcoin has grown from competing with gold or chasing technology stocks to positioning itself as a notable force in the financial world . How Bitwise’s CEO’s prediction materializes remains an event to look forward to in the financial world. Bitcoin’s Rising Institutional Adoption Fuels Optimism As of this writing, the coin was trading at $94,118.85 with a market capitalization of $1.86 trillion. This positions it as the leading digital asset in the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin’s appeal has led to growing institutional adoption from firms like Metaplanet, Semler Scientific , and Strategy.

Bitcoin, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM, and Ethereum Are Heating Up!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-580-turn-into-1-9-million-bitcoin-magacoinfinance-com-and-ethereum-are-heating-up/,"In a market known for once-in-a-generation wins, timing is everything. Catching the right project at the right moment is how legends are made. And now, early investors are wondering whether MAGACOINFINANCE.COM could be that next major play—the kind of early entry that shifts portfolios entirely. There’s no question this token is attracting serious attention. From organic growth to mounting analyst discussions, this isn’t another project trying to go viral overnight. It’s one that’s quietly gaining power—and smart investors are noticing. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Steam While Others Stall Not every token launch is worth watching—but this one is. MAGACOINFINANCE has been steadily building momentum with real traction: growing wallet counts, strong retention rates, and increasing visibility in investor forums. It’s not relying on influencers or hype cycles. Instead, it’s executing with purpose—developing a community-first ecosystem that’s attracting early believers and long-term thinkers alike. There’s a seriousness to its rollout that sets it apart from the typical short-burst memecoins. More importantly, it’s doing this at a moment when the market is hungry for new momentum. With attention shifting toward early-stage entries that could define the next run, MAGACOINFINANCE is standing right in the spotlight. Other Solid Projects—But With Limited Early Entry: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin Uniswap remains a key player in the decentralized exchange space. Its model for token swaps and liquidity pools has changed how people trade—but it’s now a well-known giant, with much of its explosive upside already realized. Polkadot is doing valuable work around interoperability and multi-chain scaling. It’s vital to Web3 innovation—but as a large-cap asset, its growth arc is longer and more gradual. Bitcoin Cash continues to serve those focused on simple, peer-to-peer digital payments. It has strong utility and global adoption—but few would describe it as an “undiscovered” asset. Litecoin is one of the oldest altcoins still standing. It remains relevant, especially for fast, low-cost transactions—but it’s also fully matured in its current form. These projects are dependable—but they’re no longer in their early days. MAGACOINFINANCE , on the other hand, is just beginning its ascent. Final Thought Can $750 really become $1.2 million? It depends on the project. It depends on timing. And it depends on execution. Right now, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is hitting all three. The structure is there. The interest is growing. And the window is still wide open—for now. If history has taught us anything, it’s that those who move early often move the farthest.

Meme coins require minimal capital investment to build a sizable positions, yet promise explosive initial gains, which continue to attract millions of buyers from all over the world into meme assets to date. One of the up-and-coming contenders within the meme coins market this year is CartelFi . But does this newcomer have what it takes to uncrown some of the more established names within this space like Shiba Inu? Let’s explore. CartelFi vs Shiba Inu: which one offers better utility? Shiba Inu has long been touted as the “Dogecoin killer”. It gained famed as a community-driven meme coin upon launch in 2020. Over the years, it has grown its ecosystem to include ShibaSwap, a decentralised exchange, and other tokens as well like LEASH and BONE. Shiba Inu continues to thrive on a vibrant community and speculative trading, but its utility remains rather limited. CartelFi, on the other hand, is more innovative. It’s fully committed to becoming more than just a meme coin. CartelFi is marketing itself as a platform with a mission. It wants to help the community transform its idle meme coins into yield-generating assets, branding itself as “the ultimate staking cartel.” This means that instead of letting meme coins idle in wallets, they get to put them to work and set up a new source of passive income with CartelFi. It’s a unique approach that bridges the gap between meme culture and decentralised finance (DeFi), offering real utility and value to users. Click here if you’d like to learn more about CartelFi and its native meme coin. CartelFi vs Shiba Inu: which one has better growth potential? CartelFi may be a better pick than Shiba Inu in 2025 also because it’s currently in its early stages only, which makes it a prime opportunity for investors looking to get in on the ground floor. CartelFi presale has attracted massive interest, raising more than $1 million in within a matter of weeks. This momentum indicates strong investor confidence and potential a bright future ahead. Note that meme coins are broadly known to offer explosive initial gains. This narrative makes CartelFi all the more exciting to own than Shiba Inu as the latter has been around for years. So, it’s reasonable to believe that it has already had its moment in the sun. However, CartelFi is yet to realise that explosive growth, indicating building an early position in it today could prove rather lucrative for investors as we proceed through the remainder of 2025. All in all, CartelFi’s innovative approach, strong growth potential, and focus on utility make it a standout in the crowded world of meme coins. For investors looking to merge the fun of meme coins with an added benefit of yield generation, CartelFi is the clear winner.

Amid wild market movements for TRUMP, a Georgia senator has labeled the invitation an impeachable offense. Meanwhile, a shift in sentiment sees investors turn to PepeX , a project looking to revolutionize the memecoin space. Georgia senator slams Trump’s memecoin dinner It’s an impeachable offense, US Senator Jon Ossoff from Georgia said. Ossoff said this as he publicly criticized President Donald Trump’s reported gala dinner for top 220 investors of his $TRUMP memecoin. The lawmaker criticized the move as “selling access,” noting that the event set for May 22 could be grounds for impeachment proceedings against the president. This is the latest controversy around the TRUMP token, which launched in January 2025 amid market euphoria on Trump’s election win and inauguration. Critics point to TRUMP soaring amid the dinner news as a scenario that will only enrich these few whales and insiders. The criticism, which has come from other congressional lawmakers and the crypto circle as well, see the president’s involvement as a conflict of interest and a dangerous precedent. Notably, the token’s creators hold 80% of supply. Memecoin investors buy PepeX While analysts suggest TRUMP memecoin could be worth watching, investors keen on other opportunities are flocking to PepeX. The AI-powered memecoin launchpad, which seeks to challenge Pump.fun and others in the market, has raised over $1.6 million in its presale. PepeX, targeted for multi chain use, eyes a user-friendly platform for memecoins creation. Its main selling point is it’s focus on community rather than token creators and a few top whales. The platform’s AI-powered technology provides a fair token distribution. It caps creators at 5% of supply while allocating 95% to the public. PepeX also includes anti-sniping tech and real-time transparency tools like bubble maps. This means the platform removes the potential for manipulation and rugs, which have dominated Pump.fun launches. Moreover, only 0.04% of Pump.fun participants profitable.

PepeX is here to let YOU tokenize your way through the chaos. 🚀Forget tech stocks, PepeX is where AI-powered tokens and degen plays meet.

According to the PepeX whitepaper , the planned public launch is in Q3 2025. The roadmap includes key milestones such as decentralized AI launchpad, DEX partnerships and staking. Its presale, with tokens priced at $0.0243, offered early birds up to 332% in presale returns. This has many looking to buy early before the 90-day ICO ends. Overall crypto-friendly environment under President Donald Trump Despite the controversy around TRUMP, the broader crypto landscape is experiencing a notable shift under President Trump’s administration. Since his campaign for election in 2024, Trump has increasingly taken a pro-crypto stance. The industry supported him and other leaders amid the push for clarity in the regulation of digital assets, with the signing executive orders to promote cryptocurrencies among key developments in 2025. On April 25, 2025, new SEC chair Paul Atkins said the agency was ready to work with Trump’s administration and Congress to support efforts for regulatory clarity.

The bank’s indirect Bitcoin exposure via stocks reached $356 million, raising sell pressure risk amid a global trade war and recession concerns. Abu Dhabi’s $437 million spot Bitcoin ETF stake shows sovereign wealth funds see Bitcoin as a hedge. Norges Bank, Norway’s $1.7 trillion sovereign wealth fund, reported a $40 billion loss in the first quarter of 2025, with most of the decline caused by a drop in the value of US-listed technology companies. Norges Bank also indirectly owned 3,821 BTC through its stock market investments by the end of 2024, presenting a potential sell pressure risk to Bitcoin, especially when considering the socio-political uncertainty and the risk of an economic recession caused by the global trade war. In such times, could Norges Bank increase its investments in Bitcoin-related companies or even buy spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a way to hedge risk? For now, it seems unlikely that Norway’s investment fund would consider buying a Bitcoin ETF, especially since the fund does not hold any gold. Besides stocks and bonds, Norges Bank invests in real estate, including retail, industrial, renewable energy, and logistics properties worldwide. Norway sold all of the central bank’s gold by early 2004, when gold was trading below $400. Since then, gold has outperformed the S&P 500 by 280%. Equities now make up 71.4% of the fund’s total investments, so if the global trade war continues, significant losses could occur. Gold/USD (orange) vs. S&P 500. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Norges Bank investments generated $222 billion in profits in 2024, and its stock market portfolio dropped by only 1.6% in the first quarter of 2025. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund is “mainly index-driven,” according to CEO Nicolai Tangen, specifically following the FTSE Global All Cap Index. Although this index includes over 7,100 stocks from both developed and emerging markets, it is based on market capitalization, which means 65% of the exposure is to North American companies. But, according to Norges Bank Deputy CEO Trond Grande, there is some flexibility for active investment, and their exposure to US-listed tech stocks has been below the benchmark for the past 18 months. Some of these holdings, such as Strategy, Mara Holdings, Coinbase, and Riot Platforms, hold large amounts of Bitcoin ( BTC ) on their balance sheets. As a result, even if not intentional, the sovereign wealth fund had a $356 million indirect exposure to Bitcoin at the end of 2024. FTSE Global All Cap (purple) vs. FTSE + 10% Bitcoin (green). Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Data shows a 5% hypothetical allocation in Bitcoin back in 2018 would have boosted the fund’s equities benchmark performance by 56%. Buying Bitcoin ETFs seems unlikely, but indirect exposure remains possible Technically, it seems unlikely that Norges Bank could buy into the spot Bitcoin ETF without changing the fund’s mandate. However, increasing exposure to companies with significant Bitcoin holdings appears possible. Still, there is no sign of such a move, although Nicolai Tangen stated on April 24 that the fund will increase investments in US stocks.

Similarly, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board held $321 million in spot Bitcoin ETFs, showing the growing use of cryptocurrency as a hedge.

Cardano just rolled out a governance framework update that aims to sharpen its community-led innovation. Meanwhile, Litecoin celebrated its latest halving with a modest uptick in hash rate and community engagement, reminding everyone it’s still swinging in the heavyweight division of payments-focused coins. But amidst the buzz, a new heavyweight contender is emerging: Qubetic s. It isn’t just another blockchain play. With over $16.4 million raised and more than 509 million $TICS tokens sold to over 25,200 holders, this one’s building tools real folks and businesses need—starting with a decentralized VPN. At $0.1902 per token in its 31st presale stage, Qubetics is not just solving blockchain’s old headaches; it’s crafting new paths for the future of digital finance. Let’s dive into what makes Qubetics, Cardano, and Litecoin each worth watching and how one of them could end up being your ticket to the best crypto to get rich. Qubetics ($TICS): A Real-World Blockchain With Utility that Hits Home Here’s the deal. Crypto ain’t just about charts and candle patterns anymore. It’s about solving problems—real ones. And Qubetics is out here treating blockchain like a Swiss Army knife. Whether you’re a professional handling sensitive data or a small business owner dealing with sketchy internet providers, this one hits different. The standout? Its built-in decentralized VPN. Imagine ditching shady VPN services and replacing them with one that’s on-chain, secure, and anonymous by design. It’s not just smart—it’s what the ecosystem’s been crying out for. And it doesn’t stop there. What’s Popping Right Now? Qubetics is in Stage 31 of its crypto presale . $0.1902 per $TICS token. Over 509 million tokens sold. More than 25,200 holders. Over $16.4 million raised. With tech that simplifies cross-border payments, creates secure file transfers, and decentralizes cloud services, Qubetics isn’t following trends. It’s setting them. The QubeQode IDE & Business Simplicity This isn’t just a playground for coders. Qubetics’ QubeQode IDE is designed for devs, professionals, and even non-tech folks who want in on blockchain without wrestling code like a python in the jungle. Add in lower transaction fees and scalable infrastructure, and you’ve got something built for the long haul. The Buzz from Analysts Look, folks in the know are calling out numbers like $1, $5, even $15 post-mainnet. That’s up to a 7783% return. Of course, this ain’t financial advice—it’s simply what’s out there in credible circles. Why It Could Be the Best Crypto to Get Rich When you’re looking for the best crypto to get rich, utility and early entry matter. Qubetics isn’t just a whitepaper dream. It’s a functional, scalable project that’s making tech smoother and privacy tighter. Cardano (ADA): Smart Contracts Meet Real-World Governance Cardano’s been around the block—literally. It was one of the earliest Proof-of-Stake champions and has long pitched itself as an academically serious blockchain. In 2025, Cardano isn’t chasing hype. It’s refining the fundamentals. Cardano just activated an upgrade to its Voltaire governance model, putting more power directly in the hands of ADA holders. Community voting, treasury allocation, and even on-chain proposals are seeing streamlined improvements. That’s real decentralization, not just lip service. With over 1,200 dApps currently built on Cardano and a dev community that’s growing like it’s on Miracle-Gro, ADA keeps climbing the ranks. Its low transaction fees, energy efficiency, and secure Haskell-based coding environment keep it appealing. Education systems, agricultural supply chains, and even digital ID solutions in emerging markets are actively integrating with Cardano tech. This isn’t fantasy—it’s happening. It’s not the fastest mover, but it’s steady and consistent. For those scoping out the best crypto to get rich with a balance of safety and innovation, ADA earns its seat at the table. Litecoin (LTC): The OG Payments Coin Still Holding It Down Don’t let the quiet demeanor fool you—Litecoin’s a beast that’s aged like fine whiskey. It’s got roots going back to 2011, and while many have come and gone, LTC is still here, doing its thing. Litecoin’s August 2024 halving event is already showing its ripple effects. The hash rate is up, miner activity is steady, and LTC has crept back into payment gateway headlines. With transaction speed sitting at around 2.5 minutes per block, it still lives up to its “silver to Bitcoin’s gold” nickname. While newer blockchains chase the shiny DeFi narrative, Litecoin keeps it simple: be fast, cheap, and reliable. Whether it’s cross-border remittance, ecommerce checkout, or ATM withdrawals, LTC is quietly powering real transactions every day. It’s accepted at thousands of merchants globally, from retail stores to online platforms. Payment processors keep integrating it. Litecoin is that old-school friend who never asks for the spotlight but always shows up. If you’re betting on dependability and wide acceptance, Litecoin’s got the goods. It’s not flashy, but it works—and sometimes, that’s exactly what pays off. What’s a Decentralized VPN and Why Should Anyone Care? A decentralized VPN flips the script on traditional ones. No central authority. No single point of failure. Just pure peer-to-peer privacy. Here’s why this matters: Traditional VPNs can be hacked or surveilled. Centralized systems log your data—even if they swear they don’t. Governments can block access or demand logs. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN changes the game: User data isn’t stored—ever. Connections route anonymously through a mesh network. It’s blockchain-backed, meaning secure and transparent without compromising privacy. Great for business use, remote work, or just surfing without big brother peeking in. This isn’t some side project—it’s a core piece of Qubetics’ infrastructure. And that’s what makes it a serious contender when folks talk about the best crypto to get rich. Conclusion: Who’s the Best Bet? Cardano’s playing the long game with governance and academic rigor. Litecoin’s old-school but steady, with widespread real-world usage. But Qubetics? That one’s rewriting the rules—solving the problems that’ve tripped up other chains and doing it with tools people can actually use. The best crypto to get rich in 2025 might not be the loudest one. It’s the one laying down real-world foundations—one decentralized VPN, secure payment system, and developer IDE at a time. Want in before the crowd catches on? This might be your shot.

Earlier this month, the BTC mining hotspot of Irkutsk unveiled the nation’s first-ever year-round ban on crypto mining in the southern part of the oblast. This move came just months after Moscow imposed a wintertime ban on crypto mining in 10 Russian and Russian-controlled regions until 2031. Russian Gas Alternative for Irkutsk Bitcoin Miners? Per the Russian news agency Interfax , the Irkutsk Governor Igor Kobzev has urged major players in the mining market to join forces with oil and gas companies. A Gazprom Neft oil refinery. (Source: Neftehim [CC BY-SA 3.0]) He said that the parties should unite to build data centers that use “alternative fuel sources.” Kobzev made the comments during an April 25 address on the state of affairs in the region. He claimed that the Irkutsk government was “not against mining as a phenomenon.” However, he reasserted claims that miners need to overcome electricity shortages. And he said his government had a duty to ensure residents and enterprises in the region enjoyed uninterrupted electricity supplies. Kobzev said: “The regional government is ready to act as a platform to coordinate interaction between mining operators and enterprises working in the oil and gas production sector. There are already successful cases of firms building data centers powered by autonomous generation. These firms use associated gas.” Iran, Russia agree on 55 bcm of gas supplies, nuclear plant funding https://t.co/cP4vZjiySE https://t.co/cP4vZjiySE — Reuters (@Reuters) April 25, 2025 Russian oil firms have been working with crypto miners on associated gas-related pilots since the start of the current decade. Some of the nation’s biggest BTC miners and oil firms, including BitRiver and Gazprom Neft, started working together in 2022. Irkutsk’s Governor Igor Kobzev meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2019, in a photograph released by the Kremlin’s press service. Russia Starting to Feel Crypto Mining Boom Downside? Russia has seen one of the world’s biggest booms in Bitcoin and altcoin mining in recent years. With many miners forced out of China, Russian miners have claimed that taxing their industry could bring Moscow hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of revenue. But this growth has taken a toll on many areas’ energy grids. The Ministry of Energy is reportedly mulling issuing three more regional mining bans as networks in some areas begin to suffer. Other parts of the country claim they have surplus power that they can use to power miners’ rigs. But Kobzev appears keen to keep miners in southern Irkutsk away from public grids at all costs. He pledged to support associated gas-powered crypto mining initiatives “in every possible way.” He also said that such a partnership could help improve the Irkutsk environment by reducing flaring. Could BTC Miners Switch to Russian Gas Power? When drilling for crude oil, producers often release pockets of natural (associated) gas. If drillers do not have any infrastructure that lets them capture this gas, they must instead burn it using flare stacks. Many industries are hesitant about using associated gas, as it tends to produce intense but irregular bursts of energy, rather than uninterrupted flows. Russia said it arrested a man suspected in the murder of a senior military official near Moscow and claimed that a car bomb had been activated remotely from Ukraine. https://t.co/Gut35SJH0z — Bloomberg (@business) April 26, 2025 Some Russian miners, however, say that they are happy to use this model of energy flow, provided they can pay discounted rates. Kobzev was optimistic about the said that a failure to stamp out crypto mining-related energy problems could see the capacity deficit in southeastern Siberia hit just shy of 3GW by 2030. But critics say that efforts to ban crypto mining in southern Irkutsk have instead resulted in a rise in illegal and quasi-legal operations. Some claim that rising Bitcoin prices have also played a role, with miners now increasingly reluctant to turn off their rigs.

RIPPLE’S MONICA LONG JUST LIT UP CNBC WITH MASSIVE UPDATES. We have extracted every key quote you need to see from her interview — broken down for you: On XRP: “XRP serves a couple different roles… within the blockchain, the XRP Ledger, it’s the native asset, so you… pic.twitter.com/QGkcPHM6fB — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) April 25, 2025 XRP: A Critical Component of Ripple’s Strategy Monica Long emphasized XRP’s essential role within the XRP Ledger, explaining that it is required for transaction fees and account reserves. She stated, “XRP serves a couple different roles… within the blockchain, the XRP Ledger, it’s the native asset, so you need it for gas fees, you need it for the reserve account minimum, and so as there’s more users and more use cases built on XRP Ledger, that asset will always be needed.” She also discussed XRP’s function in liquidity provisioning on XRPL. “Within that exchange… if a trading pair doesn’t have liquidity between it, it auto-bridges, goes between XRP for efficiency, speed, and cost… so that will be an increasingly important use case as more activity comes to the blockchain.” Long confirmed that Ripple continues to use XRP as part of its payments offering depending on customer needs, adding, “It’s kind of dependent on customer use case.” XRPL: Designed for Functionality and Innovation Long described the XRP Ledger as an early attempt to improve Bitcoin’s limitations. “The original XRP Ledger launched as… Bitcoin 2.0… in their brains, they were thinking of Bitcoin as this ingenious invention, how can we improve upon scalability and tinker with the consensus model so that you could enable things like an exchange within the blockchain itself.” She reinforced the company’s long-term alignment with XRPL development, noting, “The whole company started because three developers created the XRP Ledger… and so we’ve always had a belief in building use cases that would make use of the efficiency within XRP Ledger.” Ripple continues to enhance the ledger, including adding lending protocols and a multi-purpose token amendment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple USD (RLUSD) and Institutional Stablecoin Demand On the subject of stablecoins, Long explained the rationale behind Ripple’s decision to launch RLUSD, citing its relevance to Ripple’s cross-border payments business. She highlighted RLUSD’s utility and availability. “It’s quick, right, you can get effectively the equivalent of a dollar in digital version… and then 24 by 7 availability… as opposed to using this kind of real-time rail for stablecoins.” Long said the stablecoin market is projected to exceed $3 trillion , adding that Ripple focuses on institutional usage. One area gaining momentum is using stablecoins as collateral: “One that I think is getting more and more attention is using [stablecoins] as an asset for collateral for trading in the more traditional institutional world… this is one that’s definitely spiking for us.” Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Long also addressed Ripple’s relationship with the banking sector. Recalling the early years, she said, “In 2014… we knocked on the doors of banks and we explained… you could do cross-border payments on a blockchain and it would be near instant, almost free… they were like, slam the door in our face.” But today, she said, banks are far more receptive. “They have embraced it a lot more.” She clarified that Ripple’s role is to serve as an intermediary, and acknowledged how regulatory shifts make banks more willing to engage with blockchain services. Long concluded with a critique of legacy financial systems. “When you talk to the banks, the effort to run those products, it’s kind of shocking, a lot of the backend process is still manual or it’s paperwork, it’s just all this stuff that could be automated and just made more efficient with technology.” As All Things XRP noted in his coverage of the interview, Ripple is no longer operating in a limited capacity. Under Long’s leadership, it is positioning itself to help build the infrastructure underpinning the next phase of institutional finance.

Back argued that investment firms allocating their treasuries to BTC are leading the charge in global adoption, a trend he believes could drive the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization to $200 trillion within the next decade. Back contends that companies are using Bitcoin treasury strategies as a rational and long-term arbitrage Adam Back, also the creator of Hashcash, claimed that organizations and governments worldwide were beginning to acknowledge the special monetary qualities of BTC. Back further shared an X post to illustrate this on April 26, stating that treasury firms like Strategy were taking advantage of the gap between the current fiat world and the future of BTC. He continued after this, elaborating that a scalable and sustainable front-running hyperbitcoinization with a $100–200 trillion trade value had enough scalability for most large listed companies to switch to BTC Treasury. Hyperbitcoinization is the term used to describe the hypothetical scenario in which BTC surpasses fiat money as the most widely used currency in the world due to its inflationary economics and the growing mistrust of the established financial system. According to Back, the primary cause of global hyperbitcoinization was still the price of BTC exceeding the inflation of fiat money. Following this, he claimed that some believed that treasury strategy was a passing trend. In response, he argued that it was a sustainable and rational arbitrage. Additionally, based on his argument, BTC prices have increased over the past four years more quickly than interest and inflation, but this trend is temporary. Interestingly, Back made these remarks almost two months after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order creating a national Bitcoin reserve using BTC that was forfeited in criminal cases involving the government. More international companies may decide to adopt BTC following the current appealing conditions Reports suggest that firms like Strategy — the largest corporate holder of BTC — could inspire others to follow suit if they continue expanding their Bitcoin treasuries. According to Michael Saylor , Strategy’s co-founder, the company’s Bitcoin treasury has made over $5.1 billion in profit since the start of 2025, demonstrating the strategy’s profitability. Likewise, Japanese investment giant Metaplanet — aka “Asia’s MicroStrategy” — has adopted the same strategy after April 24, when it surpassed more than 5,000 BTC in its reserves. Furthermore, according to Metaplanet, this was not the end; by 2026, it plans to acquire 21,000 BTC, making it the largest corporate Bitcoin owner in Asia. Furthermore, another thing that would have made it easier for international companies like Strategy to follow suit was the US Federal Reserve’s decision to remove its 2022 guidance that banks shouldn’t deal with cryptos. With this reversal, U.S. financial institutions might feel more comfortable embracing Bitcoin. In reaction to the withdrawal of the guidance, Saylor stated that banks were now free to start supporting BTC. Moreover, Iliya Kalchev, a Nexo dispatch analyst, revealed that banks would now be subjected to regular supervision, indicating a more liberal regulatory framework for integrating digital assets.

While giants like XRP and Bitcoin continue to dominate the headlines, early traders are shifting their focus toward a fresh lineup of altcoins with far greater upside potential heading into 2025. Many long-term XRP holders who saw early success are now reallocating part of their portfolios into smaller, high-traction tokens that could multiply faster in the next cycle. It’s not a rejection of the big caps—it’s a rotation into opportunities that haven’t fully played out yet. New Altcoins Are Catching Smart Money Attention While Bitcoin and XRP continue to offer stability and scale, they’re no longer the undiscovered gems they once were. That role is now being filled by emerging players that combine strong narratives, lean supply models, and rapid community growth. Among the most mentioned right now is MAGACOIN FINANCE —a politically themed altcoin that’s carving out space with bold branding and strategic market entry. With consistent early-stage demand and growing visibility on trackers and social platforms, it’s being discussed as one of the few tokens that hasn’t yet priced in future interest. Investors aren’t just looking at charts—they’re watching wallet activity, search volume, and rotating capital flows. What they’re seeing is that the real action is happening before listings ever begin. Why Traders Are Reallocating Altcoins are inherently higher risk, but that’s exactly what makes them attractive to seasoned traders who’ve already done well with XRP or Bitcoin. They’re not betting on speculation—they’re positioning for volatility they can control. The altcoins getting the most traction right now often check a few critical boxes: a memorable name, early-stage scarcity, increasing coverage from crypto media. Those who once turned $1K into six figures with XRP are now scanning for projects with similar setups—structured entries, social-driven exposure, and room to run. Final Thoughts The $1K-to-$1M tagline may sound ambitious, but in crypto, narratives move markets—and right now, the narrative is shifting. While Bitcoin and XRP maintain their legacy status, many traders are betting big on smaller tokens with disruptive potential. Whether it’s a cultural movement like MAGACOIN FINANCE or another sleeper pick waiting for its moment, the real returns often come from acting before the hype—not after. As always, timing matters. For those with eyes on what’s next, this altcoin wave might be the most exciting play of the year.

In fact, the smartest crypto plays usually begin in silence. Today, while Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) continue to gain strength, a growing number of seasoned investors are locking into MAGACOINFINANCE —a project showing all the right early-stage signs. It’s already surging—and it hasn’t even hit the exchanges yet. What’s fueling MAGACOINFINANCE’s rapid rise Bonus access is still active: Strategic buyers are locking in during the final moments of private entry. Listings are approaching fast: Once live on exchanges, the opportunity for first-mover advantage disappears. Visibility is surging: The token is now on radar inside altcoin analyst circles and private investor communities. Access is still limited: This isn’t mass-market yet. That’s why early positioning matters. MAGACOINFINANCE is earning bold projections MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just climbing—it’s accelerating. With a capped supply and rapidly rising interest, market analysts now place it in the best crypto potential for Q2—supported by its clean structure, momentum, and strategic launch timing. Why SOL, XRP, KAS, and OP won’t offer this entry again Solana (SOL) , XRP , Kaspa (KAS) , and Optimism (OP) are well-established. Their early discovery moments are long past. MAGACOINFINANCE is now trending as a contender among top early-stage altcoins. Final thoughts on MAGACOINFINANCE Every major coin had its quiet beginning— Bitcoin , XRP , and Solana were once ignored. Today, MAGACOINFINANCE is in that same position: building fast, rising confidently, and offering timing that rarely lasts. This is the phase where smart money moves.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 245,000 followers on the social media platform X that he’s bullish on Bonk ( BONK ) following the altcoin’s breakout of an accumulation zone on the three-day chart. The trader shares a chart suggesting that BONK can rally to as high as $0.0000262 after taking out its resistance at $0.0000142. “BONK is going much higher (I have a bag). Looks good on the charts as well. Think I’m going to add to my position if I get a small dip.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, BONK is trading for $0.0000182. Turning to the native asset of the non-fungible token (NFT) project Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ), the trader says the altcoin needs to print a bullish higher low setup at around $0.0065 to start reversing its multi-month downtrend. Otherwise, Altcoin Sherpa warns that PENGU may drop to as low as $0.004. “Coins like PENGU got rekt the last several months but are showing some signs of life. The true test is going to be where the next low is and how the reaction is. The trend is still bearish, so don’t be so quick to catch knives. That said, we could see some reversal if the environment continues to ease up.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on the trader’s chart, he appears to suggest that PENGU may soar to as high as $0.014 if the altcoin manages to establish a higher low. At time of writing, PENGU is worth $0.00985. As for the broader altcoin market, the analyst warns that most coins are still in a high-time-frame downtrend and that the gains witnessed this month could be erased. However, Altcoin Sherpa notes that it is now within the realm of possibility for altcoins to start carving a major cycle bottom en route to a bullish reversal. “To be clear, I’m pretty bullish overall and think that we’re going higher and the next major dip is a BUY THE DIP situation. HOWEVER, most alts still are in bearish market structures (see TAO) and continuation of that trend is down. I think we go higher for everything, but just a careful reminder that these sh*tcoins are still in bearish trends and have made lower highs, lower lows. I do think that we’re doing better, though.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Bitcoin’s weakening correlation with stocks highlights its growing independence as an asset. Bullish institutional investor positioning contrasts with retail traders’ caution, supporting a rally above $100,000. Bitcoin ( BTC ) gained 11% between April 20 and April 26, demonstrating resilience by holding near its two-month high around $94,000. This relief rally followed signals from the Trump administration about easing import tariffs, as well as strong corporate earnings reports. Investor confidence in Bitcoin was further boosted by a record $3.1 billion in net inflows to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over five days. However, a key BTC derivatives indicator showed signs of bearish momentum, raising questions about whether the $100,000 target is still realistic. Perpetual Bitcoin futures contracts are favored by retail traders because their prices closely track the spot market. A positive funding rate means that buyers pay to maintain their positions, so a reversal in this rate is typically linked to bearish trends. Bitcoin perpetual futures annualized funding rate. Source: Laevitas.ch The sharp negative funding rates recorded on April 26 are highly unusual during bull markets, as they indicate stronger demand from sellers. This metric has been volatile since April 14, but sellers were caught off guard as Bitcoin’s price climbed above $94,000. Since April 21, over $450 million in BTC short positions have been liquidated . Some of the renewed confidence and Bitcoin’s price strength can be attributed to the S&P 500’s 7.1% weekly gain. However, despite this optimism, US President Donald Trump reportedly said on April 25 that negotiations would depend on China making concessions, causing traders to question the sustainability of recent gains. Companies are now reporting first-quarter earnings from before the escalation of the trade war, so the factors driving the stock market and Bitcoin are different. In fact, Bitcoin’s price is no longer closely correlated with the S&P 500. 30-day correlation: S&P 500 vs Bitcoin/USD. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Currently, the 30-day correlation between the S&P 500 and Bitcoin stands at 29%, well below the 60% level seen from March to mid-April. While this lower correlation does not mean a complete decoupling, since investor sentiment is still influenced by macroeconomic factors, it does show that Bitcoin is not simply a proxy for technology stocks. Bitcoin’s status as an independent asset has strengthened Gold’s inability to maintain its bullish momentum after reaching an all-time high of $3,500 on April 22 was also seen as significant for Bitcoin’s status as an independent asset class. Some traders had questioned the “digital gold” narrative, but the longer BTC remains above $90,000, the more confidence investors may have, potentially paving the way for further gains. The increased demand for bearish leverage in perpetual BTC futures does not align with the sentiment of professional traders. Monthly Bitcoin futures contracts avoid fluctuating funding rates, so traders know their leverage costs in advance. Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.ch On April 26, the two-month Bitcoin futures premium (basis rate) rose to its highest level in seven weeks, indicating greater interest in bullish positions. At 6.5%, this metric remains within the neutral 5% to 10% range, but is moving away from bearish territory. The disconnect between leverage demand in perpetual futures and monthly BTC contracts is not unusual. Even if retail traders remain cautious, substantial accumulation by institutions could be enough to push Bitcoin’s price above $100,000 in the near future.

A move past this point could push the Ethereum price toward $1,720 or even $1,800. However, if it fails to break through, the Ethereum price might fall back to $1,550. The Ethereum price is currently trading above the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average, which is a positive sign. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is also above 50, suggesting bullish momentum. But if the Ethereum price drops below $1,605, it could test lower support levels. Overall, the Ethereum price is at a critical point, and traders are closely monitoring these key levels. Chainlink Technical Analysis Shows Mixed Market Signals Chainlink is currently holding above $12.50, a key support level. If it breaks past $14.58, analysts suggest it could climb to $26. This potential rise is closely tied to Bitcoin's price movements. Currently, 53% of LINK holders are at a loss, which may influence market sentiment. Technical indicators like MACD and Bull Bear Power show early signs of a possible upward trend. However, a drop below $12.50 could lead to further declines. Chainlink technical analysis indicates that maintaining support above $13.20 is crucial for a bullish outlook. Market sentiment remains mixed, with many holders near their break-even points. Overall, Chainlink technical analysis suggests cautious optimism, but key resistance levels must be overcome. Continued monitoring of Chainlink technical analysis will be essential for anticipating future price movements.

For those tired of switching between tools and still missing the mark, Web3 ai combines everything into one AI-backed dashboard. From basic trades to advanced strategies, this system makes smarter trading easier and more accessible for everyone in the market. Smart Crypto Picks for 2025 Web3 ai is shaping up to be more than just another AI-powered platform—it’s offering practical tools that matter. Features like real-time signals, portfolio rebalancing, and advanced risk models it deliver what traders need. That’s why many are already calling it the best crypto for 2025. While Ethereum price remains above $1,600 with a bullish RSI, and Chainlink technical analysis holds firm above $12.50, both coins still depend on key resistance levels. For those looking beyond price charts, this platform sets a clear example of what smart trading can look like.

43882814,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/pi-network-and-avalanche-are-growing-cold-wallets-privacy-presale-could-50x-in-2025,1745800166,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/43882814.jpeg,Pi Network and Avalanche Are Growing; Cold Wallet’s Privacy Presale Could 50x In 2025,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/pi-network-and-avalanche-are-growing-cold-wallets-privacy-presale-could-50x-in-2025,"Crypto investors chasing the next breakout are watching Pi Coin and Avalanche closely. Pi jumped 35% after a Chainlink integration, fueling speculation it could hit $3. The move suggests stronger utility and could pave the way for listings on top-tier exchanges. Meanwhile, AVAX is approaching a crucial resistance near $21, with analysts calling for a bullish reversal if volume supports a clean breakout. But while both are driven by momentum and speculation, Cold Wallet is offering something far more rare: a real solution to a growing problem. It is the only Web3 wallet that collects zero data: no IP logs, no analytics, no behavioral tracking. And it is now in Batch 1 of its presale at just $0.007. With a projected launch price near $0.35171, early buyers are looking at a potential 4,900% ROI. In a market that thrives on visibility, Cold Wallet is the one product built to keep you truly invisible, and that is starting to matter more than ever. Pi Coin Surges 35% After Chainlink Deal, Could $3 Be Next? Pi Coin jumped 35% this week after announcing a key integration with Chainlink, pushing its price to around $0.74. The collaboration allows Pi to access real-time data through Chainlink’s oracle system, which helps decentralized applications use accurate price feeds. Analysts believe this could support Pi’s adoption and may lead to listings on larger exchanges such as Binance. Market reaction was immediate. Pi rose from $0.63 to $0.78 in just hours after the update, before stabilizing slightly lower. The surge comes despite a broader monthly decline of over 40%, showing renewed investor interest in the project. Some forecasts now suggest Pi could climb to $3 in the short term, with more ambitious targets placed even higher. The project’s growing ecosystem and strong user base add to that momentum. For traders eyeing emerging altcoins with real use cases and expanding integrations, Pi’s recent moves may signal a return to the spotlight. AVAX Nears Key Resistance: Analyst Says $21 Breakout Could Trigger Full Reversal Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining attention as analyst Crypto Rand highlights a possible bullish reversal if the asset breaks above the $21 level. According to his analysis, AVAX is approaching a critical resistance zone where several technical indicators are converging. A clean move through this price point could mark the start of a broader upward trend. AVAX has faced pressure in recent weeks, but current price action is holding steady near multiple resistance levels. Crypto Rand’s outlook has caught the eye of traders looking for early signals in a still-uncertain market. If AVAX successfully clears the $21 threshold, it may attract renewed buying interest and shift market sentiment. However, the move would need to be supported by rising volume to confirm the trend reversal. AVAX’s current price structure keeps it on the radar for investors seeking assets with short-term upside potential and favorable technical setups. This Wallet Doesn’t Track You, Can’t Profile You, and Still Works Flawlessly; Cold Wallet Is What Web3 Promised Most crypto wallets claim to offer privacy, but nearly all of them collect something: your IP, your activity patterns, even the apps you connect to. Cold Wallet does none of that. It is the only Web3 wallet designed from the start to gather zero metadata. No trackers, no behavior logs, and no background surveillance. Just pure, private access to your crypto, with every layer built to protect, not observe. Cold Wallet uses zero-knowledge cryptography to make sure no one, including the wallet itself, can see your transactions, your wallet balance, or even when you log in. There is no backend logging your behavior, no analytics code quietly watching you. You stay invisible by default. Right now, Cold Wallet is in Batch 1 of its presale, priced at just $0.007. With a confirmed listing price around $0.35171, that’s an estimated 4,900% ROI if you move early. What makes Cold Wallet stand out is that it doesn’t just promise privacy, it runs on it. In a market where every app wants your data, Cold Wallet wants none of it. If you’re serious about protecting your crypto footprint, this is your moment to get in early, before everyone else realizes what real privacy in Web3 should look like. Why Cold Wallet Could Be the Smartest Long-Term Bet Pi and AVAX are gaining attention, but their stories depend on external momentum, new listings, resistance breakouts, and favorable sentiment. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, is rising for a different reason: it solves what every trader eventually realizes is a critical flaw. Today’s wallets leak data. They log behavior. They silently track everything. Cold Wallet fixes that with zero-knowledge infrastructure and a design that forgets you on purpose. It is not just for experts. It runs like an app, but protects like a vault. And right now, with a presale entry at $0.007 and a listing estimate of ~$0.35171, the opportunity is both technical and financial. That is a potential 4,900% gain on a product already built for the regulation-heavy, surveillance-heavy Web3 era that is quickly arriving. Pi might trend. AVAX might reverse. However, the Cold Wallet is where privacy becomes a performance. For investors who think long-term, this is more than an asset, and it is an edge.

Reports suggest TRUMPTAR is gearing up for listings on several major crypto exchanges. Such exposure is expected to attract millions of investors, likely driving a sharp increase in the coin’s value. Already, projections suggest a potential price surge of over 9,000% within the next few days. Currently, TRUMPTAR is only available for trading on decentralized Solana platforms such as Jup.ag and Raydium.io . Early buyers, who have access to the coin before wider exchange listings, stand to benefit the most from the anticipated price movement. The memecoin launched with an initial liquidity of over $6,000 — a notable figure compared to many new entries in the space. How to Purchase TRUMPTAR Early Investors interested in buying TRUMPTAR before its first centralized exchange (CEX) listings can do so on Raydium.io or Jup.ag . To buy, users need to connect a compatible wallet like Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom. They then swap Solana (SOL) for Trump Ends Tariffs by entering the contract address — w7h5t9MrJ77Cu2VCf2apxaMSK1KFkPf6fWNJ7uee144 — into the receiving field. For those without a compatible wallet, setting one up takes only a few minutes. Solana can be transferred from major exchanges like Coinbase or Binance to the wallet to make the purchase. If TRUMPTAR follows the trajectory of previous viral memecoins, early investors could see returns similar to those who got in early on SHIB and DOGE, potentially creating a new generation of crypto millionaires in record time. Solana Memecoin Craze Gains Momentum With larger memecoins like SHIB, DOGE, and DogWifHat (WIF) struggling to maintain momentum in recent weeks, many investors are turning their attention to emerging Solana memecoins such as TRUMPTAR. Despite having no inherent value or utility, these new tokens are attracting speculative investors hoping to capitalize on rapid price growth. The excitement around TRUMPTAR highlights the ongoing appetite for high-risk, high-reward opportunities in the crypto market. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It’s Still $0.025,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-undervalued-crypto-to-buy-now-with-real-world-use-and-2500-roi-potential-its-still-0-025/,"In a sea of overpriced tokens and short-lived trends, spotting an undervalued cryptocurrency that actually delivers something useful is a rare advantage. Most investors tend to chase what’s already pumped, but some are now turning their attention to projects that are still early, still building, and still offering massive upside. One name keeps coming up in those conversations: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Still priced at just $0.025, MUTM is gaining momentum as a real-world decentralized finance (DeFi) solution—not another meme coin or hype-based token. With analysts pointing to a potential 2,500% return in the coming year, long-term crypto investors are locking in early positions before the price climbs in upcoming presale phases. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is built around a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that enables users to lend and borrow digital assets directly, without the need for third-party involvement. Users can lend assets to earn passive yield or borrow against their crypto without selling—providing access to capital while keeping long-term exposure. The platform uses secure, transparent smart contracts to manage the entire process. Unlike many projects that try to imitate popular platforms, Mutuum built its own system from the ground up. The platform features a revenue-driven approach, allocating a portion of its earnings to purchase MUTM tokens directly from the open market. These tokens are then shared with users who hold mtTokens, which represent their deposit positions. This model supports long-term engagement by channeling platform activity into meaningful value redistribution. By directing protocol-generated revenue toward token repurchases and user rewards, Mutuum creates a system where active participants benefit directly from ecosystem growth—an approach that has drawn attention from more experienced investors. One feature setting Mutuum apart is the development of its own overcollateralized stablecoin. Minted through excess collateral locked in the system, this stablecoin offers a way to unlock liquidity without abandoning long-term holdings. It will play a major role in Mutuum’s borrowing system, adding another layer of utility to the ecosystem. Yield generation is also straightforward. When users deposit assets into the protocol, they receive mtTokens, which continuously accumulate interest based on platform activity. These tokens are flexible—users can hold them, redeem them, or use them in other decentralized finance applications. That means real passive income potential, not just speculation. MUTM has a total supply of 4 billion tokens, and the ongoing presale has already seen 420 million tokens sold and over $7 million raised. With nearly 9,000 holders already participating, demand is climbing as the price prepares to rise to $0.03 in the next phase. There are 11 phases total, each offering a higher price point than the last. This creates a natural pressure to get in early. Once the token goes live and major exchange listings kick in, exposure will likely grow exponentially. Combined with the buy-and-redistribute model, this setup is already driving strong FOMO from those watching the presale closely. Let’s run the numbers on what this could look like in practice. An investment of $1,800 at the current price of $0.025 would secure 72,000 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $0.65, that same position would grow to $46,800. And when MUTM climbs closer to the $1 mark over time, you’re looking at a portfolio worth $72,000—all from getting in early, before the broader market catches on. MUTM checks all the right boxes: utility, transparent tokenomics, community traction, and room to grow. It isn’t relying on hype or influencer tweets. Instead, it’s building tools that actually matter in decentralized finance. This isn’t about catching a short-term pump. It’s about identifying a project early—before exchange listings, before media buzz, and before the crowd catches on. With solid fundamentals and a realistic path to real-world use, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may just be the best cryptocurrency to invest in now for those chasing long-term growth and real yield. And at $0.025, it’s still early enough to make every dollar count.

43885138,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=716772,1745805019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43885138.jpeg,Term Finance recovers $1M after oracle bug triggers $1.6M liquidation loss,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/term-finance-recovers-1m-after-loss/,"The Ethereum-based lending platform Term Finance said it had recovered nearly one million dollars after a misconfigured price oracle caused erroneous liquidations in its Treehouse (tETH) market. The issue began when a new ETH oracle provided incorrect price data to the system. This caused automatic liquidations, approximately $1.6 million worth of positions. Term Finance clarified in a post on X that the incident was not a hack, no smart contracts were involved, and no users were attacked, explaining that a technical bug in the configuration of the new oracle caused the issue. The episode again shows how vital oracle feeds are to the DeFi ecosystem. Even tiny things can be catastrophic when it comes to smart contracts. Term finance recovers half of lost funds Term Finance immediately pressed to recover the missing assets. Of the 918 ETH lost in total, they recovered 556 ETH. In particular, 223.197 ETH, valued at around $400,000, was seized by the platform internally. Another 333 ETH, worth roughly $600,000, was returned after what Term called “negotiations.” It also remains unknown who was included in the negotiation or on what terms the pact was made. The company has not yet disclosed additional information regarding the method. With the recovery attempts, the remaining loss is now 362.03 ETH — approximately $650,000 at today’s market rates. That’s much less damaging than the one before, and it takes some pressure off Term Finance and its community. The website did not acknowledge this until media coverage surfaced, and the company has since declared that it will conduct a thorough review of its Oracle integration process to avoid such problems in the future. It also suggested that users affected by the bad liquidations might be eligible for further compensation, though no formal decision had been made. Weekend crypto attacks spark industry scrutiny The Term Finance incident wasn’t crypto’s only bad news over the weekend. The DeFi industry was rocked by a chain of attacks, highlighting the continued risk. Impermax Finance said Saturday that a flash loan attack hit its V3 pools. The exploit siphoned more than $150,000 out of the protocol, according to the blockchain security firm TenArmor. Impermax apologized to users and said a full post-mortem would be released soon. For its part, another Solana DeFi platform, Loopscale , lost $5.8 million in an exploit. Attackers took advantage of security holes, contributing to a growing tally of DeFi losses this year. A centralized platform is also not an exception. Crypto exchange Bitget revealed a $20 million loss after hackers exploited a market connected to an obscure token. Bitget said it had discovered eight accounts suspected of being involved in the scheme and would seek legal action against those behind them. The most recent attacks underline how insecure even the biggest players are. The data suggests that very little is recovered from many hacks. Take Bybit CEO Ben Zhou, for example; He disclosed recently that just 3.84% of stolen funds from their February heist had been frozen. Nearly 28% of the stolen funds — worth millions of dollars — have already gone “dark,” flowing into mixers and peer-to-peer networks, where they become impossible to trace. It was a rare victory compared to many other cases in which victims come up empty-handed. And yet, the incident displays a fundamental weakness in the overall security standards and risk management practices in the DeFi industry. The larger DeFi becomes, the higher the stakes and some projects may soon regret not budgeting more for technical failures.

Bitcoin and XRP have long held the spotlight, but one new name is entering the conversation with speed and structure: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . With market momentum building and investor eyes scanning for 2025’s big play, these three names are emerging not just as short-term picks—but as long-term strategies for real wealth growth. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Shaping Up to Be a High-Conviction Wealth Play Some tokens explode and fade. Others build the foundations quietly—and then take over. MAGACOINFINANCE appears to be the latter. It’s not just early—it’s early and executing. Wallets are growing daily, the community is expanding with real participation, and analyst mentions are starting to include MAGACOINFINANCE in serious wealth-building forecasts. What stands out is the way this project has avoided fluff. No overhype, no over-promising—just a clear, growing platform with the potential to rival the early days of Bitcoin-style entry points. For investors with long-term vision, this may be one of the last tokens still early enough to move on. Rising in Parallel: Ethereum, Polygon, Tron, and Arbitrum Ethereum continues to dominate smart contract innovation. Its Layer-2 integrations and network upgrades keep it vital across every use case. Polygon is Ethereum’s trusted scaling engine, pushing transaction speeds and onboarding major real-world partners—from corporations to institutions. Tron keeps volume high and transaction costs low, especially in Asia and among fintech products. It’s one of the most adopted blockchains for payments. Arbitrum is leading the Ethereum Layer-2 conversation, providing scalability and seamless user experiences for decentralized app developers. Each of these platforms is strong—but their early breakout phase is largely behind them. MAGACOINFINANCE , however, is just entering it. Final Word Looking ahead to 2025, the names that may define the year are already taking shape. Bitcoin and XRP continue to prove why they’re essential. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is starting to look like the next big crypto story in the making. The time to find tomorrow’s wealth builders is now—before they become today’s headlines.

When momentum builds, it builds fast—and the market is buzzing about two names that are setting the pace: Solana and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . One is a proven powerhouse gaining fresh traction. The other is a bold new contender that’s turning heads before the mainstream even notices. This is the moment investors dream about—when a project moves from early whispers to loud watchlist alerts. And right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is doing exactly that. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Picking Up Speed With Zero Gimmicks Some tokens go viral for a week. MAGACOINFINANCE is doing something far more sustainable—it’s building. The excitement isn’t artificial. It’s the result of measured execution, steady wallet adoption, and growing attention from research-driven investors. Community channels are growing daily. Social conversations are shifting from “What is this?” to “How early am I?” And perhaps most importantly, the token is showing signs of real structure: transparent development, active leadership, and a clear roadmap that people can actually follow. Momentum is no longer speculative—it’s visible. Solana Stays Hot With Performance and Expansion Solana has been here before—and it’s coming back stronger. Known for its lightning-fast processing and low transaction costs, Solana’s recent uptick isn’t just another rally—it’s tied to actual expansion across apps, integrations, and ecosystem upgrades. With developer activity on the rise and major apps continuing to choose Solana as their foundation, the token is once again showing that it can capture serious volume when the market warms up. Also Trending: NEAR Protocol, Chainlink, Ethereum, and Aave NEAR Protocol is gaining respect for its fast-growing development community and user-focused scalability. It’s quietly becoming a platform of choice for app builders and startups entering Web3. Chainlink continues to be indispensable. As smart contract platforms demand secure, off-chain data inputs, Chainlink remains the most trusted source in the oracle space. Ethereum is still the beating heart of blockchain infrastructure. Layer-2 growth, staking upgrades, and enterprise engagement keep it at the center of any serious discussion. Aave stands tall in on-chain lending and asset management. With continued innovation and flexibility, it’s a staple for those looking to build financial primitives on-chain. These projects are strong, yes—but they’re also established. The excitement now? It’s centered around MAGACOINFINANCE , where early means opportunity—and opportunity is shrinking fast. Final Word $10,000 in 30 days? It’s ambitious—but not unheard of in crypto. Timing is everything. Solana is proving it still has fire. MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is showing it’s more than talk—it’s motion. This might be your window—before the rest of the market catches up.

Feist, who had the blockchain’s “ danksharding ” data storage solution named after him, put forward EIP-9698 on April 27, which would introduce a “deterministic gas limit growth schedule” starting at epoch 369017, or around June 1. The proposal would gradually increase the gas limit by a factor of 10 for roughly two years, or 164,250 epochs, when one final tenfold increase would occur. Ethereum clients would need to vote on the proposal for it to take effect, Feist said. “By introducing a predictable exponential growth pattern as a client default, this EIP encourages a sustainable and transparent gas limit trajectory, aligned with expected advancements in hardware and protocol efficiency,” he added. As Ethereum can occasionally reach up to 20 TPS in blocks dominated by simple transactions, a 100x gas limit increase could theoretically increase Ethereum’s TPS to 2,000. Feist’s proposal would better position Ethereum to compete with the likes of Solana, which currently processes a non-vote TPS between 800 to 1,050 and has a theoretical TPS of 65,000. Source: Fabda.eth The EIP would expand the current gas limit of 36 million to 3.6 billion, potentially allowing around 6,000 transactions to fit into Ethereum blocks. Feist’s proposal comes after Ethereum validators agreed to raise the gas limit from 30 million to 36 million in February. Before that, the last change to Ethereum’s gas limit occurred in August 2021 under the London hard fork, where the figure was roughly doubled from 15 million to 30 million. Daily change in Ethereum Average Gas Limit over the last five years. Source: YCharts Feist acknowledged that a rapid increase in the gas limit under his proposal may stress less-optimized nodes and increase block propagation times. “However, the exponential schedule with very gradual increments per epoch gives node operators and developers ample time to adapt and optimize,” he said. Related: Ethereum community members propose new fee structure for the app layer EIP-9698 marks the Ethereum community’s latest effort to boost scalability at the base layer after predominantly focusing on scaling through layer 2 solutions in recent years. Critics of Ethereum’s layer-2 focused strategy claim that it has fragmented the ecosystem into several siloed chains with little interoperability, leading to a worse user experience. EIP-9678 looks to increase gas limit Ethereum developers are also looking to test a fourfold increase of Ethereum’s gas limit in the Fusaka hard fork under EIP-9678. Fusaka has been flagged as possibly going online in late 2025, while the next major Ethereum upgrade, Pectra, is scheduled to go live on the mainnet in May.

A wallet named “GASW,” created on March 6, 2025, just bought 48 million Pi coins — and none of them are locked. This could mean that a major player, like a company, institution, or even a government, is getting involved. Other Positive Catalysts: Binance, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, has shared new listing guidelines that have caught the attention of the crypto world — especially fans of Pi Coin. Since the platform now has more direct rules for adding new tokens, many believe this could open the door for Pi Coin to be listed on Binance soon. Meanwhile, the Pi Network team recently shared a roadmap for their migration process to improve transparency and respond to user concerns. However, the update left many disappointed, as it didn’t include details like how many users are still waiting or how many accounts can be migrated each day.

A group of RTFKT users led by Jagdeep Cheema claimed in the proposed class suit filed in a Brooklyn federal court on April 25 that they suffered “significant damages” as a result of Nike touting its sneaker-themed NFTs to gain investors, then shuttering the platform. The suit claimed the NFTs were unregistered securities, as Nike sold them without registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It accused the company of using “its iconic brand and marketing prowess to hype, promote, and prop up the unregistered securities that RTFKT sold.” “Because the Nike NFTs derived their value from the success of a given promoter and project — here, Nike and its marketing efforts — investors purchased this digital asset with the hope that its value would increase in the future as the project grows in popularity based on the Nike brand,” the lawsuit argued. The class suit claimed investors suffered damages due to Nike shutting its NFT platform. Source: CourtListener The lawsuit asks for $5 million in damages, claiming Nike broke consumer protection laws and violated various state unfair trade and competition laws. A US court hasn’t definitively ruled on whether NFTs are securities. Still, in an April 9 letter to the SEC, marketplace OpenSea urged the regulator to exclude NFTs from federal securities laws, arguing they don’t meet the legal definition of a security. In its case against Nike, the class group said that the court doesn’t necessarily need to rule on the legal status of NFTs to address the complaint. NFT market value dips In 2021, Nike acquired the NFT firm RTFKT Studios, which created virtual sneakers. According to the complaint, holders of the resulting Nike NFTs were told the tokens could be traded peer-to-peer on the secondary market and used to complete challenges and quests that could lead to rewards. Nike’s crypto kick NFT collection was changing hands for an average of 3.5 Ether ( ETH ), or around $8,000 when they were first listed on April 18, 2022, but were trading for around 0.009 Ether, or roughly $16 as of April 21, according to OpenSea. Nike NFTs have seen a sharp drop in value since they were first listed. Source: OpenSea Nike shut down RTFKT in January , which the class suit claims decimated investors when “prices plunged and did not recover,” and also took away the chance to take part in the challenges and quests, which the group argued was a primary reason for purchasing the tokens. Related: RTFKT’s CloneX avatars reappear after issue blacks out NFTs The overall NFT market dropped sharply in the first quarter of 2025, with sales plunging 63% year-over-year, to $1.5 billion in total sales from January to March 2025, down from $4.1 billion during the same period in 2024.

This ETF is expected to go live on April 30th, 2025. While it’s not a spot ETF — which tracks the actual price of XRP — it’s still a huge step forward for XRP’s recognition on Wall Street. The ETF approval comes just a few years after Ripple, the company behind XRP, was locked in a long legal battle with the SEC. Now, XRP is moving from courtrooms to trading floors, joining the ranks of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which already have both futures and spot ETFs. Some investors were unsure at first, asking, “Why futures and not spot?” But futures ETFs are often the first step. This was the path for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and experts believe a spot XRP ETF could be next. Futures trading allows big institutional investors to take positions on XRP, whether the market goes up or down — a common and healthy part of mature financial markets. BREAKING: SEC Approves an $XRP ETF — and It's HUGE No, it’s not a Spot ETF yet. It’s a Futures ETF — but don’t underestimate what this means.

The sharp increase shows a new phase of integration between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). These deals fall into five main trends: companies buying Bitcoin for their treasuries (like Twenty One Capital), traditional firms merging with crypto infrastructure providers, acquisitions focused on institutional services (like Ripple buying Metaco), consolidation between crypto and traditional trading platforms, and mergers between token-based projects. But one deal in particular is drawing high praise — especially from pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton. Deaton recently pointed to Ripple’s $1.25 billion acquisition of prime brokerage firm Hidden Road as “possibly the best example” of the TradFi-DeFi convergence happening in crypto. Hidden Road processes over $3 trillion a year for more than 300 institutional clients. By integrating with Ripple’s XRP Ledger (XRPL), settlement times have dropped from 24 hours to just 3–5 seconds. I agree with Chamath. I also believe @Ripple ’s $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road as possibly the best example of the convergence of TradFi and DeFi in all of crypto.

Deaton explained how this move positions Ripple at the forefront of institutional DeFi by combining DeFi’s speed with TradFi’s reach. He also opened up about the importance of Ripple’s rapid expansion into crypto custody. In addition to acquiring Metaco, Ripple has bought Standard Custody and launched “Ripple Custody” to offer institutions a full suite of services — from payments and stablecoins to asset storage. Why the big push into custody? Deaton believes Ripple is preparing for the tokenization boom. With the custody market expected to grow beyond $16 trillion by 2030, Ripple is building the tools banks will need to tokenize stocks, bonds, or even real estate using the XRPL — with RLUSD powering these transactions. “It looks like [CEO] Brad Garlinghouse is making up for lost time,” Deaton said, referring to Ripple’s progress after its long legal battle with the SEC.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 03:34:44

Following a volatile end to 2024, THORChain’s native token, RUNE, suffered a sharp correction in Q1 2025 and ended up closing the quarter at $1.14, down 74.5% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). This significantly underperformed major digital assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum falling by 12.6% and 45.5%, respectively. RUNE’s market capitalization dropped 73.8% over the same period, as it plunged from $1.5 billion to $400.9 million, its lowest level since mid-2022. THORChain’s USD TVL Drops 50% According to Messari’s latest report , the slump in RUNE’s value heavily impacted THORChain’s DeFi footprint, as total value locked (TVL) in USD terms fell by 50.5%, from $368.6 million to $181.1 million by the end of the quarter. TVL had peaked at $367.7 million on January 2, before sliding in step with RUNE’s declining price. Despite the steep losses in USD terms, native participation in THORChain’s ecosystem remained strong. In fact, RUNE-denominated TVL climbed 93.2% QoQ, after increasing from 82.2 million to 158.8 million RUNE. Messari said that the figure pointed to growing user activity and confidence in the protocol’s multichain liquidity infrastructure even amid volatile pricing. THORChain Swap Volumes Dip Swap activity, however, painted a more muted picture. Average daily swap volume fell 24.4% QoQ to $68.8 million, reversing the previous quarter’s momentum and continuing a downward trend from the $218.4 million daily average seen in early January. A notable exception occurred on March 2, when THORChain processed a record $1.05 billion in swaps in a single day. This anomalous spike followed the Bybit exploit, as attackers utilized the protocol to convert stolen ETH into BTC. While this inflated weekly throughput figures, it did not meaningfully alter the broader decline in organic activity. On-chain data also showed a drop in user engagement, with the average number of daily swappers declining 14.5% QoQ to 1,780. However, usage remained widely distributed across wallets and affiliates, which indicated that while overall volume fell, the protocol’s infrastructure continued to support a broad base of participants. “The sustained participation reflects the protocol’s continued role as a backend settlement layer for multichain swaps, even as broader market volatility and RUNE’s price drawdown weighed on user activity.” The post RUNE Slump Hits THORChain’s DeFi USD TVL in Q1, But Native Deposits Surge appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|THORChain,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|RUNE,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-28 03:41:06

Bitcoin ( BTC ) felt “noticeably different” over the trading week ended April 25, NYDIG’s global head of research Greg Cipolaro said in an April 25 market note . “We’ve been observing subtle shifts in its behavior over the past few weeks,” he added. “The decoupling from traditional risk assets is still very early and fragile, but for those watching crypto markets 24/7, the shift is palpable.” “Bitcoin has acted less like a liquid levered version of levered US equity beta and more like the non-sovereign issued store of value that it is.” Cipolaro noted that Bitcoin has gained more than 13% since the beginning of April, while US markets such as the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq have declined amid escalating global trade tensions due to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs. He added that the US dollar and long-term US Treasurys have also underperformed since the election and Trump’s April 2 “ Liberation Day ” tariff announcements, which lumped every country with various rates, the minimum being 10%. Gold and currencies such as the Swiss franc have been consistent winners as safe havens, Cipolaro said, noting that Bitcoin is emerging as a non-sovereign store of value. Amid surging volatility in equities, measured with the VIX index, foreign exchange rates (CVIX index), and interest rates and bonds (MOVE index), investors have been on the hunt for these safe haven assets . Several asset classes have recently seen high volatility. Source: NYDIG Cipolaro said investors are also seeking alternatives to US hegemony, whether that is stocks, bonds, forex, or commodities. Few large liquid options However, Cipolaro said investors seeking alternatives outside traditional financial systems have few large, liquid options. Gold remains the largest non-sovereign store of value at around a $22 trillion market cap, while Bitcoin has just a fraction of that at $1.8 trillion. Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in May — Here is why Additionally, Bitcoin is the only top crypto asset listed that “solely focuses on monetary or store of value use cases,” while the others are better described as the fuel for decentralized application platforms, he said. Cipolaro concluded that despite Bitcoin’s recent gains, “there are few signs of the market overheating,” and the recovery is still in early stages.

Over 80,000 ETH have moved into derivative exchanges in this brief timeframe, an inflow of a scale that seasoned market watchers typically view as a setup for significant price movements. And historically, these kinds of inflows have meant that deep-pocketed players are up to something, usually something not great for the price. Someone’s prepping for a move… Over 80,000 $ETH just flowed into derivative exchanges in the last 48 hours. That’s not a number you brush off. Historically, inflows like this signal incoming volatility—and usually lean bearish. Buckle up. pic.twitter.com/fHcZQCmMvq — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) April 25, 2025 However, it is not only the scale of these inflows that has struck observers but also their timing and the subsequent trading actions. One trader, closely watched over the past couple of days, said to have lost $208,000 by aggressively shorting the market when the time was very much not right. This shows how, in times of heightened uncertainty, it’s quite easy for even the very experienced to get surprised. One Trader’s Costly Bet Against ETH On April 24, the afternoon of which this particular trader chose for his ill-fated foray into Ethereum’s short side, ETH was anything but a falling knife. Despite the best efforts of the trader to hammer down the price (and despite significant selling all across the crypto market, which on that day featured a number of bearish headlines), Ethereum found support at around $1,750 and, later in the night, reclaimed the closely watched $1,800 level. Nevertheless, the trader pressed on. A few hours after ETH took back the $1,800 marker, he personally borrowed another 4,000 ETH (worth about $7.25 million then) from decentralized lending protocol Aave and short-sold it at $1,808.60. This one didn’t go as well for him either. And again, it suggests he believes downward pressure is imminent for Ethereum. This sort of behavior—both big inflows of ETH to derivatives platforms and the spree of short selling by certain large traders—looks bearish. It seems to point in the direction of a segment of the market that has a decidedly negative outlook on Ethereum’s short-term price prospects. 这老哥对于摸顶卖空 $ETH 很执着啊 ：昨天他才因为卖空 ETH 导致亏损 $20.8 万，昨晚半夜 ETH 涨上 $1,800 后他又继续卖空了 4,000 ETH。 ◎他昨天下午才把借币卖空的 8,000 枚 ETH 买回来把仓位平掉，亏损了 $20.8 万。 ◎昨晚半夜时，ETH 重新站上 $1,800，于是老哥又再次从 Aave 借出 4,000 ETH… https://t.co/8AwkUVvpFI pic.twitter.com/fdOliKQ9lN — 余烬 (@EmberCN) April 26, 2025 And when we try to make sense of this, one possible explanation that emerges is simply that sentiment in the derivatives market is not in sync with what spot market participants are doing. Spot Ethereum ETFs See Strong Inflows, Offering a Bullish Counterbalance This bearish derivative action is occurring simultaneously with robust spot ETF performance. On April 25, Spot Ethereum ETFs notched net inflows of $104 million, with not a single ETF in the Ethereum space reporting a net outflow. That’s a striking contrast to the derivatives side of the market and may indicate that retail and institutional investors see long-term value in Ethereum, even if they are deriding its price performance on a short-term basis. This divergence in market behavior—bullish ETF inflows vs. bearish derivative signals—creates a complex and somewhat contradictory near-term outlook for Ethereum. One hand suggests derivative traders are positioning for a correction, possibly to be triggered by macro factors, regulatory uncertainty, or just-took-gains profit-taking after recent rallies. Yet, the other hand—that’s not anything near an order of four—shows a continuously liquid spot ETF market for ETH that cannot possibly uphold a bearish scenario. On April 25, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $380 million, marking six consecutive days of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $104 million, with no net outflows across all nine ETFs. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 26, 2025 Ethereum’s recent price action has also been centered around the important $1,800 level that seems to be acting as a battleground between bulls and bears. In terms of inflows and ETF setups, investors are more inclined to bet on Ethereum’s long-term developments, especially with the anticipated changes in Ethereum 2.0. With all this activity, traders and investors should prepare for possible volatility. It’s not clear if Ethereum will keep climbing or get hit with some more selling pressure, but it’s pretty clear that it’s going to do something—and soon. If it does something in either the spot or derivatives market, watch out below: big trades can send huge ripples through both markets. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

However, it has now rebounded quite remarkably, and some folks (like this author) who are Bitcoin bulls and believe in the digital asset’s potential are hopeful and even somewhat confident about the big breakout to $94K and beyond. This was an unexpected breakout event for the digital asset, and it’s happening at a time when the world is more divided and in conflict than ever. Bitcoin's unexpected breakout has flipped the script for the crypto community. Data shows a surge in optimism from the crowd as $BTC rebounded above $95K for the first time since February. As for the level of greed being measured across social media, this is the highest spike… pic.twitter.com/cbdEt41xo4 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 25, 2025 Rising Macro Tensions and Institutional Support Fuel Bitcoin’s Rebound Bitcoin’s resurgence above $95K comes in a globally uncertain macroeconomic environment. The tariff wars, rising geopolitical tensions, and inflation worries have cast a pall of fear and instability over the old-school financial markets. This kind of atmosphere has often been very good for Bitcoin, presumed by many to be a “safe-haven” asset during times of unease. Gold has long held that same mantle, but Bitcoin is now clearly in the conversation. And if things keep going the way they have been, the conversation might get a lot louder. It is not only the state of the macroeconomy that has brought Bitcoin back. The recovery has, in large part, been driven by a huge uptick in institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Heavyweights such as BlackRock have continued to shove force into Bitcoin and the crypto space writ large. Their recent participation in the recovery, along with the much-wanted movement toward institutional adoption of Bitcoin ETFs, has added a level of street cred and stability to the market that had been largely absent. As Bitcoin has recovered as high as $95.8K today, we are seeing the highest week of net inflows to $BTC ETF's since the week before Trump's inauguration in mid-January. Institutions like Blackrock have played a large part in the crypto-wide bounce traders were waiting for. pic.twitter.com/jUxNM8wo75 — Santiment (@santimentfeed) April 25, 2025 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted an enormous $380 million in net inflows for the week ending April 25, 2025, marking the highest weekly net inflows since the week before Trump’s inauguration in mid-January. This trend is signaling something very positive for Bitcoin. It suggests that the interest in Bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset is going mainstream, especially among the kinds of large institutional players who presumably also have a lot of influence over retail investor sentiment. On April 25, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a total net inflow of $380 million, marking six consecutive days of net inflows. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a total net inflow of $104 million, with no net outflows across all nine ETFs. https://t.co/Hj2Gs49bWa — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 26, 2025 The Crowd’s Growing Optimism and Rising Greed When Bitcoin soared over the $95,000 mark, there was a marked increase in the overall optimism of the crypto community. While the price of Bitcoin never dipped below $88,000 from November 20 to December 31, 2024, the sentiment surrounding crypto in general had many people thinking it was DOA (dead on arrival) for any chance of a near-term price recovery. On Christmas Day, Bitcoin’s price was at $91,550. Then it climbed to… Despite the growing optimism about the market, some analysts have raised concerns that this could simply be a sign of an incipient top, with excessive greed and hubris fueling the latest rally. For the Bitcoin price to keep going up, there needs to be a sufficient base of retail investors willing to purchase the leading cryptocurrency. If too many traders try to take profits, it creates an opportunity for the institutional investors and whales who have been buying up the lower dips in Bitcoin to push the price up even further. The crowd’s sentiment is crucial in deciding whether Bitcoin can carry on with its present momentum or must soon retrace its steps. If the market gets too greedy and retail traders rush to take profits, we may see a temporary pullback in Bitcoin’s price. On the other hand, if the market remains patient and controlled greed is the order of the day, we could see Bitcoin push further into the uncharted territory of prices it has not seen before. In either case, sentiment is of the utmost importance. Bitcoin’s Future Outlook: Will $100K Be Within Reach? With Bitcoin approaching $95K, the question on many investors’ minds is whether the cryptocurrency can keep up its current trajectory and finally break through the $100K barrier. The road to $100K may not be without its bumps, but the combination of strong institutional support, an increasingly worrisome macroeconomic picture, and a steadily rising tide of retail and institutional investors gives Bitcoin a solid foundation to continue its upward movement. To conclude, the crypto space has been revitalized by Bitcoin’s recent surge, with both retail and institutional investors looking to the cryptocurrency as an all-but-certain store of value. We’re at the highest levels of market optimism and institutional inflows since Trump was inaugurated, and now it’s time for Bitcoin to take a crucial test—can it either maintain this momentum or avoid a serious retracement? At this point, with a stronger than ever market position, only a severe plot twist could deny Bitcoin’s re-ascendance. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The platform’s resurgence began with a strategic overhaul, including the launch of Euler v2, fresh audits of the system, and key partnerships with prominent industry players. By the end of April 2025, Euler’s Total Value Locked (TVL) had rocketed to $1.5 billion, a remarkable turnaround that showcases the platform’s resilience and ability to rebuild trust within the DeFi community. Euler Finance’s Resilient Comeback 2023 was a dark chapter in the history of Euler Finance. During that year, hackers took advantage of a few vulnerabilities in the Euler Finance code and made off with $197 million. The hack sent shockwaves through the DeFi space—was Euler ever going to get back to where it was? It was a good question. The answer, in my opinion, is yes—and the first step in that direction was the launch of Euler v2 in September 2024. Euler reborn: TVL сlimbs to $1.5B In March 2023, hackers stole $197M from the @eulerfinance lending protocol. Euler’s strong comeback began with the launch of Euler v2, followed by fresh audits, @gauntlet_xyz joining as risk manager, and backing from @wintermute_t . Since v2… pic.twitter.com/aSq4JFiaSu — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 25, 2025 Euler version 2 brought forth a wealth of new capabilities—improved security, better user interfaces, and optimizations that pretty much made the whole platform run better. From those updates, it was able to regain the confidence of its previous users and even add new participants to the mix. The v2 upgrade also marked a turn in the road that led to a series of strategic moves that made Euler what it is today. In addition to making technical upgrades, Euler Finance brought in outside auditors to ensure that any remaining vulnerabilities in the protocol had been eliminated and that its security was now sufficiently strong to prevent any future hacks. Audits like this one are a standard and important part of the assurance process in the blockchain space, and they played a crucial role in signaling to the community that the Euler platform was now safe to use. Even after this audit was completed, Euler Finance further increased its security assurances by bringing in the risk management firm Gauntlet to do ongoing risk assessments of the protocol. Strategic Partnerships and Growing Network Apart from technical improvements and risk management upgrades, Euler Finance obtained backing from a prominent crypto liquidity provider, Wintermute. Not only did Wintermute provide some much-needed financial backing, but its participation in the Euler project also helped to significantly boost the platform’s liquidity—an absolutely vital factor for the successful operation of any lending protocol. Euler Finance further widened its reach by integrating with many blockchains. Since it launched Euler v2, the protocol now serves a set of networks in addition to Ethereum. This set includes Avalanche (AVAX), Berachain, and several other ecosystems. By using a multi-chain strategy, Euler has been able to reach more diverse sets of users and serve a more diverse set of blockchain ecosystems. Consequently, Euler’s market share has grown fairly significantly over the last year. One of Euler’s revival’s standout accomplishments has been the remarkable growth of its TVL. Since the release of v2, Euler’s TVL has skyrocketed from a modest $4.5 million to an impressive $1.44 billion, with close to $1 billion of that locked on Ethereum. The protocol’s ability to corral such a goodly amount of capital, even in light of the past security problems it faced, speaks loud and clear about its greatly enhanced functionality and the strong demand for decentralized lending services. A Bright Future Ahead for Euler Finance Euler Finance’s astounding revival is a testament to the platform’s durability and the resilience of the broader DeFi ecosystem. By tackling security issues directly, beefing up its product, and securing key partnerships, Euler has not only bounced back from the hack but also emerged as one of the leading DeFi lending platforms right now. With a protocol TVL of $1.5 billion, it is once again a trusted part of the DeFi community. With Euler v2 now fully functioning and a solid platform established, the prospects for growth in the next few years look good. Attracting new users seems a safe bet, as the expansion to multiple blockchains will likely continue to pull in fresh traffic. And attracting new users is pretty much Job #1 for Gauntlet, which ensures that risk management remains a priority as Euler scales. For investors and users in the DeFi space, Euler Finance offers a compelling option in the realm of decentralized lending and borrowing. Its strong security, innovative features, and growing multi-chain presence make it a protocol to watch as the DeFi landscape continues to evolve. In terms of total value locked, Euler appears to be expanding its market presence quite nicely. Total value locked has generally been a reliable metric for assessing the market footprint of any particular DeFi protocol. As services like Euler continue to attract more liquidity and seem to be fortifying trust among users, they are also driving decentralized finance further into the mainstream.

Over the past week, Bitcoin has not moved in lockstep with major stock indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. This seems to signal a fascinating shift in its role in global financial markets. The correlation between Bitcoin and the S&P 500, once at a relatively high 0.68, has now dropped all the way down to 0.27. This is a big change for a cryptocurrency that has spent the last year following the same ups and downs as the stock market. Even as Bitcoin’s ties to traditional stocks appear to be weakening, its links to gold seem to be enshrined in ever-more-solid ground. Recent data have revealed that Bitcoin’s correlation with the precious metal has really taken off and is now at a more pronounced -0.51, up from a modest 0.05. If folks are making a case for seeing Bitcoin as even more akin to gold than stocks, it’s probably not a bad case to make. ""Bitcoin Breaks Away from Stocks, Moves Closer to Gold "" — OKX Ventures (@OKX_Ventures) April 25, 2025 Bitcoin’s Position in the Market: A Growing Share of Gold’s Market Cap The changing relationship between Bitcoin and traditional assets, like stocks, reflects a broader shift in the cryptocurrency’s position within global financial markets. As Bitcoin’s correlation with gold strengthens, it is slowly becoming a more direct competitor to the precious metal in terms of being a store of value. This transition is highlighted by Bitcoin’s growing share of the gold market, which, according to Cryptorank, stands at 11% in 2025. Although Bitcoin’s market share in gold has decreased a little over time, the trend shows that Bitcoin’s Total Addressable Market (TAM) is still growing, as the actual global gold market is also growing. This market share expansion emphasizes Bitcoin’s increasing acceptance as an alternative digital wealth preservation vehicle. Bitcoin now makes up 11% of gold’s market size As gold’s market cap continues to grow, #Bitcoin share stands at 11% in 2025. Even though the percentage has slightly declined, #Bitcoin ’s Total Addressable Market (TAM) keeps expanding as the gold market grows. pic.twitter.com/8GyGZ9HH8x — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) April 23, 2025 For a long time, gold has been regarded as a safe haven asset. It is valued by investors for its stability and its role as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. It is becoming increasingly correlated with Bitcoin, though, and many investors are starting to see the leading cryptocurrency as a potential alternative to gold. Because of the shift in perception in regard to Bitcoin, we might be looking at a new phase in the life of the leading cryptocurrency. The Implications of Bitcoin’s Divergence from Stocks The implications for traditional investors and those in the cryptocurrency market from Bitcoin’s decoupling from U.S. stocks are significant. For investors in both worlds, it has been long established that Bitcoin’s movements have been closely aligned with traditional stock market indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Yet as that correlation continues to decline, we can see that Bitcoin’s price movements are becoming less tethered to the performance of traditional equities. This shift could provide new occasions for investors. As Bitcoin moves more in line with the gold market, it may well become an attractive asset for those looking to diversify their portfolios. Bitcoin’s price behavior, in increasing tandem with gold’s, offers some signal that it too will serve a similar port in the storm for investors who want to protect their wealth from uncertainties. Also, Bitcoin’s increasing connection with gold could affect how institutional investors look at the crypto market. If Bitcoin demonstrates relative strength and a propensity for more stability than stocks, it might begin to claim a larger share of investment capital from these large players as part of their overall strategies. The Future of Bitcoin as a Digital Store of Value As Bitcoin keeps on developing, its ever-growing parallel with gold makes it a real rival in the universe of classical assets. It seems obvious now that the correlation between the two is strengthening; therefore, one must concede that Bitcoin’s pathway toward becoming a digital store of value is now clear. Even though its market share in gold has decreased slightly, one must now acknowledge that Bitcoin’s potential to seriously upset the classical asset universe continues to grow. In the future, it appears that Bitcoin will no longer be competing directly with stocks and bonds and will instead be on a similar playing field as gold. Bitcoin’s price and market share are moving more and more into the realm of redefining the role of precious metals in the global economy. And with those changes to the role of digital assets surely comes some recalibration of the global economy for digital asset holders. As this trend develops, investors will have to keep an eye on the continuing association between Bitcoin, stocks, and gold. Right now, it is very much evident that Bitcoin is putting itself out there as more than just a highly speculative asset. It is, in fact, a potential safe-haven asset with a few interesting twists that are worth noting. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The network is demonstrating its durability and user appeal, and also developer appeal, with a series of impressive metrics. Data monitored by Lookonchain tell the story quite well. Growth across several key indicators has really picked up. And those key indicators are: Total Value Locked (TVL), DEX (decentralized exchange) trading volume, and stablecoin supply. Total Value Locked (TVL) Soars by 38% One of the most significant indicators of the Sui ecosystem’s growth is its rapidly increasing Total Value Locked (TVL). In just one week, TVL surged by an impressive 38%, reaching $1.645 billion. TVL, which represents the total value of assets locked within the ecosystem, is a critical metric for assessing the health and adoption of decentralized networks. The notable uptick in Sui’s TVL is a sign of growing confidence from users and investors alike. This surge can be attributed to a mix of reasons: the tech of the network has improved, its main projects have started rolling out new features, and it has seen an uptick in not just decentralized apps but also dApps that deliver fun, varied experiences to users. This is making the Sui network look more and more like a go-to place for DeFi projects as well as other blockchain-based apps. DEX Trading Volume Hits $599 Million, a 177% Weekly Increase An additional main measure that shows the Sui ecosystem is growing quickly is the huge amount of trading volume occurring on its decentralized exchanges. In the past week, Sui’s DEX platforms had 24-hour trading volume of $599 million. That’s up a staggering 177% from just the week before. At this rate, Sui isn’t just keeping pace with other ecosystems but is pulling ahead as a DEX trading destination. No other layer 1 or layer 2 network is coming close. The increase in trading volume on Sui’s DEX can be linked to the launch of several new features and campaigns by Sui’s core projects. These initiatives, which include new trading pairs, liquidity incentives, and improved user interfaces, have likely played a role in driving increased trading activity. Additionally, the available liquidity on Sui’s DEX platforms provides traders with the ability to execute larger transactions with lower slippage, making the platform an attractive option for users seeking efficient and cost-effective transactions. 1/ Over the past week, the Sui ecosystem has experienced significant growth. According to data monitored by Lookonchain: TVL increased by 38%, reaching $1.645 billion; DEX 24-hour trading volume reached $599 million, a 177% week-over-week increase; The total stablecoin… — OKX Ventures (@OKX_Ventures) April 26, 2025 The increase in trading volume is also proof of rising developer confidence in the Sui blockchain. This, in turn, seems to be spurring the building of even more innovative, decentralized financial products on the Sui platform. Meanwhile, traders and liquidity providers are starting to show up in significant numbers. All of this adds up to a pretty favorable scenario for the Sui ecosystem. Stablecoin Supply Increases by 82%, Reflecting Capital Influx The fast expansion of stablecoin supply within the Sui ecosystem is yet another main signal of the network’s ever-expanding role in the larger crypto market. In just the past two months, the total supply of stablecoins on the Sui network has risen from $482 million to $879 million—an unbelievable 82% growth. Stablecoins are a basic building block of DeFi. They provide a stable-store-of-value alternative in a crypto world that’s largely dominated by unstable, highly speculative assets. Capital is flowing into the Sui ecosystem, and it’s doing so through stable assets. This is a huge sign of the kind of progress we are making with Sui Stablecoin influx reflects a capital trend and user shift toward using Sui as a more risk-averse investment vehicle. Stablecoins are stable, and they provide the kinds of user opportunities that make DeFi appealing (lending, staking, yield farming, etc.). These user opportunities, paired with the inherent stability of stablecoins, make it likely that stablecoins will be a big part of Sui’s capital and user base going forward. In addition, the supply of stablecoins is expanding rapidly in parallel with the growth of DeFi applications. As a new apparatus for interacting with digital assets, decentralized finance requires an ever-growing and increasingly diverse set of financial tools. Stablecoins are now a basic component of this toolkit. They occupy a middle ground in a world where uncollateralized dollar-denominated credit is increasingly hard to come by. Sui’s Rising Capital Resilience and Developer Confidence When looked at from an investment standpoint, the Sui ecosystem’s is one of steadily building capital and developer confidence in a Layer 1 blockchain. Its performance, across some of the most fundamental key metrics—TVL, trading activity, and stablecoin volume—suggests that the on-chain ecosystem is not just on the path to thriving The Sui network’s long-term success will be determined by how well it can scale and satisfy a burgeoning demand from a swelling number of users and developers. The rising capital activity and user engagement across Sui indicate that it’s becoming an ever-more-important player in the blockchain space. To sum up, the Sui ecosystem has entered a significant stage. Its size and relevance have increased impressively. With an ecosystem that encompasses over 70 projects and keeps expanding, with an increase in trading volume on its decentralized exchange (DEX) that approaches the conditions that would make DEX arbitrage feasible, and with a stablecoin framework set up, the Sui ecosystem seems to be on a solid path.

43888488,https://nulltx.com/?p=148381,1745812709,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Rising Open Interest and Short Bias Signal Potential Volatility in Bitcoin’s Perpetual Swap Market,https://nulltx.com/rising-open-interest-and-short-bias-signal-potential-volatility-in-bitcoins-perpetual-swap-market/,"Bitcoin’s price is rebounding, and so the market for perpetual swaps is showing a sharp increase in open interest (OI). That OI number crude proxy for how many traders are in the market shows that, post-CPI (Consumer Price Index indica implementation of economic policy), we have roughly 281,000 BTC in the Bitcoin perpetual swap OI. This is way more than we’ve had in quite some time, so what it means (more or less) is that more traders are in the perpetual swap market, period. And that must, of course, mean something. And what it inevitably leads you to is this: the perpetual swap market is not a market that exists in a vacuum. By its very name, it implies a building up of leverage, because how do you perpetually swap an asset without a lot of leverage being involved? Also, and I can’t stress this enough, the perpetual swap market is now and always has been an essential part of the landscape for Bitcoin traders. The rise in open interest is a typical feature of price recovery. As prices rise, more and more traders join the fun. The influx of traders means that order flow becomes even healthier. The healthier order flow is, the more likely it is that prices keep going in the direction they’re going in (i.e., recovery); hence, the healthier the price recovery becomes. Open interest, then, is a positive indicator for price recovery. Short Side Dominates: Funding Rates Suggest a Bearish Sentiment Even though open interest (OI) has risen, the funding rate in perpetual swap markets has turned negative. The average funding rate has fallen to -0.023%. This means that when perpetual swap traders make payments to each other, the traders on the long side pay the traders on the short side. It also means, apparently, that more perpetual swap traders are betting on Bitcoin’s price to fall rather than to keep rising. That also seems to be what more and more market participants think is going to happen. A market generally implies positive funding rates when the price is going up, but that’s what you’d expect in a typical market structure, right? Because in a typical market structure, you have long positions in excess of short positions, and the demand for borrowing the asset just pushes the funding rates higher. So the funding rate being negative during a price recovery really shows a divergence from that typical market structure, and it also implies that traders are kind of split on being with or against the rally. When there is a significant number of short positions that get liquidated, we say that a short squeeze has occurred. This is when the traders who shorted an asset in anticipation that its price would go down are suddenly rushing to buy back the asset that they shorted because the price is going up and they can’t let their loss go on any longer. This action in the market causes the price to go up even more, in a kind of virtuous cycle for the bulls and a vicious cycle for the bears. Reduced Appetite for Long Positions Adds to Short Bias More evidence of the prevailing short bias is found in the data for long-side funding premiums. The 7-day moving average (7DMA) of long-side funding premiums has recently drifted down to $88,000 per hour and is still trending downward. Funding premiums for long positions represent the amount long traders pay to maintain their positions. A downtrend in a long-side premium is generally seen as a signal that the market is moving against long traders. So, what by now should be a pretty clear picture is this: The funding structure of the Bitcoin market is slanted in favor of short traders. The reduction in long-side funding premiums may indicate that traders are hesitating to fully commit to long positions as the market remains unsure about the sustainability of the price recovery. Many traders may be holding off on adding to their long positions and instead are maintaining a wait-and-see approach in the hopes that the recent price action matures into a more substantial and lasting bullish trend. Open Interest in perpetual swaps has risen to 281K $BTC , up +15.6% since early March. This suggests a build-up of leverage in the market as prices rebound, increasing the potential for amplified volatility via liquidations and stop-outs. pic.twitter.com/3e0mOORqAT — glassnode (@glassnode) April 25, 2025 Increasing open interest, poor funding rates for longs, and lower actual premiums paid by long position holders combine to create a potentially very volatile Bitcoin market. These factors boost the chances for big price moves and, hence, the opportunity to make big profits— or suffer huge losses. And the fact that half of the market is betting against Bitcoin could even mean that the next big Bitcoin move will be upward, as the shorts get stopped out. What Lies Ahead? With Bitcoin demonstrating renewed vigor in its price restoration, the critical variable in deciding this market’s future seems to be the tug-of-war between long and short positions. If bullish forces keep pushing the price upward, all these chumps who have piled on to the short side are going to find themselves in an unwanted position and will have to cover their shorts, adding further fuel to the upward price movement. On the other hand, if this rally starts to roll over and those short positions start making money, then we’ve got a market that could very well see Bitcoin prices start declining again. The continues transformation in open interest, funding rates, and long side premiums stresses the high-stakes arena that Bitcoin traders are working in. With so much leverage in the system and such a strong load towards short positions, potential for amplified volatility remains high. Traders must stay alerted and keep a close watch over these key indicators. They may very well serve up the next significant price move. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Drawing utility from the strengths of the Bitcoin network, Mezo is emerging as a service layer in the BTCFi landscape. And it seems to be resonating with users, who are finding it a compelling means of “farming” their Bitcoin for returns. The value proposition core to Mezo is its incorporation with the tBTC infrastructure, which permits user access to liquidity and programmability of decentralized finance while hewing to the Bitcoin security model. Mezo’s appearance, in a way, permits the whole appearance of borrowing, spending, and earning with the Bitcoin to become seamless—with few apps lingering in the space—that’s a huge gap being filled by Mezo. And ultimately, let us not miss the point here, it’s about putting the BTC itself to work in ways that get the BTC into actual, functional use-cases in financial applications. Growth Signals Show Rising Demand for BTCFi Solutions Mezo’s ascent is supported by impressive growth numbers from on-chain metrics. Over the past week, the number of borrowers on the platform surged by 84.4 percent. This brings the total user count to over 8,600. The speed at which this base is growing is a clear signal that holders of Bitcoin are seeking means through which the can utilize their assets in a more direct, decentralized manner. And by direct, I mean not relying on any centralized intermediaries. Simultaneously, the volume of $MUSD—Mezo’s stable borrowing currency—has skyrocketed. On the platform, a total of 183.8 million dollars worth of $MUSD has been borrowed, representing a 70 percent increase within just seven days. This spike reflects both a burgeoning user confidence and an increasing demand for liquidity solutions that are native to the Bitcoin ecosystem. With its mainnet launch expected in May, @MezoNetwork is rapidly gaining traction as the Bitcoin Economic Layer for BTCFi. Over 8,600 borrowers, up 84.4% in the past week $183.8M in $MUSD borrowed, a 70% increase in the last 7 days 92% of users collateralize with… pic.twitter.com/4MN55lQ5qQ — Bitcoin Ecosystem (@BitcoinEcoTK) April 25, 2025 Maybe the most revealing aspect is the composition of the user base. Data indicates that 92 percent of users collateralize with less than 0.0005 BTC, which suggests that Mezo is not just appealing to whales or institutional participants. This distribution seems to indicate that the platform is quite accessible, as it is engaging a large number of smallholders who are, in traditional DeFi models, often overlooked. For these users, the platform represents, in many cases, their first experience with using Bitcoin for anything other than holding it or making simple transfers. Mezo’s infrastructure is designed with this inclusivity in mind. By making borrowing against Bitcoin easy and efficient, the platform lowers the barrier to entry for everyday Bitcoin users. It allows them to put their Bitcoin to work without giving up custody or incurring the risks associated with centralized lending platforms. This shift toward on-chain borrowing not only improves capital efficiency but also strengthens Bitcoin’s presence in the broader DeFi ecosystem. In contrast to Ethereum-based DeFi, which many times has high-yield mechanisms contingent upon shaky token models, Mezo is stable, transparent, and sustainable. Its core growth strategy focuses on low volatility. The use of tBTC—a “trust-minimized” decentralized version of Bitcoin on Ethereum—allows Mezo to bridge two ecosystems while remaining true to Bitcoin’s core ethos. Analysts and investors are starting to take notice of Mezo’s advancements as excitement surges for the imminent launch of its mainnet. There exists a firm belief in many circles that Mezo could serve as the platform and portal for unleashing the hitherto locked liquidity of Bitcoin, which is better described as monetary energy, in order to truly set the stage for BTCFi to become a rising star in its next cycle of DeFi innovation. Should Mezo keep growing at its current rate, it will very soon become the go-to solution for anyone wanting to do anything with Bitcoin that was impossible not so very long ago. Its future success will almost certainly hinge on whether it can keep scaling to huge sizes while remaining accessible, secure, and decentralized. Mezo’s adoption isn’t just rapid; it is strong and across the board. The value proposition is exceedingly clear. Its meetings are well-attended, with the audience comprised largely of potential users. We think that this situation—strong early adoption, a clear value proposition, and a launch just around the corner—puts Mezo in position to redefine how Bitcoin interacts with the world of DeFi. And for Bitcoiners who have long awaited a more functional use case for their holdings, Mezo may most imminently deliver on that front. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This well-coordinated buying spree happened earlier today and was most visible through the on-chain metrics for a particular wallet. That wallet, identified as 0x97251bbbe8f80bf1787b15abed08c09ac5cc1776, executed a series of high-value purchases in what were largely seen as confidence bets. Among the purchases made were millions worth of the following tokens: VIRTUAL, WLD, GAME, and COOKIE. The size and timing of these acquisitions suggest that there’s a lot more here than just casual speculation. Be it insider knowledge, a long-term belief in the chosen tokens, or a more expansive bet on the narratives the market is going to play out in the near future, this whale is putting a considerable amount of dollars behind its decisions. A Closer Look at the Whale’s Portfolio Picks The buying binge started with a huge purchase of VIRTUAL, a recently popular token in the metaverse and digital experience realm. The whale got 2.53 million VIRTUAL tokens at an average price of 0.93 dollars, totaling 2.66 million dollars. In appearance, that looks an awful lot like a vote of confidence on the virtual world front. Altcoin Buffet: Whale Scoops Up $VIRTUAL, $WLD , $GAME , and $COOKIE in One Big Shopping Spree One wallet is making bold moves across multiple altcoins today. The whale behind address 0x97251bbbe8f80bf1787b15abed08c09ac5cc1776 went on a buying spree, pic.twitter.com/sV07F94HXT — EyeOnChain (@EyeOnChain) April 26, 2025 Then, the purse zeroed in on WLD, or Worldcoin, a project that has audacious dreams of making a worldly, decentralized, identity-and-finance layer. The whale gobbled up 1.48 million WLD at an average price of 1.02 dollars, investing 1.73 million bucks in all. Worldcoin has been buzzing for quite a while now, not just for its all-but-audacious biometric model, but also for its star-studded cast of crypto luminaries. Even so, to the extent Worldcoin scales at all, it has to be considered a “win” for the purse—much more so than with the other coins mentioned above. After the tokens priced at a premium, the investor dove down to “affordable” purchases and snagged a hefty amount of GAME. That’s 6.47 million tokens on an average price of 0.04 dollars “per” token. Total cash outlay came to about 299,000 dollars. While the value of GAME may be on the low end, the number of tokens purchased is impressive and suggests that this whale has a strong conviction on some upside potential. Completing the shopping spree was a smaller, yet still significant, purchase of COOKIE—a lesser-known but emerging token in the meme or micro-cap segment. The wallet acquired 303,574 COOKIE tokens for 40,700 dollars, averaging about 0.13 dollars per token. While speculative in nature, tokens like COOKIE have been known to deliver outsized returns in short bursts, and it’s possible the whale sees this as a calculated bet on something that might deliver 100X as much back in return. In total, the wallet splashed out about 4.73 million bucks among four different assets—not chump change, even in today’s altcoin market. But what’s most interesting is where those funds went and how they were allocated. The largest investment was in Worldcoin (WLD), a token associated with a project whose vision is definitely expansive (and somewhat controversial; more on that in a sec). Right behind WLD is the riskier, much less known, and far more volatile project called COOKIE. Market watchers are already abuzz about this activity, with many traders now keeping an eye on the wallet’s future moves for sentiment signals related to these tokens. And large-scale, diversified purchases like this one could also be seen as influencing the next short-term price moves in various tokens, especially those with smaller market caps where a single buy can dramatically shift order books. Whether the recent buying will pay off is yet to be seen, but there’s no denying that this whale is going for diversification and striking big in a market where the right narrative and use case can turn a modest investment into a home run.

The company’s head of Asia, Jiayin Xie, said on X that legal letters had been sent to the accounts, which it believes were operated by a professional arbitrage group. Bitget, which is headquartered in Victoria, Seychelles, said it plans to return any recovered funds to users through an airdrop. The incident unfolded when VOXEL, the token associated with the Polygon -based game Voxie Tactics, saw an extraordinary spike in trading volume last week. At one point, VOXEL’s trading volume briefly exceeded that of Bitcoin . VOXEL’s Sudden Spike Prompts Bitget to Investigate Trading Irregularities On April 20, VOXEL surged by more than 200% in just 30 minutes on Bitget, climbing to $0.1645 before retreating to $0.09131, still around 40% higher than its earlier price. The cryptocurrency exchange Bitget said it would issue eight lawyers' letters, saying they were the main instigators of the VOXEL incident and had gained more than $20 million from it. Bitget will distribute 100% of the recovered funds to platform users in the form of airdrops.… https://t.co/idxkaqbk3k — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 27, 2025 Bitget flagged the abnormal activity in VOXEL/ USDT perpetual futures trading shortly after it occurred. Soon after, the exchange noted suspicious volumes and wild price swings. As a result, it moved quickly to suspend certain accounts from trading, depositing, and withdrawing. Although Bitget claims that most users were not affected, it has yet to disclose who was behind the activity. Moreover, it remains unclear whether internal technical flaws contributed to the situation. Traders Question Bitget’s Systems After VOXEL Trading Turmoil The crypto sector has witnessed several high-profile exploits in recent years. Hackers and market manipulators have often exploited weak liquidity, smart contract bugs or flawed trading algorithms. As a result, security concerns across exchanges have continued to grow. In Bitget’s case, some traders have suggested that the platform’s market-making technology may have malfunctioned. However, no official explanation has been confirmed yet. Following the incident, comparisons quickly surfaced online. Some users likened Bitget’s actions to casinos suing players for winning. Nevertheless, Bitget maintains that the accounts in question engaged in manipulation, not legitimate trading. The exchange said it will publish a full report on the VOXEL incident soon. Meanwhile, the eight targeted accounts remain suspended as legal proceedings move forward.

SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce: US Crypto Regulation Feels Like Playing 'The Floor is Lava' in the Dark At the SEC’s ”Know Your Custodian” roundtable on April 25, SEC Commissioner and head of the agency’s crypto task force, Hester Peirce , delivered a vivid analogy to describe the current regulatory landscape facing US financial firms engaging with cryptocurrency: it’s like playing a game of ”the floor is lava” — but without any light. Peirce explained that navigating crypto regulations today means firms must hop from one uncertain legal position to another, all while avoiding direct contact with crypto assets themselves — which she likened to ”burning legal lava.” “It is time that we find a way to end this game. We need to turn on the lights and build some walkways over the lava pit,” Peirce urged, calling for a clearer regulatory framework that would allow financial institutions to engage more openly with the rapidly evolving digital asset sector. Navigating in the Dark Peirce detailed how SEC-registered entities — such as investment advisers, broker-dealers, and custodians — are often left uncertain about how to handle crypto assets. Firms are unsure whether a given token constitutes a security, which custodians meet federal qualifications, and whether participation in activities like staking or exercising governance rights could inadvertently trigger regulatory breaches. This regulatory fog, according to Peirce, is choking innovation and hampering the development of a robust, transparent crypto market in the United States. Firms are increasingly forced to operate with extreme caution, avoiding direct custody of crypto assets altogether, which in turn restricts the liquidity and maturity of US-based crypto markets. Peirce was not alone in voicing concern. SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda echoed her sentiment, stressing that as more registrants seek to work with crypto assets, it’s critical they have access to qualified custodians that meet all legal and regulatory requirements. Uyeda proposed that the SEC should consider permitting advisers to use state-chartered limited-purpose trust companies, which are already authorized to hold crypto assets, as qualified custodians. He argued that broadening access to compliant custodial options could offer some much-needed clarity and operational support to firms navigating the sector. The inability of brokers and Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) to custody crypto assets under the current rules, Uyeda warned, could stifle the development of a healthy secondary market for digital assets in the United States. A New Direction Under Chair Paul Atkins The roundtable also marked an important moment for the newly sworn-in SEC Chair, Paul Atkins, who laid out a notably different vision from that of his predecessor, Gary Gensler. Atkins, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, stated that he expects blockchain technology to deliver ”huge benefits” through increased efficiency, greater risk mitigation, enhanced transparency, and reduced costs across the financial system. Importantly, Atkins pledged to focus the SEC’s energy on crafting ”clear regulatory rules of the road” for digital assets — a commitment that many in the crypto community have long been hoping for. Without directly criticizing Gensler, Atkins made it clear that the previous regulatory approach had contributed to significant confusion and uncertainty in the market. “I look forward to engaging with market participants and working with colleagues in President Trump’s administration and Congress to establish a rational, fit-for-purpose framework for crypto assets,” Atkins said. Peirce’s metaphor resonated widely because it captures what many market participants have long complained about: the absence of coherent and accessible guidelines. Crypto firms, investment funds, custodians, and trading platforms are often left guessing about how to operate within the law, while enforcement actions against the industry mount. Calls for regulatory reform have grown louder as the United States risks falling behind other jurisdictions — such as the European Union, with its MiCA framework, or countries like Singapore and the UAE — that have adopted clearer and more supportive digital asset regulations. If Atkins, Peirce, and Uyeda succeed in pushing through more practical reforms, it could mark a major turning point for crypto in America. The prospect of regulatory clarity would likely unlock new levels of institutional adoption, investment, and innovation within the sector. For now, however, Peirce’s warning remains clear: unless US regulators build structured ”walkways” across the legal lava pits, the nation’s financial firms will continue to stumble in the dark, risking not only their own survival but also America's future leadership in blockchain and digital finance. Senator Jon Ossoff Calls for Impeachment Proceedings Against President Trump Over Private Meme Coin Dinner In other crypto news, US Senator Jon Ossoff has thrown his support behind launching impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, citing a growing controversy over Trump’s association with the Official Trump meme coin and a private dinner event tied to its holders. Speaking during an April 25 town hall in Georgia, where he is running for reelection, Ossoff said Trump’s actions clearly meet the standard for an impeachable offense. “I mean, I saw just 48 hours ago, he is granting audiences to people who buy his meme coin,” Ossoff said, according to a report by NBC News. “When the sitting president of the United States is selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him, there is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense.” While expressing strong support for impeachment proceedings, Ossoff acknowledged the political reality that such action is unlikely to succeed unless the Democratic Party regains control of Congress during the 2026 midterm elections. Republicans currently hold majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Dinner That Sparked a Political Firestorm The controversy centers around the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme coin, a cryptocurrency project directly tied to Trump's personal brand. On April 23, the TRUMP meme coin website announced plans for an exclusive dinner with President Trump at his Washington, D.C. golf club, inviting the top 220 holders of the TRUMP token to attend. TRUMP holders can register to dine with the US President (Source: gettrumpmemes.com) A leaderboard tracking the largest TRUMP wallets was published alongside the announcement, with a registration link for eligible holders. The site noted that participants would need to pass a background check, could not be from a Know Your Customer (KYC) watchlist country, and would not be allowed to bring guests. Following the announcement, the price of the TRUMP token surged by over 50%, according to CoinMarketCap data — further intensifying concerns that the president was personally profiting from the event. Social media speculation quickly emerged suggesting that a TRUMP holder would need to own at least $300,000 worth of the token to secure an invitation. However, the TRUMP team denied those claims on April 25, clarifying that the threshold was based on a curated leaderboard rather than raw blockchain data, which includes locked tokens, exchange wallets, and non-participating addresses. Still, the controversy over selling direct access to the sitting president for crypto holdings has not subsided. Legal experts have sounded alarms about the potential conflicts of interest created by Trump's cryptocurrency activities, including not just the TRUMP meme coin but also his involvement in World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol affiliated with his brand. “Within just a couple of days of him taking office, he’s signed a number of executive orders that are significantly going to affect the way that our crypto and digital assets industry works,” said Charlyn Ho, a partner at the law firm Rikka, in a February interview. “So if he has a personal pecuniary benefit arising from his own policies, that’s a conflict of interest.” Ho and other legal scholars warn that Trump's direct financial involvement in cryptocurrency projects that could be influenced by federal policy presents unprecedented ethical challenges for the presidency. The concerns are amplified by the fact that Trump’s executive orders in the early days of his new term have already had notable impacts on the crypto sector, including proposed changes to digital asset taxation, decentralized finance regulations, and stablecoin oversight. A Brewing Battle Ahead of the 2026 Midterms Senator Ossoff’s town hall comments suggest that Democrats may increasingly focus on Trump’s crypto-related activities as a potential campaign issue ahead of the 2026 midterms. With control of Congress hanging in the balance, Democrats hope to position Trump’s personal financial dealings as a symbol of broader ethical and governance failures. Despite these criticisms, Trump's political base remains fiercely loyal, and his embrace of emerging technologies like cryptocurrency has been praised by some conservative and libertarian voters seeking alternatives to traditional financial institutions. Still, Ossoff’s comments signal that the president’s blending of official duties with personal crypto ventures is unlikely to fade quietly. As legal experts, ethics watchdogs, and political opponents continue to scrutinize the administration’s entanglements with the crypto industry, the stage appears set for a fierce political and legal battle that could shape the remainder of Trump’s presidency — and the future of digital asset regulation in the United States.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-28 05:00:00

Trading volumes remained low as markets around the region paused to assess the latest signals from Washington and Beijing. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index rose 0.1% to close at 21,995.82. On the mainland, Shanghai’s Composite Index was nearly flat at 3,294.02. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 added 0.4%, finishing at 35,863.60, and South Korea’s Kospi edged up 0.1% to 2,5549.19. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.8%, ending at 8,028.20, and Taiwan’s Taiex advanced 0.6%. U.S. stock futures drifted lower, while oil prices held near flat, as uncertainty persisted over whether formal talks on tariff cuts would take place. President Trump said he was “actively negotiating” with Chinese officials over duties, but Chinese authorities and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both maintained that no direct discussions have begun. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index. Source: Google Finance The mixed performance in Asia came after Wall Street closed with gains on Friday, as Big Tech stocks powered a late rally. The S&P 500 rose 0.7% to 5,525.21, extending a three-day rebound that pulled it within 10.1% of its record high earlier this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite led U.S. benchmarks higher with a 1.3% advance to 17,382.94, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up 0.1% to 40,113.50. Alphabet shares climbed 1.7% in their first session after Google’s parent company said late Thursday that first-quarter profit jumped 50% from a year earlier, well above analysts’ forecasts. Nvidia also contributed to the S&P 500’s gain, rising 4.3% after reporting better-than-expected results and upbeat guidance for its chip business. Trump says he’s on track to finalize new trade agreements President Trump told reporters at the White House that he remained on track to finalize several new trade agreements in the coming weeks, but he also described it as “physically impossible” to complete all the meetings he would like to hold. His back-and-forth signals on tariffs have left businesses scrambling to adjust supply chains and temper spending plans amid the threat of sudden policy shifts. On Friday, roughly 60% of S&P 500 stocks fell, including Eastman Chemical, which tumbled 6.2% after issuing a profit forecast for the spring that came in below analysts’ estimates. A growing number of companies across multiple industries have pointed to the uncertainty around tariffs as a key reason for pulling back on financial guidance for the year ahead. Investors hope that if Trump rolls back some of his tougher tariffs on imports, he may stave off the recession many see as a likely outcome of an extended trade war. Yet the repeated cycle of threats may be prompting both households and businesses to hold off on big purchases and postpone long-term investments. A report from the University of Michigan on Friday showed that U.S. consumer sentiment fell in April, though not as steeply as economists had feared. Its gauge of expectations for future conditions dropped 32% since January, marking the largest three-month decline in percentage terms since the 1990 recession. In commodity markets on Monday, U.S. benchmark crude for June delivery fell 25 cents to $63.27 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard for oil prices, slipped 24 cents to $66.04 a barrel. Currency moves were modest in early Asian trade. The U.S. dollar rose to 143.62 Japanese yen from 143.60 yen, while the euro dipped to $1.1358 from $1.1366. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

HTX Research has announced the release of its latest report,“ Sonic: A Model for the New DeFi Paradigm ” The report dives into the details of the Sonic public chain. By fully supporting EVM while rebuilding its virtual machine, storage engine, and consensus mechanism, Sonic achieves performance metrics that redefine industry standards: over 2,000 TPS, 0.7-second transaction finality, and a cost of $0.0001 per transaction. This performance surpasses most Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions, representing a significant advancement in public chain infrastructure and ushering in a “sub-second era.” Sonic’s Evolution: 2000+ TPS, 0.7s Confirmation, Near-Zero Fees The Fantom Opera blockchain, initially recognized for its speed and throughput as a high-performance aDAG-based Layer 1 solution, encountered scalability limitations as its ecosystem expanded. Its traditional EVM architecture struggled with bloated state storage, slow node synchronization, and execution bottlenecks. To overcome these challenges without resorting to sharding or Layer 2 solutions, Fantom developed Sonic — a fundamental redesign engineered to deliver a significant performance leap. Sonic Labs, a new team led by CEO Michael Kong, CTO Andre Cronje (founder of Yearn Finance), and Chief Research Officer Bernhard Scholz, dedicated two and a half years to the redesign of Fantom’s virtual machine, storage, and consensus. They built Sonic, a new, independent EVM-compatible chain capable of processing over 2,000 TPS, achieving 0.7-second finality, and executing transactions at a cost of $0.0001. It also improves storage efficiency by 90% and reduces node synchronization time from weeks to under two days. Technical Innovations Driving Sonic’s Performance Sonic’s enhanced performance is underpinned by three core technological advancements: SonicVM: A newly developed virtual machine fully compatible with the EVM, SonicVM optimizes computationally intensive operations like SHA3 hashing, pre-analyzes jump instructions, delivers significantly faster execution, and supports high throughput. SonicDB : Achieving nearly 90% data compression, SonicDB uses a layered storage strategy that splits the blockchain state into two databases: LiveDB for the current global state and ArchiveDB for historical blocks and states. This reduces node requirements and enhances network resilience through greater decentralization. Sonic Gateway : Functioning like an “L2-like” bridging solution to Ethereum, it uses a batch processing mechanism that strikes a balance between security and efficiency, enabling seamless two-way asset transfers and ecosystem access. Sonic Tokenomics: Dual Incentives for Developers and Users Sonic has launched its native token, $S, which is exchangeable with FTM at a 1:1 ratio. The $S token powers the Sonic ecosystem through gas fee payments, staking, and governance voting.Key features include: ● Gas Fee Monetization (FeeM) Mechanism: Developers can earn up to 90% of transaction fees, incentivizing ecosystem growth. Non-FeeM applications will burn 50% of fees to counter inflation. ● Points-Based Reward Mechanism: Users earn points (Passive/Activity Points and Gems) by holding $S, participating in DeFi activities, or interacting with the ecosystem. These points are redeemable for a total of 200 million $S, promoting a sustainable “use-to-mine” loop. Stablecoin Ecosystem: Nested Yield and Resilient Growth Defying market trends in 2025, Sonic’s on-chain Total Value Locked (TVL) surged by over 500%, with the total stablecoin supply surpassing $260 million. This growth is driven by sophisticated high-leverage yield mechanisms. ● Silo v2 Loop Lending: Use staked S tokens to borrow stablecoins, achieving up to 20x exposure to capture combined incentives alongside stable yield spreads. ● Euler + Rings Protocol Combo: Deposit USDC to mint scUSD, then use leverage to potentially achieve up to 10x yield, along with Sonic points and protocol rewards. ● Shadow DEX Liquidity Provision for Rewards : By facilitating trading activity, particularly with the S/stS pair on Shadow, users can earn up to 169% APY and a share of trading fees. Looking ahead, the ecosystem will incorporate Real World Asset (RWA) yields and off-chain payment solutions to create a sustainable and widely used stablecoin ecosystem backed by compliant assets and real-world applications. Sonic’s Innovations in DeFi Infrastructure: Adaptive AMM and Dynamic Risk Control Sonic’s decentralized exchange (DEX), FlyingTulip, designed by Andre Cronje, integrates trading, lending, and leverage with two key innovations: – Adaptive AMM Curve: By combining Curve V2’s liquidity aggregation with oracle-driven volatility monitoring, FlyingTulip’s AMM dynamically adjusts its shape. It offers low slippage in stable markets (similar to a constant sum curve) and prevents liquidity issues in volatile markets (similar to a constant product curve), resulting in a 42% reduction in impermanent loss and an 85% improvement in capital efficiency. – Dynamic LTV Model: Inspired by Curve’s LLAMMA, FlyingTulip’s lending platform adjusts Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios in real time based on market volatility. For example, ETH borrowing limits can decrease from 80% in stable conditions to 50% during periods of high volatility, enhancing system stability. Conclusion: Sonic – Leading the Charge in DeFi 2.0 Sonic’s high performance, nested yields, and accessibility position it for rapid growth, with the potential to exceed $2B TVL and a multi-billion $S token market cap within a year. More importantly, Sonic is championing an “efficiency revolution” in blockchain design—prioritizing performance and capital efficiency to attract liquidity. The report identifies technical challenges, including the adaptive AMM’s reliance on external oracles, which introduces potential vulnerabilities. . Furthermore, the inherent risks of high-leverage strategies in volatile markets necessitate the use of hedging instruments, such as short perpetual futures, to mitigate potential liquidations. From a broader view, Sonic is well-positioned to lead the expected 2025 DeFi resurgence. Its thriving stablecoin ecosystem boosts the value of both the $S token and the network. Even in a bear market, Sonic demonstrates the potential for DeFi to establish resilient “yield havens” through innovation and performance. With its nested yields, developer-focused incentives, and efficient infrastructure, Sonic provides a model for the industry. The integration of RWAs and payment tools could place Sonic as a critical bridge between on-chain yields and real-world utility, driving DeFi toward mass adoption For full report, please visit: https://square.htx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HTX-Research-Latest-Report-.pdf About HTX Research HTX Research is the dedicated research arm of HTX Group, responsible for conducting in-depth analyses, producing comprehensive reports, and delivering expert evaluations across a broad spectrum of topics, including cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and emerging market trends.

Americans are turning against his massive efforts to reshape the government, and the numbers show it clearly without any room for spin. A new set of polls dropped Sunday, showing that a majority of Americans disapprove of how Trump is handling the presidency. His approval rating is sliding between 39% and 45%, depending on which poll you look at. The Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll pinned him at 39%, the CNN/SSRS poll gave him 41%, and the NBC News Stay Tuned poll pushed it to 45%. No matter which number he wants to cling to, it’s still the worst 100-day showing for any first-term president since World War II ended. The bad news keeps stacking. Trump rolled back into the White House in January with a little boost in his favorability. That’s gone. His approval is sinking fast as people grow more doubtful about the way he’s trying to change everything at once. Source: Washington Post Trump’s promises haven’t turned into wins, and Americans are showing less patience every day. His so-called strong point — the economy — is also taking a beating. He made handling the economy the centerpiece of his 2024 comeback run, but now, voters are pulling away. The CNN/SSRS poll said only 52% of adults still trust him with the economy, which is a serious 13-point drop from December. That’s not the kind of number a sitting president wants flashing all over the media during an election year. The economic fear is real. The Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll said a huge 72% of Americans believe it’s either “very” or “somewhat” likely that Trump’s economic plans are about to push the country into a recession soon. People are watching their wallets, and Trump’s promises aren’t enough to settle them down. Trade isn’t helping him either. Trump’s sweeping tariffs have caused serious problems in the financial markets. The NBC News Stay Tuned poll said that 61% of Americans disapprove of how he’s handling trade and tariffs. Inflation is crushing people, too, and 60% say they’re not happy with the way he’s dealing with the rising cost of living. Trump built his comeback campaign around claiming he would fix these exact problems, and now voters are saying he’s only making things worse. Independent voters hammer Trump as partisan gap widens Immigration, another big issue Trump loves to talk about, is falling apart in the polls, too. The CNN/SSRS poll said only 45% of Americans now approve of how he’s handling immigration. That’s a sharp fall from the 60% who gave him a thumbs-up back in December. Support for Trump still follows party lines, as the majority of Republicans are sticking by him. Nearly all Democrats are also not buying it at all and are firmly against him, which is no surprise at all. But the real damage is showing up with independents, the voters who don’t play for either team. Trump barely lost independents last November. Now, he’s losing them by even bigger margins. The Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found that 58% of independents disapprove of how Trump is running the country. These are the voters who could swing an election, and right now, they’re moving further away from him. The polls paint a brutal picture for Trump. His first 100 days are not a story of momentum or success. They are a red flashing warning sign that he’s losing ground where he can’t afford to lose it. He walked into office promising to change everything. But after three months, what Americans see is a president running out of goodwill, fast. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

According to the company’s assessments, this decline in selling pressure from miners has historically often been followed by periods of sideways consolidation or price declines. Alphractal's statement noted that low selling pressure rarely produces positive effects, however, positive reactions are observed more often in the following periods: December 2012 September 2013 A few months into 2016 July 2021 In most cases, Bitcoin continued to trade sideways or in price declines. In April 2025, Hash Rate (processing power) reached an all-time high, then fell, and a slight recovery was seen recently. This movement is similar to what happened in April 2021. The company also states that April 14, 2021 and April 14, 2023 stand out as local peaks for Bitcoin, making April a critical period for mining.

It is stated that the current miner selling pressure remains low, which is an indication of miners wisely selling their Bitcoins at the beginning of 2025. However, if a capitulation process begins in the mining sector, a new wave of selling pressure may emerge.

The Shenzhen-based Huawei is poised to start testing a new AI chip called the Ascend 910D, and has approached local tech firms, which are slated to receive the first batch of sample chips by late May, The Wall Street Journal reported on April 27, citing people familiar with the matter. The development is still at an early stage, and a series of tests will be needed to assess the chip’s performance and get it ready for customers. Huawei is pinning hopes on its latest Ascend AI processor being more powerful than Nvidia’s H100 chip, which was used for AI training in 2022. Huawei is also poised to ship more than 800,000 earlier model Ascend 910B and 910C chips to customers, including state-owned telecoms operators and private AI developers such as TikTok parent ByteDance. Beijing has also reportedly encouraged Chinese AI developers to increase purchases of domestic chips as trade tensions between China and the US escalate. In mid-April, Nvidia stated that it was expecting around $5.5 billion in charges associated with its AI chip inventory due to significant export restrictions imposed by the US government affecting its business with China. The Trump administration added Nvidia’s H20 chip, its most powerful processor that could be sold to China, to a growing list of semiconductors restricted for sale to the country. Some key components for AI chips, such as the latest high-bandwidth memory units, have also been restricted for export to China by the US. Huawei is focusing on building more efficient and faster systems, such as CloudMatrix 384 , a computing system unveiled in April, connecting Ascend 910C chips. This would leverage their chip arrays and use brute force rather than making individual processors more powerful. China seeks self-reliance on AI Reuters reported on April 26, citing state media reports, that Chinese President Xi Jinping pledged “self-reliance and self-strengthening” to develop AI in the country. “We must recognise the gaps and redouble our efforts to comprehensively advance technological innovation, industrial development, and AI-empowered applications,"" Xi said at a Politburo meeting study session on April 25.

The exchange’s head of Asia, Jiayin Xie, revealed in an Apr. 27 post on X that Bitget would issue eight legal letters, targeting the individuals suspected of improperly gaining more than $20 million from the incident. Xie noted that the exchange plans to distribute 100% of any recovered funds from the legal proceedings to platform users through airdrops. 看到有社区在讨论BG发出的律师函，我核实后，想跟大家澄清几个细节： 1、Bitget 将陆续发出8份律师函。 2、这8个账户疑似相关联的专业羊毛利益集团，是导致本次VOXEL事件的主要始作俑者，并从中不当得利超过2000万美金。 3、追回的资金，Bitget 将100% 以空投形式发放给平台用户！… — 谢家印 (@xiejiayinBitget) April 27, 2025 He assured the community that users who traded VOXEL between 16:00 and 16:30 on Apr. 20 but had already withdrawn their funds, would not face any repercussions. These accounts have been restored, and no further responsibility will be pursued against them. In addition, Xie expressed regret for any inconvenience caused and stated that a full report would be made available shortly to give a better picture of the situation.

During this price spike, which spanned from $0.125 to roughly $0.1645, trades seemed to be executed without the usual order book process. The incident was caused by a suspected bug in Bitget’s market-making bot, which resulted in rapid price swings and instant order fills that some traders took advantage of to make huge profits. In response, Bitget paused trading on the VOXEL/USDT contract and froze several accounts involved in the unusual trading activity. Bitget also announced it would roll back irregular trades and compensate users who incurred losses during the incident. While the platform has assured users that the incident wasn’t due to an internal failure or exploit, it has not revealed the identities of those responsible. Meanwhile, comparisons have been drawn to a March price manipulation incident on Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) involving the JELLY token.

While some believe the AI crypto sector is no longer exciting, the truth is that artificial intelligence (AI) projects, especially AI agents, might just be getting started again. The Rise and Fall of AI Crypto AI crypto projects saw massive growth toward the end of 2024, with the market value hitting $70 billion in December. But soon after, things took a turn. The AI crypto market dropped sharply to around $24 billion. This made many investors lose interest, especially as other crypto sectors also slowed down due to market uncertainty. However, in the past week, there’s been a positive shift. The market cap for AI crypto has bounced back to around $31 billion. Although altcoins haven’t fully recovered yet, experts believe this could be a good time to start paying attention. Why AI Agents Still Have Potential AI agents — special crypto tools powered by artificial intelligence — were a huge part of the earlier AI craze. Even though many of these projects fell in value, some have continued developing behind the scenes. The idea is simple: in crypto, the best time to invest is usually when nobody else is talking about it. For example, projects like Virtuals Protocol have started showing signs of life again. In just the past week, Virtuals’ price has jumped by over 60%. This project aims to make it easy to launch and monetize AI agents and connect them within its ecosystem. Although it once hit $4.50 in January, it’s now trading under $1, showing how far it’s fallen — and how much room it might have to grow again. Other AI Coins to Watch Two other AI-related coins catching attention are AIXBT and Tric: AIXBT: Once a popular AI agent platform for crypto research and analysis, it’s recently gained around 70% in a week. While it’s still far from its all-time high, some believe it has the potential to recover as interest in AI agents returns. TRAC: A similar platform on the Solana blockchain, TRAC had a massive run-up before crashing. It now sits at a very low market value of $3 million, compared to its previous $100 million peak. While risky, small market cap coins like this sometimes offer big returns — but also come with high risks.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 05:33:03

Despite the concerns about Strategy’s debt-fueled buying spree, experts like Saifedean Ammous argue that such concentration of Bitcoin ownership will not threaten the protocol itself, as institutions have no incentive to alter Bitcoin’s rules. Meanwhile, the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin treasuries is strengthening the path toward hyperbitcoinization, a future where Bitcoin overtakes fiat as dominant global money. Blockstream CEO Adam Back described this shift as a rational arbitrage of fiat’s declining value. Governments like El Salvador also still continue their quiet Bitcoin accumulation, navigating international agreements with flexibility. Altogether, these trends mean that Bitcoin’s role in global finance is growing very quickly and irreversibly. Bitcoin Could Get Much Scarcer Michael Saylor’s company, Strategy, is effectively “synthetically halving Bitcoin” by buying more than half of all newly mined BTC each month. This is according to Adam Livingston , a Bitcoin analyst and author of The Bitcoin Age and The Great Harvest. Miners currently produce around 450 BTC daily, which totals roughly 13,500 BTC per month, yet Strategy acquired an astonishing 379,800 BTC over the past six months. This means the firm purchased around 2,087 BTC per day, which is greatly exceeding the global daily miner output. Livingston explained that this level of accumulation will make Bitcoin dramatically scarcer, and could push the asset into an environment where access will require paying large premiums. As a result, lending against Bitcoin will become increasingly expensive, borrowing BTC will be a luxury reserved for major corporations and nation-states, and Strategy will have a dominant influence over Bitcoin’s cost of capital. Livingston’s prediction points to an impending Bitcoin supply crunch, and suggests that if Strategy maintains this acquisition pace while institutional and retail demand grows, Bitcoin prices could soar much higher. Despite the concerns over the sustainability of Strategy’s debt-fueled Bitcoin purchases , especially if a prolonged bear market emerges, some Bitcoin advocates argue that Strategy’s dominance is not a threat to the protocol itself. Saifedean Ammous , economist and author of The Bitcoin Standard, recently said that even if institutions like Strategy and BlackRock hold large portions of Bitcoin’s supply, they will have no incentive to manipulate the network’s rules, like increasing the maximum supply. Doing so will devalue their holdings, which ultimately belong to shareholders who could move their investments elsewhere. Thus, while Strategy’s aggressive accumulation strategy is reshaping Bitcoin’s financial landscape, many believe it only strengthens Bitcoin’s fundamental scarcity rather than undermining its decentralized ethos. Bitcoin Treasuries Are Fueling Hyperbitcoinization Investment firms with Bitcoin-focused treasury strategies are increasingly front-running global Bitcoin adoption , and could potentially pave the way for the world’s first cryptocurrency to reach a $200 trillion market capitalization in the next decade. Institutions and governments are beginning to recognize Bitcoin’s unique monetary properties, according to Blockstream CEO and Hashcash inventor Adam Back. In an April 26 post, Back described companies like Strategy as engaging in a logical and sustainable arbitrage of the gap between the current fiat world and a Bitcoin-driven future, a move scalable enough for most major listed companies to transition their treasuries to Bitcoin. The phenomenon is known as hyperbitcoinization , where Bitcoin replaces fiat currencies as the dominant global money, and it is being fueled by Bitcoin’s consistent outpacing of fiat money inflation. Back explained that this is not a temporary trend but a rational and sustainable arbitrage play, driven by Bitcoin's superior long-term price appreciation over inflation and interest rates across four-year periods. His comments were made after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a national Bitcoin reserve sourced from government-seized BTC. Momentum for corporate Bitcoin accumulation is still growing. Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin holder , already generated over $5.1 billion in profit from its Bitcoin treasury since the beginning of 2025, according to co-founder Michael Saylor. Japanese investment firm Metaplanet , dubbed ”Asia’s MicroStrategy,” also embraced this approach and even surpassed 5,000 BTC in holdings on April 24 and set a goal of reaching 21,000 BTC by 2026. Top companies that hold Bitcoin (Source: BitBo ) Meanwhile, the regulatory landscape in the United States is becoming a lot more favorable. The Federal Reserve’s withdrawal of its 2022 guidance discouraging banks from engaging with cryptocurrency opened the door for even more institutional participation. Michael Saylor said that banks are now free to support Bitcoin. Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev, agreed with this, and pointed out that banks will now be supervised through normal regulatory processes. This means that there is a much more open environment for digital asset integration. As financial institutions and corporations continue to move into Bitcoin, the foundation for hyperbitcoinization seems to be strengthening. El Salvador Quietly Continues Bitcoin Buying Certain countries are also making sure to stock up on Bitcoin. El Salvador, the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, is still quietly accumulating Bitcoin despite comments from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) suggesting otherwise. In the seven days leading up to April 27, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office recorded the acquisition of 7 Bitcoin, which is valued at over $650,000. During an April 26 press briefing , Rodrigo Valdes, the director of the IMF’s Western Hemisphere Department, stated that El Salvador is still complying with its commitment under an IMF agreement to halt Bitcoin accumulation by the government’s fiscal sector. El Salvador’s BTC holdings changes (Source: Bitcoin Office ) Valdes explained that the IMF’s program with El Salvador is focused not on Bitcoin but on broader structural reforms, including governance and transparency. This program was part of a $1.4 billion loan deal that was struck in December of 2024, which required El Salvador to stop treating Bitcoin as legal tender and cease government-led Bitcoin purchases. However, there appears to be some flexibility in the interpretation of the agreement. According to blockchain adviser and author Anndy Lian , the ”flexible interpretation” could mean that Bitcoin purchases are being conducted through non-governmental or reclassified entities, which allows the country to technically remain compliant with IMF conditions. Lian pointed out that this approach makes it possible for El Salvador to preserve its Bitcoin-friendly reputation while still securing vital IMF funding needed to manage public debt and financial reserves. El Salvador’s strategy shed some light on the broader tension between financial innovation and traditional international economic frameworks. Lian suggested that the country’s experience provides important lessons for other nations considering crypto adoption, particularly regarding the need for strong regulatory systems and the ability to balance domestic innovation with global financial expectations.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-28 05:37:00

Trump earned a Bachelor of science in economics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. Trump won the 2016 presidential election as the Republican Party nominee against Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton while losing the popular vote. As president, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, diverted military funding toward building a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border, and implemented a family separation policy. Trump has remained a prominent figure in the Republican Party and is considered a likely candidate for the 2024 presidential election President hinted that Americans could soon see a dramatic shift in how the government is funded, possibly eliminating federal income taxes. In a Truth Social post on April 27 , Trump suggested that once his new Trump Tariff policies on imported goods are fully in place, income taxes could be “substantially reduced,” especially for those earning under $200,000 a year. Trump introduced a new concept called the “External Revenue Service,” proposing that tariffs, rather than income taxes, could support the government. He described it as a return to an earlier model, pointing to the 19th-century Gilded Age when the U.S. operated without an income tax. Could Lower Taxes Boost Investments and Crypto? Lower income taxes could leave Americans with more disposable income, potentially sparking increased investment in stocks, real estate, and cryptocurrencies . Market watchers note that extra take-home pay often translates into higher consumer spending and asset growth. However, analysts caution that the broader economic impact — especially against the backdrop of Fed rate cuts and fluctuating markets — will ultimately determine whether the plan would fuel major investment surges. Skepticism Grows Over Lack of Details This isn’t the first time Trump has floated the idea. He previously mentioned the concept during a 2024 appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience. Critics argue that Trump has yet to provide a clear roadmap on how a tariff-funded government would work, especially at current spending levels. Research from Dancing Numbers suggests eliminating income taxes could save the average American more than $134,000 over a lifetime, with even greater savings if payroll taxes are removed. Still, experts warn that relying solely on tariffs might not generate enough revenue without significant changes to federal spending. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick , a strong supporter of Trump’s tariff strategy, has also advocated for scrapping the IRS. In January 2025, Lutnick pointed to the early 1900s, when tariffs helped make America the world’s richest country, arguing that protecting domestic workers through Trump Tariff measures could once again boost national wealth. New Tax Proposals Emerge Financial strategist Bert Dohmen has pitched additional tax ideas for Trump to consider. He proposes exempting seniors over the age of 76 who operate small businesses from income taxes, arguing that the administrative burden is too high for older entrepreneurs. Dohmen also recommends offering tax incentives for families, suggesting a 10% tax exemption per child, capped at a 50% total reduction, to encourage higher birth rates — a growing concern among industrialized nations. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump-Backed Crypto Project World Liberty Financial Partners with Pakistan for Full Crypto Legalization , Markets Wobble Amid Trump Tariff Uncertainty While Trump signed an executive order to introduce sweeping new tariffs earlier this month, frequent revisions and policy shifts have injected volatility into the markets.

No, Trump has proposed substantially reducing income taxes, especially for those earning under $200,000, by using tariffs to fund the government. He has not announced a full elimination of income taxes. What is Trump’s “External Revenue Service” idea? Trump’s “External Revenue Service” is a concept where government funding would primarily come from tariffs on imported goods rather than traditional income taxes. How could lower income taxes impact investments and crypto markets?

43891451,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=716805,1745818847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43891451.jpeg,China to dump its US Treasury holdings for Bitcoin and gold,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/china-us-treasuries-for-bitcoin-and-gold/,"China plans to dump a chunk of its US Treasury holdings and for Bitcoin and gold to protect itself from rising global tensions, according to an interview given to CNBC by Jay Jacobs, head of thematics and equity ETFs at BlackRock. Jacobs said central banks around the world have been pulling away from the US dollar for decades. He said that in the last three to four years, Bitcoin and gold have become the new favorites among the assets they are piling into. Jacobs said crypto is now moving separately from US tech stocks, even though tariffs and political fights have made crypto markets behave like stocks and bonds in the short term. He pointed out that Bitcoin doesn’t depend on economic growth, stability, or peace to rise. Jacobs said, “It thrives when there is more uncertainty,” which makes it different from traditional investments that need low risks and steady growth to perform. China builds bigger Bitcoin and gold positions The latest numbers show that China held $784.3 billion in US Treasuries by the end of February, based on the US Treasury Department’s data. China’s gold pile was worth around $229.6 billion at the end of March, the Economic Times reported on April 21. On top of that, China is sitting on 194,000 BTC, valued at about $18 billion, according to Bitbo’s Bitcoin Treasuries. Guy Cecala, executive chair at Inside Mortgage Finance, told CNBC that China has real power to shake the US markets. He said, “If China wanted to hit us hard, they could unload Treasuries. Is that a threat? Sure it is.” Cecala said Treasury securities are the foundation of US government financing, so any big sell-off would hit the system hard. China also owns a massive amount of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), part of the $1.32 trillion in US MBS owned by foreign countries, based on an analysis from Ginnie Mae. Besides China, big holders include Japan , Taiwan, and Canada . If China starts selling its MBS, and others follow, it could crush the MBS market and ripple across global finance. Some experts think China will hesitate because dumping MBS would hurt its own assets. Melissa Cohn, regional vice president of William Raveis Mortgage, told Newsweek that a large sell-off would wreck China’s remaining investments and could destabilize global currencies. Cohn added that China depends on keeping the renminbi (RMB) weaker than the US dollar to keep its exports cheaper and more attractive for American buyers. To do this, China has kept buying US debt for years. Mortgage rates face pressure from China’s strategy The MBS market heavily influences US mortgage rates. If China starts selling its MBS stash, prices would crash and mortgage rates would jump. Homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages would be some of the first to get hit. Eric Hagen, mortgage and specialty finance analyst at BTIG, told CNBC that “most investors are concerned that mortgage spreads would widen” if countries like China, Japan, or Canada decided to retaliate financially. As of April 17, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate stood at 6.83%, reported by Freddie Mac. That is already squeezing many American homeowners. If rates rise more because of an MBS dump, refinancing will be less attractive or even impossible for some. Refinancing would mean higher monthly payments instead of savings. First-time homebuyers would feel the blow, too. Higher mortgage rates would knock many buyers out of the market, and home sellers might stay on the sidelines, waiting for prices to recover. Higher rates also raise borrowers’ debt-to-income ratios, which could push banks to tighten lending rules even more. Lenders might demand higher credit scores or bigger down payments to reduce their risks. Jacobs said BlackRock believes that geopolitical fragmentation is the big driver behind these changes. He said Bitcoin is not just another asset but a direct result of a world that’s becoming more divided. While stocks and bonds need stability, crypto like Bitcoin feeds off the instability that China and other powers are preparing for. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Under the partnership, World Liberty will help the Council launch regulatory sandboxes to test blockchain-based products, expand stablecoin applications for remittances and trade, explore real-world asset tokenization, and assist with the growth of decentralized finance protocols, local news outlet Business Recorder reported on April 27. World Liberty founders Zach Witkoff, Zak Folkman and Chase Herro signed the letter in a recent meeting with the Council’s CEO Bilal bin Saqib, with Pakistan’s central bank governor, finance minister and IT secretary among those in attendance. Source: Pakistan Crypto Council Trump and his family backed World Liberty at the crypto lending and borrowing platform’s launch last year and they receive a cut of its profits. The Pakistan Crypto Council is a government-backed body that oversees crypto regulation and related initiatives aimed at driving adoption and attracting more foreign investment. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis ranked Pakistan ninth for crypto adoption last year, with an estimated 25 million active crypto users and $300 billion in annual crypto transactions. Pakistan is looking to capitalize on its young population, where roughly 60% are under 30, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said. “Pakistan’s youth and technology sector are our greatest assets. Through partnerships like this, we are opening new doors for investment, innovation, and global leadership in the blockchain economy.” Pakistan looks to balance pro-crypto innovation with regulation The three World Liberty founders recently met with former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao , who was recently appointed as an adviser to the Pakistan Crypto Council to assist the country on crypto regulation and innovation. Pakistan’s Federal Investigation Agency also proposed a crypto regulatory framework on April 10, which looks to address terrorism financing, money laundering, and Know Your Customer controls. Related: Pakistan Crypto Council proposes using excess energy for BTC mining FIA Director Sumera Azam said the framework is part of a broader effort to strike a “balance between technological advancement and national security imperatives.” The proposed framework is subject to legislative approval and input from crypto firms operating in the country, with an expected multi-phased rollout beginning in 2026. Pakistan’s new crypto-friendly approach contrasts sharply with its stance in May 2023, when former finance minister Aisha Ghaus Pasha stated the country would never legalize cryptocurrencies due to concerns over bypassing Financial Action Task Force regulations.

Feist introduced Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 9698 on April 27, aiming to increase the network’s gas limit by 100 times over the next two years, potentially enabling the Ethereum mainnet to handle up to 2,000 transactions per second (TPS). The proposal outlines a “deterministic gas limit growth schedule,” set to begin around June 1 at epoch 369017. Ethereum Proposal Plans 100x Gas Limit Increase Over Two Years Under this plan, the gas limit would grow tenfold gradually over approximately 164,250 epochs (about two years), followed by a final tenfold increase. This structured approach, Feist argues, would ensure a transparent and sustainable path for scaling, aligned with ongoing improvements in hardware and protocol efficiency. Currently, Ethereum’s gas limit stands at 36 million, following a recent increase from 30 million in February. Feist’s EIP suggests expanding this to 3.6 billion, allowing for roughly 6,000 transactions per block — a significant jump from today’s capacity. At present, Ethereum processes up to 20 TPS during periods dominated by simple transactions. How serious is Ethereum about scaling L1? Answer: Exponentially increase gas limit 100x over 4 years by @dankrad How: Clients sets default and automatically raise the gas limit every epoch (users can still override). 100x means: – 3.6B gas limit ~2000 TPS – 6000 tx per block https://t.co/3Wjb5EKKck — fabda.eth (@fabdarice) April 27, 2025 If implemented, this proposal could position Ethereum to better compete with high-throughput blockchains like Solana, which averages between 800 and 1,050 TPS, with a theoretical maximum of 65,000 TPS. However, Feist acknowledged potential challenges, noting that such rapid gas limit growth could strain under-optimized nodes and lead to longer block propagation times. Still, he emphasized that the gradual, epoch-based increases would give developers and node operators sufficient time to adjust. EIP-9698 is part of Ethereum’s broader push to enhance base-layer scalability, following years of reliance on layer-2 solutions. Critics argue that this layer-2 strategy has fragmented the ecosystem, creating isolated chains and complicating user experience due to limited interoperability. Meanwhile, Ethereum developers are also preparing for the Fusaka hard fork, which could test a fourfold gas limit increase under EIP-9678, potentially launching in late 2025. Before that, the Pectra upgrade is scheduled to go live in May, marking another step in Ethereum’s ongoing evolution. Ethereum Has ‘Huge Opportunity’ to Fix AI’s Centralization Problem Ethereum could play a key role in solving some of the most pressing problems facing artificial intelligence, according to Eric Connor, a former core developer of the blockchain. Earlier this month, Connor said Ethereum’s “biggest mainstream moment” could come through its integration with AI, as the sector struggles with centralization, opaque algorithms, and growing privacy concerns. “AI is plagued by black-box models, centralized data silos, and privacy pitfalls,” Connor noted, adding that Ethereum is uniquely positioned to address these issues. Ethereum has already shown the world trustless, programmable finance through DeFi and stablecoins. But its biggest mainstream moment is waiting in the wings with AI. AI is on a fast-track to reshape almost every aspect of our lives. But it’s plagued by black-box models,… — Eric Conner (@econoar) April 15, 2025 Last month, crypto venture capitalist Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures pointed to two key issues undermining Ether’s value: the rise of layer-2 (L2) scaling networks and unchecked token issuance. He argued that “greedy Eth L2s” are siphoning off value from Ethereum’s base layer while giving little back. He also criticized the Ethereum community’s acceptance of excessive token creation, claiming that “ETH was buried in an avalanche of its own tokens. Died by its own hand.” The post New Ethereum Proposal Could Boost Mainnet to 2,000 TPS, Says Researcher appeared first on Cryptonews .",Ethereum News|ETH|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|SOL|ZRX|FORKS,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-28 05:43:34

While Ripple (XRP) continues to lead in terms of institutional use cases, some altcoins under $0.08 are seeing serious attention for their special narratives and market setups. Here are four altcoins with the kind of entry points that could turn $250 into something big by 2025. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA) – #1 COIN ON TOP WATCHLISTS Right Now The crypto world is already noticing MAGACOIN FINANCE’s rise, having already accumulated over $6.9 million and counting. Investors are sold on the meme coin, with the token attracting them with its growth and rising momentum in the market. The early-stage rush has also attracted the attention of other users, establishing MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most-watched altcoins of 2025. As analysts continue to monitor its rise, it is becoming clear that the token is on the verge of a rise. 2. Ripple (XRP) – The Established Leader with Long-Term Utility Ripple remains one of the most trusted names in crypto, with XRP continuing to carry the cross-border transaction industry. The token has also become the first option for institutional usage. The token recently climbed past $2, with the move backed by the company’s recent global partnerships and clear regulatory framework. While XRP is no longer a secret, its potential to grow remains strong, especially as it continues to move into real-world financial infrastructure. 3. Sei (SEI) – A High-Speed Chain Built for Modern Traders Sei has been rising fast in the crypto market because it focuses on performance. It was designed to help decentralized applications and trading environments, using low latency and fast throughput–the kind of technology that developers and liquidity providers need. The technical edge has drawn SEI to traders that are betting on next-gen layer-1 ecosystems to be successful in a competitive DeFi landscape. 4. Uniswap (UNI) – The Trusted DeFi Protocol with Room to Expand Uniswap remains an important part of the decentralized exchange world. UNI has been improving in the sector, thanks to its proven use case and its developer’s focus on innovation. As decentralized trading continues to expand, UNI’s role is expected to grow further in the market. The consistent development, updates, and upcoming integrations make it one of the safest bets for profits in the market. Final Thoughts If you are looking for projects with substance, early availability, and the potential for rewards, then this list is a very good place to start. MAGACOIN finance, XRP, SEI, and UNI each offer the best path to long-term growth–whether you are attracted to bold branding, institutional fundamentals, high performance, or DeFi leadership. With early entries closing fast, investors who act while these tokens remain under the radar could make big rewards.

While major names like Solana and XRP continue to perform, a growing number of investors are pivoting toward this new contender with one question in mind: Is this the next multi-million dollar crypto story? From wallet activity to online chatter, it’s becoming clear— MAGACOINFINANCE isn’t just another token launch. It’s looking like a serious player on the verge of something much bigger. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building Real Momentum—and It’s Happening Fast The smartest moves in crypto come before the headlines. That’s exactly where MAGACOINFINANCE is right now: rising fast, but still early enough to move on. What’s fueling the rush? It’s a combination of clean rollout mechanics, transparent development, and—most importantly—confidence from experienced traders. Unlike short-lived trends, this project is checking every box: real wallet growth, growing community participation, and a development team that’s actively delivering on promises. It’s not speculation anymore. It’s traction. Why Solana and XRP Investors Are Joining the Move Solana has become the standard for high-speed, high-performance blockchains. It’s attracting developers, real-world applications, and institutional capital—but its biggest gains are likely behind it. XRP , revitalized by its regulatory clarity, is finally being recognized for what it’s always claimed to be: a legitimate infrastructure layer for global finance. Banks and fintech firms are now taking it seriously—and so are the investors who stuck with it. But even among these giants, there’s growing recognition that MAGACOINFINANCE could be where exponential growth still lives. Others in the Mix: Polkadot, Sei, and Key Ecosystem Drivers Polkadot remains a top-tier network for chain interoperability. Its parachain structure continues to attract experimentation and development flexibility, especially among builders focused on scalable applications. Sei is emerging quickly as a speed-first blockchain designed for performance-heavy use cases like trading. It’s still in the early wave—but developer interest is growing fast. These projects are solid—but they’re already discovered. MAGACOINFINANCE is still under the radar—and that’s exactly what makes it exciting. Final Word The crypto world rewards timing—and investors know it. Right now, early buyers are treating MAGACOINFINANCE.COM as a rare shot at entering before the wave breaks. This might not be just another token. It might be the opportunity that turns today’s moves into tomorrow’s big headlines.

43892057,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=716814,1745820023,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43892057.jpeg,The Federal Reserve deceived everyone with its rescission of anti-crypto rules,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/fed-deceives-with-anti-crypto-rules/,"Caitlin Long, the CEO of Custodia Bank, said the Federal Reserve tricked the public by pretending to ease up on crypto rules but actually keeping the most important anti-crypto restriction alive. Caitlin posted a detailed thread on X Sunday explaining that while the Fed made noise about scrapping four pieces of anti-crypto guidance, it left one major piece in place. This surviving policy, she said, was issued alongside the Biden White House’s anti-crypto statement back on January 27, 2023, and it still blocks banks from touching crypto in any real way. Caitlin said the guidance left untouched does three main things. First, it blocks banks from holding cryptoassets as principal, meaning they can’t even pay a small gas fee. Second, it stops banks from issuing stablecoins on permissionless blockchains. Third, it keeps a clear preference for permissioned blockchains — ones controlled by big banks — even though the OCC and FDIC dropped that idea. Caitlin said , “The Fed has maintained a regulatory preference for permissioned stablecoins,” warning that this creates a first-mover advantage for big banks’ private stablecoins before the broader stablecoin bill becomes law. Fed favors big banks while stifling crypto custody Caitlin said the Fed’s refusal to let banks deal with crypto directly has bigger consequences than most realize. Not only does it block Wall Street banks from making markets in major tokens like BTC , ETH, and SOL, but it also screws over banks trying to offer crypto custody. Caitlin explained that crypto custodians usually need to estimate gas fees ahead of time. If the estimate is too low because network fees spiked, the transaction would fail. In the current setup, a bank acting as a custodian can’t pay the missing amount, which would force the transaction to die. This issue grows even messier because custodians often split up large crypto holdings into smaller pieces to manage risk better. Every split means new on-chain transactions and more gas fees. Caitlin said that since banks can’t pay those fees directly, the whole process becomes too risky, discouraging them from offering crypto custody services at all. In short, the Fed threw sand into the gears for banks looking to seriously work with crypto. Caitlin summed it up by saying the Fed effectively handed big banks a head start in launching permissioned stablecoins while making it harder for others to catch up once the stablecoin market fully opens. She added that this maneuver gives Wall Street giants an advantage now, before Congress passes the stablecoin law that would remove the Fed’s preference for permissioned systems. Fed hides real actions while White House cheers Caitlin criticized the Fed’s public relations stunt. She said the Fed made a big deal about all the rules it rolled back but never mentioned the critical one it kept. “The Fed definitely won on PR spin,” she wrote, adding that even smart people got fooled. She warned that now that people know the truth, they should be furious. She said the White House praised the Fed’s actions, clearly unaware—or pretending to be—that the worst policy stayed. Caitlin said this raises questions about what the White House expected from the Fed, what the Fed promised, and how the relationship between the two might be shifting. She said most media outlets have talked about brewing fights over interest rates, but almost nobody is covering the growing tension over bank regulation. Cynthia Lummis, the head of the Senate Banking Committee’s Digital Assets Subcommittee, was not tricked. She called the Fed’s move “lip service” and made it clear she wasn’t buying the act. Cynthia, who has serious power over digital asset rules in the Senate, could take steps to fix what she called a “deceptive maneuver.” In her own post on X, Cynthia added, “Unlike the OCC and FDIC, the Fed STILL uses reputation risk in bank supervision.” She also said that the same Fed staffers who pushed Operation Chokepoint 2.0, the infamous Biden-era effort to pressure banks away from controversial industries, are still the ones handling crypto policy today.

The meme coin is showing signs of bullish continuation after a long stretch of consolidation, and a resulting breakout from such momentum could be enormous. To put it plainly, its 2024 400% breakout could pale in comparison to what is coming if Shiba Inu manages to complete its breakout. Shiba Inu Green Closes Point To Bullishness A pseudonymous crypto analyst has pointed out some interesting formations in the Shiba Inu price chart, which seem to have gone under the radar. For example, the Shiba Inu price has marked its 3rd consecutive weekly close and continues to flash signs of more price increases. With the most recent break and close in the green, Shiba Inu is now looking to break above its long-term support. Related Reading: XRP Price Ready To Reach $8 As Consolidation Breaks – Here’s The Timeline Currently, the Shiba Inu price is still trading above its August 2024 low before its 400% breakout. This suggests that the meme coin could be on the ground floor of something extraordinary, especially as the majority of its investors sit underwater, according to data from IntoTheBlock. If this bullish momentum is maintained, the crypto analyst sees the meme coin rallying to brand-new all-time highs. The first target is @0.000139, which would be an 894% rally from its current level, as well as 50% higher than its current peak of $0.00008. Another more bullish target is that the Shiba Inu price could reach as high as $0.000220. This is a 1,479% increase in price and 150% higher than the current all-time high. The post read: We will have to wait and see, it is too early but the market is turning green now and will continue to trade green. It can happen that it go higher rather than lower based on the chart. It can happen that rather than overestimating the potential of this pair, we are underestimating it, this too would be good, the more it grows the better it gets. The Other Side For The Shiba Inu Price While the fact that the Shiba Inu price closed three weeks with green candles is commendable, it is possible that this might not end well for the meme coin. Looking back to November-December 2024, which is the last time that SHIB saw three consecutive green weekly closes, what followed was catastrophic. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Reaches Last H1 Support, Next Major Resistance Comes Into View The price went on a rapid downtrend with three red weekly closes following the three green weekly closes. The following weeks were not much better as the Shiba Inu price only saw one green weekly close in eight weeks. Therefore, if this were to repeat this time around, then it is possible that the SHIB price could see a downtrend before picking back up.

It jumped above $95,100 early Sunday and the rally came after the U.S. President Donald Trump said he would roll back tariffs on Chinese imports. Bitcoin’s surge was largely driven by $3.06 billion in weekly inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. Altcoins also fared well, with XRP up 4%, Solana up 1%, and Cardano up 2% over the past day. XRP is making headlines as the SEC has approved ProShares’ first-ever XRP futures ETF, set to go live on April 30. ProShares is preparing to launch three XRP-tracked products this week after a quiet SEC approval. The flurry of XRP ETFs comes after Ripple’s major victory over the SEC in March, which cleared major regulatory hurdles for XRP. Analyst Warns XRP Could Drop to $1.25 Analyst Egrag Crypto, in his latest X post , predicted that XRP could hit $1.25 in the short term. He explained that XRP still shows weakness unless it can close above the $2.33–$2.45 range, which would signal a bullish breakout. Egrag opened up about the importance of the 0.702 Fibonacci level, linking it to a major past breakout. Further, he advised his followers not to chase market gains or panic sell, but instead to keep accumulating XRP during price dips. “This is a short-term outlook, and while I am confident we may see double digits in the upcoming months, we first need to dispel any bearish sentiments,” the analyst said.

In a post that sharply contrasts with typical narratives pushed by prominent digital asset influencers, Aljarrah stated, “Tether props up BTC. XRP was engineered to replace what Bitcoin only pretended to solve. Ripple’s protocol is already bridging financial systems, something BTC never could.” This assessment was accompanied by a video featuring Egon von Greyerz, Founder and Managing Partner of Von Greyerz AG, who expanded on the ideas. This is the take on Bitcoin, Tether, XRP, and Gold you won’t hear from any mainstream crypto influencer. Tether props up BTC. #XRP was engineered to replace what Bitcoin only pretended to solve. Ripple’s protocol is already bridging financial systems, something BTC never could. pic.twitter.com/pwxNEx0zB3 — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) April 25, 2025 Bitcoin as a Politicized Asset and the Role of Tether Von Greyerz described Bitcoin as a heavily politicized asset that no longer functions as its original proponents claimed. He characterized Bitcoin as the “new oil,” suggesting that its value is being inflated deliberately to facilitate debt repayment strategies by certain governments, referencing El Salvador as one example. He said, “Bitcoin is being used like oil was in the 70s, artificially inflated to pay down US debt and create demand for US dollars.” He explained that the drive to inflate Bitcoin is tied to the need to prop up demand for U.S. dollars and U.S. treasuries, especially under frameworks like the Loomis bill. According to von Greyerz, Bitcoin’s current trajectory aligns it more with the goals of central authorities rather than functioning as an independent, decentralized financial alternative. Tether plays a significant role in this arrangement. Von Greyerz pointed out that Tether is not only backed by U.S. Treasuries but holds more Treasuries than the country of Germany. He described how Tether’s integration into Bitcoin’s ecosystem, particularly in trading pairs and liquidity, contributes to an inflated perception of Bitcoin’s organic market demand. The stablecoin, when tied to an asset like Bitcoin, effectively supports a system that promotes demand for U.S. debt instruments. XRP and Ripple’s Foundational Role in Global Finance In contrast to Bitcoin, XRP, and the technology created by Ripple were framed by both Aljarrah and von Greyerz as practical tools with functional utility across financial systems. According to von Greyerz, Ripple developed the underlying digital ledger technology (DLT) as far back as 2001, long before the wider public discourse around cryptocurrency took hold. He noted that Ripple’s ISO 20022-compliant protocol enables interoperability between various financial systems and is being positioned as the technological backbone for central bank digital currency (CBDC) development. Von Greyerz claimed that institutions like the IMF have already acknowledged Ripple’s role in CBDC infrastructure, and that the tokenization of assets, interbank settlement, and digital identity will rely on XRP’s ecosystem. This stands in contrast to Bitcoin, which he said “is not a store of value. It is not a medium of exchange. It is not a unit of account.” Rather, it is a speculative asset whose value is strategically inflated to serve state monetary objectives. Gold’s Continued Relevance in a Digitally Oriented World While praising Ripple and XRP’s practical applications, von Greyerz also emphasized that the foundational backing for the coming digital monetary system remains physical gold. Referring to the IMF’s reports from 2020, he noted that even within future digital frameworks, gold is still cited as a hard asset supporting the system. This is despite public emphasis on digital innovations and tokenized assets. He stated, “The whole thing is still going to be based and backed by a hard asset, gold, not Bitcoin.” Final Perspective on Speculation Versus Utility Von Greyerz clarifies that he is not categorically opposed to Bitcoin. However, he stressed the need for honesty about his role. He said if the Loomis bill is enacted, the Bitcoin market could offer significant speculative gains. Yet he rejected the idea that Bitcoin is fulfilling the functions originally promised by its advocates. He described the current narrative surrounding Bitcoin as dishonest, characterized it as an “intentionally created asset bubble to create demand… for the very dollar it’s supposed to be an anti-dollar asset solution to.” Aljarrah’s tweet and von Greyerz’s commentary suggest that Bitcoin is no longer a challenge to the system but now works in support of traditional monetary policy. In contrast, XRP and Ripple are shown as tools for real financial connectivity, while gold is still seen as a quiet but steady reserve in today’s changing digital economy.

He added that capital flows into the network “are ramping up,” sharing a chart that showed an increase in 30-day total flows and a decrease in 30-day speculative flows. “Both total and speculative flows have bottomed. When both align, they join forces to make a bullish environment anchored in fundamentals. Bullish Bitcoin Technicals The analyst added that their risk signal model has started its trend back down, which means liquidity has returned to the market. “Downside pullbacks will be muted in this environment,” he added. BTC fundamentals have turned bullish, not a bad setup to break all time highs. I took a break from X to enjoy the NZ summer but every week I put out a series of analysis to my subscribers (this is a hobby, NOT a long term project). Thought I’d post this update publicly. — Willy Woo (@woonomic) April 27, 2025 With medium-term targets of $90,000 and $93,000 being hit, “the $108,000 target is still in play with a new interim target of $103,000 forming,” said Woo. However, in the short term , more sideways action or a slow grind upwards is the most likely scenario. He added that all dips are for buying under the present regime, and there is a good chance of them in the very short term, before concluding: “BTC is setting up for another break of all-time highs if the capital flow trend continues. It’s a solid long-term setup.” Analyst “Rekt Capital” said that Bitcoin would need to have a weekly close above $93,500 to start the process of regaining the previous range. The asset dipped below $93,000 briefly on Monday morning before recovering to reclaim $94,000 at the time of writing, so this move may be a possibility. #BTC Can Bitcoin do it?

BTC Above STH Price The positive weekly close has pushed the Bitcoin price above the short-term holder price for the first time since March 3, reported Galaxy Research. When BTC trades above the STH price, it signals that recent buyers are in profit. “This reduces the likelihood of capitulation and strengthens on-chain support for further upside,” it explained. Bitcoin’s price increased more than 10% this week, climbing from $85,177 at the weekly open to $93,946 as of the April 24 daily close.

SEC staff need to use crypto to better understand how it works and the best way to regulate it, Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal argued in open letters sent to OGE acting director Jamieson Greer and newly sworn-in SEC Chair Paul Atkins , which he shared to X on April 25. “To regulate technology, you need to understand it. To understand technology, you need to use it,” Grewal said in the letter to Greer. “Permitting commission staff to hold crypto is essential to them developing the knowledge necessary to propose and adopt workable regulatory frameworks for digital securities activity,” he added. Source: Paul Grewal Legal Advisory 22-04, issued on July 4, 2022, by the OGE, prohibits SEC staff from buying, selling, or otherwise using crypto and stablecoins because they are not “publicly traded securities” and don’t qualify for an exception, unlike stocks. SEC needs waivers for staff Grewal said US President Donald Trump directed the SEC and other agencies to submit recommendations for crypto regulations due in around 90 days, and SEC “staff still cannot use the technology on which they are making recommendations.” He echoed a similar sentiment in his letter to Atkins and crypto-friendly SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, arguing being unable to hold crypto is a roadblock for the agency’s Crypto Task Force in creating a regulatory framework. Source: Paul Grewal While it’s up to OGE to rescind the advisory, the SEC should take its own action, Grewal said. “For example, issuing waivers to crypto task force members and other staff actively working on task force matters would be consistent with measures already taken in commensurate advisory situations,” he said. Related: Coinbase files FOIA to see how much the SEC’s ‘war on crypto’ cost Grewal added that a waiver would allow SEC staff on the Crypto Task Force responsible for creating crypto regulations to use crypto and “evaluate the underlying digital asset technology.” Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who took office in 2021, was known for his hardline stance on crypto regulation. He resigned on Jan. 20 after spearheading an aggressive regulatory stance toward crypto , bringing upward of 100 regulatory actions against firms. Following Gensler’s exit, the SEC opted out of a swathe of lawsuits against crypto firms, including Coinbase, on Feb. 27 and, in a more recent April 24 walkback, flagged plans to drop its enforcement against blockchain firm Dragonchain.

ADA is consolidating near $0.70 and eyes more gains above the $0.720 zone. ADA price started a recovery wave from the $0.650 zone. The price is trading above $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.7180 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.720 resistance zone. Cardano Price Faces Resistance In the past few sessions, Cardano saw a fresh decline from the $0.7350 level, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA declined below the $0.720 and $0.70 support levels. A low was formed at $0.6826 and the price is again moving higher. There was a move above the $0.70 level. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7338 swing high to the $0.6826 low. Cardano price is now trading above $0.680 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.7150 zone and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.7338 swing high to the $0.6826 low. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.7180 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $0.7250. The next key resistance might be $0.750. If there is a close above the $0.750 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.780 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.80 in the near term. Another Drop in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.7150 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.70 level. The next major support is near the $0.680 level. A downside break below the $0.680 level could open the doors for a test of $0.630.

According to a filing with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, the plaintiffs claim Nike carried out a “rug pull” by promoting sneaker-themed NFTs, pocketing profits from initial and secondary sales, and then shutting down RTFKT in January 2025, leaving holders with steep losses and worthless assets. The lawsuit, led by an RTFKT holder, Jagdeep Cheema, seeks $5 million in damages and calls for a trial by jury to decide the claims. It accuses Nike of violating consumer protection laws and selling unregistered securities. Plaintiffs argue that the Nike NFTs meet the criteria for securities under the Howey Test, as buyers made an investment of money in a common enterprise with an expectation of profits tied to Nike’s ongoing efforts. “As this type of digital asset is properly classified as a security under relevant law, the issuers of this type of token are required to register them and file relevant statements with the authorities and comply with relevant securities laws. The Nike NFTs were never registered as such,” the lawsuit noted. You might also like: TRUMP developers remove $4.6m from liquidity pool, raising rug pull concerns Nike acquired RTFKT in December 2021, during the peak of NFT mania, positioning the move as part of its bigger push into the digital world. At the time, RTFKT was praised for blending fashion, gaming, and blockchain tech in ways that captured huge attention across the crypto and sneaker communities. The studio quickly became a standout name, with projects like CloneX and Cryptokicks generating millions in sales. Early buyers were promised a gamified experience with quests, forging events, and exclusive drops that tied digital collectibles to real-world rewards. However, as the broader NFT market cooled throughout 2023 and 2024, interest in RTFKT’s collections also started to fade. In December 2024, Nike announced RTFKT would wind down after one final release, the “Blade Drop,” describing the move as a shift toward preserving RTFKT’s legacy rather than an outright shutdown. The plaintiffs argue that Nike’s withdrawal crushed the value of the NFTs, many of which had once traded for thousands of dollars, and wiped out promised ecosystem features like quests, rewards, and exclusive access to limited-edition products. Nike and RTFKT had also allegedly promoted the NFTs with promises of peer-to-peer trading and an active ecosystem where completing challenges and forging sneakers would add real value. After the shutdown, those features disappeared, the secondary market dried up, and NFT prices collapsed almost overnight. “Predictably, prices plunged and did not recover. Investors – some of whom are cited in this complaint – and the crypto community at large lamented Nike’s brazen rug pull,” the lawsuit added.

Set to go live tomorrow, XRPFi will introduce smart contract capabilities to XRP, enabling users to stake, lend, borrow, and trade XRP-based assets directly on the Flare blockchain. Crypto analyst Angelica Saldaña broke the news, highlighting how XRPFi will open up new avenues for XRP holders. The platform will allow users to earn rewards, engage in lending and borrowing, and explore yield strategies, all while operating within the familiar XRP ecosystem. This is seen as a significant step in enhancing XRP’s real-world utility. A Game-Changer for XRP Holders For years, XRP holders had limited options beyond simply holding their tokens. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, XRP lacked the tools to tap into the growing DeFi market. Flare Networks is changing this by introducing FXRP, a new version of XRP that can be used on the Flare blockchain. This innovation allows users to mint FXRP, enabling them to lend, borrow, and earn rewards without relinquishing ownership or relying on external parties. It’s a breakthrough that provides XRP holders with newfound freedom and security. Flare’s Bigger Vision for DeFi XRPFi is imminent!!

This comes amid positive news on the Ripple ETF front, albeit not what the XRP community anticipates. Bitcoin, alongside most of the market, had a quiet weekend, but prices started to fall on Monday morning. BTC dropped by a few grand from over $94,500 to under $93,000 before it recovered to the starting lines. Consequently, bitcoin and most alts sit at essentially the same levels as yesterday. In contrast, XRP dipped to $2.16 yesterday before it shot up to a multi-day peak of almost $2.3. Although it has retraced slightly since then, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency is still 5% up on the day, outperforming all top 25 alts. The most evident reason for this is the approval of three Ripple ETFs in the United States. ProShares got the green light to launch Ultra XRP ETF (which has 2x leverage), Short XRP ETF, and Ultra Short XRP ETF (-2x leverage again). ICYMI: ProShares has received SEC approval to launch three $XRP ETFs: Ultra $XRP ETF (2x leverage), Short $XRP ETF, and Ultra Short $XRP ETF (-2x leverage). These funds will track #XRP futures prices, offering traders opportunities for long and short positions. pic.twitter.com/VXzVyOgn9x — CryptoPotato Official (@Crypto_Potato) April 28, 2025 The products are similar to the leverage XRP ETFs released by Teucrium earlier this month. Although they are not the spot Ripple ETFs expected by the community, it seems that the most recent approvals have given XRP’s price a notable bump over the weekend and Monday morning. Popular crypto analysts believe the eventual approval of spot XRP ETFs will have a groundbreaking effect on the underlying asset’s price, with some shocking predictions setting targets of up to $100.

In a statement posted on X , Term Finance detailed the recovery efforts, noting that 223.197 ETH (approximately $400,000) was recaptured internally, while an additional 333 ETH (around $600,000) was secured through negotiations. The outstanding loss now stands at 362.03 ETH, valued at roughly $650,000 — a significant reduction from the initial impact of 918 ETH.

Instead, a bug in an updated ETH oracle caused the liquidation error. “No smart contracts were exploited, and user funds were not directly targeted,” the team emphasized. However, details regarding the negotiation process for the returned funds remain undisclosed, and Term Finance has yet to provide further comment.

Just days earlier, Solana-based platform Loopscale suffered a $5.8 million exploit , while crypto exchange Bitget reported a $20 million loss after coordinated manipulation of a lesser-known token market. Bitget has announced legal action against eight accounts linked to the incident. Additionally, Impermax Finance fell victim to a flash loan attack over the weekend, resulting in losses exceeding $150,000, according to security firm TenArmor. The protocol confirmed the breach, promising a detailed post-mortem once investigations conclude. Recoveries in such cases remain inconsistent across the industry. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou recently disclosed that following a $1.4 billion hack in February, nearly 28% of the stolen funds had become untraceable after being laundered through mixers and peer-to-peer platforms. Only a fraction (3.84%) has been successfully frozen. Crypto Lost $1.6 Billion to Hacks in Q1 In the first three months of 2025, the crypto ecosystem lost a whopping $1,635,933,800 across 39 incidents, according to the blockchain security platform Immunefi . The report claimed, “Q1 2025 marks the worst quarter for hacks in the history of the crypto ecosystem.” Most of that was the result of only two hacks of two centralized exchanges. Phemex suffered a $69.1 million loss in January, while Bybit lost $1.46 billion in February. Subsequently, the total number of losses in the first quarter marks a 4.7x increase compared to Q1 2024 . At that time, hackers and fraudsters stole $348,251,217. Notably, experts assume that the infamous North Korean Lazarus Group is behind the two largest attacks.

Sonic’s Evolution: 2000+ TPS, 0.7s Confirmation, Near-Zero Fees The Fantom Opera blockchain, initially recognized for its speed and throughput as a high-performance aDAG-based Layer 1 solution, encountered scalability limitations as its ecosystem expanded. Its traditional EVM architecture struggled with bloated state storage, slow node synchronization, and execution bottlenecks. To overcome these challenges without resorting to sharding or Layer 2 solutions, Fantom developed Sonic — a fundamental redesign engineered to deliver a significant performance leap. Sonic Labs, a new team led by CEO Michael Kong , CTO Andre Cronje (founder of Yearn Finance), and Chief Research Officer Bernhard Scholz , dedicated two and a half years to the redesign of Fantom’s virtual machine, storage, and consensus. They built Sonic, a new, independent EVM-compatible chain capable of processing over 2,000 TPS, achieving 0.7-second finality, and executing transactions at a cost of $0.0001 . It also improves storage efficiency by 90% and reduces node synchronization time from weeks to under two days. Technical Innovations Driving Sonic’s Performance Sonic’s enhanced performance is underpinned by three core technological advancements: SonicVM: A newly developed virtual machine fully compatible with the EVM, SonicVM optimizes computationally intensive operations like SHA3 hashing, pre-analyzes jump instructions, delivers significantly faster execution, and supports high throughput. SonicDB : Achieving nearly 90% data compression, SonicDB uses a layered storage strategy that splits the blockchain state into two databases: LiveDB for the current global state and ArchiveDB for historical blocks and states. This reduces node requirements and enhances network resilience through greater decentralization. Sonic Gateway : Functioning like an “L2-like” bridging solution to Ethereum, it uses a batch processing mechanism that strikes a balance between security and efficiency, enabling seamless two-way asset transfers and ecosystem access. Stablecoin Ecosystem: Nested Yield and Resilient Growth Defying market trends in 2025, Sonic’s on-chain Total Value Locked (TVL) surged by over 500%, with the total stablecoin supply surpassing $260 million . This growth is driven by sophisticated high-leverage yield mechanisms. Silo v2 Loop Lending: Use staked S tokens to borrow stablecoins, achieving up to 20x exposure to capture combined incentives alongside stable yield spreads. Euler + Rings Protocol Combo: Deposit USDC to mint scUSD, then use leverage to potentially achieve up to 10x yield, along with Sonic points and protocol rewards. Shadow DEX Liquidity Provision for Rewards : By facilitating trading activity, particularly with the S/stS pair on Shadow, users can earn up to 169% APY and a share of trading fees. Looking ahead, the ecosystem will incorporate Real World Asset (RWA) yields and off-chain payment solutions to create a sustainable and widely used stablecoin ecosystem backed by compliant assets and real-world applications. Conclusion: Sonic – Leading the Charge in DeFi 2.0 Sonic’s high performance, nested yields, and accessibility position it for rapid growth, with the potential to exceed $2B TVL and a multi-billion $S token market cap within a year. More importantly, Sonic is championing an “efficiency revolution” in blockchain design—prioritizing performance and capital efficiency to attract liquidity. The report identifies technical challenges, including the adaptive AMM’s reliance on external oracles, which introduces potential vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the inherent risks of high-leverage strategies in volatile markets necessitate the use of hedging instruments, such as short perpetual futures, to mitigate potential liquidations. From a broader view, Sonic is well-positioned to lead the expected 2025 DeFi resurgence. Its thriving stablecoin ecosystem boosts the value of both the $S token and the network. Even in a bear market, Sonic demonstrates the potential for DeFi to establish resilient “yield havens” through innovation and performance. With its nested yields, developer-focused incentives, and efficient infrastructure, Sonic provides a model for the industry. The integration of RWAs and payment tools could place Sonic as a critical bridge between on-chain yields and real-world utility, driving DeFi toward mass adoption For full report, please visit: https://square.htx.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HTX-Research-Latest-Report-1-1.pdf About HTX Research HTX Research is the dedicated research arm of HTX Group, responsible for conducting in-depth analyses, producing comprehensive reports, and delivering expert evaluations across a broad spectrum of topics, including cryptocurrency, blockchain technology, and emerging market trends.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-04-28 07:37:08

The hack, which resulted in the theft of Rs. 2,000 crore worth of crypto , left over 4.4 million users locked out of their accounts. This incident, and the court’s rejection of the petition, has highlighted the glaring gaps in India’s crypto regulations , leaving users vulnerable and raising questions about the country’s ability to protect digital asset holders. The WazirX Hack: A Blow to 4.4 Million Users On July 18, 2024, WazirX, one of India’s largest crypto exchanges , was targeted in a massive hack that saw a significant portion of user funds stolen. Despite the exchange’s promise to restore 85% of users’ funds by May 2025, many affected users are dissatisfied with the compensation plan. This led 54 users to file a petition with the Supreme Court, seeking intervention in the ongoing restructuring process happening in Singapore, and requesting a thorough investigation into the exchange’s fund mismanagement. Supreme Court’s Decision: A Setback for Users The Supreme Court, led by Justice B R Gavai and Justice Augustine Masih, dismissed the petition, citing the absence of clear crypto regulations in India . The ruling underscored the limitations of the current legal framework, leaving victims of crypto hacks, such as the WazirX incident, with little recourse in the Indian legal system. WazirX’s Restructuring Plan: Fund Recovery on the Horizon In response to the hack, WazirX management proposed a restructuring plan to the Singapore Court, promising to restore 85% of affected user funds by May 2025. The remaining 15% will be returned over the following 2-3 years, depending on the exchange’s recovery and future profits. While the restructuring plan has received user support, the Singapore court’s approval is still pending. WazirX Users Vote in Favor of the Recovery Plan Despite the legal hurdles, WazirX claims that more than 93% of users support the exchange’s restructuring proposal, following a vote conducted in partnership with legal firm Kroll. The Call for Crypto Regulation in India The WazirX case serves as a wake-up call for India, highlighting the urgent need for a clear and robust cryptocurrency regulatory framework. While countries like the U.S. have embraced pro-crypto policies , India’s regulatory stance remains largely outdated. The WazirX hack exposes how India’s failure to adopt progressive crypto laws leaves users at risk, preventing the sector from reaching its full potential. As the global crypto landscape continues to evolve, India risks falling behind if it does not address its regulatory shortcomings. The WazirX saga illustrates the challenges faced by users in a legal vacuum, emphasizing the need for stronger regulations to protect the growing crypto community in India. FAQs How does WazirX’s restructuring plan work for affected users? WazirX’s restructuring plan aims to restore 85% of the crypto portfolios for affected WazirX users by May 2025. The remaining 15% of the funds will be returned over the next 2-3 years, depending on the exchange’s recovery and future profits. This plan is part of the ongoing restructuring process being presented in the Singapore court. While WazirX claims over 93% of users support this proposal, the plan still awaits court approval. What steps are WazirX users required to take to benefit from the proposed 85% fund recovery in the restructuring plan? WazirX users need to stay updated on the restructuring process, accept the plan, and possibly verify their accounts to claim their share of the 85% fund recovery. Why is WazirX promising to restore only 85% of the users’ funds, and what happens to the remaining 15%? WazirX is restoring 85% due to financial constraints after the hack. The remaining 15% will be returned over 2-3 years, depending on the exchange’s future profits and recovery. How does WazirX plan to recover the remaining 15% of funds over the next 2-3 years for users affected by the hack? WazirX plans to recover the remaining 15% through future profits and successful financial recovery, returning the funds once the exchange is in a better financial position.",News|Exchange News,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 07:41:39

On May 1, approximately 74 million Sui ( SUI ) tokens, or 2.28% of the circulating supply, will be unlocked, according to data from Tokenomist. The pending release adds fresh selling pressure at a moment when demand has been heating up. So far, only 33% of the total SUI supply is unlocked. Meanwhile, Sui’s on-chain fundamentals have been strengthening . Total value locked on Sui-based protocols climbed 40% since the beginning of April, now sitting at $1.73 billion, as per DeFiLlama data . Stablecoin market cap on the network also jumped from $630 million to $880 million over the same period, while daily decentralized exchange volume has been hovering around $500 million. The network has handled over $3.6 billion in trading over the last seven days, lifting its monthly volume past $11 billion. With fresh supply about to hit the market, some traders may take profits after last week’s gains. However, others see the growing DeFi metrics as signs that Sui can absorb the new tokens without a downturn. You might also like: SUI or SEI: Which one will dominate the 2025 bull market?

With a relative strength index of 78, the asset appears to be overbought, signaling potential exhaustion in the short term. Momentum indicators are still in favor of buyers, and the moving average convergence/divergence is still in positive territory. Sui price analysis. Credit: crypto.news In addition, all estimated moving averages indicate a buy. If buying pressure holds and SUI stays above $3.60, it could attempt a move toward $4.00, a psychological level that may attract more momentum traders. On the negative side, SUI might retest support at $3.30 if selling pressure from the May 1 unlock starts to build. A deeper pullback might find further support around the $3.00 area, near the 10-day EMA. If the market smoothly absorbs the unlock, SUI may settle between $3.30 and $3.60 before establishing a new trend.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. With crypto adoption at an all-time high, more investors are turning to crypto-backed loans to unlock liquidity without selling their assets. Table of Contents 1. Rocko 2. Aave 3. Unchained 4. Ledn 5. Nexo Conclusion As global crypto adoption accelerates, investors are increasingly seeking ways to access liquidity without selling their assets. Crypto-backed loans have surged in popularity, allowing crypto owners to use their crypto holdings as collateral to borrow funds. This approach enables investors to retain ownership of their crypto and avoid taxable events like selling while accessing liquidity for new investments, business expenses, major purchases, and more. To service the demand for crypto loans, an entire industry has emerged. Today, there are a variety of crypto loan platform offerings, each with different models, rates, and value propositions, complicating the decision process for many prospective borrowers. To simplify choosing the best crypto lending platform, here are the five top options for 2025. 1. Rocko Rocko is a simple-to-use, crypto-loan marketplace that aggregates the best rates and protocols across DeFi, offering a one-stop solution for securing competitive crypto-backed loans. Users can compare interest rates and easily borrow from top DeFi protocols like Aave and Morpho. Rocko’s design is simple to use for crypto users of all levels, ensuring anyone can get a loan in minutes and immediately receive the funds to their preferred exchange account. Rocko also offers helpful loan management tools such as alerts to monitor collateral value and a refinancing tool which allows borrowers to refinance their loan in one click. Rocko supports many major cryptos as collateral including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana , and more. Pros: Compare and access a variety of competitive interest rates. Non-custodial platform so borrowers keep control of their crypto. Compatible with any Ethereum wallet and accounts at centralized exchanges like Coinbase. No monthly minimum payments and no required repayment date. Cons: No fixed-rate loan options. Few tools for implementing highly levered strategies. 2. Aave Aave is one of the earliest DeFi lending protocols and remains one of the most established with many years of being battle tested. Aave allows for the supply and borrowing of a variety of crypto assets across many Ethereum-based networks. The protocol’s flexibility and significant depth of liquidity make it a popular platform for those with more technical familiarity and DeFi experience. Pros: Fully decentralized and open-source. Broad asset and network support. Features like flash loans and efficiency-mode borrowing. Cons: Difficult to use for less experienced users. Interest rates can fluctuate wildly. 3. Unchained Unchained focuses solely on Bitcoin financial services including Bitcoin-backed loans. While it’s a centralized lending platform, its multi-key structure sets it apart, requiring multiple parties to authorize any movement of collateral. This collaborative custody model appeals to those prioritizing control and transparency over BTC loan arrangements. Pros: Bitcoin-collateralized loans without rehypothecation. 2-of-3 multisig model can increase security. Collaborative custody for added transparency. Cons: No support for other crypto besides Bitcoin. Primarily tailored to institutional clients. Interest rates can be high relative to decentralized options. 4. Ledn Ledn is a crypto financial services firm that offers loans against Bitcoin and Ethereum using a third–party custodian, BitGo. Borrowers can choose whether their collateral is rehypothecated, which can reduce the interest rate they pay. Ledn is one of the first centralized crypto companies to complete a Proof-of-Reserves attestation which can provide some assurance to potential users. They also offer a Bitcoin-loan product that automatically purchases more Bitcoin with the proceeds, which may be appealing to Bitcoin owners looking to increase their exposure. Pros: Choice over rehypothecation of collateral. Completed Proof-of-Reserves attestation. Loan product that automatically purchases more Bitcoin. Cons: Interest rates can be high relative to decentralized options. High admin fees. 5. Nexo Nexo offers a broad custodial lending platform supporting a wide range of crypto assets. Loans are typically approved quickly, with no credit checks, appealing to those seeking immediate access to fiat or stablecoin liquidity. The platform emphasizes convenience but with the tradeoff of custodial trust and rehypothecation risk. Pros: Fast approval process. No credit score required. Wide selection of supported crypto assets. Cons: Collateral may be rehypothecated, increasing risk for borrowers. Service not available in certain jurisdictions such as the U.S. Conclusion While the crypto lending landscape is constantly evolving, these five crypto loan platforms top the list for the best crypto loan platforms of 2025. Each offers a different model and value proposition to borrowers and we encourage prospective users to research the options themselves and choose what makes most sense for them. Whether borrowers want a simple-to-use platform with access to many competitive rates, such as Rocko , or a centralized option with multi-sig institutional custody, such as Unchained, there’s an option for everyone.

This article examines where to invest $10,000 today for superior returns over the next few years. Bitcoin and BTC ETFs The first key area to invest and generate superior returns in the next few years is in the crypto market. While the Bitcoin price has dropped by 13% from its January high , it has performed better than stocks following the Liberation Day tariffs . Furthermore, spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net inflows of over $3 billion last week, indicating that the cryptocurrency is becoming a safe-haven asset. Furthermore, Bitcoin has a strong track record of outperforming the stock market. Besides, it has jumped from less than $1 in 2009 to $94,000 today. These gains have not been linear and the coin has experienced substantial drawdowns in this period. For example, it tumbled by over 33% from its highest point in March to its lowest level in August last year and then bounced back. Analysts are bullish on Bitcoin. Just last week, Ark Invest predicted that Bitcoin price will surge to $2.4 million by 2030. That would be a 2,426% surge from the current level, The most cost-effective and straightforward way to invest in Bitcoin is to purchase it directly from an exchange like Coinbase or Kraken. Still, when considering spot Bitcoin ETFs, the Grayscale Mini Bitcoin ETF (BTC) is the best one to invest in as it has a low expense ratio of 0.25%. China EV companies Last week, Tesla reported weak financial results. The numbers showed that its total sales dropped by 9% to $21.3 billion last quarter. Its adjusted EBITDA fell by 17% to $3.3 billion, while its net income plunged by 71%. These numbers showed that the company’s business was struggling as its deliveries in the United States, Europe, and China dived. Therefore, one area to invest $ 1,000 right now is in Chinese electric vehicle companies, as these firms are experiencing more growth this year. This includes companies like Nio, Li Auto, BYD, and XPeng. For example, Li Auto delivered 92,864 vehicles in the first quarter, representing a 15% annual growth. XPeng, a company that is also building flying cars , delivered 94,000 vehicles, a 330% annual increase. Nio delivered 42,094 vehicles in the first quarter, up by 40% from a year earlier. Other firms like BYD and Zeekr have also boosted their sales. China EVs are more innovative than their American counterparts. For example, BYD and CATL have just unveiled batteries that can charge in less than 5 minutes. Nasdaq 100 index The other contrarian area to invest $10,000 this year is in technology companies, especially through the Invesco QQQ (QQQ) ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index. This is a contrarian call since the index remains in a correction after falling by over 10% from the highest level this year. There are also concerns that the artificial intelligence bubble has burst this year. However, history shows that the Nasdaq 100 index typically rebounds whenever it enters a correction. It recovered from the dot-com bubble, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) dip. The index is expected to rebound due to upcoming trade talks between the US and other countries, as well as potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This recovery will also boost other American indices like the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones. It also makes investing in the JEPQ ETF worthwhile, as it tracks the Nasdaq 100 index and offers superior returns.

Cryptocurrency exchange Bithumb earned more than 140 billion won (nearly $97.6 million) in extra fees by using unclear processes that misled users, The Maeil Business Newspaper reports , citing a South Korean lawmaker. Kim Jae-sup, a member of the People’s Power party, revealed that Bithumb earned 672.79 billion won in total fees between February 2023 and February 2024, referring to data submitted by the Financial Supervisory Service. During the period, Bithumb advertised a “lowest commission in Korea” of 0.04%. In reality, however, the average commission rate charged to actual users was 0.051%, Kim added. As a result, consumers faced an additional fee of about 140.91 billion won, the lawmaker emphasized. You might also like: Crypto exchange Bithumb to spin off investment arm ahead of potential Nasdaq listing Kim explained that Bithumb failed to properly notify users that they needed to register a coupon to receive the minimum fee rate. The South Korean lawmaker suggested that such a practice seems to be a typical dark pattern , a deceptive scheme where a user interface is carefully crafted to trick users into doing things they didn’t mean to. The lawmaker also highlighted that the extra fee burden was heavier on older users. “The damage to the middle-aged who may have difficulty recognizing or carrying out the coupon registration process is even more serious,” Kim said. The lawmaker urged regulators to step in, saying the Financial Services Commission and the Fair Trade Commission should take strong action to stop this kind of consumer deception. Bithumb successfully returned to profitability in 2024, with revenue increasing by 265.4% year-over-year. Per data from the Financial Supervisory Service’s electronic disclosure system, Bithumb posted an operating profit of 130.7 billion won (around $90.1 million) last year, marking a turnaround from losses as the exchange had recorded an operating loss of 14.8 billion won in 2023. Net profit for 2024 surged 565.8% year-over-year to 161.8 billion won (nearly $111.2 million).

According to a well-known venture capitalist, Chamath Palihapitiya , crypto acquisitions and public listings in the U.S. have already reached $8.2 billion across 88 transactions, tripling the total value seen in all of 2024. He has also highlighted five key trends driving this rapid growth. Companies Are Turning Treasuries Into Bitcoin Investments First, we’re seeing a wave of Bitcoin treasury moves. Companies like Twenty One Capital are following in the footsteps of MicroStrategy by turning their corporate treasuries into Bitcoin investment vehicles. Their business model is simple, buy Bitcoin, hold it, and ride the wave of crypto appreciation. Wall Street Firms Moving Into Crypto Second, traditional finance firms are making serious moves into crypto infrastructure. A major example is DTCC’s acquisition of Securrency. This deal allows Wall Street firms to offer crypto services alongside traditional assets, giving investors the best of both worlds on a single platform. Institutions Are Building Secure Platforms Third, institutions are stepping up their crypto game. Ripple’s purchase of Metaco shows the push to build platforms that can securely manage digital assets while meeting the strict compliance needs of big players like banks and asset managers. Crypto Exchanges Merge for Growth Fourth, crypto exchanges are consolidating. Kraken’s $1.5 billion purchase of futures broker NinjaTrader is a major step in blending digital and traditional trading. It’s all about making it easy for users to move between Bitcoin, stocks, and more without the usual hassle. Finally, even blockchain projects are merging. Projects like Fetch, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET are combining forces to speed up growth, expand their communities, and boost the power of their tokens. However, all of these moves together are building a bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance. If this trend continues, 2025 might be the year crypto truly becomes part of the everyday financial world. Crypto Market Outlook After struggling for two months, the crypto market is finally showing some strength. The total market cap is now around $3.03 trillion . Leading the way, Bitcoin has just hit $95,000 after a long period of consolidation. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also moving up, trading at $1,809 with a 10% gain over the week. Other altcoins like XRP, Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin have also gone up by 8% to 15% this week. What is driving the $8.2 billion in crypto acquisitions? The rapid growth of Bitcoin treasury investments, Wall Street firms entering crypto, and major mergers in crypto exchanges and blockchain projects are driving the surge in acquisitions. How are companies turning their treasuries into Bitcoin investments?

He called the prohibition “particularly egregious” as the vast majority of crypto activity does not involve securities. In a letter to the acting director of the US Office of Government Ethics (OGE), Grewal stressed that SEC staff need to use crypto and understand the technology before making recommendations for regulatory proposals. He noted that “potential conflicts” in removing the ban can easily be managed. I never understood why @SECGov employees are barred from holding or using digital assets. Any potential conflicts can easily be managed. So I wrote to ask that @OfficeGovEthics rescind and update Legal Advisory 22-04 and for the Crypto Task Force to issue waivers—now. pic.twitter.com/vdG9veuqPY — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) April 25, 2025 “To regulate technology, you need to understand it. To understand technology, you need to use it,” he wrote. In January, President Trump signed an executive order to “establish regulatory clarity for digital financial technology.” He had ordered a Working Group, comprising key leads, including the SEC staff, to submit a report within 180 days, recommending crypto regulatory and legislative proposals . Coinbase’s Grewal noted that almost half of the given time is already over. Further, he emphasized the need for the SEC staff to use the technology, on which they are making recommendations. Grewal Writes to Newly Sworn-In SEC Chair Paul Atkins Additionally, in a separate letter to the new Securities and Exchange Commission chair , Paul Atkins, he said that the ban on SEC employees from holding crypto is an “impediment to the Task Force’s ability” to aid in the right crypto regulatory recommendations. “This needs to be corrected immediately,” he wrote in the letter . Grewal added that Coinbase has pressed the OGE to rescind and update Legal Advisory 22-04. The Legal Advisory , released in 2022, states, “an SEC employee who holds any amount of a cryptocurrency or stablecoin may not participate in a particular matter.” He also said that this rule is “misguided and damaging to [crypto] regulatory progress.” In the letter, Grewal told Atkins that the Commission should clarify that certain crypto holdings would not have “a direct and predictable effect on the value of their crypto or stablecoins.” Most Crypto Activities are Not Securities: Coinbase CLO Further, he added that the Commission must continuously adapt and build new expertise, given the rapid rise in crypto. Besides, he noted that most crypto activities are not securities, highlighting the recent SEC reversals on crypto enforcement actions. “The technology itself is not a security, and securities regulators’ engagements with the technology does not inherently entail conflicts or concerns.” The post Coinbase CLO Urges to Rescind Prohibition on SEC Staff Holding Crypto appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Coinbase|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-04-28 07:55:43

CSPR, the native token of the Casper Network, shot up to an intraday high of $0.023 on April 28, its highest point since Dec. 9 last year. From its lowest level this year, the token has now surged more than 180%. Its market cap climbed to around $215 million, while daily trading volume exploded by nearly 2,500% from the previous day, hovering around $115 million. The surge coincided with a sharp increase in futures open interest, which hit a 5-month high of $6.64 million, way up from about $836k just a month ago, per data from CoinGlass. The simultaneous rise in price and open interest typically signals strengthening bullish sentiment. Funding rates have also stayed positive for the last six days, meaning traders going long are paying less than those betting against the token, a clear bullish signal. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows more holders are moving their tokens off exchanges. In just the past two days, over $1.7 million worth of CSPR left trading platforms. Exchange outflows are typically a bullish sign, as they suggest investors are moving their tokens into self-custody wallets, reducing immediate sell pressure. You might also like: Bitcoin dips below $94,000 as ETFs record $3b weekly inflow CSPR’s gains today can be primarily attributed to a surge in investor interest ahead of its Casper 2.0 upgrade, scheduled for May 6. This update aims to boost the network’s speed, security, and developer experience. The team called it “a leap forward for the Casper Network and a defining step toward bridging the real-world economy with Web3” in an April 22 post on X. Moreover, community sentiment has been buoyed by broader changes within the project’s leadership . According to a community member, Nick, the team associated with past delays and unmet promises has been replaced. He believes that the network is under stronger management, with renewed focus and execution, following positive impressions from interviews conducted late last year. The crypto community appears bullish on CSPR, with CoinMarketCap’s social sentiment metric showing 92% of traders expecting short-term gains while its social sentiment has flipped positive. Growing traction among investors has also pushed the altcoin to trend on Google. CSPR price analysis On the 1-day USDT chart, CSPR recently broke out of a descending parallel channel it had been stuck in for the past five months. Breaking out of a pattern like this usually signals a trend reversal, and a fresh move higher could be in the cards. CSPR price, MACD and Aroon chart — April 28 | Source: cry p to.news The MACD lines have also turned upward, showing growing bullish momentum. On top of that, the Aroon Up is at 100% while the Aroon Down sits at 0%, showing clear dominance by buyers. Hence, CSPR looks poised to rally toward $0.024, its December high and a key resistance it failed to break twice in the second half of 2024. The target is about 45% above its current price. CSPR RSI chart — April 28 | Source: crypto.news However, the RSI has stayed in overbought territory for the past two days, suggesting the token could be due for a short-term cooling period before its next leg higher. At press time, Casper Network ( CSPR ) was trading at $0.016 per coin.

Dogecoin Targets $10 Cycle Peak Potts’ chart is anchored by a rising, two-point regression channel whose lower rail began at Dogecoin’s 2015–2016 base near $0.0001 and now sits just under $0.12. The upper rail, which has acted as resistance in every prior mania phase, currently extrapolates to roughly $69.42 by late 2025—the level highlighted in red where Potts places the next speculative blow-off. Inside that corridor, price action forms three successive rounded bottoms, each capped by a descending yellow resistance line and undergirded by a red basing arc. The geometry alone implies mounting compression: the present triangle apex, lying at $0.17, is almost exactly where DOGE has been coiling for months. Related Reading: Before Dogecoin Hits $1, This Needs To Happen — Analyst Explains The engine driving the forecast is a proprietary dual-wave oscillator rendered as a thicker turquoise wave and a swifter yellow counterpart. Potts explains that “cycle tops have historically printed in two ways: an early top when the yellow wave dips below the green, and a late top when the yellow wave plunges under the horizontal red line at –0.00013.” Vertical purple bars mark every such event on the price chart. According to his archival reconstruction, the oscillator flashed a late top in February 2014, painted twin peaks in the 2017–2018 run, and signalled only an early top in May 2021 when DOGE notched its record $0.739 high. The early-cycle signal appeared on March 6 this year—leaving an expected late-cycle breach still on the table. “If this pattern holds,” Potts writes, “a cycle top is likely around the week of October 27th,” a moment the chart underscores with a final purple bar and a white arrow labelled “LATE TOP.” Related Reading: Can Dogecoin Realistically Reach $3? Analyst Weighs In That date dovetails with the oscillator’s predicted descent below the red threshold (–0.00013) and with the upper channel, which will then hover in the $60–70 range. Potts, however, grounds expectations by flagging $10 as a psychologically resonant milestone—the first round number one logarithmic order higher than the 2021 summit. Historical symmetry strengthens the call. In both earlier cycles, Dogecoin’s break of the yellow down-sloping lid unleashed vertical rallies that did not culminate until the upper white boundary was tagged. The geometry implies a similar stair-step may be at hand: a weekly close above the current yellow resistance, now parked just below $0.20, would enable a decisive push towards the upper rail. Potts remarks that “each cycle has touched the upper white curved trendline,” pointing to the channel’s remarkable predictive persistence. Whether the meme coin can repeat its parabolic history will depend on extrinsic factors—Bitcoin’s own halving cadence, global liquidity, and social-media-driven hype—but the oscillator’s track record is unblemished. As Potts puts it, “this indicator has accurately identified all cycle tops for DOGECOIN,” and until it proves otherwise traders will be watching the –0.00013 trigger and the integrity of the channel’s lower rail for confirmation of the next explosive rally for Dogecoin price. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.18.

Today, that token may be MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . As more traders and investors scan the market for the next serious opportunity, this emerging project is capturing the attention of Bitcoin and Solana holders alike. Why? Because the structure, sentiment, and timing are aligning. The upside looks real—and the window to act may be narrow. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Turning Heads at the Right Moment This project didn’t rise on hype. It rose on traction. MAGACOINFINANCE has shown what early-stage execution is supposed to look like: consistent rollouts, measurable growth in user wallets, and social momentum that isn’t paid for—it’s earned. The pre-sale excitement isn’t manufactured. It’s happening because traders are seeing the same indicators repeat: wallet tracking spikes, developer consistency, and organic mentions increasing across top investor forums. And now, the big question is echoing everywhere: Is this the one everyone will wish they bought early? Honorable Mentions: Kaspa, Polkadot, and the Layer-1 Ecosystem Kaspa has been building a strong following thanks to its blockDAG architecture, offering near-instant confirmations and scalable throughput. Polkadot remains a major force in interoperability. Its parachain model is still one of the most creative ways to connect multiple blockchains into one ecosystem. These names continue to play roles in the infrastructure layer—but right now, the early-stage narrative belongs to MAGACOINFINANCE . Final Word The crypto world thrives on timing. And with more Bitcoin and Solana holders starting to move in, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is looking less like a secret and more like the next breakout. $1.7 million potential? Maybe.

The asset is attracting smart money and whales, following the rapid price recovery in the past week. Official Trump (TRUMP) is becoming a leader among meme tokens, by attracting higher smart money inflows. Based on Nansen wallet data, TRUMP attracted $684K in netflows from smart money wallets. TRUMP is going through its most active trading period since January 20, right after the token’s launch. In the past week, trading volumes recovered between $1.5B and $3B in 24 hours. After renewed trader interest, TRUMP returned to $14.64, briefly peaking above $15.50. TRUMP leads meme token recovery TRUMP became the fourth-largest meme token by market capitalization, also becoming the top Solana meme. In the past week, the token rallied by more than 84%, after the invitation for a Trump dinner dedicated to token holders. The competition to acquire more TRUMP still drives whale buying and accumulation in privately held wallets. One whale withdrew 190,987 TRUMP from a Binance hot wallet, presumably to improve their position on the owners’ leaderboard. Another large-scale holder withdrew 92.46K TRUMP in the past day, adding it to a portfolio of Solana assets. The whale is also a holder of Jupiter JLP tokens, signaling deeper involvement with the Solana ecosystem. A newly registered HTX cold wallet is also part of the TRUMP owners leaderboard. In the past day, the wallet added another 150K TRUMP. The wallet has been tagged as belonging to Justin Sun, the founder of TRON and supporter of Trump’s crypto projects. Other whales have been competing to climb the unofficial leaderboard. Most of the TRUMP buyers include prominent influencers and Solana ecosystem participants. The cutoff ownership is at 109,409.199 TRUMP. Recently, one TRUMP whale sold $300K in FARTCOIN to increase their leaderboard influence. The whale, known as boop, has already taken up to $1.75M in profits from TRUMP, and is now holding the remainder for leaderboard advantage and future rallies. Some of the recent buyers will probably not be eligible to attend the Trump dinner, even after buying more coins. The acquisition may be a form of speculation, driven by the token’s hype. In the past days, TRUMP has been highly active, increasing interactions with the Robinhood wallet, and ranking #6 based on Bubblemaps data. Traders start discounting TRUMP rally TRUMP remains highly active, but there are signs traders are preparing to discount the rally. The top TRUMP trader has been selling to realize more profits from the recent rally. One of the top TRUMP whales sold into the rally, realizing additional gains. | Source: DexScreener The token’s price action managed to compensate the start of team unlocks, with enough buyers to absorb the newly unlocked tokens. Other whales are making riskier bets that TRUMP will break down from its local highs. One whale is shorting TRUMP on the perpetual DEX Hyperliquid, with a liquidation price of $20.57 . The wallet started shorting TRUMP with 2X leverage at $14.73, and is still holding the position. On centralized exchanges, TRUMP still sees a domination of long positions, as traders are cautious about shorting a volatile asset. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The Layer-2s will drain all the value, and users will migrate elsewhere, eventually getting eclipsed by Bitcoin,” said Charles Hoskinson. Vitalik Buterin’s Layer-Zero Update Buterin responded directly to Hoskinson’s comments, which predicted Ethereum’s collapse within 15 years if it continued relying heavily on Layer-2 solutions. In a bid to address these scalability challenges, Buterin unveiled an exciting Layer-Zero upgrade. This proposal suggests transitioning Ethereum from the traditional Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to a more efficient zkVM system, based on RISC-V standards. The upgrade promises major improvements, including up to 832 times fewer cycles than the current EVM and a 95.7% reduction in proving cycles. These advancements are expected to increase throughput by 30 times through GPU acceleration, significantly improving the network’s efficiency. Plus, proof compression could shrink from 346MB to just 1.5MB, creating a much more streamlined system. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Charles Hoskinson Confirms XRP Integration and Midnight Airdrop for Holders , A Path to Ethereum’s Long-Term Growth However, this Layer-Zero update could potentially reshape Ethereum’s scalability, offering a new path forward that doesn’t rely on Layer-2 solutions.

The Layer-Zero upgrade is a proposal to transition Ethereum’s base layer to a zkVM system, improving scalability and reducing transaction costs by enhancing the Ethereum Virtual Machine’s efficiency. Why does Charles Hoskinson believe Ethereum will not survive in the next 10-15 years?

The chart highlights strong similarities between XRP’s previous historical breakout and its current market structure, suggesting another significant upward movement may be approaching. The big breakout is coming soon. #XRP pic.twitter.com/HVWSio2rVQ — Amonyx (@amonbuy) April 25, 2025 Historical Accumulation Zone Mirrors Current Price Action In a prior statement reported by Times Tabloid , Amonyx posted, “The big breakout is coming soon. #XRP.” His latest analysis builds on this perspective by providing a visual representation of XRP’s market cycles. The chart he shared displays a triangular consolidation pattern that formed before XRP’s past explosive rally. Amonyx annotated the earlier accumulation zone with a yellow circle, noting the price compression that ultimately led to a breakout. He compared this historical structure directly to XRP’s current chart, implying that the same technical pattern is unfolding again. “Buying Under $20 Is a Blessing” — Amonyx Amonyx further emphasized the opportunity he believes investors have, stating, “Buying $XRP under $20 is a blessing from above.” This comment underscores his view that XRP remains undervalued at present levels and that its price may significantly increase. On the chart, XRP is trading just above $2, well below the $20 threshold he referenced. The setup indicates a gradual narrowing of the price range within a triangle formation, typically viewed by technical analysts as a precursor to a breakout when accompanied by historical precedent. Long-Term Targets Highlighted on Chart The technical chart presented by Amonyx shows key support and resistance levels, with a target zone drawn above the $20 range and potentially even higher, near $34.7850. This level is marked at the top of the chart as a possible long-term target, reinforcing the scale of the bullish movement he anticipates. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Additionally, the chart visually tracks a massive historical decline of approximately 90% after the previous peak, highlighting the cyclical nature of XRP’s price movements and suggesting that another positive cycle could be underway. Important dates are also highlighted on the chart, including long-term projections into 2028 and beyond, indicating that Amonyx views XRP’s potential breakout not just as a short-term event but as part of a broader and extended market cycle. The timeline suggests that while the breakout could happen soon, the full extent of XRP’s appreciation may unfold over several years. Technical Evidence Reinforces Market Expectations Amonyx’s analysis adds to the ongoing sentiment among XRP supporters who argue that XRP’s historical patterns support the case for an eventual strong price recovery. His emphasis on the current price level being a “blessing” further conveys his belief that the present market presents a rare buying opportunity. Based on the chart and analytical evidence shared by Amonyx, there is a clear conviction that XRP is poised for a major market move. As always, price predictions in the volatile cryptocurrency market remain speculative. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Market watchers are now focused on whether these gains will persist or fade. This article delves into the factors driving their recent performance and examines whether these coins are poised for further growth or at risk of cooling off. FET Price Trends: Short-Term Surge Amid Long-Term Setbacks FET gained 42.91% in a week and 44.99% over the month, yet it faced a 37.76% drop over the past six months. The recent upswing shows renewed investor interest and momentum, but the half-year decline points to caution amid volatility. Price movements indicate energetic buying in the short term, while longer-term bearish concerns persist. Strong rallies can occur, but previous significant drops highlight underlying issues. Current prices range between $0.32 and $0.68, with support near $0.19 and resistance around $0.91. Bulls are active within these levels, but an overbought RSI of nearly 79 suggests caution. Trading ideas involve watching for a bounce at support and a potential breakout above $0.91, while remaining alert to bear reversals if prices move lower. Toncoin Price Volatility: Mixed Trends and Key Support Zones Toncoin price dropped 18.33% in the last month and fell 34.08% over six months, with an 11.35% surge over the past week indicating brief recoveries amid overall declines. Recent moves highlight a volatile market experience characterized by sharp dips followed by short-lived rallies that offer little sign of sustained momentum. Current trading ranges sit between $2.92 and $4.73, with a nearby support level at $1.73 and resistance at $5.35, while $7.16 poses a secondary resistance. Bulls and bears both hold sway, with no clear trend in place. Trading within these levels may offer opportunities for cautious entry or exit based on movements around the key support and resistance areas. Conclusion FET and TON have shown significant gains recently. Both coins have strong backing and potential for growth. Their continued uptrend depends on market conditions and investor sentiment. If the positive momentum continues, FET and TON could see further price increases. However, if interest wanes, they might lose steam. Observing market trends and news will be key to understanding their future performance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While ETH is trying to find a way to rise after a series of difficult days, a new offer has arrived for Etheruem. The new Ethereum proposal proposes a dynamic structure to balance application revenue and fair fee extraction. Two members of the Ethereum community, Kevin Owocki and Devansh Mehta, have proposed a new Ethereum fee structure that aims to balance revenue and fee generation for application developers. The proposal suggests using a square root formula that proportionally reduces the percentage of fees as the fund capital allocated to a particular project grows. Owocki and Metha noted that if a particular app’s funding pool exceeds the $10 million level, fees will be capped at 1%. The duo added that this method will allow small app developers to develop decentralized applications without paying excessive fees, and that fees will be limited as developers scale their applications, encouraging project and fund growth. Owocki and Mehta’s proposal to strike a balance between revenue generation and profitability among Ethereum application developers comes at a time when Ethereum is lagging behind rivals like Solana (SOL). According to analytics platform Santiment, Ethereum fees fell to a five-year low in April 2025 due to low activity on the Ethereum base layer, resulting from reduced demand for smart contract transactions such as decentralized finance. The Solana network also had more developers than the Ethereum network in 2024. According to the data, SOL added 7,625 new developers compared to Ethereum’s 6,456 new developers. *This is not investment advice.

Recent developments—including El Salvador’s continued Bitcoin accumulation, Grayscale’s ETF push, and Michael Saylor hinting at a major new purchase—are reinforcing optimism across the market. Coupled with nearly $3 billion in fresh U.S. Bitcoin ETF inflows last week, Bitcoin appears well-positioned for a breakout. El Salvador Adds Bitcoin Despite IMF Constraints In a development boosting Bitcoin sentiment, El Salvador quietly added seven more Bitcoin worth over $650,000, according to its Bitcoin Office. This move comes despite the nation’s $1.4 billion IMF loan deal, which technically restricts further official BTC purchases. Experts suggest the government may be acquiring Bitcoin indirectly to navigate IMF terms while maintaining its crypto-friendly stance.

Though the push focuses on ETH, broader acceptance of crypto financial products would likely spill over positively into Bitcoin, enhancing institutional credibility. Adding to the bullish momentum, Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, hinted at another massive Bitcoin buy —potentially between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion. Big news in the crypto world!

April also saw whale wallets holding over $1 million in Bitcoin surge from 124,000 to 137,600, reflecting aggressive accumulation below $100K. U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs further reinforced the trend, recording nearly $3 billion in net inflows last week—the second-highest since launch. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Bulls Target $95,848 Breakout Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is rebounding sharply after defending critical support at $92,863, with the 50 EMA ($93,623) acting as dynamic support. MACD indicators are nearing a bullish crossover, suggesting buyers are regaining control. For beginners, this pattern is called a “trendline defense”—where price respects rising support, often leading to higher moves. If Bitcoin breaks above $95,848, it could clear a path toward $97,569 and possibly $99,420. Conversely, slipping below $93,600 could expose Bitcoin to a retest of $92,863. Trade Setup: Buy breakout: Above $95,848 Targets: $97,569 and $99,420 Support levels: $93,623 and $92,863 Stop-loss: Below $92,800 Patience remains crucial—waiting for a confirmed breakout can help avoid getting caught in false moves. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5M Milestone as 81% Yield Boosts Staking Demand Investor momentum behind BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) remains strong, with the Ethereum-based project officially surpassing the $5 million mark in its ongoing presale. As of today, $5.05 million has been raised out of a $5.74 million target, signaling rising urgency among buyers as the next price jump approaches. The current token price stands at $0.00248, offering a limited window before another repricing. High-Yield Staking with Flexible Access BTCBULL continues to set itself apart from typical meme assets by focusing on sustainable utility. The project’s staking program offers an estimated 81% annual yield, complemented by Bitcoin-backed distribution rewards. Crucially, users retain full liquidity with the ability to unstake anytime—no mandatory lockup periods or penalties. Latest Staking Snapshot: Total Tokens Staked: 1,293,025,857 BTCBULL Estimated Annual Yield: 81% APY Unstaking: Available at any time This flexible structure appeals to both yield hunters and investors seeking upside potential without giving up liquidity. Presale Snapshot: Final Stretch Before Repricing With less than $683,000 left before the next price adjustment, BTCBULL’s presale is rapidly entering its final stages at the current rate. Investors are securing positions before the project’s valuation steps higher. Presale Metrics (Updated): Token Price: $0.00248 USDT Raised: $5,058,002.58 out of $5,741,234 target BTCBULL combines an aggressive yield model with meme-token upside, carving out a niche for investors looking for more than just speculative trading.

At the same time, Cardano (ADA) seems poised for a significant price jump towards $1. This article dives into whether these coins are primed for growth, sparking curiosity about potential opportunities for keen investors. XRP Price Trends: Weekly Gains Amid Six-Month Surge The past month XRP shows a drop of 5.27% following a robust six-month surge of 331.66%, indicating a volatile yet resilient performance. Weekly gains of 8.08% contribute to a mixed chart, with the coin experiencing minor retracements amid broader upward momentum. Price fluctuations have been significant, marking notable changes over differing timeframes. The current price sits between $1.66 and $2.77, with resistance levels at $3.45 and $4.56 and support near $1.23 and $0.11. The RSI at 56.16 indicates mild bullish strength, while low oscillators suggest neither bears nor bulls firmly dominate. Trading within these key levels could favor short-term buys on breakouts and positions near support levels. Cardano ADA Positioned for Bullish Momentum with Key Support Levels Strong performance over the past half-year with a 114.41% gain contrasts with a steady month where there was no change. The numbers portray Cardano as having been gaining momentum over a longer period while holding relatively stable in the shorter term. Recent data indicates solid 6-month strength alongside modest short-term consolidation. Current trading shows price oscillating between $0.47 and $1.02, with immediate support at $0.27 and resistance at $1.37. There is no clear trend dominance yet, with slight bullish signals from momentum indicators. Traders might consider buying near support and monitoring resistance levels for further direction. Conclusion XRP shows signs of breaking higher due to a wedge pattern and increasing volume. ADA also appears poised for a significant increase, targeting the $1 mark. Both cryptocurrencies present opportunities for growth. Factors like established patterns and rising interest suggest that these assets may perform well in the near future. An informed decision could involve considering a long position on XRP and ADA as the market trends appear favorable. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

There is a list of use cases, growing daily, that show where Web3 technology is uniquely capable of solving problems that were considered impossible just a few years ago. Whether it is transparency, secure communications, distributed systems, or a community-driven governance, Web3 can accomplish more and more as the sea of developers and creatives uncover new uses and bring them to market. All of this is very optimistic and exciting, but it only happens if the Web3 infrastructure is solid. And one of the more critical areas to make or break the Web3 infrastructure is RPC functionality. RPC (Remote Procedure Call) nodes are a specialized asset within the Web3 ecosystem, acting as a server that takes in client requests and successfully executes them on a blockchain. They handle that crucial connection between dApps and the underlying blockchain, and the RPC infrastructure quality is an indication of the entire system’s quality. Unless you are in the RPC industry it’s not something you focus on, except when the system breaks down, can’t scale, or creates unacceptable errors/delays. Think of it like your neighborhood water or electricity. If you aren’t thinking about it, things are probably working well. If things are broken, it’s probably all you can think about. Within the industry are many different node providers, but because it is infrastructure focused, the larger players have traditionally had an edge as they can gain efficiencies that small and mid-sized node providers can’t. Web3 continues to upend traditional models, however, and by developing incredibly scalable and efficient digital infrastructure, the dominant advantage doesn’t always have to be which competitor has the most capital or reach. dRPC has gained more and more attention among Web3 players with its PAYG RPC platform, which is now considered an industry benchmark and is being replicated by some of the major blockchain players. The reason this model is so potent is that it creates scalability advantages for node providers no matter their size or reach, and based on the current roadmap has plans to unveil even more capabilities that providers will be able to use to level the playing field. Let’s focus on a few of these features from the perspective of small to mid-sized node providers to see just how much leverage the “little guy” can gain through these Web3 infrastructure innovations. Visibility and “Time to Correct Action” For any business, Web3 or otherwise, there is one metric that should be focused on as much as profit, speed, or quality. Summed up, this metric is “time to correct action.” This means that a given business, whether a single person operation or a global leader, should be working to reduce the time it takes to identify a needed action, bring that issue to the attention of the person who needs to know, interprets what the issue is into the action needed to solve it, and communicates that action to the person who can accomplish it. This is both a simple and obvious thing to do, but it often gets lost in the thousands of details happening within a business. Successful businesses seek to have an almost god-like awareness of their operations, know if anything goes wrong (ideally, they can predict before something goes wrong), and understand which action, lever, button, knob, etc. to adjust to solve the problem. For both physical businesses and digital platforms, the ability to have this god-like knowledge is more efficiently presented in dashboard format. The term “dashboard” is incredibly broad because it can represent a whiteboard that is manually updated once a day, or it can represent the innermost workings of a complex system, leading users efficiently to that minimum “time to correct action” metric that is so crucial for success. On the Web3 side, dRPC’s success with clients big and small focuses on leveling the playing field by understanding what information is needed and how clients can interact with it. Effectively, it allows a small team with this god-like knowledge of their node service to understand exactly what is happening, what might happen, and what to do about it. Called NodeHaus, the comprehensive dashboard provides in-depth visibility, control, and scalability for multi-provider RPC infrastructure. What maximizes the “time to correct action”, however, is an intuitive UX, actionable insights, and the robust analytics that can lead a user from problem to solution in minimum time. dRPC clients have had very positive reactions to the dashboard and are clamoring for more. This type of leverage represents the new standard, where those who are successful make the most of it, and those who fail didn’t adopt it quickly enough. It won’t be long before competitors are working to imitate the dashboard the way they have attempted to replicate the larger PAYG RPC model. Leveraging the Power of AI Along with visibility, insight, and “time to correct action”, is the ability to move from reactive to preventative measures. Monitoring your processes and acting quickly is important, and with unexpected issues this is the ideal strategy. However, the natural progression from process monitoring is process control. In other words, those god-like powers of observing what is happening start to extend outward to the near future. By having a clear picture of what is likely to happen, you can effectively change the future and prevent issues before they begin. While likely not the only player doing this, dRPC is also working to empower the small and mid-size providers through this type of “crystal ball” prediction. Instead of mystic powers, however, the best practice is employing AI predictive capabilities, combined with intelligent responses. This is upcoming for dRPC and will very probably see imitations as well from other players in the market. However, the ability to pull the right data and understand it makes a huge difference, and the architecture needed for a strong dashboard is undoubtedly going to be used here as well. The AI platform will act as an intuitive load balancer, preventing many of the issues before they have a chance to cause issues. dRPC has announced that the balancer will be open-source, and will allow users to scale their RPC infrastructure autonomously, on their infrastructure, for free. The ability to eliminate a single point of failure that would occur on a third-party is huge, especially for those small and mid-size providers. Optimizing your RPC infra just got easier. ✅We’ve rolled out updated pricing + a new calculator to estimate your potential savings with dRPC.Run the numbers ➡️ https://t.co/6ZZ8iZQQ4i pic.twitter.com/aqRekMYrVw — dRPC // All data from any blockchain in one place (@dRPCorg) March 28, 2025 Looking Ahead While technology continues to barrel forward, Web3 seems to have a unique ability to move fast and innovate with incredible results. Using very efficient development and service infrastructure, Web3’s leading platforms like dRPC have not just created new products, they have effectively supercharged players big and small across the industry. It’s these types of innovations that will continue to accelerate Web3’s progress faster than any other industry before it. At this rate, it should be very exciting to see what Web3 is capable of even a year or two from now. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

One area that’s been gaining significant traction is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), particularly Tokenized U.S. Treasurys . While this market is still relatively young, recent data highlights a striking concentration: just six funds currently hold a staggering 88% of the total assets in this burgeoning sector. This isn’t just a statistic; it reveals a lot about the current landscape and the major players shaping the future of finance. Understanding the Rise of Tokenized U.S. Treasurys Before diving into who holds the lion’s share, let’s quickly touch upon what Tokenized U.S. Treasurys are. Essentially, they are digital tokens issued on a blockchain that represent ownership or a claim on traditional U.S. Treasury bonds or bills. This process leverages blockchain technology to bring the benefits of traditional, stable assets into the digital asset ecosystem. Think of it as bridging the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). The appeal is clear: investors in the digital asset space can access the safety and yield typically associated with U.S. government debt, often considered one of the safest investments globally, without necessarily leaving the blockchain environment. This opens up new possibilities for portfolio diversification and yield generation within the digital asset landscape. Who Holds the Majority? The Dominant Players in Tokenized Assets According to data from RWA.xyz, as cited by Cointelegraph, the concentration in this market is undeniable. Six specific funds stand out, controlling the vast majority of Tokenized U.S. Treasurys . This level of concentration isn’t necessarily unusual for a nascent market, especially one involving large financial institutions, but it’s certainly noteworthy. Here are the key players leading the charge: BlackRock’s BUIDL: Leading the pack by a significant margin, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund holds approximately $2.5 billion in assets. BlackRock’s entry into this space signals a major endorsement from a traditional finance giant, attracting significant capital and attention. Franklin Templeton’s BENJI: Another major asset manager, Franklin Templeton, is a key player with its BENJI fund, holding around $707 million. Superstate’s USTB: Superstate also holds a substantial position with its USTB fund, accounting for roughly $661 million. Ondo’s USDY: Ondo Finance is a prominent name in the RWA space, and their USDY tokenized note holds about $586 million. Circle’s USYC: Known primarily for its USDC stablecoin, Circle also offers a tokenized Treasury product, USYC, with assets around $487 million. Ondo’s OUSG: Ondo appears again with its OUSG fund, holding approximately $424 million, further cementing its position in the tokenized RWA market. Combined, these six funds represent a significant portion of the total market capitalization for Tokenized U.S. Treasurys , illustrating that while the market is growing, it is currently dominated by a few key issuers. Why This Concentration in the RWA Market? The high concentration among a few funds can be attributed to several factors: Institutional First Movers: Large financial institutions like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have the brand recognition, infrastructure, and capital to launch such products at scale, attracting significant initial investment. Regulatory Navigation: Tokenizing securities involves navigating complex regulatory landscapes. Larger, established players are often better equipped to handle these challenges. Liquidity Aggregation: Centralizing assets within larger funds can potentially offer better liquidity for investors compared to a highly fragmented market. Investor Trust: Investors, especially institutions exploring Digital Assets , may initially prefer to allocate capital to products offered by well-known and trusted financial brands. This concentration suggests that the initial phase of growth in Tokenized Assets representing traditional securities is being led by established financial entities, bridging their existing client base and expertise with blockchain technology. What are the Benefits of Tokenizing Treasurys? Despite the concentration, the underlying technology and asset class offer compelling advantages: Increased Accessibility: Tokenization can lower the minimum investment threshold for accessing Treasurys, potentially opening them up to a wider range of investors globally. Improved Liquidity: While still developing, the goal is to enable peer-to-peer transfers and potentially faster settlement times on-chain compared to traditional markets. Transparency: Transactions recorded on a public or permissioned blockchain can offer a level of transparency not always present in traditional finance. Programmability: Tokenized assets can potentially be integrated into DeFi protocols, enabling new financial applications like using them as collateral for loans. Faster Settlement: Blockchain settlements can occur in minutes, compared to the T+2 (trade date plus two days) settlement cycle common in traditional bond markets. These benefits are driving interest and adoption, even if the market is currently top-heavy. Are There Challenges to Widespread Adoption? Absolutely. The path to widespread adoption of Tokenized Assets , including Treasurys, isn’t without hurdles: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory treatment of tokenized securities varies across jurisdictions and is still evolving, creating uncertainty for issuers and investors. Interoperability: Ensuring these tokens can seamlessly interact across different blockchains and traditional financial systems is crucial. Custody Solutions: Secure and reliable custody solutions for tokenized securities are still developing. Market Education: Educating traditional investors about the benefits and risks of digital assets and tokenization is necessary for broader adoption. Liquidity Development: While potential for improved liquidity exists, the market needs to mature significantly to rival the deep liquidity of traditional Treasury markets. Overcoming these challenges will be key to expanding the market beyond the current dominant players and attracting a more diverse range of participants. What’s Next for Tokenized Assets and RWA? The current concentration, led by initiatives like BlackRock’s BUIDL , could be seen as a stepping stone. As the market matures, we might see increased competition, more diverse offerings, and potentially a broader distribution of assets across more funds and individual investors. The trend of bringing RWA onto the blockchain is likely to continue, extending beyond Treasurys to other asset classes like real estate, private equity, and more. The infrastructure being built now by these early movers is paving the way for potentially significant shifts in how traditional assets are owned, traded, and managed in the future. Actionable Insights for Investors If you’re interested in the Tokenized U.S. Treasurys space, here are a few points to consider: Research the Issuers: Understand the fund manager, their track record, and the specific structure of the tokenized product (e.g., yield mechanism, underlying assets, blockchain used). Understand the Risks: Tokenization introduces new risks related to smart contracts, blockchain security, and regulatory changes, in addition to the market risks of the underlying asset. Evaluate Accessibility: Check which platforms or exchanges list these tokens and ensure they are accessible from your location. Consider Your Portfolio: Assess how tokenized Treasurys fit into your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. This market is dynamic, and staying informed about developments, particularly concerning key players and regulatory shifts, is essential. Compelling Summary: A Concentrated Beginning for Tokenized Treasurys The data showing six funds holding 88% of Tokenized U.S. Treasurys highlights the early-stage nature and institutional dominance of this market. Led by giants like BlackRock with its BUIDL fund, this concentration is a natural phase as large players leverage their resources and trust to build initial infrastructure and attract capital. While challenges related to regulation, liquidity, and education remain, the underlying benefits of tokenization – increased accessibility, transparency, and potential for integration with Digital Assets – suggest a promising future. The RWA market is clearly gaining momentum, and while currently concentrated, it represents a significant step towards bridging traditional finance with the innovative world of blockchain.

Cardano Holds Steady At $0.70 Levels Cardano is currently trading at $0.7241, up over 3% in the past day. Cardano has managed to hold steady at the $0.70 level. If ADA manages to stay above $0.70, it could target the next resistance at $0.764, potentially aiming for $1. However, if it drops below $0.70, the next support levels are $0.674 and $0.60.

ZETA’s price stood at $0.26 at the time of writing. While this performance reflects broader market dynamics, ZETA is gaining amid significant ecosystem developments, including a major integration with Avalanche (AVAX). ZetaChain price bounces amid integration with Avalanche A key driver behind ZETA’s recent price activity is ZetaChain’s integration with Avalanche , announced on April 24, 2025. Per the platforms, Avalanche, known for its high-throughput and near-instant transaction finality, joined ZetaChain’s Universal Blockchain ecosystem. This has allowed it to enable native cross-chain functionality with major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. ZetaChain 🟩 @zetablockchain · Follow Replying to @zetablockchain 3/ With Universal Apps, devs can build once and reach every major chain, natively — BTC, ETH, SOL, and now AVAX — all from a single contract. 8:30 pm · 24 Apr 2025 5 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply With the integration, developers can now deploy a single smart contract to access these chains without bridges or wrapping, fostering seamless Universal Apps. The integration aligns with industry trends toward streamlined cross-chain functionalities. ZetaChain offers the first Universal Blockchain, allowing for native access to any chain. As noted above, this includes non-smart chains like the world’s most popular blockchain network, Bitcoin. The support for Avalanche on mainnet unlocks further cross-chain user experience for users, including the more than 1.4 million active users on Avalanche. “By connecting Avalanche to the ZetaChain ecosystem, we future-proof your apps: whether Avalanche develops new architectures, novel DeFi projects, or new token standards, ZetaChain can incorporate them without requiring each dApp to rebuild bridging logic from scratch,” the ZetaChain team wrote in a blog . Gains for ZETA have come amid a bullish reaction from the community. ZETA’s price has bounced from lows of $0.24 and could eye $0.30, a key level over the past month. What could curtail the ZETA price in the short term? Despite the bullish momentum, ZETA faces potential headwinds due to an upcoming token unlock event. ZETA chart by CoinMarketCap Data from the token unlock tracking site Tokenomist shows ZetaChain is set to unlock 44.26 million ZETA tokens on May 1, 2025. The unlock value is around $11 million and will account for about 5.67% of the altcoin’s circulating supply. While ZetaChain’s integration with Avalanche has driven optimism, investors may throw in some caution due to the unlock. An influx of new tokens will likely temper ZETA’s recent gains, impacting short-term sentiment. If price dips, bears may target $0.19. On the upside, buyers will eye $0.50 and potentially $1 in the coming months.

With a growing ecosystem and a token that’s still early, the $FXG crypto presale is where smart investors are moving. And a major reason driving this trend is that FXGuys is solving traders’ issues.

Analyst Sets $11 as the Next Target for SUI: One of the Altcoins to Watch? SUI is slowly crawling back after taking a hit in the last market dump. It started 2025 strong, crossing $5 in January. But things got rough, and it dipped below $2 in March. Now, in Late April, SUI is back at $2.97 after a promising 44% price climb over the past week. This price recovery is not bad for a token trying to get its momentum back. Crypto analyst Bitcoinsensus thinks this might just be the beginning. He pointed out that SUI has broken a long-term resistance on the RSI chart and could hit $11.50 next. That’s a bold SUI price prediction! But anything’s possible in crypto. Still, when it comes to the best altcoins for high ROI in 2025, FXGuys tops the list every time. It’s rising in fame due to its crypto presale, with predictions of 100x gains post-launch.

According to Livingston, Saylor’s firm, Strategy, is buying half or more of the newly minted Bitcoin from miners each month, effectively tightening the available supply at an unprecedented rate. Currently, Bitcoin miners produce around 450 BTC per day, amounting to roughly 13,500 BTC per month. However, in the last six months alone, Strategy has accumulated approximately 379,800 BTC . This figure translates to about 2,087 BTC purchased daily—far surpassing the amount miners bring to the market each day. Livingston warns that as Bitcoin becomes scarcer, accessing it will require paying a premium. Lending against Bitcoin will become more expensive, and borrowing Bitcoin may eventually be a privilege reserved for nation-states and corporate giants. “BTC’s global cost of capital will no longer be set by ‘the market.’ It will be set by the gravitational policies of the first Bitcoin superpower: Strategy,” Livingston stated. Higher Prices and Growing Institutional Demand Livingston’s analysis suggests that Strategy’s aggressive buying could cause a severe Bitcoin supply crunch, leading to much higher prices if institutional and retail demand continues to rise. Supporting this view, Cypherpunk and Blockstream CEO Adam Back recently predicted that Strategy, along with other firms adopting Bitcoin corporate treasury strategies, could help drive Bitcoin’s total market capitalization to an astounding $200 trillion. Back described these firms as capitalizing on the gap between Bitcoin’s future value and today’s fiat economy, suggesting that their continued accumulation will have a major impact on Bitcoin’s price trajectory. As Bitcoin remains supply-capped, the aggressive strategies of these institutions could redefine the dynamics of the market in the coming years. Debate Around Risk and Centralization Despite the optimism, Strategy’s debt-fueled Bitcoin acquisition plan has drawn criticism. Skeptics warn that if Bitcoin enters a prolonged bear market, the company could face severe financial consequences, potentially introducing new systemic risks for the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Moreover, concerns about centralization are rising, given the sheer volume of Bitcoin now controlled by a single entity. However, Bitcoin advocate and author Saifedean Ammous has dismissed fears that the firm could manipulate the Bitcoin protocol. Ammous argued that major holders like BlackRock and Strategy would never support changes like increasing Bitcoin’s maximum supply, as it would severely harm their own financial interests—and their shareholders would likely push back against any such moves.

Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. Why is dYdX up today? Following the overall buying demand in the market, dYdX witnessed a surge in buying pressure. As a result, buyers are aiming for a hold above $0.66. Will dYdX Recover?

One of these forces is a menace, and has certainly affected each of us in a negative, predatory way. The other is an unsung hero, meant to be helpful overall, but actually has exactly what is needed to conquer the menace. What are these two forces and how do they affect you directly? Let’s dive in and explore. If The Service Is Free, Then You Are The Product There is a saying that has evolved in the world of free online services: “If the service is free, then you are the product.” It’s a little disturbing to hear it, but it’s absolutely true. Have you ever wondered why these modern miracles of the internet age are completely free? Search engines, email, social media, photo storage, AI chatbots, all of them free to use. How do these companies make any money? It’s not like they are charities, and if you pay attention you can easily see that the founders are the new billionaire tycoons of the modern age. The reason they make so much money is because they sell you, or at least your data. Data brokers and advertisers pay big money, and with tools like AI they can learn more about you than you probably know about yourself. They can and do use this data to manipulate you, advertise to you, and get you to spend money. The services themselves are free, but you pay for them at a price much higher than you realize. This is our world now, and because this business model has been so successful, we haven’t even tried to stop it until recently, and even then we are at an extreme disadvantage. It’s not like these services are easy to give up. We have made them an essential part of our lives, and to give them up would put you at a severe disadvantage socially, for your job, for your education, and for most things you need to accomplish during the day. So what can be done about this menace? Web3 Is The Unlikely Hero Web3 has been evolving for a number of reasons, but a key reason is a response against the control of your data. There is a growing community that wants to get rid of these companies who have their claws in our personal data, harvesting it without our consent, profiting from it without sharing, and using that data to further manipulate us. The decentralized nature of Web3 is perfect for this, and so is the ability to have control over your own data. Being able to turn data into a digital asset is more powerful than you might realize, because it actually solves two problems at once. Imagine that your personal data is like your house. Right now you have strangers living with you, taking your food, sleeping in your bed, doing pretty much whatever you want because you don’t have doors or locks on the house. Web3 allows you to put those doors and locks on when done right, keeping the inside of your house (your data) safe. However, it does something equally amazing. By having this control and being able to package up your assets, you could actually let certain parties in if they follow your rules and pay you. Instead of having squatters in your house who are stealing all your things, you have paid renters who have to follow the rules. How does Web3 do this? Let’s take iExec as an example, as they have been developing very interesting ways to monetize your digital assets using Web3. The first use of this is with messaging and privacy. Combining the two elements of keeping data safe and monetizing it, iExec has developed an interesting feature leveraging Web3 to accomplish both. Users can use their messaging apps like Telegram or even email , locking in their handle/address on their iExec Data Protector tool. This allows a layer of separation between the info and the recipients, allowing them to choose who can contact them. They utilize their Ethereum address to manage communication, so that you can send a message to someone’s email or Telegram without ever gaining knowledge of the address/handle. What benefit is this? First, this prevents the onslaught of spam and other unwelcome messages we are currently buried with, along with the risk of data/identity theft. Second, it allows the user, if they choose, to allow certain individuals and even brands to send them information, but with Web3 they can charge for the access. Instead of receiving spam each day that benefits everyone but you, you can have a curated list of messages that each come with your blessing and a reward. What a difference between the two mindsets, and this is a shining example of where Web3 can both create privacy and allow for monetization to reward users when they are willing to share certain access and info. The second example falls into the category of being rewarded for unused resources. Also with iExec, the Worker Pass NFT allows a holder to join a workerpool and start earning RLC tokens by providing computing power on the iExec Marketplace. Unused computing power, with your specific permission, can be used by others through the trusted third party in a way that pays rewards. This too is a major benefit of Web3, providing the infrastructure necessary to not just decentralize and protect, but to gather decentralized resources and create marketplaces. AI firms profit off your data without consent. Let's take back control. https://t.co/o57bGuNujd — iExec RLC (@iEx_ec) March 3, 2025 What’s Next? These examples are just the beginning, and there are many other platforms in the Web3 industry working to either safeguard privacy, enable monetization directly to those who own the assets (data, computing power, etc.), or both. This is one of those areas that will only grow stronger and more in demand as the goliath data brokers and megacompanies take your data and privacy itself, using it for their own benefit and leaving you with nothing but targeted spam. This, more than token speculation or digitized art NFTs, will drive Web3 into common usage as the larger population begins to understand that there is hope against the abuse of data.",Information,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-28 10:10:07
43898536,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153192,1745835037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Shift: Crypto Fear and Greed Index Enters Neutral Zone,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-neutral-11/,"Ever feel the pulse of the crypto market? It’s often driven by two powerful emotions: fear and greed. Understanding this collective sentiment is crucial, and that’s where the Crypto Fear and Greed Index comes in. Recently, this widely-watched indicator made a significant move, shifting from the ‘Greed’ zone into ‘Neutral’. What does this change signal for traders and investors? Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index The Crypto Fear and Greed Index , developed by Alternative.me, is designed to quantify the dominant emotions influencing the cryptocurrency market. Think of it as a barometer for market psychology. It operates on a simple principle: when the market is surging, participants tend to become greedy, potentially leading to irrational exuberance. Conversely, when prices plummet, fear can take hold, pushing people to sell irrationally. The index uses a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Indicates investors are very worried, potentially a sign of undervaluation or a buying opportunity for contrarians. 25-49: Fear – Sentiment is cautious or negative. 50-50: Neutral – The market is balanced, with no strong directional sentiment dominating. 51-74: Greed – Investors are becoming optimistic or greedy, potentially signaling overvaluation. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Indicates excessive optimism and potentially irrational behavior, often seen near market tops. As of April 28th, the index registered 54, a drop of seven points from the previous day. This specific movement pushed it out of the ‘Greed’ territory (which starts at 55) and firmly into the ‘Neutral’ zone. This wasn’t just a small fluctuation; it represented a noticeable cooling of market sentiment. What Caused the Shift in Crypto Market Sentiment? A seven-point drop in a single day is notable and suggests that the overall crypto market sentiment experienced a rapid change. While the index’s daily report doesn’t pinpoint exact causes, such shifts are typically triggered by a combination of factors influencing investor confidence. These can include: Significant price drops in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Negative news headlines (regulatory concerns, exchange issues, macroeconomic data). Sudden increases in market volatility. Changes in trading volume and momentum. Shifts in social media buzz or Google search trends related to crypto. The move from ‘Greed’ to ‘Neutral’ doesn’t necessarily mean the market is bearish, but it indicates that the previous bullish enthusiasm has moderated. It suggests investors are adopting a more cautious, wait-and-see approach rather than aggressively buying based on upward momentum. Decoding the Factors: Beyond Cryptocurrency Volatility It’s important to remember that the index isn’t based on just one metric. It’s a composite index, taking into account six different data sources to provide a holistic view of crypto market sentiment . Let’s break down these components and their weighting: The index weighs different factors to arrive at its score: Factor Weighting What it Measures Cryptocurrency Volatility 25% Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to average values over 30 and 90 days. High volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and market momentum compared to average values. High buying volume in a positive market suggests greed, while high selling volume suggests fear. Social Media 15% Scans Twitter for specific hashtags and analyzes the speed and number of posts. A high rate of interaction and positive sentiment can indicate greed. Surveys 15% Includes weekly polls conducted by Alternative.me, asking participants about their market outlook. (Note: This factor is currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. An increasing dominance can indicate fear (as investors flee riskier altcoins to Bitcoin), while decreasing dominance can signal greed (as altcoins rally). Google Trends crypto 10% Analyzes search query trends related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on Google. A surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” might suggest fear, while terms like “buy crypto now” could indicate greed. As you can see, it’s a blend of price action, trading activity, social buzz, and public interest captured through searches. A significant drop in the index suggests that several of these factors likely moved in a direction indicating increasing caution or fear among market participants. How Does Bitcoin Dominance Play a Role? The Bitcoin dominance factor (10% of the index) is particularly interesting. Bitcoin is often seen as the ‘safe haven’ asset within the volatile crypto space. When fear rises, investors sometimes sell off their altcoins and consolidate their holdings into Bitcoin, causing its market dominance percentage to increase. Conversely, during periods of high greed and bullishness, altcoins often experience parabolic rallies, causing Bitcoin’s dominance to decrease as money flows into smaller, riskier cap assets. Therefore, an increase in Bitcoin dominance can contribute to the index moving towards ‘Fear’, while a decrease can push it towards ‘Greed’. This component adds another layer of insight into where market participants are allocating their capital based on their risk appetite. Leveraging Google Trends Crypto and Other Data The inclusion of Google Trends crypto data (10%) highlights how mainstream interest and public curiosity influence sentiment. Spikes in searches for generic terms like “Bitcoin” or “cryptocurrency” during a bull run can signal retail investor FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), contributing to the ‘Greed’ score. Conversely, a sudden surge in searches for negative terms or explanations during a crash can indicate panic and contribute to ‘Fear’. Combined with cryptocurrency volatility , market momentum, and social media sentiment, these factors paint a picture of the market’s emotional state. While volatility and momentum are direct reflections of price action, social media and Google Trends offer a glimpse into the collective mindset of the broader public and crypto community. Using the Index: Benefits and Limitations The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a valuable tool, but like any indicator, it has benefits and limitations. Benefits: Quick Sentiment Check: Provides a fast, easy-to-understand snapshot of overall market mood. Contrarian Indicator: Some traders use it as a contrarian signal – buying during ‘Extreme Fear’ and selling during ‘Extreme Greed’. As the saying goes, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” Historical Context: Comparing the current level to historical values can offer perspective on the market’s position in a potential cycle. Limitations: Not a Perfect Predictor: It indicates current sentiment, not future price movements. A market can remain fearful or greedy for extended periods. Simplified View: It aggregates many factors into a single number, potentially oversimplifying complex market dynamics. Bitcoin-Centric: While it includes other factors, its components are heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance and dominance, which might not always perfectly reflect the entire altcoin market. Data Source Reliability: The accuracy depends on the reliability and interpretation of the underlying data sources. Therefore, the index should be used as one tool among many in an investor’s arsenal, complementing technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and risk management strategies. What’s Next? Navigating the Neutral Zone The move into the ‘Neutral’ zone (50-50) suggests a period of equilibrium. Neither fear nor greed has a strong upper hand. This can precede periods of consolidation, sideways price action, or increased uncertainty as the market waits for a new catalyst. For investors, the ‘Neutral’ zone might call for a more cautious approach, potentially waiting for a clearer signal before making significant moves. A sustained period in the ‘Neutral’ zone could mean the market is taking a breather, digesting recent price action, and waiting for fresh news or economic data to dictate the next trend. Alternatively, it could be a brief pause before sentiment quickly shifts back towards fear or greed based on upcoming events. Summary: Reading the Market’s Emotional Pulse The recent seven-point drop in the Crypto Fear and Greed Index , pushing it into the ‘Neutral’ zone at 54, is a clear signal that the market’s collective mood has moderated from its previous state of ‘Greed’. This index, which considers factors like cryptocurrency volatility , market momentum, social media, Bitcoin dominance , and Google Trends crypto , provides valuable insight into investor psychology. While not a crystal ball, understanding this shift in crypto market sentiment from ‘Greed’ to ‘Neutral’ helps investors gauge the prevailing emotions, potentially identify contrarian opportunities, and inform their overall strategy in the dynamic world of digital assets. Staying informed about these sentiment indicators is key to navigating the market effectively.

43898623,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-projects-prepare-battle-privacy-switzerland,1745835166,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Crypto projects prepare to battle for privacy in Switzerland,https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-projects-prepare-battle-privacy-switzerland?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Switzerland has long been seen as a beacon of privacy where companies, organizations and wealthy people put down roots in an effort to avoid the prying eyes of the rest of the world. Joining this cohort are many Web3 projects, which also appreciate the Swiss government’s generally positive stance toward blockchain and digital assets. The country’s reputation as a privacy haven has resulted in Switzerland becoming a hub for privacy projects establishing their foundations or development entities there, including Nym, Session and Hopr — joining traditional privacy software companies such as Proton and Threema. Now, a proposed change to a Swiss surveillance ordinance is worrying these same projects, as it would spell a marked increase in the government’s user monitoring requirements. But the decentralized nature of crypto may offer a solution for those wishing to preserve their privacy in a climate of increasing surveillance. Switzerland is a privacy haven — or maybe not Switzerland has long been considered by many to have some of the world’s strongest privacy protections. As Proton, the company behind the encrypted Proton Mail email service, argued in a 2014 blog post titled “Why Switzerland?”, the Central European country offers several advantages: Companies are outside of the jurisdiction of the US and EU, the country is politically neutral, there are strong constitutional privacy protections, and there is established infrastructure. Kee Jeffries, technical co-founder of decentralized private messaging app Session, recently told Cointelegraph’s The Agenda podcast that it was important to establish the foundation “in a country which has a long history of preserving people’s personal privacy and freedom of speech.” However, all governments must ultimately balance citizen privacy and national security concerns. In Switzerland, surveillance is governed by the Ordinance on the Surveillance of Correspondence by Post and Telecommunications (OSCPT). In January, the Swiss Federal Council proposed a revision to the OSCPT that would increase user monitoring requirements for telecommunications service providers and widen the definition of who meets these requirements to include services such as VPNs, social networks and messaging apps. In short, as they are currently written, the changes would require service providers that serve at least 5,000 users to identify all users and willfully decrypt all communications that are not end-to-end encrypted. Privacy projects fight back against surveillance The move has been met with widespread backlash from the privacy community. Proton CEO Andy Yen has threatened to fight the government in court and potentially pull the company out of the country. Decentralized VPN provider Nym issued a public call to action for Swiss citizens to contact their representatives and oppose the action. Source: Andy Yen In a statement, Nym’s chief operating officer, Alexis Roussel, said the ordinance by the Federal Council “is destroying an entire sector,” adding: “This ordinance directly endangers the people who use these services.” Sebastian Bürgel, vice president of technology at Gnosis and founder of decentralized mixnet Hopr, echoed the concerns of Yen and Roussel, telling Cointelegraph the move would likely backfire. “If the intent is to limit the privacy and anonymity that services such as Proton Mail, Proton VPN and Threema are providing, that will not change much because those entities will potentially leave Switzerland if that were to happen,” he said. “But again, the consequences will be borne by everyone out there and everyone who’s actually in Switzerland.” Related: Keeping crypto cypherpunk protects users from censorship and corporatism — Gnosis VP Meanwhile, Ronald Kogens, a legal partner at Swiss law firm MME who focuses on Web3 and fintech, told Cointelegraph that it’s unclear whether the Swiss Federal Council even has the authority to implement such changes. “In an ordinance, you cannot include any heavy rights or obligations which have a strong impact on individuals in Switzerland,” he shared, saying that the Federal Council is essentially an executive body and that laws must pass through parliament. “One question you could ask is, does the Federal Council have the power, based on the laws where it stated that they can enact an ordinance, the power to do this, what they’re doing now?” Are Swiss crypto projects at risk? The move by the Swiss Federal Council is damaging Switzerland’s privacy reputation, but decentralized technologies like blockchain networks may offer a lifeline. According to Kogens, truly decentralized projects should be exempt from the new surveillance requirements. “In my opinion, most Web3 activities are not affected because [...] the pure offering of software without running any infrastructure for the whole messaging or communication system is not covered by this,” he told Cointelegraph. “You have to have specific servers or clients that you operate that are an essential part of the communication or messaging service.” Either way, the more decentralized a project is, the less any government can influence its operations. Take, for example, Tornado Cash, which has continued chugging along for years despite multiple developers being arrested and the US sanctioning its smart contracts at one point. Nym CEO Harry Halpin told Cointelegraph in March that “in theory, we should be able to get run over with a car, and the network would keep operating.” “Hopr, as an example of Web3 infrastructure, does not operate infrastructure, right?” said Bürgel. “Hopr Association is involved in software development and research and development, but we are not an operator of a network.” The fact that the Hopr network is fully decentralized and anonymous means the Hopr Association could not actually give any information about its users to Switzerland, even if it were legally compelled. “Individual node runners which are participating in it, or other third parties, cannot tell who is using the Hopr network to access any kind of web service. That is the explicit goal of what we are undertaking.” The future of privacy in Switzerland The Swiss Federal Council’s proposed changes to the OSCPT are still in the consultation phase, with the public encouraged to offer feedback on the proposal through May 6. Kogens told Cointelegraph that the council will review the feedback, create a final report, and decide whether to adjust the proposal. “That happens quite a lot,” he said, “because in the end, it’s not in the interest of Switzerland to do something which harms the industry, as long as they still can fulfill their goal, which they have with this surveillance act.” Source: Nym But even if the changes go through as written, there could be some positive knock-on effects for the crypto space. “It may be that the silver lining is that it will drive users to decentralized and privacy-facilitating solutions instead,” said Bürgel. “It is clear to everyone that more surveillance is bad,” he added. “Every single individual understands that.” “Taming the surveillance machinery is a goal of Web3.

With tariffs stirring global tensions and markets thrashing in response, the search for stability looked unusually uncertain. Yet amid the turmoil, Bitcoin quietly stepped into a role many had long debated it could fill. Recent performance data points to a shift: Bitcoin behaving less like a high-risk tech stock and more like the store of value its earliest believers envisioned. And if this trend deepens, it could have wide-reaching effects across the crypto market. Bitcoin's Growing Role as a Store of Value Could Reshape Crypto's Trajectory Recent market behavior indicates that Bitcoin is beginning to mature into the asset its early supporters envisioned. During a month marked by extreme volatility, where traditional safe havens like the Swiss Franc, gold, and even US Treasuries wavered under pressure, Bitcoin demonstrated an unusual level of resilience. NYDIG’s research highlights a noteworthy change in its behavior. Bitcoin appeared less correlated to traditional equities and more aligned with the attributes of a non-sovereign store of value. This shift carries important implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. When Bitcoin starts behaving in a way that mirrors gold's historical performance during times of uncertainty, it signals a potential transformation in investor psychology. Confidence in Bitcoin's stability could spill over into other parts of the crypto ecosystem, encouraging more capital inflows not only into Bitcoin itself but also into projects that offer complementary value propositions. Sectors that emphasize decentralization, censorship resistance, and financial autonomy could see amplified interest. Tokens tied to emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, decentralized finance innovations, or projects that align with political or economic hedge narratives may benefit the most. As traditional financial systems show signs of stress, the migration toward digital alternatives could accelerate, creating a favorable environment for selective growth across the crypto space. The projects most attuned to this evolving market preference are likely to be the ones that outperform. Best Crypto to Buy Now With Crypto’s Increasing Influence Solaxy - SOLX As global confidence in traditional finance falters, blockchain projects that strengthen interoperability are becoming essential infrastructure. Solaxy steps directly into this emerging need by offering a Layer 2 network designed to facilitate transactions across both Solana and Ethereum. At its core, Solaxy aims to erase the friction that often divides blockchain ecosystems, enabling users to transfer assets swiftly and at reduced cost without sacrificing security. The project’s value becomes even more pronounced when considering Bitcoin’s growing reputation as a non-sovereign store of value. As investors deepen their exploration into decentralized systems, they will demand smooth movement of assets across chains—a need that Solaxy is strategically positioned to meet. Beyond bridging transactions, Solaxy also offers staking opportunities with attractive yields, catering to users who seek passive income streams within trusted ecosystems. Its dual-chain focus is particularly relevant given the rising interest in both Solana and Ethereum for decentralized finance applications. If crypto adoption accelerates in the aftermath of financial uncertainty, infrastructures like Solaxy that facilitate cross-chain liquidity could see rapid user growth. With technical efficiency, relevant utility, and a clear problem-solving orientation, Solaxy is more than a facilitator—it is an enabler of the multi-chain future the crypto world increasingly gravitates toward. SUBBD - SUBBD SUBBD is more than a token; it is a challenge to the traditional platforms that have long dictated how creators interact with their audiences. Built with the specific aim of empowering creators through decentralization, SUBBD introduces a new standard where ownership, autonomy, and fair monetization converge. The platform offers creators the ability to tokenize their work, build direct relationships with supporters, and control how their content is distributed and monetized—all without interference from corporate gatekeepers. In a world increasingly skeptical of centralized control, SUBBD’s mission gains critical relevance. If Bitcoin’s rise as a store of value highlights the global appetite for decentralization, then SUBBD reflects that appetite within the creator economy. It turns creative output into digital assets with measurable, tradeable value, enabling artists, influencers, and thinkers to finally own their audiences and earnings. The utility behind SUBBD’s token is layered. Beyond acting as a medium of exchange within its marketplace, $SUBBD fuels governance decisions, meaning users have a real voice in shaping platform evolution. The project, covered by many content creators, has received much traction already, with top names like 99Bitcoins also covering it as a high-potential initiative. As the traditional content economy faces mounting criticism for exploitation and control, platforms like SUBBD could represent the natural migration point for both creators and audiences seeking fairness and transparency. Projects empowering individual sovereignty stand to thrive in the new financial paradigm, and SUBBD’s alignment with this ethos positions it well for future growth. Fantasy Pepe - FEPE Fantasy Pepe delivers an ambitious blend of meme culture, artificial intelligence, and fantasy sports—three of the most resilient entertainment trends of the digital era. It is an AI-powered fantasy football platform where players create teams, strategize, and earn rewards, all wrapped within the humorous and viral aesthetic of the Pepe meme. However, beneath the playful branding lies serious technology and a clear use case. The platform’s AI capabilities help optimize fantasy team decisions, offering players real data-driven advantages instead of leaving outcomes entirely to chance. This intersection of artificial intelligence and gaming introduces a new standard for fairness and competitiveness within fantasy sports. Furthermore, staking options for Fantasy Pepe's native token create avenues for passive rewards, linking entertainment with earning potential. Fantasy Pepe’s design becomes particularly important in an environment where the financial world is redefining its understanding of value and ownership. As more individuals look to decentralized systems for security and growth, gamified ecosystems with transparent reward mechanisms become appealing alternative outlets. Fantasy Pepe captures attention through memes but retains engagement through utility and continuous incentives. In a market shifting toward both decentralization and entertainment-driven applications, Fantasy Pepe fits neatly into the narrative. It is not merely another memecoin; it is a gamified platform with embedded intelligence, offering an experience that matches both the cultural and technological expectations of the next generation of crypto adopters. BTC Bull - BTCBULL BTC Bull is a project built with a sharp understanding of what drives long-term relevance in crypto: a strong cultural connection paired with a meaningful ideological foundation. Rooted in the philosophy that Bitcoin is not merely an asset but a movement toward financial independence, BTC Bull embraces this vision while adding a fresh layer of community-driven energy through its meme coin framework. However, developers believe that BTC Bull is more than symbolic. The project ties itself closely to Bitcoin's core narrative of decentralization and sovereignty, channeling those values into an ecosystem that rewards participation, engagement, and belief in the future of decentralized finance. Its presale design, community incentives, and transparent operational structure reflect a genuine effort to create a token that stands for something larger than speculation. This positioning is especially timely. As Bitcoin shows early signs of achieving the ""store of value"" status that its architects hoped for, the broader appetite for projects that reinforce Bitcoin’s ideals is likely to expand. BTC Bull offers investors a dual proposition: participation in a cultural phenomenon and alignment with the original ethos of cryptocurrency. By merging identity, belief, and community action, BTC Bull taps into a trend that goes beyond short-term gains. In a financial world increasingly questioning traditional systems, crypto assets that resonate both emotionally and ideologically could become pivotal pillars of the next growth wave. BTC Bull seems well-prepared to seize that opportunity. Conclusion The changing perception of Bitcoin as a true store of value signals more than just a shift in asset preference. It reflects a deeper realignment in how individuals approach security, autonomy, and opportunity in an increasingly uncertain world. As trust in traditional systems shows signs of strain, the migration toward decentralized solutions may only accelerate. For investors watching these developments closely, the path forward favors projects that boast innovation, resilience, and concepts built with the future in mind.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has approved ProShares' application to launch the XRP Futures ETF on April 30. According to the proposal, ProShares, a company that already offers Bitcoin ETFs, now seeks to provide three XRP-linked ETFs. The first is the Ultra XRP ETF with 2x leverage, the Short XRP ETF with inverse leverage, and the Ultra Short XRP ETF with inverse (-2x) leverage. This approval has led to a parabolic increase in the XRP price, as the token is registering over a 4% increase in the last 24 hours. As market conditions grow bullish, it also indicates that the time is right to find the best crypto to buy now. What Does XRP ETF Approval Mean for Investors? The first thing that the community needs to know is that these aren't the first XRP-linked ETFs. The first XRP Futures ETFs went live for trading on the New York Stock Exchange on April 8th. Furthermore, ProShares has also opted for XRP Spot ETFs, which are yet to be approved. A similar product known as Hashdex was approved in Brazil last week . But being first is not the core USP here; it is the race to get more adoption for crypto within the regulatory framework, and it seems like the community is winning. Trading around the $2.28 level at the time of writing, XRP has a market cap of $133 billion. The current traction that XRP has been getting is outshining the likes of Ethereum, leading analysts like Geoffrey Kendrick to believe that XRP will overtake Ethereum soon to become the world's biggest altcoin by market capitalization. Furthermore, the US XRP ETF push can potentially drive the XRP price above the $3.5 mark, based on the current technical analysis. The technicals are based on the premise that the XRP approval on Wednesday could raise the price to higher highs due to the current market conditions. An ascending triangle has already formed, after which the next resistance will be around the $2.5 level. After that, the $3.0 mark will be tested, and then the goal will be to topple the previous all-time high level: $3.4. As the market conditions grow bullish, the focus should be on finding the best crypto to buy now, since XRP's consequent growth will likely permeate through the entire cryptocurrency space. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Top 4 List Listed below are the best cryptocurrencies that could profit from XRP gaining momentum. SUBBD While SUBBD is not in the same playing field as XRP, XRP's focus on ultra-fast transactions and ease of payment is what makes SUBBD one of the best contenders as a leading crypto to buy into. Powering a content creation platform of the same name, SUBBD is an AI-driven ecosystem giving creators a chance to upsell their content and sell it through a decentralized platform. The AI tools available on the website allow creators to get paid quickly and perform administrative tasks without much hassle. Creative tools such as an AI Influencer will also be added within the SUBBD domain to provide creators with better ways to offer content. Fans of these creators will be able to leverage the SUBBD token to access exclusive content and collaborate with their favorite creators. There are staking rewards as well as gamification models to make the ecosystem worthwhile.

A combination of these perks gives SUBBD a positive vibe, potentially making it one of the leading assets that could gain from XRP’s bullish momentum. BTC Bull XRP's massive growth is not a feat that Ripple achieved on its own; Bitcoin's growth is also a great factor. However, while Bitcoin's growth impact on XRP was passive, BTC Bull creates an ecosystem where this impact is more active. Described as a meme coin and a social movement of bulls behind Bitcoin, BTC Bull is a meme coin project whose identity is tied to Bitcoin. Its total supply of 21 billion vaguely mirrors Bitcoin, and its core mechanics rely on Bitcoin's growth. These mechanics — token burns and Bitcoin airdrops — unlock whenever Bitcoin reaches a new high. The first target is $125K, and these mechanics will continue to unlock until Bitcoin reaches the $225K mark. When BTC reaches $250K, BTC Bull will launch a BTCBULL airdrop. The long mechanic of BTC Bull plays on the speculative nature of the cryptocurrency market. And it's that honesty that has allowed the cryptocurrency to raise upwards of $5 million to date. The simplified approach may likely help the token's value go up even further in due time. Fantasy Pepe Blending the quirky themes of Pepe with the futuristic style of AI is Fantasy Pepe. Modeled after the concepts of Fantasy Football, Fantasy Pepe breaks the norm of traditional betting platforms to provide an ecosystem that blends narratives and use cases flawlessly. The teams it has created are inspired by several memes, and the managers of these teams are the key players. There is ChatGPT on one side, bringing its stylistic approach into the mix, and on the other, there is DeepSeek, bringing its inquisitiveness to the forefront. Refereeing the game is Grok, an X-based AI model that has made immense waves recently. As token holders, players will be able to wager on 60-second matches that will also feature radio-style live commentary. Winners will gain additional tokens as well as NFT rewards. These digital rewards may soon turn into real-life perks as Fantasy Pepe is also planning to collaborate with leading football teams. Over $230K has been raised by this project already, and more people are getting attracted to it. Multiple YouTubers, including Stock Investor, have covered this project. The YouTuber has highlighted that this meme coin could leverage Pepe's popularity and the AI narrative to gain a major boost in 2025, potentially becoming one of the biggest meme coins on the market. Similar to XRP, Fantasy Pepe also has a narrative that it gains strength from, and that strength will likely turn it into a 10x project after release, on the condition that the market remains bullish. Summary The approval of XRP ETFs shows the rise in efforts from those on the regulatory front to make crypto mainstream. The surge happening right now will likely create better market conditions, allowing crypto ICOs to explode upon listing. Some of these ICOs have been added to this ""best crypto to buy now"" list. All of them provide a unique style and narrative, both of which could give them a short-term boost. Furthermore, these projects have unique use cases as well that could help them gain more traction in the market. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, JP Morgan Chase has approved XRP for use within its banking payment framework. If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, XRP could remain in a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average price of $4.89.

There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum XRP price will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. XRP Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP’s price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029.

43898813,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153193,1745835640,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Economic Events: Crucial Data Ahead for Crypto Market Impact,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/economic-events-crypto-impact/,"Hey crypto enthusiasts! Ready to navigate the potentially choppy waters of the market this week? While cryptocurrency charts grab most of our attention, smart traders and investors know that the broader economic landscape plays a huge role in market movements. This week is packed with significant economic events that could send ripples across global financial markets, including our beloved crypto space. Ignoring these signals could mean missing key opportunities or being caught off guard by volatility. Understanding How Macroeconomic Data Affects the Crypto Market You might wonder, “Why should I care about jobs numbers or inflation data when I’m trading Bitcoin or Ethereum?” Great question! The answer lies in the intricate relationship between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset world. Major macroeconomic data releases provide insights into the health of economies, central bank policy intentions (like interest rates), and overall investor sentiment. These factors directly influence risk appetite. When the economic outlook is uncertain or central banks signal tighter monetary policy (like raising interest rates), investors often become more risk-averse, potentially pulling capital from assets perceived as riskier, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, positive data or signals of looser policy can increase confidence and risk appetite. Think of it this way: economic data acts like a barometer for the global financial climate. Changes in that climate can affect the winds blowing through the crypto market impact , influencing price trends and volatility. Key Economic Events Shaping the Week Ahead Here’s a look at the crucial economic events on the calendar this week. Remember, all times listed are in UTC, so adjust for your local time zone! Wednesday, April 30th: A busy day with multiple significant releases. Thursday, May 1st: Holidays in major Asian economies and a key central bank decision. Friday, May 2nd: The week concludes with one of the most anticipated U.S. reports. Let’s break down some of the most impactful ones: Diving into Key GDP Data Releases Wednesday, April 30th brings important updates on economic growth. At 09:00 UTC , we get the EU GDP (Q1) data. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the broadest measure of economic activity. It represents the total value of goods and services produced. For the EU, this data gives us a pulse on the economic health of the Eurozone. Stronger-than-expected GDP could signal economic resilience, while weaker data might point to headwinds. While not as direct as U.S. data for the predominantly USD-denominated crypto market, the health of major global economies still contributes to overall market sentiment. Later, at 12:30 UTC , the focus shifts to the U.S. GDP (QoQ) (Q1) . This is arguably the most critical GDP release of the week. The U.S. economy is the world’s largest, and its performance heavily influences global markets. Quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) GDP measures the change in the total value of goods and services produced compared to the previous quarter. A robust GDP reading suggests a strong economy, which could lead the Federal Reserve to maintain a tighter monetary policy stance to prevent overheating. Conversely, a weak reading might increase expectations for interest rate cuts or other stimulus measures. Both scenarios can significantly impact risk asset valuations, including crypto. Pay close attention to whether the actual numbers beat, meet, or miss analyst expectations. Surprises are what typically move markets. Understanding PCE Inflation and Its Potential Effects Inflation data remains paramount for central banks and markets, and Wednesday, April 30th at 14:00 UTC brings the U.S. PCE Price Index (March) . The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index is the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation. Unlike the more commonly cited Consumer Price Index (CPI), PCE accounts for shifts in consumer spending habits and has different weighting. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is particularly watched by the Fed for underlying inflation trends. Why is this crucial for the crypto market impact ? High and persistent inflation puts pressure on the Fed to keep interest rates higher for longer or even raise them further. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing and make traditional, safer investments like bonds more attractive relative to risk assets like stocks and crypto. If the PCE data shows inflation is cooling faster than expected, it could reinforce hopes for future rate cuts, which is generally seen as positive for risk assets. If it shows inflation remaining sticky or reaccelerating, it could dampen market sentiment. This report provides vital clues about the Fed’s potential next moves regarding monetary policy. The Anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls Report Saving one of the biggest market movers for last, Friday, May 2nd at 12:30 UTC features the highly anticipated U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls (April) report. This report measures the number of people employed in the U.S. during the previous month, excluding farm workers and some government/non-profit employees. It’s a key indicator of the health of the U.S. labor market. Alongside the headline number (how many jobs were added), markets also scrutinize the unemployment rate and average hourly earnings (wage growth). A strong Nonfarm Payrolls report (many jobs added, low unemployment, rising wages) indicates a tight labor market and a strong economy. Like strong GDP or sticky inflation, this can signal the Fed may need to maintain tighter policy to cool things down, potentially negatively impacting risk assets. Conversely, a weak report (fewer jobs added, rising unemployment, slowing wage growth) suggests the economy is slowing, which might prompt the Fed to consider easing monetary policy sooner. This could be viewed positively for assets like crypto. The Nonfarm Payrolls report often causes significant volatility across all financial markets immediately upon release, including crypto. Other Notable Events This Week While GDP, PCE, and NFP are major highlights, other events are also on the radar: Wednesday, April 30th, 12:15 UTC: U.S. ADP Nonfarm Employment Change (April) – This is a private-sector payrolls report released before the official NFP data. While not always perfectly correlated, it can provide a preview of the labor market’s strength and sometimes cause preliminary market reactions. Thursday, May 1st: Holidays in China and S. Korea (Labor Day) – Be aware that markets in these significant Asian economies will be closed, potentially affecting liquidity and trading volumes during those hours. Thursday, May 1st, 03:00 UTC: Japan BoJ Interest Rate Decision – While focused on Japan, decisions by major central banks like the Bank of Japan can influence global currency markets and overall sentiment. Thursday, May 1st, 12:30 UTC: U.S. Initial Jobless Claims – This weekly report tracks the number of people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time. It’s a timely indicator of the labor market’s health, though less impactful than NFP unless there’s a significant surprise. Navigating Crypto Market Impact: Actionable Insights So, how can you use this information to navigate the potential crypto market impact this week? Stay Informed: Know when these key reports are scheduled and be aware of consensus expectations beforehand. Expect Volatility: Major data releases often precede price swings. If you’re trading, be prepared for potential sharp moves. Consider adjusting position sizes or using stop-losses. Look for Surprises: Markets tend to react most strongly when the actual data deviates significantly from what economists expected. Understand the ‘Why’: Don’t just look at the numbers. Understand what a ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ number implies for the economy and, crucially, for central bank policy. Consider the Bigger Picture: No single data point tells the whole story. These reports add pieces to the larger economic puzzle. Risk Management is Key: Given the potential for volatility, ensure your risk management strategy is solid. Don’t overextend yourself based on a single report. Conclusion This week presents a packed schedule of significant economic events that have the potential to influence financial markets globally, including the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. From crucial GDP data and the Fed’s preferred PCE inflation gauge to the highly anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls report, these releases offer vital insights into the health of major economies and the likely path of monetary policy. Understanding these indicators is not just for traditional finance players; it’s increasingly essential for anyone looking to navigate the crypto market impact effectively. By staying informed and understanding the potential implications of this week’s data, you can be better prepared for potential market movements and make more informed decisions.

Related News: There Was a Huge Jump in the Altcoin That Binance Controversially Delisted! What's the Reason? While analysts noted that there was no specific catalyst for the rise in XMR, blockchain security expert ZachXBT explained that the reason for the rise in XMR was a hacker. According to ZachXBT's post, a hacker converted the stolen $330.7 million worth of Bitcoin into XMR, and the XMR price jumped. ZachXBT noted that around nine hours ago, an address starting with “bc1qcr” was hacked and 3,520 BTC (worth $330.7 million) was stolen. The hacker then laundered the stolen funds across more than six exchanges and converted them into Monero (XMR), which caused a significant increase in XMR prices. “A hacker made a suspicious transfer of 3520 BTC (worth $330.7 million) from an address nine hours ago.

With the DeFi protocol on the Solana blockchain gaining over the past week at +21%, what are likely catalysts for further price gains? Could KMNO however face downward pressure in the short term? Two bullish catalysts for Kamino price Kamino is emerging as a significant player in the Solana ecosystem and overall crypto space. After introducing Kamino Meta-Swap to deliver the best price execution for token swaps on Solana earlier this month, the protocol has made another major announcement — the release of its v2 upgrade is imminent. Lending V2 is billed as Kamino’s biggest upcoming update, with the platform eyeing a total reshaping of lending on Solana. This release, with the protocol’s growth over the past year could be key to another leg up for KMNO amid demand. “KaminoFinance is in total growth mode. The lending platform keeps breaking ATHs in supply and borrows since early 2024. The Multiply feature’s max leverage increased from 5x to 7.5x, which is attracting more liquidity ahead,” Syndica wrote . KMNO may also gain a massive upside flip from the overall crypto market push. The token is up more than 20% in the past week and has been trending up. The trendline offers a key support base that means a break above $0.065 will bring $0.10 and $0.15 into bulls’ view. An analyst on X suggests KMNO price may see a significant surge by end of the year. “Fundamental catalysts include TVL continuing to grow, which will be further accelerated once RWAs enter the scene,” said Rendoshi Takamoto. Rendoshi Tokamoto ⭕️ @Rendoshi1 · Follow $KMNO starting a new uptrend here.With my $SOL base case being new ATH by EOY, I think $KMNO can 10x by EOY.Fundamental catalysts include TVL continuing to grow, which will be further accelerated once RWAs enter the scene. 11:19 am · 25 Apr 2025 8 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply Kamino price: bears eye $14 million token unlock However, apart from the bullish v2 release and overall SOL tokens gains, Kamino price may face short term bearish pressure due to an upcoming KMNO unlock. Per Tokenomist , Kamino Finance is scheduled for a significant “cliff” token unlock on April 30, 2025. The unlock will release 229.17 million KMNO tokens. At current prices, that’s valued at $14.30 million, accounting for 13% of its circulating supply. Such a large percentage of the circulating supply being unlocked is something to watch. Massive selling at once might negatively impact KMNO’s price in the short term. However, the overall bullish outlook means a rebound from key support levels could propel KMNO to its recently hit all-time high.

Decentralization is often idealized in crypto, but its real impact depends on how well it scales and solves real-world problems. It’s about empowering people, not just creating something that sounds good on paper. In decentralized physical infr astructure networks, decentralization encourages global participation and rewards real contributions. But the question remains, who takes responsibility when something breaks, when no single entity is in charge? You might also like: For AI that serves people, data curation DePINs hold the key | Opinion While decentralization promises financial freedom, today’s cryptocurrency markets remain anything but stable or decentralized. Amidst the supposed cryptocurrency ‘Bull Run’, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq have logged their worst quarterly performance since the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic—a volatility that extends to crypto as financial and governmental institutions become increasingly entangled. Fiat’s crisis of confidence is crypto’s opportunity This unstable market reminds me of what Satoshi Nakamoto warned about years ago, in the Bitcoin ( BTC ) whitepaper: “ The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust .” We’ve since then taken the core principle of decentralization and applied it far beyond—into self-sovereign IDs, DeFi, DAOs, DePIN, and DeSci. But while we’ve been quick to add “De-” to every industry, we haven’t always added the same rigor to questions of responsibility, reliability, and repair. The less glamorous but essential parts of building systems that actually work. Crypto can remove the need for trust, but can it handle responsibility Decentralization empowers, but it also raises a critical question: In a world without central authority, who is accountable? When no single entity is in control, holding individuals or groups responsible becomes significantly harder. If monetary policies go awry, there currently remains a clear centralised entity responsible for addressing the situation. How do we ensure the same accountability when a blockchain node goes awry or network decisions need to be made swiftly? The DAO incident of 2016 exemplifies this challenge. The DAO was one of the first major projects to focus on decentralized autonomy and was built on Ethereum, raising $150 million to function as a venture capital fund without centralized control. A vulnerability in its smart contract was exploited, however, leading to a hack that drained about a third of its funds. Since The DAO was decentralized, there was no clear authority to step in and fix the issue swiftly. The Ethereum community had to debate for weeks on whether to intervene, eventually leading to a controversial hard fork that created Ethereum ( ETH ) and Ethereum Classic ( ETC ). This case highlights the decentralization accountability dilemma, especially in times of crisis. When there’s no central authority, collective action becomes slower and more complex, and thus must be paired with mechanisms for accountability. Null Island and the GPS data dilemma DePIN and AI systems struggle the most with accountability. They are fuelled by oceans of data, and the constant incentive is to gather more data—not ensure its authenticity. In many DePIN projects, the race to scale often puts data quantity ahead of quality. Since incentives are usually based on how much data is contributed, there’s little accountability for whether that data is actually useful or reliable. Over time, some networks end up rewarding noise over signal. For example, some DePIN projects have dozens of nodes off the coast of West Africa, at latitude and longitude 0°N 0°; An empty ocean that has been coined ‘ Null Island ’ since its prevalence, occurring when location data errors arise in geopositioning, instead replacing the coordinates with “null, null”. Even when GPS location data is used accurately, it has significant vulnerabilities that are often exploited, such as location spoofing and GPS drift. There’s even an entire subreddit on spoofing your Pokémon Go location to get the best Pikachu without the effort of walking. Location spoofing —malicious manipulation of GPS data into false location data. GPS drift —when a device’s recorded location is slightly off from the device’s actual position. It can also display as movement even when a device is at a standstill. It can be caused by factors such as signal interference, satellite positioning, or even atmospheric conditions. This isn’t just a hypothetical issue—faulty location data has real-world consequences. More value is flowing into location data, from tracking real-world assets to powering smart cities. As more physical assets get connected, the integrity of that data starts to matter more. What if it’s spoofed? Think of drones delivering packages, or vehicles navigating dense urban networks. What happens when that data is wrong, delayed, or manipulated? The cost isn’t always catastrophic, but it adds up—lost time, misrouted goods, inefficiencies, and more. These are the stakes when data is unverified. The need for data verification in decentralized networks Decentralized networks must do more than just eliminate trust in centralized entities; they must replace it with accountability in the form of verifiable, high-quality data. This is exactly where Proof-of-Location technology steps in, adding an essential layer of real-time verification. Data is not only generated but also validated, ensuring it reflects actual conditions rather than manipulated inputs. For DePINs to be reliable, accountability must be built into the system. If a service fails, the network shouldn’t collapse—it should adapt. This is where redundancy plays a crucial role. Smaller DePIN networks with limited nodes often struggle with this, but established projects have a different approach. With millions of nodes across 150+ countries and battle-tested slashing mechanisms, we ensure the integrity and continuity of geospatial data even when individual nodes fail. Bad data is an existential threat to DePINs. Without verification, networks become vulnerable to spoofing, fraud, and failure. The future of decentralization hinges not just on removing central authority, but on proving that the data we rely on is accurate and consistently accessible.

And no, we’re not talking about NFTs. The way it works is, some platforms now let you buy mystery or loot boxes with major cryptos like $BTC and $ETH. You can then unwrap genuine, real-world prizes (from Apple and Rolex products to crypto mining equipment ) for a fraction of the price. With e-commerce growing by a 31% CAGR and the crypto market by 11.1% , mystery boxes could be the next big crossover between online retail and blockchain tech. Loot Box Market Set to Surge 35% to $20B+ The concept of mystery boxes isn’t new, but it’s attracting greater demand than ever. According to Statista, loot boxes could generate $20.3B in revenue this year , a ~35% spike compared to the market’s estimated $15B in 2020. North American consumers are fueling the appetite for loot boxes. In 2025, they’re expected to spend over $5.2B on mystery boxes in the hope of winning big. This tremendous growth signals a clear trend: Consumers will pay for the thrill of the unknown. As mystery box platforms introduce a gamified layer to shopping, crypto, the native digital currency, is increasingly the preferred payment method. Blockchain Technology Drives Gamified E-Commerce More and more mystery box websites let you buy loot boxes using your crypto, alongside traditional payment methods like credit cards. Crypto offers a quick, borderless, and private way to engage with such services. This makes it attractive to people worldwide who care about their digital footprint being traced. Since crypto is decentralized, it removes the need for middlemen like banks or governments, so you can manage your finances directly, without censorship, exorbitant fees, or delays. Top mystery box platform, JemLit , for example, has got crypto traders forgetting about trading . That’s because f luck’s on their side, they can use their $BTC or $ETH on JemLit to unlock prizes worth significantly more than the cost of the box. The site has over 1.4M users, with 1.5M mystery boxes opened. Cheap mystery boxes like ‘ Easy Findings’ go for just $0.67 but have prizes amounting to $93.90, giving you a chance to score big on an ultra-low investment. On the other end of the spectrum, a high-end box like ‘ Let It Gold ’ goes for $798.42, yet could yield prizes worth up to $32,519.65. This includes items like a 14K yellow gold rope chain valued at $10,651.27. Compared to crypto trading, the odds are far more in your favor betting on JemLit. You can also rest easy knowing that the best mystery box platforms , like JemLit , RillaBox, and Hypedrop, use provably fair tech. This cryptographic technique verifies the results of each digital box opening to ensure the outcomes aren’t manipulated. Crypto Funds the Next Wave of Mystery Boxes Mystery boxes purchased with crypto represent an exciting fusion of Web3 technology and e-commerce. They offer a gamified shopping experience that can turn small investments into major wins. Whether spending a few cents or hundreds of dollars, mystery boxes offer a fun way to potentially unwrap high-value prizes for less. Plus, paying with crypto adds privacy, speed, and global accessibility. As consumers continue to be attracted to the thrill of the unknown and digital-first solutions, platforms like JemLit are in the sweet spot at the crossroads of two booming industries. Read our full JemLit review for more details. Disclaimer: Mystery box platforms can involve risk because prizes worth more than your initial investment aren’t guaranteed and rewards vary widely.

43899093,https://coinpaper.com/8734/bitget-and-term-finance-respond-to-security-breaches-and-recovery-efforts,1745836200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Bitget and Term Finance Respond to Security Breaches and Recovery Efforts,https://coinpaper.com/8734/bitget-and-term-finance-respond-to-security-breaches-and-recovery-efforts,"Crypto platforms Bitget and Term Finance are working to stabilize operations after facing unrelated incidents that caused significant losses. Bitget is pursuing legal action against eight accounts allegedly responsible for manipulating the market of a low-volume token, while Term Finance has managed to recover a substantial portion of user funds following an oracle misconfiguration that led to faulty liquidations. Bitget Pursues Legal Action After Suspected $20 Million VOXEL Market Manipulation On April 20, Bitget’s VOXEL market — which supports the native token of Polygon-based RPG game Voxie Tactics — experienced an unusual explosion in trading volume and price activity. The token’s price sharply increased, gaining more than fivefold compared to its levels just two days earlier. The sudden spike quickly triggered alarms inside Bitget, leading the exchange to suspend trading in the token and initiate a rollback of trades that occurred during the window of suspected manipulation. At the time, Bitget issued a statement noting the occurrence of ”abnormal trading activity” without providing full details. The investigation has since advanced, with Bitget identifying eight accounts suspected of being linked to what the exchange described as a ”professional arbitrage” operation. In a post on X, Bitget’s Head of Asia, Xie Jiayin, confirmed that the company will send legal letters to the accused parties — a move typically seen as a precursor to full-scale legal proceedings. “All funds that are recovered will be returned to platform users 100 percent, via an airdrop,” Xie added, according to a translated version of the post. “We will release a full incident report on the VOXEL matter as soon as possible to present the complete facts.” The $20 million VOXEL manipulation incident adds to a string of recent security and trading breaches plaguing the broader crypto sector. Just weeks prior, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Loopscale, operating on Solana, suffered a $5.8 million exploit only two weeks after its launch. Additionally, Infini, a stablecoin neobank, reported a $49 million loss following a sophisticated breach of its systems. Bitget’s Reputation and Response Strategy Bitget has generally positioned itself as a relatively proactive exchange when it comes to security measures, and its fast-moving response to the VOXEL incident may help limit reputational damage. Rolling back trades is a controversial move in crypto trading, but it is often seen as a necessary intervention when market fairness is at risk. Legal action also signals Bitget’s intent to deter future attempts at market manipulation by demonstrating a willingness to pursue bad actors across jurisdictions. However, enforcement in such cases is notoriously complex, particularly when potential perpetrators operate across international borders and use pseudonymous accounts. While Bitget has pledged to release a full post-mortem report, several critical questions remain unanswered. Chief among them are: What loopholes or vulnerabilities allowed the abnormal trading to happen? Was it an issue of low liquidity, poor market surveillance, or deeper systemic risk? Were any internal or third-party systems compromised? What new safeguards will be introduced to prevent similar incidents in the future? The answers to these questions will likely determine whether Bitget can reinforce confidence among its users — or whether this will spark further scrutiny over the platform's risk management protocols. As the crypto industry continues to mature, exchanges are facing growing expectations to adopt security and compliance standards comparable to those of traditional financial institutions. Moreover, the speed with which a small group of coordinated traders can allegedly move markets and extract massive profits shows the continuing need for better monitoring, automated alerts, and rapid incident response strategies across the industry. Term Finance Recovers $1 Million After Oracle Bug Causes $1.6 Million Loss in Treehouse Market Meanwhile, in a detailed update posted to X, the Term Finance team explained that 223.197 ETH (roughly $400,000) was captured internally, while another 333 ETH (approximately $600,000) was successfully recovered through negotiations with affected parties. The remaining loss stands at 362.03 ETH, a significant improvement from the initial impact of 918 ETH. “Of the original loss: 223.197 ETH was captured internally, 333 ETH was successfully negotiated for return,” Term stated. ”The total outstanding loss is now 362.03 ETH — significantly reduced from the original 918 ETH impact.” An Oracle Misconfiguration, Not a Hack While the crypto community initially raised alarms over another potential DeFi security breach, Term Finance was quick to clarify that the issue stemmed from an internal bug, not a malicious attack. The team attributed the losses to an error involving an updated Ethereum (ETH) price oracle, which incorrectly fed data to the platform's liquidation engine and triggered widespread liquidations of collateralized positions. ”This was not a hack. No smart contracts were exploited, and user funds were not directly targeted,” Term Finance emphasized in its statement. Despite the reassurances, Term has not yet provided full transparency regarding the negotiation process that led to the recovery of a portion of the lost funds. It remains unclear whether these negotiations involved settlements, incentives, or pressure from the community and industry partners. The Difficulty of Recovering Crypto Funds Recoveries following hacks and bugs vary dramatically in the crypto space. Even when attackers are identified or vulnerabilities are patched, retrieving stolen or lost funds remains a major challenge due to the decentralized and often anonymous nature of blockchain transactions. Ben Zhou, CEO of crypto exchange Bybit, recently highlighted this difficulty. Following a massive $1.4 billion exploit against Bybit in February — the industry’s largest attack to date — Zhou said only a fraction of the stolen assets had been recovered. Nearly 28% of the missing funds had ”gone dark,” becoming untraceable after being moved across blockchain mixers, peer-to-peer networks, and over-the-counter markets. Meanwhile, just 3.84% of Bybit’s lost assets had been frozen. Term Finance’s relative success in recovering more than $1 million offers a rare optimistic example, though it also serves as a reminder of the vulnerabilities even top DeFi protocols can face. As DeFi platforms continue to innovate at breakneck speed, incidents like the Treehouse oracle bug underscore the critical need for rigorous testing, third-party audits, and real-time monitoring tools for core infrastructure components such as price oracles. Term Finance has yet to outline any specific measures it will take to prevent similar incidents in the future. However, it is widely expected that the platform — and others across the DeFi sector — will re-evaluate their integration and upgrade processes for external data feeds and liquidation protocols. In the meantime, users across the crypto ecosystem are once again reminded of the inherent risks of interacting with decentralized platforms. Despite the vision of decentralized finance offering greater transparency and fairness, vulnerabilities — whether technical bugs or security exploits — continue to threaten user funds in a rapidly evolving market.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-28 10:30:00

It’s also becoming clear that this token isn’t just riding sentiment. It’s building an ecosystem. And in crypto, that’s the foundation from which real momentum grows. Bitcoin Set the Standard—But the Market’s Still Evolving No token in history has had the impact of Bitcoin . As the first and most secure digital asset, it’s earned its status through decentralization, scarcity, and first-mover dominance. Institutional interest continues to grow, and many believe it’s still only halfway through its long-term arc. MAGACOINFINANCE may not be aiming to replace Bitcoin—but it’s clearly built to join the conversation. Elsewhere in the Market: XRP, Ethereum, Tron, and Sei XRP remains a favorite among institutional adopters. Its focus on financial systems and compliance continues to push its relevance far beyond retail speculation. Ethereum dominates as the go-to platform for decentralized application deployment. Its modular ecosystem and continued upgrades keep it central to blockchain infrastructure. Tron is one of the most widely used chains for transactional volume, thanks to its fast throughput and strong presence in global payment ecosystems. Sei is emerging as a performance-first platform for traders and applications that need high-speed execution. Though early, its architecture has drawn attention from developers and funds alike. These projects are all impressive—but none are in MAGACOINFINANCE’s phase of pure potential. And that’s the difference. Final Word Could MAGACOINFINANCE.COM surpass Bitcoin’s $1.5 million milestone? Only time will tell. But the conditions that led Bitcoin to its crown—early adoption, market fit, and unwavering conviction—are beginning to show in this rising project.

Bitcoin Solaris Offers Second Chance at Crypto Wealth on Solana’s Lightning-Fast Network,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/bitcoin-solaris-offers-second-chance-at-crypto-wealth-on-solanas-lightning-fast-network/,"The post Miss Bitcoin’s Early Days? Bitcoin Solaris Offers Second Chance at Crypto Wealth on Solana’s Lightning-Fast Network appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Back in 2010, buying Bitcoin for a few cents seemed silly. By 2017, it made early buyers millionaires. If you missed that boat, you’re not alone. But now, a new opportunity is catching attention. It’s called Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) — a powerful, next-generation cryptocurrency that could offer a second chance at crypto wealth. And this time, it runs on Solana’s lightning-fast network, making it easier, faster, and more accessible than ever. Bitcoin’s Legacy, Solana’s Speed Bitcoin laid the foundation for decentralized finance. Its fixed supply and security model created digital scarcity, turning it into a store of value like gold. But as Bitcoin grew, so did its issues. Transactions became slow, expensive, and energy-hungry. It wasn’t built for speed or scale. On the other hand, Solana became known for its blazing-fast transaction speeds (up to 65,000 TPS) and low fees. It brought blockchain to games, finance, and apps, but sacrificed some decentralization to do so. Bitcoin Solaris brings the best of both: Bitcoin’s trust and scarcity + Solana’s speed and modern design. Introducing Bitcoin Solaris: Built for the Future Bitcoin Solaris isn’t just a new coin — it’s a full ecosystem that fixes crypto’s biggest problems. Here’s what makes it stand out: Fixed Supply: Just like Bitcoin, BTC-S has a hard cap of 21 million tokens. No more will ever be created. Solana-Powered Speed: BTC-S handles up to 10,000 transactions per second, with confirmations in 2 seconds. Energy Efficiency: Uses 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin mining, thanks to a smarter dual-consensus design. Hybrid Architecture: Combines Proof-of-Work (PoW) for security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for performance. Smart Contract Ready: Full DeFi support through the Helios system, which powers lending, yield farming, DEXs, and cross-chain apps. BTC-S Isn’t Just Another Coin—It’s a New Chapter in Bitcoin This tech combo makes BTC-S a strong candidate for real-world use, not just something to hold and hope. Mining and Staking for Everyone Forget the old days of mining with huge rigs and massive electricity bills. With Bitcoin Solaris, anyone can mine — even with a phone. Solaris Nova App: Downloadable on Android, iOS, and desktop. Lets users mine BTC-S using their device’s full or partial power. Smart Optimization: The app adjusts based on your device, saving battery and preventing overheating. Cross-Platform: Works on phones, laptops, mining rigs — even web browsers. And for those who want passive income: Liquid Staking: Stake your BTC-S and get sBTC-S tokens (1:1), which can be traded, held, or used in DeFi — all while still earning rewards. No Lockups: You stay liquid. Your money stays usable. This makes BTC-S incredibly beginner-friendly and perfect for everyday users. Security, Audits, and Long-Term Vision Unlike many new projects, Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t skip on safety. It has: Ongoing smart contract audits Bug bounty programs to spot issues early Strict validator criteria for staking security On-chain governance, letting users vote on upgrades and protocol changes Join the Presale: Get In Early Bitcoin Solaris is currently in its presale phase, open to early believers who want to get in before full exchange listings and market hype. Start Date: April 28, 2025 Platform: Solana Round 1 Supply: 323,076 BTC-S tokens Bonus: 15% for early participants Redemption: 1:1 swap for native tokens once the BTC-S blockchain is live New Token, Familiar Strength—Meet BTC-S Today It’s the kind of moment crypto history is built on. A small step now could turn into major rewards later. Conclusion Bitcoin changed the world once, but not everyone caught it in time. Bitcoin Solaris gives you that rare second chance. With its powerful mix of Solana’s speed, mobile mining, flexible staking, and long-term vision, BTC-S is more than a token — it’s an ecosystem ready to grow. If you’ve been watching from the sidelines, wondering when the next big thing will come, this could be it. The tools are ready, the tech is solid, and the entry point is wide open. Don’t just watch the next Bitcoin happen — be part of it.

Global crypto ETPs collectively posted $3.4 billion of inflows in the trading week of April 21–25, marking the highest level since December 2024, CoinShares reported on April 28. The inflows were just 13% below the all-time high of $3.85 billion seen in the trading week of Dec. 2–6, 2024, CoinShares previously reported . Renewed investment interest in crypto ETPs came as Bitcoin ( BTC ) broke back above $90,000 last week for the first time since briefly retesting the price mark in early March, according to CoinGecko. Bitcoin ETFs lead as price consolidates above $90,000 Bitcoin was the primary winner among crypto ETPs last week, with investors pouring as much as $3.18 billion into BTC ETPs. The fresh inflows covered all the previous outflows seen since the beginning of April , with year-to-date (YTD) inflows extending to $3.7 billion. Flows by asset (in millions of US dollars).

Solana was the only loser Bullish sentiment was seen in all crypto ETPs except for Solana ( SOL ), with Solana-based investment products seeing $5.7 million of outflows last week. Meanwhile, Ether ( ETH ), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, saw $183 million inflows in the past trading week, breaking an eight-week streak of outflows.

All issuers see healthy inflows The fresh crypto ETP flows were distributed across all major issuers, including those in the United States and Europe. BlackRock’s iShares ETFs saw the largest inflows last week at $1.5 billion, with ARK and Fidelity following at $621 million and $574 million, respectively. Flows by issuer (in millions of US dollars). Source: CoinShares Despite significant inflows, some issuers continue to see outflows month-to-date, or since April 1. Among those issuers are Grayscale with $84 million in outflows, ProShares with $18 million in outflows, and CoinShares with $7 million in outflows. Reasons for the spike The latest inflows mark a notable trend reversal in crypto ETPs as the majority of issuers were seeing massive YTD inflows in the previous week, following a series of outflows in 2025. According to CoinShares’ James Butterfill, the new inflows likely came from concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings as well as a notable weakening of the US dollar , fueling demand for safe-haven assets . The inflows also came as gold prices saw a notable decline last week after breaking new highs at nearly $3,500 on April 22, dropping to as low as $3,275 on April 23, according to TradingView.

Bitcoin Solaris Offers Second Chance at Crypto Wealth Through Solana Technology,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/04/missed-the-bitcoin-boom-bitcoin-solaris-offers-second-chance-at-crypto-wealth-through-solana-technology,"If you’ve ever looked back and wished you had bought Bitcoin in its early days, you’re not alone. A small investment back then could have changed your life today. But what if another opportunity is knocking — one that combines the proven value of scarcity with the latest technology in speed, efficiency, and accessibility? That opportunity might be here with Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S), the next-generation cryptocurrency launched on the Solana blockchain. The Bitcoin Boom: What We Learned Bitcoin’s rise from pennies to tens of thousands of dollars showed the world how powerful blockchain and scarcity could be. But along with its success came some limitations: Slow transaction speeds High energy consumption Centralized mining dominated by large players As newer chains emerged to solve these issues, many lost what made Bitcoin special — its security, scarcity, and decentralization. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris steps in. It keeps what made Bitcoin great and upgrades the rest with cutting-edge features built for modern users. Bitcoin Solaris: The Modern Answer to Old Problems Bitcoin Solaris combines Bitcoin’s proven model with the advanced performance of Solana’s high-speed infrastructure. BTC-S is not just a coin — it’s a full ecosystem ready for mass adoption. Key Features: Fixed Supply of 21 Million Tokens: Like Bitcoin, BTC-S is limited, making it a scarce digital asset from day one. Dual-Consensus Architecture: Proof-of-Work (PoW) for strong, decentralized security Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) for blazing-fast transactions and energy efficiency Speed: Supports up to 10,000 transactions per second with just 2 seconds finality 99.95% Less Energy Use: Compared to traditional Bitcoin mining Fully Audited: With a bug bounty program and secure smart contracts These upgrades make BTC-S usable not only as a store of value but also as a tool for daily use, passive income, and smart financial decisions. Bitcoin Solaris Is for Thinkers, Builders, and Early Believers Mine from Anywhere: True Accessibility One of the biggest innovations Bitcoin Solaris introduces is Universal Mining. Whether you have a smartphone or a mining rig, you can participate: Smartphones: The Solaris Nova App lets you mine on mobile using battery-saving features Laptops & Desktops: Balanced mining that won’t slow down your device ASICs/GPUs: Optimized support for high-performance miners The Solaris Nova App is available on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux, and even works in web browsers. One-click mining, a built-in wallet, and smart automation make the process easy for everyone — no tech experience required. Staking With Freedom: Liquid sBTC-S Tokens BTC-S holders don’t have to choose between earning rewards and keeping access to their funds. With liquid staking, users receive sBTC-S tokens (1:1) when they stake their BTC-S, allowing them to: Earn passive income Use their staked tokens in DeFi platforms Trade or hold without locking their funds Participate in governance decisions Presale: A Rare Window of Opportunity The project is currently in Presale Phase 1, giving early investors a chance to enter at the foundational level before BTC-S is widely traded. With only three months to participate and a limited supply available during presale, this early stage could be a significant opportunity for long-term gains. BTC-S tokens purchased now are on the Solana network and will be redeemable 1:1 when the Bitcoin Solaris mainnet goes live — ensuring continuity and growth. Conclusion The Bitcoin boom changed the financial world — but it also left many behind. Bitcoin Solaris offers a new path forward, built on the same foundation of scarcity and trust, but powered by today’s best technology. It’s accessible, energy-efficient, and designed for everyday users — not just crypto insiders. Whether you’re mining from your phone, staking for passive income, or looking for a long-term investment with real utility, Bitcoin Solaris could be your second chance at something big. With a fixed supply, smart tokenomics, and high-performance infrastructure, BTC-S is ready to lead the next wave of crypto opportunity.

In his April 28 post on X, Ethereum Foundation Co-executive Director Tomasz K. Stańczak said that the upcoming Pectra upgrade , slated for May 7, does not include EOF, stating: “The Pectra upgrade does not include EOF, nor [is it] intended to include EOF. Everything on Pectra is going as planned for the May 7th release.” EOF, which stands for Object Format, is a major overhaul of Ethereum’s execution engine intended to optimize and modularize the Ethereum Virtual Machine. The EOF proposal has sparked intense debate among Ethereum developers in recent months, with many criticizing it for its unnecessary complexity. Source: @velvetkeyboard Despite this, Ethereum leadership decided to go ahead with implementing Full EOF — but only with the next network upgrade, Fusaka, which is now tentatively slated for Q3/Q4 this year. Tim Beiko, who runs Ethereum’s core protocol meetings, told participants during Thursday’s All Core Developers call, “We can’t choose not to do something just because it’s complex.” You might also like: Vitalik Buterin responds to security concerns over new Pectra upgrade Pectra, the upgrade set for May 7, is aimed at improving Ethereum’s validator UX, making it possible for users to pay transaction fees in USD Coin ( USDC ) instead of ETH, increasing validator staking limit from, and more . Fusaka, the following upgrade, is more ambitious. Besides restructuring how smart contracts are written and executed through EOF, it aims to make Ethereum network more efficient and scalable. This is meant to improve the performance of Ethereum’s base layer, which has been steadily declining, leading several major players to sharply reduce their Ether holdings. According to Lookonchain, Galaxy Digital recently deposited 65,600 ETH (worth $105.5 million) to Binance and then withdrew 752,240 Solana ( SOL ), suggesting it sold its ETH to buy SOL. Paradigm has also recently cut its ETH exposure by selling 5,500 ETH ($8.66M) to an institutional brokerage platform Anchorage, according to EmberCN . “While institutional investors initially bought into the ‘ultra-sound money’ narrative, they’re now facing a reality where decreasing protocol revenue and weakening tokenomics create legitimate concerns,” Jayendra Jog, co-founder of Sei Labs, told Cointelegraph.

In a recent post , the former CEO of Binance teased the content of his latest interview with Turkish crypto advocate and blockchain game Pow Ahoy founder Erhan Ünal. When asked what the Bitcoin ( BTC ) creator’s true identity could be, CZ said he has no idea, but posits that there are strange theories floating around the crypto space. One theory that he mentioned was the possibility that Satoshi Nakamoto could be a time-travelling software that has returned to the past to invent Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto was an AI from the future. I was just asked ""who I think Satoshi might be"" in a live (still on-going) interview from Turkey. I tweet during meetings all the time. 😆 — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) April 27, 2025 “Satoshi Nakamoto was an AI from the future. I was just asked “who I think Satoshi might be” in a live (still on-going) interview from Turkey,” wrote CZ in his post. In his interview with Ünal and Uygar Taze, CZ stated that he has never had any interactions with the mysterious Bitcoin founder. Though, he admitted to knowing people who have had email exchanges with him. “I know people who have, in the early days. They had email exchanges, there’s maybe less than 10 people. So I don’t know who he is, but I think it’s good that we don’t [know who he is],” said CZ. You might also like: CZ mulls over letting the crypto community make his dog a meme coin Moreover, he is uncertain whether Satoshi Nakamoto is a single individual or a group of people. CZ acknowledged that whoever is behind Satoshi “covered his tracks really well,” since there were never any traces of an IP address or other definite indicators of who it could be. Hence, leading to the creation of more outlandish theories about Satoshi. “There are other sort of stranger answers. Where they might be a software coming back through time, all of these possibilities. It’s hard to imagine now but could be possible. But regardless, I don’t know who he is,” said CZ. The debate surrounding the identity behind Satoshi Nakamoto has been going on for years. It recently resurfaced in October 2024 when an HBO documentary titled “Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery” vowed to uncover the true identity of Bitcoin’s anonymous creator. In the end, the HBO identified Canadian cryptographer and developer Peter Todd as Satoshi Nakamoto. However, Todd has since denied claims that he is Satoshi and was ultimately forced into hiding due to safety concerns.

However, he does not believe gold is an equal match for Bitcoin. “Humans also have a tendency to not always use something old to estimate something new. We do not estimate the potential of Tesla using digital cars. We do no estimate the future of what Bitcoin can do based on what gold can do,” said CZ. “So Bitcoin will be way bigger than gold. I’m very convinced on that, it just takes time. I just don’t know when it will happen. But it will happen,” he continued.

Southeast Asian countries, which suffered the effects of Trump’s levies, are joining hands to increase intra-regional trade and diversify their export destinations. Trump’s “America First” ideology, which prioritizes the domestic over the international, depends on the assumption that the world needs America more than it needs the world. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent argued that the “America First” ideology is a call for deeper collaboration and mutual respect among trade partners. Asia takes the lead in making deals to avoid Trump tariffs The president’s team has drafted a framework to handle negotiations with about 18 countries, including a template that indicates common areas of concern to guide the discussions. Bessent said on ABC News’ This Week with George Stephanopoulos that there are 18 important U.S. trading partners, including China, which is undergoing a “special negotiation.” He argued that the U.S. has a process in place, over the next 90 days, to negotiate with the other 17 nations. “Some of those are moving along very well, especially with the Asian countries,” he added. Bessent also mentioned last week that the U.S. and South Korea could reach an “agreement of understanding” on trade as soon as this week. The country’s officials said they see early July as the initial deadline for any negotiations to at least get tariff exemptions. The UK was slapped with 10% tariffs, and the Exchequer Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, told reporters in Washington last week that “a deal can be done” but “we’re not going to rush.” Canada, whose levies aren’t affected by the 90-day reprieve, also wishes to take its time. The country’s Prime Minister, Mark Carney, argued that Canada doesn’t have to make a deal in the short term. Carney told reporters Thursday while campaigning in British Columbia ahead of the April 28 election that “ my government will do the right deal.” Switzerland, facing 31% tariffs on goods, said it’s one of 15 countries that will get “somewhat preferential treatment” after agreeing to tariff negotiations with the Trump administration. Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter maintained that the tariffs will be held at 10% during the process, even if they extend beyond Trump’s 90-day tariff pause. Bloomberg reported that Japan plans to retaliate against any U.S. efforts to bring it into an economic bloc against China because of the importance of Tokyo’s trade ties with Beijing. Southeast Asia treads carefully between China and the U.S. China’s President Xi Jinping spent the third week of April visiting Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia in the wake of the actions of U.S. President Donald Trump . On April 2, the President imposed 49% tariffs on products from Cambodia, 46% on goods from Vietnam, and between 20%-30% on most other Southeast Asian countries. Xi Jinping wrote in Vietnam’s Nhan Dan newspaper that countries should work to advance a comprehensive and inclusive economic globalization. He also noted a need to protect the multilateral trading system, sustain the stability of global production and supply chains, and maintain an open and cooperative international environment. “China will persist in high-level openness, creating more opportunities for the world and also contributing to shared development with other countries through its own high-quality development.” -Xi Jinping, President of China. Jinping met with Malaysia’s King Sultan Ibrahim in Kuala Lumpur and touted a “new golden era ” of Chinese-Malaysian relations. The king also revealed new cooperation with China in various fields, including artificial intelligence. The country, which is the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc, was hit with a tariff of 24%. China’s President also met Cambodia’s Prime Minister, Hun Manet, in Phnom Penh and acknowledged that Beijing needs to bolster regional trade to offset the effect of steep U.S. levies. Though the country is trying to negotiate a reduction in tariffs, Jinping reportedly reminded them that both states were friends and Cambodia should not want to cut any deals at Beijing’s expense.

I upgrade ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) to a buy due to its strong recovery and positive crypto trends. ARKF, with a 13.4% EPS growth rate, benefits from bullish seasonal trends and a supportive technical chart. The ETF's portfolio is heavily weighted in growth sectors, with significant exposure to crypto, enhancing its long-term growth potential. Don’t count the bitcoin bull market out. While the world’s largest cryptocurrency fell from near $110,000 to below $80,000 from January through the April nadir, the relative chart of bitcoin to the S&P 500 is very close to all-time highs. A series of higher lows and higher highs dates back to late 2022. All the while, crypto-related fintech stocks have been volatile, but generally positive. I had a hold rating on the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) in the second quarter of 2024 . Shares have soared 30% since then, but it has been a wild ride. The Cathie Wood fund struggled through the fall but then took off when President Trump won re-election. Price action since Inauguration Day has been less stellar, with ARKF plunging from near $45 to below $28. But the ETF has rallied hard since mid-April, up 30% in a few weeks. Actually, it’s entire gain since my last analysis has come just April 7. I am upgrading the fund to a buy. Bitcoin vs SPX: Nearing New All-Time Highs Stockcharts.com According to the issuer , ARKF is an actively managed ETF that seeks long-term growth of capital. It aims to achieve this investment objective by investing under normal circumstances primarily in domestic and foreign equity securities of companies that are engaged in the fund’s investment theme of financial technology innovation. ARKF is a small ETF with just $905 million in assets under management as of April 25, 2025. Its annual expense ratio is moderate to high at 75 basis points, and the product does not have a trailing 12-month dividend yield . Share-price momentum is rated exceptionally strong by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system, but volatility is very high. Hence, the ETF Risk Grade is poor at a D- due to the elevated standard deviation and ARKF’s concentrated portfolio. Finally, liquidity is decent, given average daily volume of more than 400,000 shares, and the ETF’s median 30-day bid/ask spread is moderate at 9 basis points, per ARK Invest. For an update on the portfolio, the 1-star ETF by Morningstar plots on the far right side of the style box, indicating its bent toward the growth style. Much depends on how crypto performs and with industry-specific fundamental trends, such as Robinhood’s (HOOD) foray into attracting higher-net-worth investors. I concede that the valuation at more than 28 times earnings is not cheap, but ARKF’s long-term EPS growth rate is above that of the broader market at 13.4%. With bitcoin creeping higher and key momentum themes recovering, I assert that there is more left in the tank for the fund. ARKF: Portfolio & Factor Profiles Morningstar ARKF is a fintech ETF—more than 60% of the allocation is invested in the Information Technology and Financials sectors. Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary—a pair of growth corners of the market—round out ARKF’s portfolio. Of course, there’s a crypto play here since the product owns ARK’s bitcoin product. ARKF: Heavy on Growth with Bitcoin ETF Exposure Seeking Alpha Seasonally, we are entering a particularly bullish stretch. Over the past five years, returns have been strongest from May through August. So, if historical trends play out, the calendar will favor ARKF. ARKF: Bullish May-August Trends Seeking Alpha The Technical Take With a fair valuation given the earnings growth story, ARKF’s chart is encouraging. Notice in the graph below that shares retreated to a key long-term support line in the upper $20s. The long-term 200-day moving average remains upward sloping with price above that key trend-indicator line—something that can’t be said for the S&P 500. ARKF encountered selling pressure, however, right at the mid-2021 pullback-low of $44 back in Q1, so it was natural to expect a significant correction. But take a look at the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the chart that there was a minor bullish RSI divergence, which may portend a protracted recovery. Before that, a bearish divergence played out, leading to the steep retreat. For now, the mid-$40s remains resistance, while $28 is support. ARKF: Shares Hit Mid-$40 Resistance, Attract Buyers at Trendline Support Stockcharts.com The Bottom Line I have a buy rating on ARKF. The hard Q1-Q2 correction likely washed out weak hands, and I expect a further upswing given crypto price trends and seasonal/technical momentum.",BTC-USD|ARKF,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-04-28 10:40:01
43899426,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153195,1745836825,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,WLFI Leaders Meet Binance CZ: A Breakthrough Moment for Global Crypto Expansion?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wlfi-binance-cz-meeting/,"In a move that has piqued significant interest across the cryptocurrency world, leaders from World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto project notably linked to the Trump family, recently held a high-profile meeting with Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the co-founder of Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The meeting, announced by WLFI founders Zach Witkoff, Zak Folkman, and Chase Herro on the social media platform X, centered on pivotal discussions regarding the future trajectory of the digital asset space. The agenda reportedly included strategies for boosting global adoption of cryptocurrencies, establishing robust new industry standards, and driving the next wave of crypto innovation. What Did WLFI Leaders Discuss with Binance CZ? The core of the discussion between the WLFI leadership and Binance CZ revolved around accelerating the growth and acceptance of cryptocurrencies on a worldwide scale. This isn’t just about getting more people to buy crypto; it’s about building the infrastructure, understanding, and regulatory frameworks necessary for digital assets to become truly integrated into the global economy. For a project like WLFI, connecting with a figure as influential as CZ and a platform as dominant as Binance signals serious ambition. Key topics reportedly included: Strategies for Global Reach: How to overcome geographical and cultural barriers to make crypto accessible everywhere. Setting Industry Benchmarks: The importance of clear, reliable standards for security, compliance, and user protection to build trust. Fostering Innovation: Exploring new technologies and use cases beyond simple trading, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and blockchain applications. The meeting highlights the growing interconnectedness within the crypto ecosystem, where projects, even relatively new ones, seek collaboration with established giants to navigate the complex path towards mainstream success. Driving Global Crypto Expansion: Opportunities and Challenges The vision of Global Crypto Expansion is ambitious and faces a multitude of factors. On one hand, the potential is immense: reaching underserved populations, facilitating faster and cheaper cross-border transactions, and creating new economic opportunities. On the other hand, significant hurdles remain: Regulatory Uncertainty: Different countries have vastly different approaches to crypto regulation, creating fragmentation and complexity. Education and Awareness: Many people still lack understanding of how crypto works and its potential benefits, leading to hesitation and skepticism. Infrastructure Gaps: Access to reliable internet, smartphones, and financial services varies globally. Security Concerns: Protecting users from scams, hacks, and fraud is paramount for building trust. Discussions between WLFI and Binance CZ likely touched upon how collaboration and shared knowledge can help address some of these challenges, leveraging Binance’s vast experience in operating across diverse regulatory environments. Boosting Crypto Adoption: The Path to the Mainstream Achieving widespread Crypto Adoption requires more than just technological innovation; it demands usability, trust, and regulatory clarity. Projects and platforms must work together to simplify the user experience, enhance security measures, and engage with regulators proactively. The meeting between WLFI and CZ suggests a focus on these aspects. Binance, with its massive user base and diverse product offerings, has been at the forefront of onboarding new users globally. Learning from their strategies and potentially collaborating on initiatives could be invaluable for WLFI’s own growth plans. Furthermore, the involvement of a project with ties to a prominent political family, like the Trump family crypto connection via WLFI, could potentially influence public perception and even regulatory discussions, although this remains to be seen. Why Industry Standards Matter for Sustainable Growth Establishing clear and robust Industry Standards is non-negotiable for the long-term health and growth of the crypto ecosystem. Standards build trust, facilitate interoperability, and provide a framework for responsible innovation. Topics likely discussed include: Best practices for security protocols. Compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. Guidelines for decentralized governance and transparency. Interoperability standards between different blockchains and protocols. Binance has played a significant role in shaping some industry practices through its sheer scale and influence. Discussions with WLFI leaders on this topic underscore a shared recognition that a more standardized and compliant industry is better positioned for mainstream acceptance and sustainable expansion. The Trump Family Crypto Connection: What Does WLFI’s Association Mean? The description of WLFI as a “ Trump Family Crypto project” adds a unique layer of interest and potential implications. While the exact nature of the family’s involvement isn’t detailed in the announcement, such an association can bring significant attention and potentially influence. It could: Increase visibility and public profile for WLFI. Potentially open doors to specific networks or influence spheres. Subject the project to increased scrutiny from media, regulators, and the public. The meeting with CZ, a figure who has also navigated complex regulatory landscapes and public attention, could offer WLFI valuable insights on managing the unique challenges and opportunities that come with a high-profile association. Looking Ahead: Implications of the Meeting While the details shared publicly are brief, the meeting between WLFI leaders and Binance CZ is noteworthy. It signifies that even prominent figures like CZ are engaging with newer projects, particularly those with potentially influential backing. It underscores a shared interest in overcoming hurdles to achieve wider crypto adoption and global expansion. Whether this meeting leads to concrete collaborations, partnerships, or simply serves as a high-level exchange of ideas remains to be seen. However, it certainly puts WLFI on the radar of many within the crypto community and beyond, highlighting the project’s ambition and its potential connections at the highest levels of the industry. The path to mass crypto adoption and truly global expansion is complex, requiring collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to building trust and establishing clear standards. Meetings like this, bringing together different players in the ecosystem, are crucial steps in that journey.

The price of Monero ( XMR ) unexpectedly surged on Monday, jumping over 50% from $228 to $347, before retracing to $295. While some initially speculated that the increase was tied to positive developments in the privacy coin’s adoption or technology, new evidence suggests the spike may actually be linked to a large money laundering operation. A suspicious transaction involving 3,520 Bitcoin ( BTC ), valued at approximately $330 million, was flagged by pseudonymous blockchain sleuth ZachXBT, who revealed in an X post on Monday that the stolen funds were quickly laundered through multiple crypto exchanges, with XMR being one of the key assets involved.

The timing of the price surge aligns closely with the movement of the stolen Bitcoin, suggesting a direct link. While some mistakenly linked the price surge to Monero’s proposed upgrade that could make it more compliance-friendly, the rally quickly faded after the money laundering news surfaced, raising doubts about the jump’s sustainability. Although it remains unclear who is behind the laundering scheme, ZachXBT suggested it’s not linked to North Korean hackers, adding that the funds were seemingly stolen from “an OG bitcoiner who got rekt.” Read more: Monero price prediction – XMR price stability hinting a breakout?",News|Bitcoin|Monero|Money Laundering|Сrypto hack,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|XMR,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-28 10:41:22

In an announcement on April 25, crypto exchange Binance said it will list SIGN on April 28, 2025, at 11:00 UTC, with trading pairs against USDT, USDC, BNB, FDUSD, and TRY. The tokens will be available across Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Base networks. The TGE for SIGN is scheduled an hour earlier, at 10:00 UTC on the same day. During the event, SIGN tokens will be minted on Ethereum and bridged to other supported networks, officially kicking off the launch of Sign Protocol’s mainnet. Before spot trading starts, SIGN will be featured on Binance Alpha , Binance’s early-stage project platform, starting at 10:00 UTC. Binance will also airdrop 1,500 SIGN tokens to users who have at least 65 Alpha Points, with tokens set to arrive in Alpha accounts within 10 minutes after trading goes live. Alpha Points are a system Binance uses to reward user activity within the Binance Wallet and Alpha ecosystem. Separately, Binance will airdrop 200 million SIGN tokens to BNB holders who subscribed to Simple Earn or On-Chain Yields between April 15 and April 19, 2025.

At launch, about 1.2 billion tokens, or roughly 12% of the supply, will be in circulation. Out of the total supply, 40% is allocated to the community, with 10% or 1 billion tokens set aside for TGE airdrops and the rest for future rewards and ecosystem growth. 20% is reserved for early backers, 10% for the founding team, 10% for the foundation, and another 10% to support the broader ecosystem, with vesting schedules in place for team and investor allocations. Besides Binance, other exchanges like Bybit, Bitget, Gate.io, and MEXC have also announced plans to list SIGN on the same day. What is Sign Protocol? Sign Protocol started back in 2020 under the name EthSign, before rebranding as it expanded into omni-chain attestations. It’s a protocol that helps decentralized applications verify and attest information across different blockchains. It lets users easily create, store, and access verified attestations, aiming to make cross-chain verification more efficient, secure, and developer-friendly. The network is powered by the SIGN token, which covers attestation fees, rewards participants who help maintain and secure the protocol, and gives the community a say in future upgrades and protocol changes. In January 2025, the project raised $16 million from a group of major investors, including YZi Labs (formerly Binance Labs), Hack VC, Amber Group, and Altos Ventures, showing strong backing for its vision of building Web3 trust infrastructure. The project is also backed by Sequoia Capital and Circle Ventures, in an earlier $12 million seed funding round in March 2022.

Speaking at a town hall near Atlanta on Friday, Ossoff said Trump’s decision to offer exclusive access to top investors in his personal cryptocurrency was a clear case of “selling access” to the presidency. “I mean, I saw just 48 hours ago, he is granting audiences to people who buy his meme coin There is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense,” the senator said. Ossoff, who is running for re-election in Georgia this year, has been a consistent critic of Trump’s conduct in office. He previously voted to convict Trump during the former president’s second impeachment trial in 2021, though he was not yet in Congress for the first. The latest controversy centres on an event announced last week, where the top 220 holders of Trump’s personal memecoin, TRUMP, are invited to a private dinner at Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C. The gathering is scheduled for May 22 and also promises a VIP reception for the top 25 wallets. The Official Trump Memecoin website currently displays a leaderboard tracking eligible wallets. You might also like: TRUMP whale regrets sale, pays double to buy back meme coins Lawmakers and ethics experts have raised concerns that offering presidential access in exchange for cryptocurrency investments could violate federal ethics rules. Separately, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Adam Schiff have called for a formal ethics investigation, urging the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to review Trump’s involvement with the memecoin dinner event. In a letter sent the same day, they warned that selling exclusive access to the president in connection with a personal financial asset could breach ethics laws , bribery statutes, and the U.S. Constitution’s emoluments clause. “The American people deserve the unwavering assurance that access to the presidency is not being offered for sale to the highest bidder,” Warren and Schiff wrote, describing the situation as a “grave” threat to public trust. As previously reported by crypto.news, TRUMP rallied over 70% after news broke that the president was offering a private dinner to top memecoin holders. In their letter, the senators said such actions raise concerns that the president “may be engaging in ‘pay to play’ corruption.” “This new scheme is demonstrative of President Trump’s continued and concerning efforts to use his own name and likeness as President, as well as those of his family and the presidential office, for personal financial gain,” they added. As of April 28, the TRUMP leaderboard shows that Tron founder Justin Sun holds the top spot after registering his HTX cold storage wallet for the exclusive dinner. According to blockchain data, Sun’s wallet currently holds around $18.91 million worth of TRUMP tokens. Other top wallets include one linked to MemeCore, a project known for developing meme-focused crypto assets, listed as MeCo, and another registered under Wintermute, a major algorithmic trading firm, listed as CASE. In related news, the team behind the Official Trump Memecoin recently denied rumours that investors need to hold at least $300,000 worth of TRUMP to qualify for the dinner event.

Last week, the digital asset market recorded its highest amount of inflows since mid-December 2024 and the third-largest weekly inflow of all-time. Digital asset investment products saw $3.4 billion in inflows coming in from all providers. BlackRock’s iShares ETFs contributed the largest share by product, with weekly inflows amounting to $1.5 billion. Other digital asset investment products that saw large inflows include ARK ;s 21Shares with $621 million and Fidelity Wise Origin with $574 million. CoinShares head of research James Butterfill believes the influx of capital into digital asset investment products may be due to investors flocking to safe haven assets as a hedge against the economic uncertainty posed by more conventional assets. “We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the U.S. dollar are the reasons investors have turned towards digital assets,” wrote Butterfill.

Ethereum ( ETH ) investment products also saw $183 million inflows last week, effectively breaking the asset’s previous 8-week streak of outflows. On the other hand, Solana ( SOL ) became the only altcoin with outflows last week, reaching $5.7 million. Other altcoins saw little to no activity, with the exception of SUI ( SUI ) and XRP ( XRP ) which saw inflows amounting to $20.7 million and $31.6 million respectively. CoinShares’ latest report also noted that U.S. investors have been adding to their positions, contributing the largest share of inflows by region. Last week, U.S. saw inflows reaching $3.3 billion. Not only that, Germany and Switzerland also saw inflows of $51.5 million and $41.4 million respectively. This reflects the positive market sentiment present in the broader global landscape, with only Brazil and Canada experiencing outflows.

DeepBook Protocol ( DEEP ) price is up over 35% in the past 24 hours, currently trading around $0.23 with volume surging almost 400%. Today’s surge extends the explosive rally that began on April 22, when DEEP price broke out of the consolidation range between $0.05 and $0.10, where it had been trading for about a month. The catalyst behind the breakout was Binance ’s launch of a USD-margined perpetual contract for DEEP tokens with up to 50x leverage. This sent the price soaring from an opening level of $0.08984 to an intraday high of $0.1849 on April 22, marking 105% pump in a single day. Momentum continued the next day, April 23, after DEEP was listed on the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit , sending the price to a new new intraday high of $0.2315 before it entered a brief consolidation phase. After a few days of sideways movement, DeepBook exploded again on April 27 and is continuing to climb.

A descending trendline, connecting the lower highs from February through mid-April, was decisively breached around April 18–19. Currently, DeepBook is trading around $0.23 with strong bullish momentum, as reflected not only in price action but also in technical indicators. The MACD continues to show a strong bullish crossover with an expanding histogram, indicating that bulls are in control. Bollinger Bands on the daily chart are expanding sharply, signaling increased volatility. RSI is deep in overbought territory above 84, suggesting that while momentum is firmly bullish, a pullback is coming. From a structural perspective, the price is now approaching resistance around the $0.25-$0.26 zone, where it peaked briefly in early February. If the momentum continues, the next key target lies between $0.28 and $0.30, corresponding to the first lower high touching the descending trendline. On the downside, immediate support can be found around $0.18 -$0.19, the former breakout zone from April 22. When DEEP price experiences an pullback, holding this support would be crucial to maintain the current bullish structure. A deeper retracement could find support around the $0.15, where the price briefly consolidated before its latest leg higher.

At one point, Pi’s price soared to $3, sparking excitement among its 60 million-strong user base. The community, known as “Pioneers,” is rallying behind an ambitious Pi Ambassador campaign, aimed at creating a global movement to boost the coin’s valuation. But while the campaign generates buzz, experts remain skeptical. Can hype and social media chatter replace real-world value and utility? What is the Pi Ambassador Campaign? Pi Ambassadors are tasked with promoting the Pi Network’s vision of achieving the “Global Consensus Value” (GCV), a target set at $314,159, derived from Pi’s mathematical value. With representatives appointed in various countries, their role is to organize events and engage in online activism to strengthen the Pi community.

For Pi to succeed, it must prove real-world utility and functionality—something many believe the project lacks at this stage. Pi Network’s Criticisms: Is It a Ponzi Scheme? Critics argue that the Pi Ambassador campaign resembles a multi-level marketing (MLM) or Ponzi scheme, focusing more on growing a network of supporters than on building a functioning, valuable product. They stress that community hype won’t create liquidity, demand, or the necessary use cases for the coin’s success. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Coin Price Drops 4% as New Whale Buys 48 Million Tokens: What It Means for Investors , Pi Coin Price Action: What’s Happened So Far? Pi saw impressive price jumps following the mainnet launch. On February 20, its price spiked from $0.113 to $2.20—a 2,692.85% surge. However, the excitement was short-lived. By February 27, the price had dropped by 78.05%, and in the last 30 days, it fell 24.9%. The price has continued its decline, slipping by 2.5% in the last seven days and 3.1% in the past 24 hours. The Road Ahead for Pi Network While Pi Ambassadors continue to rally the community, the future of Pi Network hinges on more than just buzz. Without exchange listings, liquidity, and real use cases, Pi risks fading into obscurity. The Pi Ambassador campaign may keep the community engaged, but it’s the project’s real-world adoption and market fundamentals that will determine its future success. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ready to navigate the week ahead? One of the key events to keep an eye on in the digital asset space is the scheduled release of previously locked tokens. These events, often referred to as crypto token unlocks , can sometimes add significant supply to the market, potentially influencing price dynamics. Understanding the upcoming token unlock schedule is crucial for any savvy investor. Why Do Crypto Token Unlocks Matter? Token unlocks occur when tokens held by founders, teams, early investors, or advisors become transferable or available for sale after a vesting period. When a large number of tokens are released simultaneously, it increases the circulating supply. While not always the case, a sudden increase in supply can lead to selling pressure if recipients decide to cash out, potentially impacting the token’s price. Monitoring these events is a key part of market analysis. This Week’s Significant Token Releases According to data from DropsTab, several major projects have significant token release events scheduled for this week. Here’s a breakdown of the notable unlocks to watch: Token Amount Unlocked USD Value (Approx.) % of Circulating Supply Unlock Time (UTC) WLD 5.02 million $5.65 million 0.38% April 29, 00:00 TRUMP 493,827.16 $7.25 million 0.25% April 29, 06:00 OP 32.21 million $24.90 million 1.94% April 30, 00:00 KMNO 229.35 million $14.24 million 16.99% April 30, 00:00 ALT 240 million $7.26 million 7.35% April 30, 06:00 BONK 504.4 billion $9.43 million 0.65% May 1, 00:00 DYDX 8.35 million $5.32 million 1.09% May 1, 15:00 ENA 94.19 million $32.16 million 1.7% May 2, 08:00 Which Altcoin Unlocks Should You Watch Closely? While all unlocks listed are significant in terms of USD value, some represent a larger percentage of the current circulating supply than others. The altcoin unlock events for KMNO (16.99%), ALT (7.35%), OP (1.94%), and ENA (1.7%) are particularly noteworthy because the released tokens constitute a more substantial portion of the currently available supply. A large percentage unlock could theoretically have a more pronounced impact on price, although this is not guaranteed and depends on various factors, including overall market sentiment, the project’s fundamentals, and who receives the tokens. What Does This Crypto Schedule Mean for Investors? Keeping track of the crypto schedule for these unlocks is an essential part of due diligence. Here are a few things to consider: Potential Volatility: Prices of the affected tokens might experience increased volatility around the unlock times. Research: Look into who is receiving the unlocked tokens (team, investors, etc.) as this can sometimes indicate their likelihood to sell. Market Context: Evaluate the broader market conditions. In a bull market, unlock pressure might be absorbed more easily than in a bear market. Risk Management: If you hold these tokens, be aware of the dates and consider your risk tolerance and strategy. It’s important to remember that a token unlock is just one factor among many influencing price. Project development updates, partnerships, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment also play significant roles. However, being informed about scheduled supply increases is always beneficial. In Conclusion: Stay Informed on Token Unlocks This week presents several key token unlock events across various altcoins. While the exact impact is difficult to predict, understanding when and how many tokens are entering circulation is vital for making informed decisions in the fast-paced crypto market. Keep these dates on your radar and combine this information with your broader market analysis.

The MUTM token is available in the fourth phase of eleven presale stages where buyers can obtain tokens at $0.025 per token. The DeFi project centers its efforts around lending and borrowing services by providing lasting utility instead of optimistic yet short-lived market trends. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leads the market through its defined approach to build wealth systems which will revolutionize wealth-building in 2025. The combination of organized token mechanics and raising investor interest creates an opportunity that current buyers can capitalize on successfully. The things that make it unique within the competitive market segment have yet to be exposed. Solana (SOL) Faces Headwinds Solana (SOL) is stumbling as market dynamics shift. Once celebrated for speed, it grapples with network congestion and declining developer activity. Prices hover around $150, but bearish signals loom. Analysts note fading momentum, with transaction volumes dipping 15% in Q1 2025. Investors seeking high-yield opportunities are turning elsewhere, as Solana’s ecosystem struggles to innovate beyond NFTs and dApps. Its reliance on speculative trading leaves it vulnerable to volatility, unlike projects with structured financial models. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Pre-sale Phase Attracts Significant Market Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently operates at phase 4 of its development during which they offer tokens for $0.025. Valid investors have been quickly purchasing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens ahead of phase 5 because it initiates a 20% price increase from $0.025 to $0.03, thus delivering 20% gains for existing token holders. The presale has accumulated $7.2 million in funding due to strong investor belief and enthusiasm. The initial projected 140% Tokenomics returns for MUTM reach up to 9,900% when the price reaches $2.50. The team recently initiated a new dashboard that offers bonus tokens to the leading 50 token holders who maintain their positions in the ranking. Through gamified rewards the project obtains higher engagement that propels phase 4 toward fast sales completion. Innovative Lending Drives Value Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is establishing new DeFi standards using a two-way lending system which merges peer-to-peer interactions with peer-to-contract mechanisms. Users earn passive revenue through asset lending whereas they access borrowing services by establishing collateral which is backed by additional funds to maintain stability. The method eliminates the intense price swings which affect speculative tokens. A smart contract audit conducted by CertiK reaches its final stages before the team releases results through social channels for enhanced trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM secures both skeptical investors who value security and ambitious investors seeking utility. The revenue resettlement system of MUTM sustains market demand by redirecting profits directly to token stakeholders. The innovative approach makes MUTM stand out among other projects within the upcoming 2025 surge of DeFi development. A Smarter Path to Millions The market conditions put intense pressure on legacy token Solana (SOL) to maintain steady growth rates because investors make their decisions based on market dynamics. Mutuum Finance (MUTM enables investors to access the opportunities presented by high-yield DeFi solutions through a well-planned process. The platform has attracted more than 9,100 investors who have collectively contributed $7.2 million toward the token through its presale program that precedes the scheduled phase 5 price adjustment. MUTM presents an attractive investment by offering 140% listing gains and potentially reaching $2.50 in post-launch market value after a 9,900% increase. Potential millionaires for 2025 should currently explore the investment opportunity in Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Safely acquire tokens through the official website presale before the chance to purchase at $0.025 expires.

43899990,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153197,1745838031,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Altcoin Season Index Reveals Deep Bitcoin Season,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-bitcoin-2/,"Are you watching the crypto market closely? If so, you’ve likely heard terms like ‘Altcoin Season’ or ‘Bitcoin Season’ being thrown around. These aren’t just buzzwords; they refer to distinct phases in the market cycle where either altcoins collectively outperform Bitcoin or Bitcoin leads the pack. A key metric used to gauge this is the Altcoin Season Index , tracked by reputable cryptocurrency price data platform CoinMarketCap (CMC). This index provides a snapshot of where the market stands relative to these cycles. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Tell Us? According to data from CoinMarketCap, the Altcoin Season Index recently registered a reading of 15. This figure remained unchanged from the previous day as of 00:28 UTC on April 28. What does a score of 15 signify? It’s a clear signal that the market is currently experiencing Bitcoin Season . The index itself is a simple yet powerful tool. It measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days, specifically comparing their gains against Bitcoin’s performance during the same period. Note that stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded from this calculation to give a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. How is Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season Defined? The CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. The threshold for determining which ‘season’ the market is in is based on the percentage of the top 100 altcoins that have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day window: Altcoin Season: Occurs when 75% or more of the top 100 altcoins have performed better than Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score would typically be high, often 75 or above. Bitcoin Season: Occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have managed to outperform Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score would be low, typically 25 or below. Neither Season: If the performance falls somewhere in between (more than 25% but less than 75% of altcoins outperforming Bitcoin), the market is considered to be in a transition phase or simply ‘Neither Season’. With the index currently sitting at 15, it firmly places the market in Bitcoin Season. What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for the Crypto Market and Your Altcoin Performance? Being in Bitcoin Season suggests that over the past three months, a significant majority of the largest altcoins have failed to keep pace with Bitcoin’s price movements. Bitcoin has been the dominant performer among the top assets. This phase often coincides with periods where Bitcoin sees strong upward momentum, sometimes attracting capital away from altcoins as investors prioritize the perceived safety and liquidity of BTC. Alternatively, it can happen when the overall market is consolidating or experiencing a downturn, and Bitcoin holds its value better or declines less sharply than altcoins. For investors holding altcoins, Bitcoin Season can be challenging. While Bitcoin might be making gains, their altcoin portfolios may be lagging behind or even decreasing in value relative to BTC. This divergence highlights the varying risk profiles and market dynamics between Bitcoin and the broader altcoin market. Why Are We Seeing Bitcoin Season Now? Several factors can contribute to a period of Bitcoin Season. Recent strong performance by Bitcoin, perhaps driven by macroeconomic factors, institutional interest, or anticipation of events like the halving, can cause it to outshine altcoins. When Bitcoin rallies hard, it often sucks liquidity from altcoins in the short term as traders consolidate positions into the market leader. Conversely, periods of market uncertainty can also lead to Bitcoin Season. In times of volatility or fear, investors often retreat to Bitcoin, viewing it as the less risky asset compared to the vast and often more volatile altcoin landscape. This flight to ‘quality’ within the crypto space strengthens Bitcoin’s relative performance. Actionable Insights During Bitcoin Season Understanding the current market season based on the Altcoin Season Index can inform investment strategies. During Bitcoin Season: Focus on Bitcoin: This period historically favors Bitcoin. Investors might prioritize accumulating BTC or trading its movements. Evaluate Altcoin Positions: It might be a time to re-evaluate altcoin holdings. Are certain altcoins showing resilience? Are others underperforming significantly? Look for Opportunities: While many altcoins lag, some niche projects might still perform well based on specific news or developments. However, broad altcoin rallies are less likely during this phase. Manage Risk: Altcoins can be more volatile, especially when Bitcoin is dominating. Proper risk management becomes even more crucial. It’s important to remember that the Altcoin Season Index is a historical look (90 days) and not a predictive tool. Market dynamics can change rapidly, and a shift back towards Altcoin Season is always possible, often following a significant move or consolidation in Bitcoin’s price. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Current Market Phase The CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index currently signals that the crypto market is firmly in Bitcoin Season. This means Bitcoin has been the dominant performer among the top 100 assets over the past three months. While this phase presents challenges for broad altcoin outperformance, it also offers opportunities for strategic positioning, particularly focusing on Bitcoin or carefully selecting altcoins that demonstrate relative strength. Keeping an eye on this index, alongside other market indicators, can help investors navigate the ever-evolving landscape of the crypto market.

She stated, “It’s not realistic that the existing systems like banks are going to plug directly into the blockchain. They do need some connective tissue. That’s what we provide.” Long clarified that Ripple’s role is to act as the necessary intermediary layer that enables financial institutions to access and utilize blockchain technology, particularly through the XRP Ledger. Infrastructure Services to Facilitate Blockchain Integration Elaborating further, Long described what infrastructure means within this context. She explained that infrastructure services include on-ramps to convert fiat currencies into digital assets and off-ramps to convert them back. Secure custody solutions are also part of the infrastructure Ripple aims to offer, ensuring that institutions have a safe and compliant method to store digital assets.

She reminded viewers that Ripple’s origin is rooted in the development of the XRP Ledger by three developers. She emphasized that Ripple has always believed in creating use cases that leverage the unique efficiencies of the XRP Ledger . According to her remarks, the range of services Ripple is currently focused on building will primarily operate through the XRP Ledger, ensuring financial institutions can adopt blockchain technology more easily and securely. Strengthening Financial Institutions’ Access to Blockchain JackTheRippler’s post highlighted the significance of this announcement for the broader crypto and banking industries. The XRP Ledger, originally designed to facilitate fast and cost-effective transactions, is positioned to become a key platform for institutional blockchain adoption. By serving as the connective infrastructure, Ripple aims to bridge the traditional financial system and decentralized technology, facilitating a smoother transition without requiring banks to overhaul their existing systems. Ripple’s strategy, as detailed by Monica Long, underscores a strong commitment to enabling financial institutions to benefit from blockchain’s efficiencies. Ripple’s provision of critical services like fiat on-ramps, custody solutions, stablecoin support, and asset tokenization layers will ensure that banks can interact with the XRP Ledger seamlessly. As this strategy unfolds, it would enhance institutional trust and participation in the blockchain ecosystem, with Ripple at the center of this evolution.
