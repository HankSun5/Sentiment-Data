It’s now up an impressive 13% from the multi-week lows it recently hit in the $175 area, but still has a long way to go before it retests its recent highs in the $260s. Solana back to $200 Me and my buddies with a combined total of $17.50 in our wallet: pic.twitter.com/sbaDr7BhMk — Kakashi (@kkashi_yt) December 25, 2024 Indeed, the bulls shouldn’t get overly excited about the rebound just yet. Chart analysis suggests the Solana price remains stuck in a downtrend and remains substantial in both its 21 and 50DMAs. A meaningful break above $220 would be required to confirm an end to the bearish trend. The Fed’s recent hawkish policy shift (towards signaling only two rate cuts in 2025) knocked confidence in risk assets last week. Will that keep the Solana price in a bearish trend? Probably not. Here’s why a recovery back towards its 2024 highs and beyond is likely in early 2025. Solana Price Set to Retest $260 Soon, Here’s Why The Fed won’t be cutting interest rates as much in 2025, which is, on margin, a negative for risk assets. But there are too many other fundamentals to be bullish on right now to get overly worried about this. Firstly, the US economy continues to perform very well. Assuming that continues, this should underpin risk assets (like US stocks) moving forward, a tailwind for crypto. But much more important for crypto is the imminent arrival of the pro-crypto Trump administration and a new pro-crypto US Congress. The US crypto industry is on the cusp of entering into a new golden age, and this should be a boon for all major crypto assets as adoption accelerates. With most major cryptos also still yet to enter the most explosive phase of their bull markets, the Solana price could soon enter lift-off. And a break above the aforementioned downtrend could be the trigger. The blockchain’s on-chain fundamentals are looking very healthy, with trading and transaction volumes and TVL in strong uptrends, per DeFi Llama . Solana’s market cap was last around $94 billion, which is under 25% of Ethereum’s . Its unlikely to overtake Ethereum this cycle, given ETH will also likely see significant expansion. But it wouldn’t be unreasonable to see the Solana price 4-5x from current levels and match Ethereum’s current market cap. With the price still down 25% from its November peaks, Solana is a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now .

To read full editions, subscribe . What better way to celebrate the season than by diving into the holly-jolly madness of holiday memecoins? Pump.fun has been brimming with festive chaos as degens deck the chain with memes and mayhem, so we thought we’d take a moment to unwrap a few of the highlights. First up, the Santas. Purple is the color of the moment, and Santa is apparently taking it in stride. Santa Paws (yes, a cat) appears to be attempting to claw its way to a comeback, while Santa Is Real and Santa Isn’t Real duke it out for festive dominance. Santa wif Hat, meanwhile, is rocking an alarming variety of headgear, from classic red to…let’s just call it “experimental.” And what’s this? Could it be a brigade of naked Santa variants storming the chain, ranging from cheeky to full-on yuletide nightmare fuel ? Aw thanks, frens…you really shouldn’t have. New holidays are making their debuts too. Ever heard of Rizzmas ? Hawktuahnukkah ? Chrismahanukwanzaka ? Me neither, and yet here we are. Degens have made their wish lists loud and clear with aspirational coins like “All I Want for Xmas is (1000X)” and “AllIWANTforXmasIsAMillionBucks.” Ho ho hodl. Oh, and the snowmen…my goodness, the snowmen. They’ve outdone themselves. Frosty the Dough Man — because nothing says “the season of giving” like hoarding bags of cash — is joined by the very swol Abdominal Snowman (you read that right), an alarmingly handsome-Squidward-esque Mewing Snowman, and the ever popular extra thicc Gyatt Snowman, among many , many others . It only gets weirder. There are memecoins featuring homicidal Christmas trees, an unfortunate P. Diddy made of gingerbread, Biden and Trump (both dressed as Santa) kissing under the mistletoe, and a truly inexplicable Jesus made of shrimp (called Shresus, obviously). And then there’s the Grinch. Solana devs can’t get enough of Dr. Seuss’ iconic green grouch. Grinch Mona Lisa? Check . Super Saiyan Grinch? Why not ? Grinch Hawktuah? Sure . If it’s a meme, it’s minting. Finally, if the cold weather is keeping you from touching grass, don’t worry — you can always Touch Snow . From all of us at Lightspeed: Happy holidays, Solana fam!

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 21:34:00

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing five potentially game-changing altcoins for December and January. Table of Contents XYZverse: A new altcoin with 100x potential Ethereum PEPE Shiba Inu Ethena Conclusion As Bitcoin surges beyond the $100,000 milestone, a wave of opportunity sweeps across the crypto landscape. Altcoins are breaking new ground with record highs, and the resurgence of meme tokens could be imminent. Unveiling five altcoins that might be the key to staying ahead in December and January. XYZverse: A new altcoin with 100x potential XYZverse is the world’s first meme coin tailored for sports enthusiasts. Whether a football fanatic, basketball devotee, MMA fan, or gaming enthusiast, XYZverse creates a dynamic ecosystem where profits meet passion. Its ambitious roadmap aims to dominate the meme coin arena, outpacing competitors like Pepe and Shiba Inu. Starting at $0.0001, XYZ has already reached Stage 9 of its presale at $0.001333, and it’s targeting a listing price of $0.1 — a potential 100x gain at current prices. With the presale still open, investors have an opportunity to join the race before the token hits major exchanges. Why XYZverse is December/January powerhouse: Massive profit potential: With a roadmap targeting a 10,000x return, XYZ combines meme coin hype with the massive appeal of sports. Early mover advantage: Investors in the current presale stage are positioning themselves for exponential gains as the project gains momentum. Broad market appeal: By uniting sports and memes, XYZverse will attract a diverse audience, from crypto degens to dedicated sports fans. As the crypto market accelerates and altcoins break new records, XYZverse emerges as a potential game-changer. Its unique value proposition and growth potential make it one of the most exciting altcoins to watch this season. Interested investors can get XYZ via presale and be part of the next crypto championship . You might also like: Altcoins under $1 that could bring big gains this holiday period Ethereum Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has transformed the digital landscape with smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum’s advancements make it a prominent player in the blockchain industry. The growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and its diverse applications underpin its strong position. While market trends fluctuate, Ethereum’s technology and potential keep it at the heart of discussions about crypto’s next steps. PEPE PEPE is a meme coin on Ethereum, serving as a tribute to Pepe the Frog, an internet meme by Matt Furie. PEPE aims to ride the popularity of meme coins like Dogecoin. With no taxes and a simple, straightforward approach, it’s attracting attention for keeping things pure and fun as a meme coin. PEPE’s value skyrocketed in 2023, pushing its market cap to $1.6 billion at one point. Whether it will reach new heights in the current market cycle remains to be seen, but its momentum and community support make it an interesting player to watch. You might also like: Polygon meme coin to overtake PEPE and SHIB in the bull run Shiba Inu Shiba Inu began as a playful nod to Dogecoin but has grown into something more. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB’s place on Ethereum means it can do more. It has launched ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade tokens. Shiba Inu also plans to introduce an NFT platform and a DAO where holders will help make decisions. This shows SHIB’s potential to be more than just a meme coin. In today’s market, investors look for coins that offer real value, and SHIB’s development could make it appealing. While many meme coins come and go, Shiba Inu is building tools and a community that could last. Ethena Ethena aims to be a stable, crypto-native dollar that doesn’t rely on traditional banks. This means ENA can be used without worrying about the banking system. Ethena also brings the Internet Bond, a global savings tool in dollars, accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This bond offers a way to save money and earn interest without needing a bank. In today’s market, where many seek stable and accessible financial options, ENA stands out. The idea of a stablecoin that’s not tied to traditional banks is gaining attention, especially after recent banking uncertainties. By providing both a crypto-native dollar and a global savings instrument, Ethena is positioning ENA to meet the needs of users looking for security and growth in the crypto space. Conclusion While ETH, PEPE, SHIB, and ENA are promising, XYZ stands out as the first all-sport meme coin for fans aiming for massive growth in a community-driven ecosystem.

One such standout in the world of online gambling is Starlight Princess , a slot game developed by Pragmatic Play. This celestial-themed game offers an engaging experience for players who enjoy vibrant graphics and rewarding mechanics. For those curious about diving into the adventure, the Starlight Princess demo oyna option provides a chance to explore the game’s features without financial commitment. In this review, we’ll delve into the unique features, gameplay, and rewards of Starlight Princess while highlighting why it’s a favorite among gambling enthusiasts. We’ll also touch upon how the game fits within the evolving landscape of blockchain and crypto gaming. Starlight Princess: Overview and Theme Starlight Princess is a visually stunning slot game that transports players to a mystical, sky-high kingdom ruled by an enchanting princess. The game’s anime-inspired graphics, vivid colors, and magical soundtrack set it apart from traditional slot games. With a unique cascading reels feature, every spin is filled with the potential for big wins. The Starlight Princess demo oyna feature lets players experience the game’s rich visuals and mechanics without wagering real money. This demo is an excellent way for beginners and seasoned players alike to get familiar with its rules, payout potential, and bonus features. By exploring the demo, players can strategize and decide how to approach the game when they switch to real-money mode. Gameplay Mechanics and Features Starlight Princess offers a fresh take on the traditional slot format, featuring a 6×5 reel setup and a pay-anywhere mechanic. Unlike games where symbols must align on specific paylines, Starlight Princess rewards players for landing clusters of identical symbols anywhere on the grid. Key Features of Starlight Princess: Tumble Feature : Winning symbols disappear after a spin, allowing new symbols to cascade into the grid. This increases the chance of consecutive wins from a single spin, a mechanic that adds excitement and boosts payouts. Multiplier Symbols : The game includes multiplier symbols with values ranging from 2x to 500x. These multipliers can significantly amplify winnings, especially during the Free Spins round. Free Spins Bonus Round : Landing at least four scatter symbols triggers the Free Spins feature, where players are awarded 15 spins. During this round, multipliers accumulate, offering the potential for massive payouts. Buy Free Spins Option : For players eager to jump into the action, the game allows purchasing the Free Spins feature for a set price, bypassing the need to wait for scatter symbols. Starlight Princess and Blockchain Gambling As the gambling industry increasingly incorporates blockchain technology, games like Starlight Princess align well with the expectations of tech-savvy players. Blockchain casinos provide transparency, provably fair gaming, and secure transactions through cryptocurrencies, creating a seamless and trustworthy experience. Here’s how Starlight Princess fits into the blockchain gambling ecosystem: Crypto Integration : Many platforms offering Starlight Princess accept cryptocurrencies, enabling players to enjoy the game with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital assets. Provably Fair Gaming : By leveraging blockchain’s transparent algorithms, casinos can ensure that outcomes in games like Starlight Princess are genuinely random and fair. Decentralized Casinos : Blockchain-powered casinos allow players to maintain greater anonymity and control over their funds, making games like Starlight Princess more accessible to a global audience. Pragmatic Play: The Creator Behind Starlight Princess Pragmatic Play is a leading provider in the online gambling industry, known for its innovative slot games that combine engaging themes with advanced mechanics. The company consistently delivers high-quality titles that cater to a wide range of players. Why Pragmatic Play Stands Out: Diverse Game Portfolio : Beyond Starlight Princess, Pragmatic Play has developed numerous slots, table games, and live casino products, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Player-Centric Design : Each game is designed to offer an intuitive and enjoyable experience, whether played on desktop or mobile devices. Fairness and Security : Pragmatic Play games are rigorously tested for fairness, making them a reliable choice for players. Why Players Love Starlight Princess Starlight Princess appeals to players for several reasons: Engaging Visuals and Theme : The anime-style design and magical atmosphere create an immersive gaming experience. Rewarding Features : The tumble mechanic and multipliers keep the gameplay dynamic and lucrative. Demo Mode : The Starlight Princess demo oyna feature provides a risk-free way to enjoy the game and learn its mechanics. Compatibility with Crypto Gambling : The game’s availability on blockchain casinos makes it a go-to choice for crypto enthusiasts. Tips for Playing Starlight Princess While luck plays a significant role in slot games, here are some tips to enhance your experience: Start with the Demo : Use the Starlight Princess demo oyna feature to familiarize yourself with the gameplay and mechanics. Set a Budget : Determine a budget for real-money play and stick to it to ensure responsible gambling. Take Advantage of Bonuses : Look for casinos offering promotions, such as free spins or deposit bonuses, to extend your gameplay. Understand the Features : Learn how multipliers and the Free Spins round work to maximize your winnings. Final Thoughts Starlight Princess is more than just a slot game—it’s a captivating adventure that combines stunning visuals, rewarding gameplay, and innovative features. Its alignment with the trends in blockchain gambling makes it a must-try for modern players seeking a transparent and engaging experience. For those curious about exploring the enchanting world of Starlight Princess, the Starlight Princess demo oyna option is an excellent starting point. It’s a chance to enjoy the game’s features and prepare for the excitement of real-money play on trusted platforms like 7Slots Casino.

While financial legends like Warren Buffett turned market crashes into windfalls, today’s savvy investors are looking to the world of meme coins to achieve similar success. The crypto landscape is abuzz, with Popcat (POPCAT) struggling to claw back from a massive price drop and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) turning heads with its AI-powered promotion. But the real excitement? It’s all about BTFD Coin’s presale , which has already surged past $4.5 million in funds raised, offering a jaw-dropping 50% festive discount for early investors. This limited-time deal, featuring the bonus code “ BIG50 ,” lets buyers snag $BTFD at just $0.000064—a steal when you consider its post-presale listing price of $0.0006. With a live P2E game, staking rewards, and a thriving community, BTFD Coin is set to redefine the meme coin space. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin stands out among the top meme coin presales to buy today and explore the latest updates on Popcat and Goatseus Maximus. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Festive Bull Run is Here Imagine a world where every market dip is a golden opportunity. This philosophy is at the heart of BTFD Coin, a meme coin inspired by the “Buy The Dip” mantra. With its P2E game beta now live and staking rewards already available, BTFD Coin is poised to redefine what it means to invest in meme coins. The BTFD presale has been nothing short of spectacular. In just its 12th stage, it’s sold over 59 billion tokens to more than 6,600 holders, raising a staggering $4.5 million. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, the current price is $0.000064—a massive 837.5% return for early investors. Here’s the kicker: with the festive 50% discount, investors can grab BTFD coins at a bargain using the code “ BIG50 .” Analysts predict even greater gains when the coin lists at $0.0006 after January 5, 2025. For instance, an investment of $6,500 at the discounted price yields over 101 million BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006, that’s a potential return of over $60,000—a nearly 9x gain! This is why investors are flocking to BTFD’s presale. What sets BTFD apart is its utility-focused ecosystem. The P2E game, though in beta, is already generating buzz for its immersive gameplay. Players can join the Bulls Squad and engage in a gamified crypto experience. Though no rewards are earned during the beta, this is just the beginning of what promises to be a lucrative gaming journey. Add to this the 90% APY staking rewards introduced in Stage 3, and it’s clear that BTFD is more than just hype. Joining the presale is simple. Connect your wallet (like MetaMask or Trust Wallet) on the BTFD presale page , input the code “ BIG50 ,” and enjoy the discounted price. Don’t miss the referral programme—top referrers get 10% of the raised amount in tokens at month’s end. With a maximum supply of 173 billion tokens, BTFD is built on Ethereum’s robust blockchain, ensuring security, scalability, and accessibility for all investors. The BTFD presale isn’t just a chance to buy into a coin; it’s an invitation to join a community driven by resilience and strategic thinking. The world’s financial history—like the 1973 oil shock—has shown that buying during downturns often leads to monumental gains. BTFD embraces this ethos, giving every investor a shot at turning market chaos into personal triumph. Popcat (POPCAT): Bouncing Back from the Meme Market Dip Popcat—a coin inspired by the viral internet meme—has had a rollercoaster year. After reaching an all-time high of $2.06 in November 2024, the token faced a brutal 65% price decline over the last 30 days. This dip left many questioning its long-term viability. However, all is not lost for POPCAT. Currently priced at $0.825, Popcat has found support at the $1 mark, sparking renewed optimism among traders. Analysts note that maintaining this support could trigger a rally, with potential resistance levels offering significant upside. The coin’s developers have also been active in stabilising its community, emphasising its integration within the Solana blockchain for fast and cost-effective transactions. Popcat’s story highlights the unpredictable nature of meme coins. It serves as a reminder that while these investments carry high risk, they also offer opportunities for those who can navigate their volatility. For those who believe in Popcat’s potential, this could be an ideal time to enter the market at a discount. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): AI Meets Meme Coin Mania Goatseus Maximus has quickly become a topic of fascination in the meme coin world, thanks in large part to its association with Truth Terminal—an AI created by New Zealand developer Andy Ayrey. The AI’s promotional prowess has catapulted GOAT into the spotlight, making it a unique player in the crypto space. Despite reaching an all-time high of $1.35 in November 2024, GOAT’s price has since dropped to $0.49. This decline reflects the volatility typical of meme coins but hasn’t dampened the enthusiasm of its community.

Viewing the dip as a chance for a low market entry, these whales now purchase Dogecoin in large volumes , with the latest transactions recording a 270 million buy. Dogecoin Whales Scoop Up 270 Million DOGE The recent decline in the Dogecoin price has prompted large-scale investors, typically called “whales,” to accumulate more tokens. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez disclosed in an X (formerly Twitter) post on Tuesday that Dogecoin whales have bought a whopping 270 million DOGE tokens in the last five days. This massive 270 million DOGE buy is part of a broader accumulation trend noticed across the meme coin’s network. Since November, Martinez has recorded whales buying hundreds of millions of DOGE during the downtrend. On December 21, the analyst revealed that Dogecoin whales had purchased 250 million DOGE during the recent market dip . This bold move was made as investors saw DOGE’s decline as a favorable entry point, a behavior often associated with more prominent players who buy tokens at a lower price in hopes of long-term gains. The recent DOGE buying spree by whales could indicate strong confidence in the Coin’s future. Martinez has also expressed optimism in the meme coin’s price prospects, highlighting in a previous X post that DOGE could experience another parabolic rally to a $20 ATH. While bullish sentiment for DOGE’s price remains strong , Dogecoin whales are taking advantage of the current market conditions and declining prices to increase their holdings and prepare for a potential rally. With the Dogecoin price currently trading at $0.33, the recent 270 million DOGE buy is approximately valued at $89 million. Pattern Repetition Could See DOGE Price Reaching $5 Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has presented a chart illustrating a recurring historical trend pattern in the Dogecoin price movement. The analyst suggests that a repetition of this historical trend could trigger a parabolic rally for Dogecoin . The red curved lines in the chart highlight DOGE’s rounded consolidation phases in different cycles, while the green ascending lines underscore a steady bullish trend. Each consolidation period in the chart has led to a significant rally, where Dogecoin’s price explodes at the end of the trend. Based on the recurrent historical pattern, DOGE is seemingly exiting its recent consolidation phase , indicating that a potential breakout may be on the horizon. Trader Tardigrade has predicted that the breakout could trigger a price increase as high as $5, marking new all-time highs for DOGE . At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.33, reflecting a 3.5% increase in the last 24 hours. A surge to $5 would require the meme coin to record a staggering 1,415% surge from its current price.",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|Analyst|crypto|Crypto Analyst|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-25 22:00:33

Table of Contents XYZ: Taking the spotlight with 16,900% growth forecast XRP Cardano Conclusion A new presale token from Polygon is drawing attention from investors who once favored XRP and Cardano (ADA). Predictions for this token suggest gains as high as 16,900%, stirring excitement in the cryptocurrency market. XYZ: Taking the spotlight with 16,900% growth forecast XYZ — the first-ever all-sports meme coin — is emerging as a must-watch contender. Combining the energy of meme culture with the passion of sports fans, XYZ is blazing its trail in the crypto space with a forecasted 16,900% surge, potentially rivaling the hype around XRP and Cardano. Why XYZ is capturing investor interest: A new era in meme coins XYZ aims to bring a unique blend of sports, entertainment, and decentralized finance to the table. Its XYZVerse ecosystem will merge prediction markets, sports betting, and interactive dApps, creating a playground for millions of gamblers and crypto enthusiasts alike. Undervalued yet poised for massive growth Currently in its presale phase, XYZ is a hidden gem for early investors. By its Token Generation Event (TGE), XYZ is projected to outperform past meme coin sensations like BOME and WIF. Its roadmap also includes CEX/DEX listings, entertainment platforms, and token burns, ensuring a robust ecosystem and sustained price growth. Community-driven success Unlike many presale tokens, XYZ empowers its community.

Intrigued investors can join the XYZ presale for the potential 16,900% opportunity. XRP XRP is a digital currency aiming to make money transfer faster. It’s built on the XRP Ledger — a decentralized system that allows for swift, low-cost, and secure transactions. XRP doesn’t require a bank account for settlements, making it accessible to people everywhere. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and efficiency compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be slower and more expensive to use. XRP’s ability to facilitate seamless payment transfers across different currencies aligns well with the growing demand for quick and borderless transactions. As financial systems evolve, XRP’s technology positions it as a potential key player. Its focus on real-world application and partnerships in the banking sector also make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Cardano Cardano is a layer-1 blockchain that allows developers to build decentralized finance apps, create new crypto tokens, and develop games. Similar to Ethereum’s ETH, ADA can be used to store value, make payments, and earn rewards through staking on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake system, which is much more energy-efficient than the traditional proof-of-work model used by Bitcoin. Additionally, Cardano’s blockchain is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions quickly — potentially up to a million per second. In the current market, where sustainability and scalability are highly valued, ADA presents an attractive option. As Ethereum faces challenges with high fees and scaling, Cardano’s approach might give it an edge. Conclusion XRP and ADA remain strong options, but XYZ could dominate the 2024 bull run.

Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov spoke about alternatives to the US dollar for international trade during an interview on Russia-24 on Dec. 25. Siluanov highlighted that the government has authorized foreign trade transactions using DFAs and Bitcoin, adding that such methods are already in practice and set for expansion. “We Can Use Mined Bitcoin” Siluanov emphasized that adopting DFAs in foreign trade is a logical step under current circumstances, enabling the use of modern infrastructure. He described this approach as an innovation in global settlement systems, stating, “That is the future.” Russia is leveraging its experimental legal framework, effective since September 2024, to integrate DFAs — including Bitcoin — into international trade. Siluanov explained, “We can pay for the delivery of goods with digital financial assets. It is also possible to use Bitcoin, which we mined here in the Russian Federation, within the experimental regime.” Russia Legalizes Mining and Scales DFA Use The minister noted that Russia legalized Bitcoin mining earlier in 2024, paving the way for such transactions. He added, “We say that they need to be developed and expanded, and I am sure that next year, it will be a reality.” Siluanov Cautions Against Crypto Investment Amid Bitcoin Highs While advocating for DFA use in trade, Siluanov has warned against viewing cryptocurrency as an investment vehicle. In a speech on Nov. 6, he stated, “Some people see cryptocurrency as a source of quick money. I don’t recommend it as a means of investment.” His remarks underline the dual approach of promoting DFAs in trade while cautioning against speculative risks for individual investors.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 22:18:28

So, investors are treading very carefully. That’s why many Avalanche (AVAX) holders are switching. The same can be said for SUI. However, SUI investors are a bit more confident. Regardless, both are looking for something more stable. And this is where FX Guys ($FXG) comes in. FX Guys is a new crypto trading platform. As such, it brings massive utility to the market. So, experts are confident that it will do really well after its launch. Namely, they say that $FXG’s price will rise by at least 20x soon! >>>JOIN FXGuys HERE The Avalanche Token Price Might Fall Further Due to Sell-Offs AVAX’s price has been going up and down this whole month. Namely, AVAX’s price started off strong at the beginning of December 2024. However, a market-wide dip caused AVAX’s price to fall. Then, AVAX’s price recovered shortly after. Avalanche investors thought that the rise would continue. However, another market-wide dip proved otherwise. And due to that, AVAX’s price tumbled once again. More specifically, Avalanche’s price went below $35 on December 20, 2024. And then it rose again soon after to reach its current price of $38. This up-and-down movement is very worrying for Avalanche investors. That’s why they’re looking for something more stable. And they’ve found FX Guys! As a result, Avalanche investors are now bidding heavily on this project. As for AVAX, experts foresee its price dropping by another 20% soon. That’s because Avalanche investors are shedding their holdings to invest in more promising tokens. SUI Shows Strenght as Its Price Recovers SUI is showing massive strength right now. Unlike other altcoins, SUI is doing really well in this up-and-down market. Namely, SUI’s price has already recovered from its recent losses. Now, the SUI price stands at $4.60. Also, SUI’s charts are green in all timeframes. This just shows how resilient SUI is. However, SUI investors are still skeptical. That’s because of the current market volatility. Experts agree with them, recommending extreme caution to everyone right now. They say that SUI’s price can dip again soon due to the volatility. Per expert analysis, SUI’s price will fall by around 15% in the next couple of weeks. So, SUI investors are also looking to diversify right now. Most of them are investing in a new crypto trading platform! Of course, we’re talking about FX Guys! >>>JOIN FXGuys HERE FX Guys: The New Crypto Trading Platform Attracting Traders There are many reasons why everyone is talking about FX Guys right now.

Some claim the published image is from Thailand and was printed eight years ago, while others point to a publication in Vietnam six years ago. Overall, the controversy is creating additional social media hype around the token, where some hype up the plagiarism, while others believe the entire story is to create more FUD around the token. Reverse image search shows this came from a Vietnamese book 6 years ago The artist who claimed to have the rights to #chillguy is a fraud Send the #OGchillguy pic.twitter.com/0aODGjVgAP — DD (@onchainbookie) December 25, 2024 Previously, Chillguy was considered the original creation of cartoonist Phillip Banks. Banks himself was touchy about using the image, even intending legal action to protect his creation. Despite this, the image was widely used on TikTok and became the avatar of a whole collection of meme tokens. Up to 30 versions of CHILLGUY or similar tickers exist, spreading on Ethereum, Solana, and Base. The main version was the one affected by the discovery of what social media considers plagiarism. Is CHILLGUY still the original? Some doubted the evidence of actual plagiarism, where claims were made that the character was taken from a Vietnamese leaflet created six years ago. Skeptics did not see additional evidence and suggested the image may be AI-generated or manipulated in some way. Phillip Banks has posted an Instagram image suggesting the suspicions are unfounded and the plagiarism is based on a faked image. Banks has not communicated through X to explicitly refute the claims and rarely pays attention to the meme community. The story was appealing enough that some of the large influencer accounts repeated the message of suspected plagiarism. Others found evidence that Banks denied all claims, while the image raised red flags of being AI-generated . Others noted that the booklet is not actually years old, and may be printed after the creation of Chillguy. In fact, when showing the reverse image search, Google indexes the age of subreddits, and not the image itself, which may be more recently printed. CHILLGUY controversy produces new meme token According to the original claims of plagiarism, the booklet called the character ‘Relax Boy’. This is just the name that the meme market needed, immediately launching RELAXBOY on Solana. The token graduated to Raydium and is already in price discovery mode. RELAXBOY was created based on the plagiarism claims, going through a boom and crash just hours after creation. | Source: DexScreener RELAXBOY is just hours old and has already gone through a 700X rally, followed by a 67% crash. The new asset still has just $232K in locked liquidity, though the token is creating a social media movement. Just hours after the token’s launch, CHILLGUY whales bought in . For traders, the actual verification of the image is less important. The spreading of images and rumors on TikTok shows the short video social app may also play a big role in the meme token market. If RELAXBOY was not enough, the market also produced Just a Chill Dog (CHILLDOG) , playing on the remixed illustration hype. The new asset is just as risky as RELAXBOY, though both tokens have seen intentions of creating social media movements and rising to a higher valuation.

Amid this growing institutional adoption, the Bank of Italy has taken a notably critical stance. In its Economic and Financial Occasional Paper, it labeled Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) services – widely celebrated for their accessibility – as “crime-as-a-service.” Bank of Italy Raises Red Flag on Bitcoin P2P The Bank of Italy’s report from November 2024 highlighted the growing role of Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) services as tools for money laundering in jurisdictions with weak regulations. These services, described as “crime-as-a-service,” exploit regulatory loopholes, allowing illicit actors to obscure the origins of illegally obtained funds. The 131-year-old financial institution targeted unregulated P2P platforms and informal exchange networks, in particular, that evade traditional Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols and end up creating pathways for illegal activities. These methods enable criminals to bypass the scrutiny of centralized financial intermediaries by leveraging the pseudonymity of blockchain transactions. Regulatory Gaps The Bank of Italy’s report also highlighted the challenges posed by decentralized financial (DeFi) systems in combating money laundering. While centralized finance (CeFi) platforms can be regulated similarly to traditional financial institutions, their decentralized counterparts, on the other hand, operate without intermediaries, making oversight far more complex. The pseudonymity inherent in blockchain technology allows users to engage in transactions through unlinked addresses, effectively concealing their identities. This has sparked a debate between those who praise blockchain for its transparency and immutability and critics who highlight its potential for abuse. The report points to emerging solutions like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), which enable selective disclosure of information to mitigate illicit activities without compromising user privacy. However, these innovations, though promising, fall short of providing the continuous due diligence necessary to identify suspicious activities systematically, as per the Bank of Italy.

With its robust ecosystem and continued upgrades, the platform aims to offer significant utility and scalability, making it a foundational asset in the cryptocurrency space. Whales are drawn to Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), which has seen exponential growth and is poised for further expansion in the coming bull cycle. Accumulating Ethereum not only provides exposure to the broader crypto market but also positions investors to benefit from the increasing adoption of smart contract platforms worldwide. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu initially captured the attention of crypto whales for its explosive price movements. However, SHIB has evolved beyond its meme origins, with recent developments, such as the Shibarium Layer-2 scaling solution adding to its utility. Whales are also attracted to SHIB’s deflationary tokenomics, with regular token burns reducing supply and increasing scarcity to potentially increase price with demand. As Shiba Inu integrates further into DeFi and explores metaverse opportunities, it solidifies its potential for high upsides in the next bull run. Conclusion While ETH and SHIB remain strong choices, crypto whales are also focusing on XYZ, a meme coin uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem in the current bull run.

Investors and traders are actively exploring the top altcoins under $1 to invest in 2025. The current market sentiment appears positive as leading assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL) show signs of upside momentum. Based on technical analysis and recent whale activity, these are the top 10 altcoins under $1 to invest in for 2025. Additionally, this article will help you identify the best altcoin with the potential to generate significant returns. Cardano (ADA) ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies currently consolidating within a tight range between $0.86 and $0.97 over the past seven days. ADA is among the cryptocurrencies that could experience significant gains in the coming days if it breaks out from this narrow range. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if ADA breaks above the $0.97 mark and closes a daily candle above this level, it could potentially soar by 65%, reaching the $1.62 mark in the future. However, the altcoin may encounter resistance at the $1.24 level during its upward momentum. Hedera (HBAR) HBAR, the native token of Hedera, has been making waves amidst ongoing market uncertainty with its impressive upward momentum. Over the past three days, while major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) have struggled to gain traction, HBAR has surged by more than 40%. Source: Trading View With its recent rally, HBAR has broken out of a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern and appears to be retesting the breakout level. If it successfully retests this level, there is a strong possibility that the altcoin could soar by 200%, reaching the $0.98 mark in the future. This strong bullish price action pattern attracts traders and investors, making HBAR an ideal altcoin to consider for investment under $1 in 2025. Stellar (XLM) Following the presidential election results, Stellar’s native token, XLM, has garnered significant attention from crypto enthusiasts due to its impressive upward momentum. According to CoinMarketCap data, XLM has surged by more than 460%. However, after such a notable rally, XLM now appears to be undergoing a price correction. Source: Trading View Amid this ongoing correction, XLM has formed a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern on the daily timeframe and is currently on the verge of a breakout. Based on historical momentum, a successful breakout could propel XLM by 125%, nearing the $0.95 mark in the coming days. Tron (TRX) TRX, the native token of the Tron blockchain, has garnered attention similar to XLM with its impressive rally following the presidential election. According to data, TRX has surged by more than 165%. However, it currently appears to be undergoing a price correction, experiencing a 42% decline. Experts and analysts view this recent decline as an ideal buying opportunity. Source: Trading View Amid this price action, TRX has formed a descending triangle pattern and is on the verge of a breakout. Based on historical momentum, if the altcoin breaks out of this pattern and closes a daily candle above the $0.26 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 70%, reaching the $0.44 mark in the future. This bullish price action positions TRX as one of the top altcoins to consider under $1 in 2025, with significant rally potential. Jupiter (JUP) JUP, the native token of Jupiter, a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange and a successful project on the Solana blockchain, has been struggling over the past few days, along with other major cryptocurrencies. However, following a price decline of over 44%, JUP has reached a crucial support level where it has historically experienced upward momentum. Source: Trading View Since the beginning of 2024, JUP has tested this trendline support five times, and on each occasion, it has rallied significantly. Experts and analysts anticipate a similar rally this time. Based on price action, JUP has begun moving upward, with a strong possibility of soaring by 55% to reach the $1.40 mark in the coming days. The Graph (GRT) Amid the recent price correction, GRT, the native token of The Graph, has experienced a significant price decline of over 40%. Following this decline, GRT has reached a golden Fibonacci level while also receiving support from a strong 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and a horizontal support level at the $0.20 mark. Source: Trading View This support zone suggests an ideal buying opportunity, as long-term holders appear to be accumulating GRT at this level, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Based on recent price action, if GRT holds this support level and sustains itself above the $0.20 mark, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 60%, reaching the $0.35 level in the future. Kaspa (KAS) KAS, the native token of Kaspa, is drawing significant attention from crypto enthusiasts as tech billionaire Elon Musk reportedly shows interest in the token. Since the beginning of November 2024, KAS has been trading within a parallel channel pattern between $0.11 and $0.19. Source: Trading View Amid the recent price correction, KAS failed to break out of this channel pattern and has fallen to its lower boundary. However, the altcoin’s daily chart indicates that its price is currently consolidating. Based on recent price action, if market sentiment shifts positively, there is a strong possibility that KAS could rally by 60% to reach the $0.19 level in the coming days. Additionally, the altcoin’s daily chart suggests that KAS is an excellent choice for investment under $1 in 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular and world’s largest crypto meme coin by market cap, has been struggling over the past few days. Amid the price decline, DOGE broke below a crucial support level of $0.326 but has managed to hold this level and consolidate over the past seven days. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if DOGE sustains itself above the $0.30 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 40% to reach the $0.47 level in the future. Furthermore, it has the potential to soar by 75% if it breaks out above the $0.47 mark. Popcat (POPCAT) Popcat (POPCAT), a top Solana-based meme coin, has experienced a price decline of over 60% during the recent market drop. However, the meme coin is currently consolidating near a crucial support level at the $0.75 mark for the past seven days. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if POPCAT holds above the $0.70 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 150% to reach the $1.95 mark in the future. While this target may not be easy to achieve, POPCAT could potentially reach it in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB), the popular and second-largest crypto meme coin by market cap, is poised for upside momentum after forming a bullish price action pattern. Based on recent price action, SHIB has broken out of a consolidation zone following a successful retest of the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. Source: Trading View Following this breakout, there is a strong possibility that SHIB could rally by 75% to reach the $0.000040 mark. During this rally, the $0.000030 level may act as a hurdle for the meme coin.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 22:50:00

The tokens are set to hit the market in three transactions of 200 million, 300 million, and 500 million XRP. The clock for the three escrows will tick on the first minutes of 2025, freeing 1 billion XRP tokens in addition to the 57.2 billion currently in circulation. The January release represents 2.63% of the total 38 billion of XRP that is still locked in Ripple’s escrow accounts. To be specific, Ripple (24) address will unlock 200 and 300 million XRP that were locked in the escrow on December 1, 2024, and January 1, 2021, respectively. Then, Ripple (25) will release 500 million XRP that were locked on January 1, 2021. These will be the last transactions from Ripple (24) and (25), although there are numerous escrows held by other Ripple-controlled addresses. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which create new tokens “on the go” as a reward for miners/validators that keep the blockchain safe, Ripple pre-mined the entire supply of 100 billion XRP at the very inception of the network. In 2017, 55 billion XRP were locked in an escrow system hardcoded to release 1 billion XRP each month to ensure gradual and controlled distribution. The scheduled unlocks help Ripple fund its operations, invest in ecosystem development, and provide liquidity for its payment solutions. While the real amount of XRP that actually enters circulation every month is often lower than 1 billion due to the company re-locking a portion of tokens into a new escrow, this nevertheless creates a significant amount of selling pressure. With Ripple currently trading above the coveted $2 mark, it remains an open question whether XRP will see a proportional demand increase to sustain current price levels. Nevertheless, the promise of the nearing altcoin season leaves room for cautious optimism. VanEck experts call the start of the altcoin season As Bitcoin struggles to stay above the psychologically important $100,000 mark, VanEck experts claim that the “altcoin season” may be already in full force. The asset manager even suggested November 27 as the start day for the rise of altcoins in this cycle. For context, the term “altcoin season” refers to the periods when cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (so-called altcoins) outperform the king of crypto. The hotly anticipated altseasons historically follow after Bitcoin dominance peaks near 60%, as traders seek higher returns in alternative assets. According to VanEck analyst Matthew Sigel, the relationship between Bitcoin dominance and altcoin performance can be explained through the cyclical nature of capital flows in cryptocurrency driven by investor psychology. When new capital enters the market during Bitcoin's rise, it encourages a ”risk-on” sentiment, motivating investors to seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in altcoins. Increased appetite for risk often benefits more nascent crypto sectors, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The ”altseasons” are identified when over 60% of the top 50 altcoins by market cap, excluding the stablecoins and Bitcoin-backed assets, outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Data from Artemis’s Altcoin Season Index quoted by VanEck in a report indicates that altcoins are doing reasonably well. The index tracks how the top 50 altcoins compare to Bitcoin performance, taking on the values between 0 and 1, where 0.6 is a cutoff value that signals the start of the altcoin season. The current score of 0.64 suggests a moderate altcoin performance, a sign of a major altcoin pump still ahead. According to CoinMarketCap , the current state of the cryptocurrency market is neither altcoin season nor Bitcoin season. The platform uses a much more stringent standard for calculating the altseason index, defined as 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. With the current score of 49 sitting firmly in the middle, the altcoin rally seems like a more distant perspective than suggested by VanEck. At the same time, the index climbed as high as 82 on December 8, indicating a strong potential for a retest. Crypto analyst Ash Crypto recently made a prediction for the altcoin season to start in Q1 2025, drawing parallels between the Bitcoin performance in 2020 and 2024. In both cases, November saw strong gains in the cryptocurrency market, followed by a pullback in December. The subsequent reversal in Bitcoin dominance set the stage for the “mega altseason,” which analyst hopes to return in 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is hovering around the $99k mark. With the wave of pro-crypto policymakers brought by Trump into his administration, many experts expect Bitcoin to reach new highs in 2025. VanEck set its base price target for BTC at $180k by 2025, citing Bitcoin’s growing adoption as an institutional reserve asset, rising altcoin speculation, and powerful synergies between crypto and AI as potential catalysts in the upcoming year.",News|Altcoins|Ripple,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-25 22:53:08

Lookonchain reports that a whale suddenly created 30 new wallets to accumulate $34.1 million worth of LINK tokens from Binance. “Suspicious LINK accumulation spotted! Over the past 5 days, 30 newly created wallets have withdrawn 1.37M LINK ($34.1M) from Binance.” Source: Lookonchain/X At time of writing, Chainlink is trading at $24.04, up 34% in the last month. Earlier this week, Chainlink released Smart Value Recapture (SVR), a solution aiming to allow DeFi solutions to recapture non-toxic Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) from the leading oracle’s price feeds. “Based on real-world testing, we believe Chainlink SVR can expect to achieve a realistic value recapture rate of approximately 40% (i.e., for every $100 that would have been leaked via liquidation MEV, $40 was recaptured). While some alternative solutions have claimed to achieve a higher efficiency rate for recapturing liquidation MEV, we have not seen conclusive real-world data to showcase this. We believe that 40% is a conservative but realistic estimate—real life performance will be needed to gather actual data.” On the same day as the announcement from Chainlink, Aave , the biggest lending platform in crypto, proposed using SVR. Specifically, the proposal was about activating a pilot program of SVR oracles on Aave v3 to recapture MEV from the platform’s liquidations to return its own ecosystem. The proposal is currently awaiting questions and feedback from the community.

This Must-Watch Presale is Making Splashes in Crypto,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bitcoin-this-must-watch-presale-is-making-splashes-in-crypto/,"The cryptocurrency market has been buzzing lately with fresh developments. Bitcoin, the king of cryptos, remains in the limelight as its price dances between key moving averages. But while Bitcoin continues to hold its ground, there’s another name that’s quietly stealing the show: Qubetics ($TICS) . As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is revolutionising blockchain technology with innovations that aim to address issues Bitcoin and its contemporaries have left unresolved. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto; it’s a game-changer. From bridging blockchains to simplifying decentralised processes, Qubetics is raising the bar. And with its ongoing presale raising over $7.8 million, it’s clear that people are paying attention. Let’s explore why Qubetics and Bitcoin are among the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025 , and how they stack up against each other. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Innovation Qubetics is capturing attention for all the right reasons. Its 14th presale stage has already sold over 376 million tokens to 11,800 holders, raising an impressive $7.8 million. At $0.0377 per token, there’s a growing sense of urgency to snag $TICS before its price jumps by 10% this weekend. Crypto analysts are buzzing with excitement about Qubetics’ potential. By the presale’s end, $TICS is projected to reach $0.25, offering a return on investment of 564%. And post-presale, the numbers soar—$TICS could hit $1, providing a staggering 2,555% ROI. But it doesn’t stop there. With a $15 target after its mainnet launch, the potential ROI skyrockets to an astonishing 39,729%. Investing $100,000 at the current price could mean owning 2,652,519 tokens, which could translate to $39.7 million if the $15 milestone is achieved. QubeQode IDE: Revolutionising Real-World Applications The heart of Qubetics lies in its QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) , a powerful tool tailored for professionals, businesses, and individuals alike. Imagine a local artisan in São Paulo looking to sell handcrafted goods internationally. QubeQode IDE simplifies creating and launching a decentralised e-commerce platform, eliminating the need for tech expertise. Picture a logistics company in Mexico streamlining its supply chain using smart contracts designed through QubeQode. No middlemen, no delays—just seamless, automated transactions. Or think about a software developer in Argentina creating custom dApps for clients worldwide without needing to switch between multiple blockchains. By uniting blockchains and offering user-friendly tools, Qubetics ensures accessibility, efficiency, and trust. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Qubetics stands out for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and its real-world applications. Combine that with the excitement of its presale, and it’s easy to see why it’s among the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): The Original Crypto Titan Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of cryptocurrency, with its price currently hovering between key support and resistance levels. According to market analysts, BTC is dancing between the 21-day and 50-day simple moving averages, approximately $99,600 and $94,650, respectively. While it may not exhibit the explosive gains of younger altcoins, Bitcoin’s stability continues to make it a favourite among long-term investors. This year has seen Bitcoin reclaim its status as digital gold, with institutional interest spiking. However, regulatory headwinds and macroeconomic factors like interest rate cuts in 2025 are likely to influence its trajectory. Bitcoin’s Legacy and Use Cases Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its universality. From rural villages in Paraguay to bustling cities like Rio de Janeiro, Bitcoin is used for remittances, savings, and even everyday purchases. It’s the go-to for those who want financial freedom without the hassles of traditional banking. Bitcoin also serves as the foundation of many crypto portfolios. While it doesn’t have the bells and whistles of newer projects like Qubetics, its robustness and wide adoption make it irreplaceable. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Bitcoin’s resilience, universal appeal, and foundational role in the crypto world make it one of the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025. While its growth may not be as meteoric as altcoins, it remains a safe bet for long-term value. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics and Bitcoin are standout options for those seeking the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025. Bitcoin offers reliability and a proven track record, making it a cornerstone for any crypto portfolio. On the other hand, Qubetics is shaking up the blockchain landscape with its innovative QubeQode IDE and ambitious presale milestones. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio or ride the wave of an emerging star, now’s the time to act. Don’t let the opportunity pass you by—Qubetics and Bitcoin are here to reshape your financial future.

38117855,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322722,1735169909,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38117855.jpeg,Dogecoin Price Rallies to $0.33 – Will the Triangle Pattern Spark a Rally?,https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-rallies-to-0-33-will-the-triangle-pattern-spark-a-rally/,"The Dogecoin (DOGE) price has rallied back to $0.33 after falling as low as the $0.26s last week, and is forming a triangle pattern that could soon be the catalyst for a bullish breakout. That means that a short-term pump for the Dogecoin price back to it recent highs in the $0.48 could be on the cards in the coming days. Of course, the 21 and 50DMAs in the $0.37-38 area could offer stiff resistance, given they also coincide with some recent lows. But good vibes are likely to continue into the year’s end. Why? Well, major cryptos are tentatively recovering from a Fed-induced sell-off last week on their more hawkish than expected interest rate projections . But most major cryptos remain well below their pre-hawkish Fed meeting levels, suggesting the scope for further recovery is there. And there are a lot of tailwinds to support the crypto market right now. That’s because we are on the cusp of entering a new golden age for crypto markets in the US, but also globally. The incoming Trump administration and Congress are likely to spur a significant acceleration in the adoption of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, not least admin hopes that they establish a US strategic Bitcoin reserve. JUST IN: VanEck predicts #Bitcoin will be worth $3 million and used as a global reserve asset by 2050. pic.twitter.com/TEsvd9S34L — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) October 28, 2024 The grounds are thus fertile for the emergence of a new meme coin/alt-coin season, of which we have already seen flashes of since Trump’s emphatic election victory. Dogecoin , the oldest and still biggest meme coin, would surely lead any future meme season. That’s even more the case given that Elon Musk’ s new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) is set to be established under the Trump administration. Department of Government Efficiency pic.twitter.com/HFeHYNIkJN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 7, 2024 Musk’s new department aims to slash government fraud and waste, and will be hugely controversial and nearly constantly in the news. That all but guarantees that Dogecoin retains a leading portion of meme coin market “mind share”, guaranteeing continued market leadership. How High Will the Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Rally This Cycle? A recovery back to recent highs in the Dogecoin market is thus very likely in early 2025 as Trump returns to the White House. Bulls will be hoping for an eventual rally back to the 2021 record highs above $0.70, as well as a potential surge to $1.0 for the first time. However, might this be the end of the road for Dogecoin? Well, analysis of past Dogecoin cycles suggest the bulls need to be aiming bigger and higher, with this rally likely to far exceed where many expect. Dogecoin has been through three market cycles since its inception in 2014, and these cycles can offer clues about what could be in store for DOGE in 2025. When drawing a Fibonacci extension upwards from the prior bear market low to the prior bear market high, it can be seen that Dogecoin has always rallied well beyond the 4.236 Fibonacci level, exceeding this Fibonacci extension by over 10x during its 2021 rally. The 4.236 Fibonacci extension level from the 2022 bear market lows back to the 2021 highs suggests that Dogecoin should at least hit $3 per token this cycle. But as history has shown, Dogecoin has routinely blown well past this level. Given that context, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a $10 Dogecoin price this cycle. Of course, that would imply a multi-trillion-dollar market cap, which might be a bit much to ask. But Dogecoin could definitely 10x from current levels to reach a market cap in the $100s of billions, making it a strong candidate for best meme coin to buy now. Meme Coin Alternative With Massive Potential – Meme Index (MEMEX) For most investors, securing 10x gains is a best-case scenario. But in crypto, many degens are on the hunt for the next 100x project that will make them rich. One of the best ways to bag 100x gains is by getting into a new meme coin before it really takes off. One new meme coin that has caught the eyes of analysts at cryptonews.com is Meme Index (MEMEX) . Meme Index introduces the world’s first decentralized meme coin index, allowing investors to diversify across various meme coins through community governance. With the meme coin market cap reaching a whopping $137 billion in 2024, analysts suspect that demand for an innovative investment vehicle such as this could be very high. That’s certainly the case with Meme Index, which has already raised close to half a million dollars in MEMEX presale token sales. The project’s potential lies in its ability to offer different risk levels with indexes like Titan, Moonshot, Midcap, and Frenzy, catering to a broad investor base. Only a Chill Guy can handle the twists and turns of a Frenzy Index. pic.twitter.com/1QHv0IvF0i — Meme Index (@memecoin_index) December 17, 2024 Moreover, MEMEX holders can stake tokens for high APYs, encouraging long-term holding and potentially increasing token value. It should come as no surprise that flocks of experts have already come out to throw their support behind MEMEX . Michael Wrubel and Austin Hilton both recently hailed the project’s potential in YouTube videos to their more than 600,000 combined subscribers. Meme Index has already passed major audits from the likes of Coinsult and SOLIDProof and can be purchased with ETH, USDT or bank card.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 00:06:00

He was accused by some of creating false visuals and spreading misinformation because he used generative AI to create the photos. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupted airspace, Keyzer couldn’t travel anymore and chose to use generative artificial intelligence (AI) to produce a series of photographs about Russia. The AI-generated photos of Russia were included in his book Putin’s Dream , which was released in November. Creating Putin’s Dream To create the AI photos series, De Keyzer used real photos of Russia. Apparently, he visited Russia twelve times in a single year during the late 1980s. During the last days of the USSR, De Keyzer took pictures of the customs that would soon be lost. He has more photos from inside the prison camps in Siberia, which were taken in the 2000s. De Keyzer uploaded his own photos from the 80s and 2000s into an AI software. He then modified the output to fit his aesthetic preferences , and produced the Putin’s Dream series , The photojournalist explained that the usage of generative AI as a tool was for reflecting on the atrocities of the war in Ukraine, which was essentially the result of one man’s imagination. De Keyzer, who is pleased with the outcome, claims that the new visuals he has included in Putin’s Dream are a reflection of his earlier photography, which frequently examined power structures and propaganda. The artist sought to produce realistic AI-generated photos while fusing his trademark comedy, surrealism, and irony. His Instagram post announcing Putin’s Dream was met with scathing criticism despite his openness about utilizing AI. Many people called the photographs “fake,” but he also received some good feedback applauding the creative approach to photography. Magnum Photos, an international photographic cooperative, faced criticism as well since De Keyzer is a part of it . A week after , Magnum published a response on its website . “Magnum Photos respects and values the creative freedom of our photographers, supporting their diverse explorations and perspectives.” Other Magnum members like Jonas Bendiksen and Michael Christopher Brown have been experimenting with AI-generated photos. De Keyzer isn’t the only artist who faced backlash for using AI. Boris Eldagsen experienced criticism too, after winning the Sony World Photography Prize with an AI image. People create 34 million AI images daily Between 2022 and 2023, text-to-image AI algorithms produced over 15 billion images. An average of 34 million photos have been created every day since the debut of DALLE-2 . Adobe Firefly, a collection of AI algorithms integrated into Adobe Photoshop, is the product with the quickest rate of growth. Within three months of its introduction, it had produced one billion photographs. Midjourney has the highest number of users, with 15 million members , compared to other image generation platforms . In contrast, 30 million people use Adobe Creative Cloud, which includes graphic design and video editing tools, such as the generative AI tool Adobe Firefly. Roughly 80% of the photos, or 12.59 billion, were produced using open-source LLM models, platforms, and apps based on Stable Diffusion.

Shiba Inu, the “Dogecoin killer” that began as a meme, went from zero to a market cap in the billions, making early investors look like geniuses. Those lucky enough to scoop up Shiba Inu in its ICO at a minuscule price are now sitting pretty, while others are left asking, “Why didn’t I buy in earlier?” But here’s the good news: If you missed out on Shiba Inu’s ICO, BTFD Coin is your second chance at redemption. The presale for BTFD Coin is already crushing it, with over $4.5 million raised and nearly 60 billion coins sold. Now, with a 50% discount available using the BIG50 code, this is your opportunity to buy in at a price that could make you the next crypto success story. It’s the same kind of savvy move that was made back in 1973 during the oil market crash, where those who bought in during the panic were rewarded with significant gains when prices recovered. And just like those investors, you can seize this moment and potentially watch your investment grow. The Shiba Inu ICO: Making Millionaires Overnight Let’s rewind to 2020 when Shiba Inu launched its ICO. Initially priced at next to nothing, Shiba Inu seemed like a joke to many, but it turned out to be one of the most successful meme coins in history. The Shiba Inu community, or Shiba Army, grew quickly, and the coin’s popularity reached new heights with the celebrity endorsement of Elon Musk and other crypto moguls. The ICO price? Just a tiny fraction of a cent. And yet, today, Shiba Inu’s market cap is valued at 13 billion dollars. If you missed the chance to buy Shiba Inu at its ICO price, you’re probably thinking, “What if I had invested then?” Well, that moment has passed, but don’t let that be the end of your meme coin journey. BTFD Coin is here to offer a fresh opportunity, and it’s got everything to make waves just like Shiba Inu did. BTFD Coin: A New Era of Meme Coins, With Massive Potential BTFD Coin is poised to take over where Shiba Inu left off. The presale is well underway, and things are looking spectacular. With over $4.5 million raised, a growing community of 6,600 bulls, and a promising roadmap, BTFD Coin is on a fast track to success. The coin is currently priced at $0.000064 thanks to the BIG50 code, giving you more bang for your buck. So, why should you care about BTFD Coin? Let’s break it down: Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game: BTFD Coin’s P2E game offers rewards and engages the community in a fun way, making the token even more valuable for holders. Staking Rewards: Get rewarded handsomely with an APY of 90%, which means you can sit back, stake your tokens, and watch your portfolio grow. The Bulls Squad: This is no ordinary community. The Bulls Squad is a group of passionate investors committed to growing BTFD Coin and supporting each other’s investments. They’re your crypto family, rooting for success! A History-Inspired Move But here’s the kicker: the 50% discount on BTFD Coin’s presale is inspired by a historic event—the 1973 oil market crash. During this time, savvy investors realised that buying assets at their lowest point during times of panic was the smartest move. After the crash, the oil market rebounded, and those who made the purchase saw huge returns. The BIG50 code is BTFD Coin’s version of this strategy —an opportunity to buy in when prices are still low before the market takes off. It’s your chance to make a bold, strategic move. Let’s translate that into numbers: if you invest $4,000 at the presale price of $0.000064, you’ll get approximately 62,500,000 BTFD Coins. Hopefully, the coin will hit its predicted value of $0.0006 post-launch, and your investment could skyrocket to $37,500—that’s a 9x return! How to Buy BTFD Coin at the Discounted Price Noq Ready to grab your BTFD Coin while the price is still reduced? Here’s how (but act fast!): Head to the Presale Page . Connect Your Wallet: Click “Connect Wallet” and choose your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Apply the Discount Code: In the Bonus Code field, enter BIG50 and click “Apply”. This will unlock your 50% discount. Select Your Purchase: Choose the amount of $BTFD you’d like to buy and double-check the discounted price. Confirm Your Purchase: Hit “Buy Now”, approve the transaction in your wallet, and you’re in! Conclusion: Invest in BTFD Coin’s Presale at the 50% Discount Today Shiba Inu may have had its moment, but BTFD Coin is the new wave —and with its 50% discount, this is the perfect time to get involved. With a promising presale, a Play-to-Earn game, 90% staking rewards, and a passionate community behind it, BTFD Coin is ready to make a big splash in the crypto world. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by! Use the BIG50 code today, get your discounted coins, and become part of the Bulls Squad before the price takes off after January 5th.

Crypto strategist Ali Martinez tells his 103,200 followers on the social media platform X that Dogecoin may be following in the footsteps of its 2017 and 2021 market cycles when the memecoin ignited a meteoric ascent after witnessing a severe correction. “In 2017, when Dogecoin began a parabolic run, it surged 212%, retraced 40%, then rallied 5,000%. In 2021, it went up 476%, retraced 56%, then skyrocketed 12,000%. Now, in 2024, DOGE is up 440% and has retraced by 46%. If history repeats, another parabolic rally is on the way!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Looking at the trader’s chart, it seems that he predicts Dogecoin will soar above $1 if his parabolic rally materializes. Zooming in, Martinez says DOGE is flashing a bullish signal on the daily chart based on the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator. Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles. “The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Dogecoin DOGE daily chart, anticipating a price rebound!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is worth $0.32. Turning to Bitcoin ( BTC ), the trader says that the crypto king may be mirroring its early 2024 price action when it breached an immediate support level before triggering new rallies. “Throw it back! Bitcoin BTC.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that Bitcoin will briefly dip below $90,000 if it follows the early 2024 pattern. At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $94,133.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

Discover Why Qubetics Could Be the Next Big Investment Opportunity of the Decade,https://timestabloid.com/failed-to-join-stellars-groundbreaking-start-discover-why-qubetics/,"The cryptocurrency market is always evolving, and every few years, a project comes along that changes the game. Remember Stellar (XLM)? It launched as a bold new project aimed at revolutionising cross-border payments, and those who got in early have reaped the rewards. From empowering unbanked communities to creating efficient global payment systems, Stellar made its mark as a forward-thinking blockchain solution. But if you missed Stellar’s early rocket ride, don’t fret. Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping up as the best crypto presale to buy this week, combining cutting-edge technology with practical real-world applications. With its ongoing presale already raising over $7.8 million, Qubetics is positioning itself as the investment opportunity of the decade. Qubetics ($TICS): A Game-Changer for Everyday Crypto Transactions Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency—it’s a revolution in usability. At its core lies the multi-chain wallet, a tool designed to simplify crypto management for businesses, professionals, and everyday users alike. Unlike traditional wallets, Qubetics enables seamless transactions across multiple blockchains, making it an essential tool for anyone navigating the complex world of digital currencies. Imagine you’re a business owner running a global e-commerce store. You want to accept crypto payments but don’t want to deal with volatility or complicated conversions. Enter Qubetics. Its smart contract conversion mechanism instantly converts crypto payments into fiat currency at the point of sale, ensuring financial stability for your business. Now picture a freelancer working with international clients. Payments come in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptos, but managing these assets is often a hassle. With Qubetics, payments are converted into local currency instantly, streamlining financial management and eliminating unnecessary stress. Even for the average crypto investor, Qubetics is a game-changer. Its multi-chain compatibility allows users to manage diverse portfolios effortlessly, swapping tokens across blockchains with ease. Plus, integration with everyday tools like Apple Pay and Google Pay makes crypto transactions feel as simple as using a debit card. The Qubetics presale is in full swing, with over 376 million tokens sold and $7.8 million raised so far. Currently priced at $0.0377, $TICS tokens are a steal in their 14th presale stage. But don’t wait too long—the price is set to rise by 10% in Stage 15 this weekend. If you’re on the hunt for the best crypto presale to buy this week, Qubetics is your golden ticket. Stellar (XLM): A Blockchain Veteran with a Global Vision Stellar is a name that’s hard to ignore in the blockchain space. Launched with the goal of revolutionising cross-border payments, Stellar aimed to create a decentralised network that could handle international transactions faster and cheaper than traditional banking systems. Its mission to connect unbanked populations with the global financial system has earned it a loyal following and a solid reputation. Stellar’s real-world partnerships set it apart. Collaborations with financial institutions, NGOs, and governments have helped it build a strong use case for its technology. From facilitating low-cost remittances to enabling microtransactions, Stellar has proven its ability to deliver on its promises. The crypto’s price trajectory has been impressive as well, with analysts predicting continued growth as more industries adopt its technology. However, for new investors, Stellar may not offer the same explosive growth potential it did during its early days. Its established position in the market makes it a stable choice, but the biggest gains have already been realised by its earliest backers. For those who missed out on Stellar’s rise, Qubetics offers an exciting alternative, combining innovation, real-world applicability, and early-stage investment potential. How Qubetics Stands Out While both Qubetics and Stellar share a commitment to real-world impact, their approaches differ significantly. Stellar focuses on revolutionising international payments and connecting the unbanked, while Qubetics aims to make crypto accessible for everyone, regardless of their experience level or technical expertise. Qubetics’ multi-chain wallet is a standout feature, bridging the gap between crypto and everyday life. By integrating with familiar tools like Apple Pay and Google Pay, it ensures that using crypto is as easy as tapping your phone. Whether you’re managing a diverse investment portfolio or accepting payments as a business owner, Qubetics provides the tools you need to succeed. Stellar may have paved the way for global payment innovation, but Qubetics is taking things a step further by solving usability issues and catering to a broader audience. For those looking for the best crypto presale to buy this week , Qubetics offers a unique opportunity to invest in the future of blockchain technology. The cryptocurrency market is full of stories about missed opportunities, but it also offers plenty of second chances. Qubetics is shaping up to be one of the most exciting opportunities of the decade, with its innovative wallet, practical solutions, and massive early success. If you regret missing out on Stellar’s early days, now’s your chance to make up for it. With $7.8 million raised and over 376 million tokens sold, Qubetics is proving that it has what it takes to make waves in the crypto world. Don’t wait until the 15th stage kicks in with a 10% price hike—secure your $TICS tokens today and position yourself for future success.

Is it innovative features, promising price action, or a mix? As digital assets dominate the financial space, the spotlight shines brightly on three standout performers making waves. Stellar’s technical resilience has caught analysts’ attention, and Monero continues solidifying its position as a privacy coin leader. However, the real excitement builds around Qubetics ($TICS) and its game-changing wallet innovation alongside a red-hot presale. This article will discuss the latest developments and updates for Qubetics, Stellar, and Monero, the top coins to buy and hold now. Qubetics Wallet: The Future of Secure Digital Transactions Qubetics ($TICS) has revolutionised digital finance management with its advanced wallet , which now offers a virtual card feature. Imagine creating a secure virtual card directly within the wallet app—this is precisely what Qubetics enables its users to do. Whether it’s for online shopping or subscribing to digital services, this feature adds unparalleled convenience. Users gain enhanced control as these virtual cards can be instantly generated, monitored, and deactivated, ensuring the utmost security for primary payment methods. The virtual card isn’t just about functionality; it’s about empowering users. With seamless usability, it positions Qubetics Wallet as a must-have tool for digital finance enthusiasts. Recently, Qubetics also hosted an AMA session to engage with its growing community, addressing questions and showcasing the innovative roadmap ahead. It’s no surprise Qubetics is being recognised as one of the top coins to buy and hold now, with features that redefine user expectations in blockchain technology. Qubetics Partners with SWFT Blockchain for Next-Gen Wallet Innovation Qubetics has partnered with SWFT Blockchain to enhance its wallet’s capabilities in a groundbreaking collaboration. This partnership brings unmatched cross-chain functionality, allowing users to execute lightning-fast transactions across multiple blockchains. Whether it’s swapping assets or managing diverse portfolios, the wallet offers a seamless experience tailored to modern users.

The integration also ensures multi-asset compatibility, enabling users to manage various cryptocurrencies effortlessly. This partnership underscores Qubetics’ commitment to innovation, making it a leader in blockchain advancements and reinforcing its position among the top coins to buy and hold now. Stellar ($XLM): Resistance Levels and Bullish Patterns Stellar’s ($XLM) recent price movements have captured analysts’ interest. As of the latest update, the digital asset trades around $0.43 and consolidates within a bullish flag formation. Notably, a renowned analyst, Dark Defender, highlighted a critical resistance level at $0.6367. Once this level is breached, XLM could target the $0.9203 Fibonacci level, marking a significant third wave in its Elliott Wave pattern. The ultimate target for the fifth wave is $2.3961, showcasing Stellar’s potential for upward growth. With such promising technical indicators, Stellar is undoubtedly a contender among the top coins to buy and hold now, offering robust potential for both short-term and long-term gains. Monero ($XMR): Privacy at Its Core Monero ($XMR) remains a top choice for those prioritising privacy and security. Known for its focus on anonymous transactions, Monero continues to innovate to preserve financial privacy. The blockchain ensures transaction details, such as sender, receiver, and amount, remain private, a feature unmatched by most cryptocurrencies. This privacy-centric approach cements Monero’s status as one of the top coins to buy and hold now, particularly for investors who value discretion and security. Qubetics Presale: Unmissable Opportunities in Phase 14 If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to invest, here it is. Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 14, and the momentum is electrifying. Each phase brings a 10% price increase, culminating in a 20% hike in the final stage. Currently priced at $0.037 per $TICS token, the presale has already raised an impressive $7.8 million. The structured price increase fuels a sense of urgency among investors, making Qubetics a compelling opportunity. Early adopters stand to gain significantly as the presale progresses, aligning perfectly with its growing reputation as one of the top coins to buy and hold now . With its innovative wallet and forward-thinking approach, Qubetics isn’t just building a cryptocurrency; it’s creating a legacy. Conclusion: A Future Filled with Promise Stellar ($XLM), Monero ($XMR), and Qubetics ($TICS) each bring unique strengths to the table. Stellar’s technical patterns point towards significant price surges, and Monero continues to dominate the privacy niche. However, Qubetics steals the spotlight with its innovative wallet and an electrifying presale. For investors seeking the top coins to buy and hold now, Qubetics stands out as a cryptocurrency and a revolutionary ecosystem. With each passing presale phase, the opportunity to secure $TICS tokens becomes even more enticing. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this trailblazing journey.

This recovery follows a sharp 14.5% correction from its $108,275 all-time high on Dec. 17. Despite the recent volatility, Bitcoin derivatives maintained a neutral-to-bullish stance, supporting the potential for a rally above $105,000. Derivatives Signal Market Optimism Bitcoin futures monthly contracts are trading at a 12% premium over spot prices, signaling strong demand for leveraged long positions. Premiums between 5% and 10% are considered neutral, making the current level robust. Additionally, Bitcoin put (sell) options are at a 2% discount compared to call (buy) options. When significant corrections are expected, this indicator typically exceeds 6%, showing a preference for puts. Traditional Market Recovery Boosts Bitcoin Traditional financial markets also supported Bitcoin’s recent rise above $98,000. The S&P 500 index erased its monthly losses on Dec. 24, and the US 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.59%, up from 4.23% two weeks earlier. Higher Treasury yields often reflect inflation expectations, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more attractive during economic uncertainty. Economic Concerns and Stagnation Fears Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 index remains high at 64%, tying its performance to broader economic trends. The US Federal Reserve has reduced its 2025 interest rate-cut projections from four to two, lowering the immediate risks to corporate earnings and real estate markets. Margin and Derivatives Markets Stay Bullish On OKX, the Bitcoin long-to-short margin ratio is at 25x in favor of longs. Excessive confidence typically pushes this ratio above 40x, while bearish sentiment sees it drop below 5x. Despite record outflows from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF on Dec. 24, Bitcoin’s resilience at $92,458 reinforces optimism about reaching $105,000 and beyond.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 01:56:00

This article will delve into the latest updates for Qubetics, Bittensor, and Bitcoin, highlighting why these are among the top cryptos to buy for 2025. Qubetics Wallet: A Revolution in Digital Finance Management What if managing your digital finances became as effortless as generating a card for online purchases?

Qubetics recently hosted a highly engaging AMA session , addressing key questions and reinforcing its commitment to user-centric innovation. With these advancements, Qubetics is setting new benchmarks in digital finance. As one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025, Qubetics inspires confidence and curiosity among investors. Excitement Peaks: Explosive Rewards with Qubetics Presale Investors, take note—this is your moment. Qubetics is now in Presale Phase 14, offering TICS tokens at a current price of $0.037.

As one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025 , Qubetics is crafting a narrative of success, community involvement, and innovation. Don’t miss your opportunity to join the ranks of those already capitalising on this presale sensation. Bittensor (TAO): AI-Powered Innovation at Its Core Bittensor (TAO) is pioneering the integration of AI and blockchain with its decentralised machine learning network. Acting as a collective intelligence system, it incentivises participants to contribute computational resources in exchange for access to its shared knowledge pool. While trading 25% below its all-time high of $767.68, Bittensor’s long-term prospects remain promising. With recent listings on major exchanges like Binance and KuCoin, coupled with surging interest in AI-driven technologies, Bittensor is poised to make further strides. Despite potential short-term corrections, analysts remain optimistic about its ability to redefine decentralised AI development. Bitcoin: Altcoin Season on the Horizon? Bitcoin’s market dominance has long been a barometer for crypto trends, and recent insights suggest altcoins are gearing up for a significant moment. Following a hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve, Pantera Capital’s Cosmo Jiang noted that altcoin capital flows are beginning to gain traction. Bitcoin dominance dipped from 60% to 54%, indicating a shift towards broader crypto investment. This trend signals potential opportunities for altcoins to shine, particularly as investors seek to diversify. As the crypto market matures, Bitcoin’s role as a steadying force remains pivotal, even as attention turns towards emerging contenders.

Recent news about Immutable X and Bitcoin Cash has stirred the market, but the standout opportunity is Qubetics ($TICS), an ambitious project redefining blockchain interoperability. This article will delve into the developments of all three coins: Qubetics, Immutable X, and Bitcoin Cash. Qubetics: The Future of Blockchain Interoperability In today’s blockchain ecosystem, fragmentation is a major hurdle. Many networks operate in silos, making it difficult for data, assets, and functionality to flow seamlessly across different chains. This disconnect slows innovation and limits the potential of decentralised applications. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), an innovative project to unify diverse networks into a single, collaborative Web3 framework . By integrating cross-chain functionality, Qubetics paves the way for smooth asset transfers and efficient data sharing. It’s not just a blockchain; it’s a bridge for ecosystems, empowering developers, enterprises, and users alike. Imagine a world where decentralised technologies operate without barriers—Qubetics is making that a reality. Recently, Qubetics hosted an AMA session to engage with its community, answering pressing questions and building trust. With such interactive efforts, the project strengthens its community ties and underscores its commitment to transparency. It’s no wonder Qubetics is gaining recognition as one of the top altcoins to buy now. Immutable X: Advancing Scalability in NFTs Immutable X continues to push boundaries in the NFT space. As a Layer 2 scaling solution on Ethereum, it enhances transaction speeds and reduces gas fees while maintaining Ethereum’s security and decentralisation. Recent updates reveal further advancements in user accessibility and developer tools, making creating and trading NFTs easier than ever. This project is a driving force in the blockchain space, proving that scalability and user experience can go hand-in-hand. Immutable X’s progress positions it as a serious contender for anyone eyeing innovative solutions in the NFT ecosystem. Bitcoin Cash: A Reliable Choice for Fast Transactions Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is making headlines with its growing adoption among merchants worldwide. Known for its fast and cost-effective transactions, BCH is proving its utility as a practical cryptocurrency for everyday use. Recent reports highlight significant growth in payment integrations, making BCH a go-to option for businesses and consumers alike. While Bitcoin Cash may not generate the same hype as newer projects, its steady progress and practical applications keep it relevant in the cryptocurrency landscape. Exciting Opportunities as Qubetics ($TICS) Presale Hits Phase 14 The Qubetics presale is in full swing, an opportunity you don’t want to miss. Currently, in Phase 14, the presale offers weekly price hikes of 10%, culminating in a final stage increase of 20%. Currently, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.037, with over $7.8 million raised, 11,800+ holders, and 376 million tokens sold. What makes this presale particularly compelling? The potential for a 563.81% return on investment. With a post-presale price target of $0.25 per token, early adopters have a rare chance to capitalise on this impressive growth. These figures alone make Qubetics one of the top altcoins to buy now . The next phase is just around the corner, and the momentum is building. With each passing week, the value of $TICS rises, turning every delay into a missed opportunity. Are you ready to join a project with such promising prospects? Conclusion: Seize the Moment with Qubetics In a market teeming with options, Qubetics, Immutable X, and Bitcoin Cash each offer unique opportunities. Analysts are optimistic about all three, but Qubetics is the most compelling choice for investors seeking high ROI potential. Its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and the exciting presale dynamics cement its place among the top altcoins to buy now. The presale’s ticking clock adds urgency, reminding investors that timing is everything. Don’t let this chance slip by—Qubetics is not just another project but a blockchain technology revolution.

BTC might continue to rise if it clears the $100,00 resistance zone. Bitcoin started a decent upward move above the $96,000 zone. The price is trading above $96,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $98,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $96,000 support zone. Bitcoin Price Could Regain Momentum Bitcoin price started a decent upward move above the $95,000 resistance zone. BTC was able to climb above the $96,500 and $97,000 resistance levels. The pair cleared the $98,000 resistance level and traded close to the $100,000 resistance level. A high was formed at $99,400 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a test of the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $92,415 swing low to the $99,400 high.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 02:55:14

This $0.003 Token Will Soar Past $10 Faster,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-solana-sol-price-cross-1100-in-q1-2025-this-0-003-token-will-soar-past-10-faster/,"As Solana (SOL) continues to make waves with its high-speed blockchain capabilities, investors are speculating whether it can achieve the ambitious $1,100 price target by Q1 2025. While Solana’s strong ecosystem and past performance are encouraging, a new contender— Lightchain AI (LCAI) —is drawing significant attention. Priced at just $0.003, LCAI is gaining traction for its potential to surpass $10 in value even more rapidly. With cutting-edge technology and an accessible entry point, LCAI may outpace some of the most established altcoins in the upcoming bull market. Solana’s Journey to $1,100 Prospects and Challenges Solana has come up as a top blockchain place, known for its fast deals and growth, mostly thanks to its smart Proof of History (PoH) way of agreeing. This ease has pulled in builders looking at shared money (DeFi) apps and unique tokens (NFTs). Yet, Solana has faced problems that could affect its chance to hit $1,100. Most importantly, t͏he network has had a few shutdowns, bringing up worries about its trustworthiness and central control. These breaks have caused doubts about the network’s ability for big business use. Also, Solana sees more rivals from old platforms like Ethereum and new ones such as Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI joins smart thinking with blockchain tech, giving better tools that attract a wide mix of fields. Market state, with rules that are not clear and swings, add to the troubles around Solana’s price path. While some thinkers feel good, guessing that Solana might hit $1,100 in this strong rise, other warn to be careful saying of the told problems. Lightchain AI (LCAI) $0.003 Gem With Unmatched Growth Potential While Solana battles scalability and stiff competition, Lightchain AI is storming onto the scene, blending blockchain with artificial intelligence in a way that’s turning heads. This altcoin isn’t just another player—it’s a game-changer, tackling real-world problems with cutting-edge tech and paving the way for explosive growth. Here’s why Lightchain AI is the project everyone’s buzzing about. Revolutionary Consensus Mechanism (PoI) Goodbye, outdated mining systems! Lightchain’s Proof of Intelligence (PoI) flips the script. Instead of wasting resources on pointless computations, PoI incentivizes AI-powered tasks that actually matter—like solving real problems while being environmentally friendly. That’s right, it’s green tech with purpose! 2. Real Utility with AIVM Forget blockchains with vague promises. The AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) is the secret sauce fueling AI-focused decentralized apps (dApps). From predictive modeling to natural language processing (NLP), developers are already calling this the smartest platform for their big ideas. It’s not just promises—it’s real utility in action. 3. Numbers That Make You Double-Take A presale price of $0.003? You don’t see that every day for a project this innovative. Let’s break it down. $300 gets you 100,000 $LCAI tokens. If $LCAI hits $1 by 2025 (a very real possibility), that’s $100,000 in your pocket. Investors who got in early on Solana and Binance Coin saw similar mind-blowing gains—now it’s Lightchain AI’s turn. 4. A Rock-Solid Roadmap (With Real Progress) This is no “fly-by-night” operation. The Lightchain Roadmap is detailed, transparent, and already delivering. Phase 1 Prototype Development + Community Building Phase 2 Testnet Rollout + Performance Tweaks Phase 3 Mainnet Launch Testnets? Up and running. Validator nodes? Ready to roll. Partnerships? Already in the works. 2024 is going to be huge, and if Lightchain AI nails even half of its roadmap, 100x gains might sound conservative. Why AI-Blockchain Crossovers Are the Future The buzz around AI and blockchain isn’t just hype—it’s a full-blown revolution. Together, these two technologies are set to transform industries like fintech, healthcare, and beyond. What makes Lightchain AI special? Transparent governance through decentralization Boosted productivity in machine learning tasks Privacy-first frameworks for trustless data sharing This is Web3 innovation at its peak—solving today’s problems while building tomorrow’s solutions. AI alone is exciting, but when paired with blockchain, its potential is amplified. Ready to dive into the project that’s redefining the game? Lightchain AI isn’t just following trends—it’s creating them. Why Smart Investors Are Betting on Lightchain AI The key to massive crypto gains lies in early-stage investments, and Lightchain AI (LCAI) is ticking all the boxes. With a low entry point of just $0.003, LCAI is accessible to investors of all sizes. Unlike many speculative tokens, it offers real-world utility through its AI integration, addressing practical needs. Momentum is building as both institutional and retail investors take notice, with its presale success hinting at explosive future growth. What truly sets Lightchain AI apart is its innovative technology, blending AI and blockchain in a way that outshines the competition. As it prepares for its token launch, LCAI is a project to watch for potential 100x gains. Whether Solana hits $1,100 by Q1 2025 or not, Lightchain AI is positioned to soar past $10 in record time. Why Lightchain AI Is the Future of AI and Blockchain It’s clear that Lightchain AI is a project with immense potential, offering investors a unique opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for AI and blockchain integration. With its efficient consensus mechanism, real utility, low entry point, and solid roadmap, the project is well-positioned to capture a share of the booming DeFi market. Furthermore, Lightchain AI brings much-needed innovation to the blockchain industry by tackling real-world problems with cutting-edge technology. As other projects struggle with scalability and competition, Lightchain AI stands out as an innovative solution that has already gained traction among developers and investors alike. If you’re looking for a project that not only promises growth but also offers tangible utility and a strong development roadmap, look no further than Lightchain AI. It’s not just a gem—it’s the future of AI and blockchain.

Imagine being one of the early adopters who turned small investments into massive wealth. For many, that opportunity came and went, leaving latecomers watching from the sidelines, wondering if another chance like WIF would ever come around. Well, here’s the good news: history is repeating itself, but this time with BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Taking the meme coin craze to unprecedented heights, BTFD Coin combines innovation with community-driven momentum. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, lucrative 90% APY staking rewards, and a referral programme that rewards loyal supporters, BTFD is rewriting the rulebook on what a meme coin can achieve. And right now, thanks to a festive 50% presale price rollback—offering tokens at just $0.000064—there’s never been a better time to seize the dip. Use the code BIG50 before January 5, 2025, and claim your spot in what could be the year’s biggest crypto opportunity. BTFD Coin: Your Next Big Opportunity For those who felt left out of the WIF surge, BTFD Coin is here to rewrite your crypto story. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, BTFD embraces the iconic “Buy The Dip” philosophy, offering investors the chance to seize market lows and ride the highs. Currently, in its 12th presale stage, BTFD Coin is priced at just $0.000064, following a festive 50% price rollback. The presale has already raised over $4.5 million, with more than 59 billion tokens sold to 6,600+ bullish holders. But what makes BTFD stand out? Beyond its catchy name and presale buzz, this token offers real utility: Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game : The beta version of BTFD’s P2E game went live during Stage 10 of the presale, creating excitement among gamers and investors alike. Although rewards aren’t available during the beta, the full launch promises a unique way to earn while playing. 90% APY Staking Rewards : Staking went live on December 2, 2024, offering investors a generous 90% annual percentage yield. This feature alone makes BTFD a strong contender for both short-term gains and long-term growth. Referral Programme : The BTFD Rewards Programme incentivises community growth by offering 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens to top referrers. Massive ROI Potential : Starting at $0.000004 per coin, BTFD has already delivered an 837.5% ROI in its presale stages. Analysts predict a listing price of $0.0006, representing significant upside potential for early investors. Let’s break down what a $2,000 investment at the current presale price of $0.000064 could mean for you. You’d acquire approximately 31.25 million BTFD tokens . When the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, your initial investment could grow to $18,750—a staggering 837.5% return!

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 04:23:19

The goal behind this decision is to mitigate risks associated with the company’s reliance on Canadian dollar-denominated assets, which marks a pivotal move toward diversifying its reserves. Matador Embraces Bitcoin Citing concerns over Canada’s dependence on oil exports and rising national debt, Matador highlighted the potential devaluation and loss of purchasing power of the Canadian dollar as key motivators. As part of its strategy, the company will make an initial $4.5 million allocation to Bitcoin in December 2024. It will also consider further acquisitions through measured buying programs. The firm also plans to transition the majority of its cash reserves from CAD to USD. Matador expressed its confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value, particularly as institutional interest in the cryptocurrency continues to rise across the world. The move also aligns with a growing trend among corporations seeking to hedge against currency debasement and explore alternatives to traditional financial assets like bonds. The latest move is also expected to drive Matador’s digital gold platform, which will enable users to trade digital gold backed by reserves at the Royal Canadian Mint. The Board picked Bitcoin over alternatives due to its stability, security, and growing use by institutions, making it the strongest foundation for the project, the company said in a statement . Following the development, Sunny Ray, President of Matador, commented, “Matador’s Board and management believe in using Bitcoin to future-proof our treasury. This step also supports our mission to explore using Bitcoin as a platform for our gold-based products.” Bitcoin Adoption Boom Firms like MicroStrategy , Metaplanet , and more have ramped up their Bitcoin holdings, while others have newly joined the growing trend. New research revealed that Bitcoin’s institutional adoption has grown significantly. As reported, BTC holdings rose to 31% of total supply. MicroStrategy leads with 440,000 BTC, worth over $46 billion. Meanwhile, ETFs have attracted large inflows, while the US, China, and El Salvador maintain substantial reserves. Combined, governments hold 2.45% of Bitcoin’s circulation, which is almost $49.36 billion. Additionally, several US states, including Ohio , Pennsylvania, and Texas, are exploring Bitcoin reserves as a strategy to safeguard public funds and adapt to modern financial innovations.

Leading the pack are $PENGU and $FARTCOIN. Investors and enthusiasts are now speculating on whether new meme coin presales like Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) and Flockerz ($FLOCK) could follow suit. Pudgy Penguins and Fartcoin Lead Christmas Meme Coin Rally The crypto market saw an explosive rally this Christmas Eve, with meme coins stealing the spotlight. While Bitcoin reclaimed $98,000, bringing renewed enthusiasm across the sector, it was Pengu and Fartcoin that captivated investors by reaching ranks #5 and #10 in the meme coin market cap rankings. Pudgy Penguins Reaches the Meme Coin Top 5 Pengu, the official token of the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection, managed to reach a market cap of over $2.2 billion and claim the fifth spot in the meme coin market cap rankings. Spiking from $0.028 on December 24 to $0.038 today, the token has experienced a substantial 35% increase in just one day. While the momentum has subsided somewhat, the meme coin managed to keep most of the gains it made. However, while in consolidation at the moment, $PENGU’s push through the descending triangle chart pattern fueled additional speculation of further price gains. The token’s performance follows its controversial launch on December 17, which initially caused Pudgy Penguins NFT prices to plummet due to a large number of airdrop claims leading to additional sell pressure. Despite early backlash from NFT holders, Pengu’s accessibility has attracted a broader investor base. Analysts now predict the token could reach $0.05 before facing significant resistance. Fartcoin’s Meteoric Rise Not to be outdone, Fartcoin has become the 10th-largest meme coin after a record-breaking post-launch rally. Recording a jaw-dropping daily price increase of 1,712.76%, Fartcoin’s surge has even garnered attention from traditional finance figures. Charlie Billelo, a prominent TradFi financial analyst, highlighted Fartcoin’s rise on Twitter, adding credibility to the coin’s momentum: “With a market cap of $1.3 billion, Fartcoin is now worth more than 786 companies in the Russel 3,000 Index.” You’ll see tradfi accounts tweet about Bitcoin from time to time, rarely ever any alts But now we see tradfi accounts blasting out 3 tweets in a row about fartcoin No other coin has had this effect pic.twitter.com/vDDTsqkJOZ — HornHairs (@CryptoHornHairs) December 19, 2024 With the meme coin market regaining investor confidence, both Pengu and Fartcoin have become symbols of the sector’s resilience. Wall Street Pepe and Flockerz Next Meme Coins to Explode? As established meme coins like Pengu and Fartcoin dominate the market, attention is shifting toward up-and-coming projects, with investors hoping to get in as early as possible and catch the best token prices. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) and Flockerz ($FLOCK) have generated significant buzz in recent days, with presales showing promising results. Wall Street Pepe combines the appeal of the Pepe meme with a clever nod to Wall Street traders, creating a narrative of beating crypto trading whales at their game that has resonated with investors. The project has been raising close to $2 million daily, raising over $35 million to date in its presale, demonstrating its potential to capture the next wave of meme coin mania. The WEPE presale’s success lies in its community-focused approach, emphasizing the utility it will provide its investors – in the form of alpha calls, trading groups and competitions, short and long calls, etc. With its launch on the horizon, analysts predict that $WEPE could rival top-tier meme coins once it hits the open market. Flockerz , a bird-themed meme coin, has also garnered substantial attention, raising close to $8 million during its presale. Built around the FlockTopia DAO, the project introduces a Vote-to-Earn protocol, rewarding participants for engaging with the community. This approach to community governance addresses a common issue in DAOs: declining member engagement over time. FLOCK tokens can currently be purchased at a discounted price of $0.00653, with staking options offering an impressive APY of up to 353%. As the presale concludes in January, investors have limited time to secure tokens before Flockerz’s exchange debut.",Press Release,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-26 04:34:14

ADA is consolidating and facing hurdles near the $0.920 and $0.950 levels. ADA price started a downward move below the $1.00 support zone. The price is trading below $0.950 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.92 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.950 resistance zone. Cardano Price Starts Fresh Decline After struggling to clear the $1.00 resistance zone, Cardano started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA declined below the $0.9650 and $0.950 support levels. The recent high was formed at $0.9495 before the price dipped. There was a move below the $0.920 support level. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.8628 swing low to the $0.9495 high. Cardano price is now trading below $0.925 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.920 zone. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.92 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $0.9350. The next key resistance might be $0.950. If there is a close above the $0.950 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.00 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.050 in the near term. More Losses in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.920 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.8950 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.8628 swing low to the $0.9495 high. The next major support is near the $0.865 level. A downside break below the $0.8650 level could open the doors for a test of $0.820. The next major support is near the $0.8050 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.8950 and $0.8650.

However, a rising star has entered the spotlight: Yeti Ouro (YETIO). This innovative token captures the imagination and can potentially deliver exponential gains. Analysts speculate that a $1,000 investment in Yeti Ouro could transform into $100,000 by 2025. With a 20% holiday bonus on YETIO purchases from December 24th to 26th, along with a referral campaign and meme contest, this project creates significant excitement. Pepe Coin Price Analysis: A Resilient Meme Token Inspired by the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, Pepe Coin has become a favorite among crypto traders. After recent market turbulence, Pepe Coin price has bounced back, proving its resilience. However, its primary appeal lies in its meme-based community, with little utility to back long-term growth. 1-month Pepe price chart- source: CoinMarketCap The absence of utility leaves space for tokens like Yeti Ouro to shine. YETIO is more than another meme coin; it embodies the fun and exuberance of meme culture while providing real value through harnessing it in the Yeti Go ecosystem, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game. While Pepe Coin may find short-term hype, Yeti Ouro provides a solid argument for long-term investment. New Market Leader: Yeti Ouro Yeti Ouro is on track to be the next big thing in cryptocurrency! Yeti Ouro combines the excitement of meme coins with real-world use cases built on the Ethereum blockchain. Its ecosystem will centre on Yeti Go, an Unreal Engine-based racing game where players can obtain rewards through YETIO tokens. Yeti Ouro stands out for its approach to value creation amongst its community. Tokenomics: The token has a capped supply of 1 billion, ensuring it will always retain an element of scarcity while staking and token burns, promising long-term price increases. That’s why from December 24th to December 26th, Yeti Ouro will give a 20% bonus for all acquired tokens, the best time for investors to enter the project. The referral campaign gives users the opportunity to receive additional rewards for inviting others to participate in the presale, creating a culture of membership and joint success. Yeti Ouro also hosted other community initiatives, cementing its status as a project to watch. The current Meme Contest inspires creativity and empowers participants to receive YETIO tokens. The contest has attracted considerable attention on social media, with an offer of a prize pool worth $3,500. The 10% referral program also allows community members to cash in. By spreading their customized referral links, users can attract additional people into the ecosystem and increase their wallet balance. The Path To $100,000 Yeti Ouro stands to be a market leader through its mix of scarcity, utility, and community involvement. Analysts expect the token’s ‘meme’ status to repeat the success of early meme coins Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With finite supply and an innovative use case in the P2E gaming space, Yeti Ouro could be the ticket to huge returns for early investors. With its well-structured tokenomics and growth potential, a $1,000 investment today could result in significant gains for investors who buy into Yeti Ouro. Investors looking to get in on the ground floor of this project will find even more value in the 20% bonus over the holiday period. Join the Yeti Ouro Revolution As Pepe Coin regains strength, Yeti Ouro will emerge as the next big opportunity in cryptocurrency. With its innovative ecosystem, community-focused initiatives, and holiday bonuses, Yeti Ouro is proving to be more than just a meme coin—it’s a utility-driven token with real potential.

Experts predict that the price of the Bonk coin may rise to $0.0000600. Also, they say the value of Lunex Network (LNEX) and Stellar (XLM) could cross $1 in the coming months. In the meantime, investors are taking advantage of the downtrend to stock their portfolios. Analyst Forecasts Uptrend For Bonk (BONK) Despite Price Drop The Bonk token has plunged to former lows after a recent correction. CoinMarketCap data showed its price soared to a peak of $0.000058 before it began to lose momentum. Currently, the value of Bonk (BONK) has dropped by 8.1% on the biweekly chart. Still, analysts believe the correction is just a phase. They expect another uptrend to begin in the coming days. One of such analysts is LEVERAGED_LABS. They forecast the Bonk price might rally to two price targets in the coming weeks. The first target is $0.00006000. If the bullish momentum lingers, LEVERAGED_LABS says the Bonk coin price could rise to $0.00009188. Presently, the sentiment surrounding the memecoin is bullish. Its Hull Moving Average (9) and VWMA (10) are flashing buy signals which means bulls are in control. So, we might see some upward movement in the next few days. Stellar (XLM) Predicted To Cross $1 The Stellar coin produced an overwhelming performance last month. Holders of the token made more than 400% returns as the altcoin price increased from $0.1 to $0.6. The cryptocurrency is, however, trading in the red zone, according to CoinMarketCap . The 14D chart shows a decline of 15.3% on its price. Nevertheless, analysts are looking forward to a price surge. One of them is Arye. They believe the Stellar token is a better option than XRP. They forecast its price could increase to $0.9 in the coming months. Another analyst called PB told his followers there was a good buying opportunity at $0.3900-$0.4600. He predicts the Stellar price might rise to $2 in the coming months. Moving on to the technical indicators , the probability of this prediction is high. Stella’s relative strength index is above average, which means bulls are in charge. The Average Directional Index (14) is also in the by territory. Lunex Network (LNEX) Prices Soar to New Level Lunex Network (LNEX) is gaining attention in the DeFi market as it progresses through an appealing presale stage, where each token costs $0.0048. Lunex Network has a customizable cross-chain trading platform where one can trade over 50,000 assets across different blockchains. Such cross-chain compatibility makes Lunex good for traders who value convenience. Therefore, Lunex may be among the top DeFi projects in the market, which will be explained in this article. Lunex Network also has engaging financial benefits for anyone who possesses the $LNEX tokens. Staking LNEX can earn holders up to 18% APY, making Lunex Network one of the best forms of passive income in the DeFi space. In addition, Lunex has a unique portfolio tracker that is distinct from the rest; you can track your investments in cryptocurrencies, stocks, and ETFs.

According to a report by Coinpost , Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru issued an official statement on 20th December in response to Senator (Rassho) Hamada Satoshi’s question. The government admitted it doesn’t have detailed information on how other nations will adopt Bitcoin into national reserves as these discussions are still in their early stages. Earlier this month, on December 11th, Senator Hamada proposed that Japan consider joining other countries in turning part of its foreign exchange reserves into Bitcoin. The government, however, submitted its reply, pointing out that crypto-assets do not conform to the current legal definition of foreign exchange. Moreover, Japan’s reserves aim to stabilize foreign currency-denominated assets and bond markets. Japan remains cautious about keeping Bitcoin in the national reserve Japan’s top priorities are safety and liquidity, which means its stance on Bitcoin’s price swings does not match that. At a time when an increasing consensus is gaining steam within and outside of Japan over whether to put crypto assets into national reserves, Ishiba’s response is cautious. Meanwhile, in the United States, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently said that the Fed cannot hold Bitcoin, but President-elect Trump and some Republican lawmakers want a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

With massive potential, the countries globally are planning to tap this trillion-dollar industry to support their economy. Japan’s Cautious Response While the market is bullish in the long term, the Japanese government has officially responded to the idea of holding Bitcoin as part of its national reserves , taking a cautious approach. This came after Senator Hamada Satoshi suggested that Japan should consider following in the footsteps of countries like the U.S. and others, which are reportedly exploring the idea of strategic Bitcoin reserves. Hamada believes that incorporating Bitcoin could strengthen Japan’s economy and act as a safeguard against potential financial risks. The government clarified that it currently has no detailed understanding of similar developments in other countries and pointed out that discussions about Bitcoin reserves are still in their early stages. They explained that the legal framework governing Japan’s foreign exchange reserves prioritizes safety and stability, which are not characteristics typically associated with volatile assets like Bitcoin. In simple terms, the government doesn’t see Bitcoin fitting into its current system, which is focused on maintaining steady foreign currency reserves. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Russia Turns to Bitcoin to Fight Sanctions , Global Interest in Bitcoin Reserves This cautious approach comes as other regions are also debating the role of Bitcoin in national financial strategies.

However, on a global scale political leaders, including President-elect Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers, are pushing for the adoption of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. In Europe, MEP Sara Knafo urged the EU to adopt Bitcoin reserves , opposing a digital euro. She highlighted Bitcoin’s decentralization as a defense against authoritarian overreach. NON à l’euro numérique OUI à une réserve nationale stratégique de BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/o886lk9uV8 — Sarah Knafo (@knafo_sarah) December 16, 2024 While Japan is restricting innovation other nations are planning to add Bitcoin as a strategic reserve to support innovation. It will be interesting to see if Japan joins the trend or not. With Trump’s aggressive planning to become the top leader in Bitcoin , it will be a challenge for other countries to enter the game later. On the flip side, economists also see the downside of Bitcoin Reserve calling it a gamble, though Bitcoin is on a rising trend historically it can drop to its lowest as well creating a liquidation and overall economic crash hence a cautious approach is required while evaluating such high-risk assets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

SBI VC Trade said that the exchange’s customers will have their accounts ready by March 2025 following the transfer of custody assets. Also, the crypto trading platform expands spot crypto trading offerings for its customers. Ripple Partner SBI to Help DMM Bitcoin Users In a major relief to the users of hacked crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin, Ripple’s partner SBI announced a fresh deal with the company. The announcement notes that by March 8, 2025, SBI VC Trade will transfer the customer accounts and custody assets of DMM Bitcoin users to its own platform. Thus, users don’t need to open a separate account with SBI. Following the $320 million breach of DMM’s crypto wallets, the exchange has been unsuccessful in recovering customer’s funds. Earlier this month, the exchange announced that it would liquidate and transfer the customers over to SBI. Now, SBI VC Trade is willing to offer a helping hand to DMM Bitcoin customers. As a result, the Ripple partner will introduce 14 crypto products that are currently handled by DMM but not by SBI. However, SBI cleared that crypto-to-crypto trading pairs, such as ETH/BTC, are not part of their planner offerings. Additionally, SBI VC Trade clarified that leveraged trading would not be part of the transfer, and unsettled leveraged trading positions would remain ineligible for migration. There are no immediate plans to introduce leveraged trading pairs available on DMM Bitcoin at this time. North Korea Behind the Hack, Says FBI Crypto exchange DMM reported a major hack earlier this year in May, in a security breach of servers, wherein hackers stole 4,500 Bitcoins worth $320 million back then. DMM assured its customers that it would fully compensate for the losses and restore their accounts. As a result, Ripple partner SBI is now working with DMM on this matter. During the investigation in the following months, America’s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed that North Korean hackers linked to the crime group TraderTraitor were behind this hack. FBI investigation shows that a North Korean threat actor posed as a recruiter on LinkedIn while targeting an employee of DMM Bitcoin. This employee was responsible for maintaining the company’s wallet management system. As part of the pre-employment test, the attacker sent a malicious link which the employee unknowingly uploaded to their GitHub page. The threat actor then exploited this vulnerability later, reported the FBI. In a recent development, the US Treasury Department dismantled a North Korean cryptocurrency laundering scheme, by sanctioning a UAE-based exchange, used to launder millions of dollars. North Korea’s Lazarus Group is popular for conducting all the crypto-hacking activities with top crypto exchanges like Upbit also falling victim to it.

Modern Portfolio Theory shows that the most efficient portfolio is one that includes everything that possibly can be invested in, including such alternative assets as collectibles. Many adherents of Modern Portfolio Theory do not include alternative assets such as collectibles in their portfolios because high transaction and other costs and risks associated with them. Bitcoin does not have the high transaction and other costs and risks associated with many other alternative assets, which is why mainstream investors are including it pursuant to MPT. As the price of any asset such as Bitcoin rises, adherents to Modern Portfolio Theory should buy more to maintain its proportion in the Market Portfolio. Those who have profited from Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) surge to over $100,000, owe their good fortune, more than any other factor, to Harry Markowitz whose 1952 paper Portfolio Selection for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1990, led to what is now referred to as Modern Portfolio Theory. As taught in finance courses, Modern Portfolio Theory says that the most efficient portfolio is the Market Portfolio, one that includes all assets. Students are sometimes surprised when told that everything that one can possibly invest in, including baseball cards and beanie babies should be included in the most efficient portfolio. This has created a situation where professional portfolio managers who might not include baseball cards and beanie babies in their portfolios might now include Bitcoin. Anyone who has taken a graduate finance course and many others are familiar with the work of Markowitz which led to Modern Portfolio Theory. This led to the Capital Asset Pricing Model and Jensen's alpha which is the Alpha in ""Seeking Alpha."" In my Seeking Alpha article 30% Yielding MORL, MORT And The mREITS: A Real World Application And Test Of Modern Portfolio Theory I gave a concise explanation of how and why Modern Portfolio Theory leads to the conclusion that the most efficient portfolio is one that includes all assets. I have reproduced it below. Those who are familiar with this topic may want to skip down to Why Bitcoin is the Perfect Asset to Benefit from Modern Portfolio Theory . The basis for the theory is that investors evaluate all assets in terms of expected return and risk. Risk can be quantified by standard deviation. Any asset is more efficient than another asset if it has a higher expected return than the other asset but no more risk or has the same expected return but less risk. Markowitz CAL frontier (Wikipedia) Markowitz frontier.jpg If all possible assets and portfolios of assets are plotted on a graph with expected return on the vertical axis and risk on the horizontal assets as shown above, there will be some assets and portfolios of assets that are more efficient than others. The most efficient assets and portfolios of assets, those which have the highest expected return for any given level of risk (standard deviation) form the Efficient Frontier. This, as shown above, is the line connecting those assets and portfolios of assets that are more efficient than those below then in terms of risk and return. Portfolios of assets will generally be more efficient than individual assets. Compare investing all of your money in one security that had an expected return of 10% with some level of risk, to a portfolio comprised of 20 securities each with an expected return of 10% with same level of risk as the single security. The portfolio would provide the exact same expected return of 10% but with less risk than the individual security. Thus, the portfolio is more efficient than any of the individual assets in the portfolio. This principle of diversification has led to the boom in index funds and ETFs. Markowitz demonstrated that the most efficient portfolio will be the Market Portfolio, which consists of all assets that anyone could invest in. That would include not just all domestic and international stocks and bonds but all other assets as well including art and collectibles such as baseball cards. In a model where a risk free interest rate exists at which all investors can borrow and lend, all investors should own the Market Portfolio, as the line labeled ""Best possible CAL"" on the graph indicates. The best possible capital asset allocation for any investor, regardless of risk preferences, lies along a capital asset line that connects the risk free rate with the Efficient Frontier. The risk or standard deviation of an investment at the risk free rate is zero. A line originating at the point of the risk free interest rate on the Expected return vertical axis and zero on the Standard Deviation axis can be drawn to tangency point on the Efficient Frontier. Any investor should invest at some point on that Best possible CAL. An extremely risk averse investor should invest only in the risk free asset. Someone slightly less risk averse should have most of their assets in the risk free asset with the remainder in the market portfolio. A risk seeking investor could have 200% of their assets in the Market portfolio by buying on margin by borrowing at the risk free rate. The important implication is that any point on the best possible CAL is more efficient than any individual asset or portfolio below that point, since it has a higher return with the same risk. Modern Portfolio Theory has had its ups and downs in both the financial and academic communities. Critics of the theory and model point to the difficulty in determining or creating a ""market portfolio"" and the assumption that investors can borrow and lend at a risk free rate. Many use the S&P 500 ( SPX ) as a proxy for the market portfolio and the T-bill rate as the risk free rate. There still remain numerous issues with the model. One could argue that the Wilshire 5000 is a better proxy than the S&P 500. Why Bitcoin is the Perfect Asset to Benefit from Modern Portfolio Theory. Some market participants who may be devoted adherents to Modern Portfolio Theory, probably do not include baseball cards, beanie babies and similar alternative assets in either their own portfolios or those they manage. Those adherents could cite various reasons for why certain risk and cost factors associated with alternative assets are sufficient to make one forgo the benefits of the Market Portfolio, which should include those alternative assets according to Modern Portfolio Theory. The risks associated with those alternative assets include what might be called fashion risk and the associated dual-use risk. Residential real estate and collectibles have dual uses, both as investments and that they can generate utility for their owners, separate from any returns they may generate as investments. Certainly, there are some who invest in art and other collectibles purely for investment purposes, and keep their collections locked in warehouses. However, those only interested in capital gains from collectibles, may have to bid against buyers who love the objects in question and have no compunction about paying too much. More importantly what might be called fashion risk can occur if the objects in question fall out of favor with collectors. Some collectibles now have various metrics that can lend themselves to evaluation that comes closer to that of securities such as stocks and bonds, which have metrics such as earnings, yields and ratings, However, even those collectibles that have metrics that can lend themselves to evaluation have fashion risk. Coins are an example of collectibles that now have various metrics that can lend themselves to evaluation that comes closer to that of securities but have fashion risk. Rarity and condition are metrics that can be used to evaluate coins. The mintage number of any American coin is known and there are a number of professional rating agencies that can assign a number from 1 to 70 for any coin, where 70 is the highest grade indicating a pristine flawless coin. Any coin graded 60 or above is in the uncirculated category. However, just knowing the mintage and condition of a coin does not necessarily mean that you know its relative value. For example, there were only 3,700 gold US one dollar coins minted in 1865 and 52,000 Standing Liberty quarters minted in 1916. However, in any given condition, a1916 Standing Liberty quarter is worth considerably more than an 1865 gold dollar. In terms of investment outcomes, in 1916, an 1865 gold dollar was already a collector item and could have been purchased in uncirculated condition for about $10, according to Gemini 1.5. For $10, in 1916 someone could have acquired 40 uncirculated Standing Liberty quarters, each of which is now worth about $70,000 in grade 67 according to pgcs-coinfacts . The same service shows an 1865 gold dollar in grade 67 at $42,500 . Diamonds are dual use and still in many investment portfolios. However, lab-grown diamonds, which cannot be differentiated from natural diamonds, without extremely sophisticated equipment, if at all, now are taking an estimated 50% of the bridal diamond market . A similar situation occurred when the development of cultured pearls caused a massive decline in the value of natural pearls. Alternative investments such as oil and metals, which can have transactions costs as low as securities, have considerable custodian costs, including insurance. Crude oil for spot delivery actually went negative during the pandemic as there was no capacity to store it. Many collectibles have enormous transaction costs. For example, in the Sotheby’s auction sale NY7617 NYC June 4, 2001, I sold a small bench that I had been using as a seat to take off muddy shoes in my summer home, when I sold the home. I had bought It from the artist for $1,200 in 1987. It had faded from being exposed to the sun through a skylight and someone had left a cold can of soda on it, which left a noticeable ring. Sotheby's included it in the June 4, 2001 catalog and gave it an estimate of $4,000-6,000. It sold for $12,000. However, I received only $7,200, even though I had absolutely minimized the costs involved, by taking it to Sotheby's in my own car. Later that year I saw an identical bench from that artist in a store in Santa Fe NM, in much better condition offered at $4,000. Bitcoin has none of the transaction or custodial costs associated with other alternative assets. It really cannot now be considered a dual use asset like collectibles and residential real estate. At one point it was thought that it would have some use for transactions, especially those involving illicit activities, that does not seem to be materializing. In my 2018 articles The Cryptocurrency Craze May Be Not So Crazy and Cryptos Revisited I pointed out that in a blockchain, all transactions are recorded by all participants of the blockchain, this could lead to digital cryptocurrency eventually replacing money as we know it today. But before this could occur, I also suggested that government could take control of the cryptocurrency universe. The government would then know the exact real identity of all blockchain wallet owners, giving government knowledge of all transactions. Possibly, the individuals in a group known as DarkSide which extorted a ransomware payment from Colonial Pipeline in May 2021 did not read my articles, since on June 7, 2021, a press release from the Department of Justice included: WASHINGTON - The Department of Justice today announced that it has seized 63.7 bitcoins currently valued at approximately $2.3 million. These funds allegedly represent the proceeds of a May 8, ransom payment to individuals in a group known as DarkSide, which had targeted Colonial Pipeline, resulting in critical infrastructure being taken out of operation. The seizure warrant was authorized earlier today by the Honorable Laurel Beeler, U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Northern District of California. “Following the money remains one of the most basic, yet powerful tools we have,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco for the U.S. Department of Justice. Where Does That Leave Bitcoin? While in the future, Bitcoin will probably not be used in transactions any more than gold is today, that doesn't mean that, like gold, it will not inexorably be included increasingly in institutional and professionally managed portfolios. Those adhering to Modern Portfolio Theory, which increasing seem to be including the vast majority of portfolio managers who have not been able to consistently beat the S&P 500, do not have any of the reasons that limit their investments in collectibles, to preclude their including some of the 21 million Bitcoin in their market portfolios. That does not mean that Bitcoin will not continue to be very volatile and subject to event risk. However, just as Madoff on Enron did not permanently impair the stock market, various scandals and exchange collapses such as FTX will not permanently impair the Bitcoin market. One feature of the Modern Portfolio Theory conclusion that the total market portfolio will be the most efficient portfolio for all investors regardless of their risk aversion or risk seeking, is that since the weighting of an individual asset or asset class in the market portfolio, is that asset’s proportion of the total market value of all assets. Thus, as an asset class increases in price, adherence to Modern Portfolio Theory requires that more of it be purchased. In the short term there may be some disappointment when it becomes obvious that the USA has no business having a sovereign wealth fund and especially that the American government should not buy Bitcoin, anymore that the US Government should buy dollars for investment purposes. However, it is possible that countries for whom having sovereign wealth funds makes sense, they might increasingly be buying Bitcoin, since those running those funds probably studied Modern Portfolio Theory in whatever college or university they attended.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-26 05:35:39

Vulnerabilities on the Solana blockchain This is not the first time that Solana blockchain has been used to execute a scam. Solana’s infrastructure makes users prone to specific vulnerabilities. A recent case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice shone a light on this issue, with the Justice Department charging two California men, Gabriel Hay and Gavin Mayo, with running NFT rug pulls on Ethereum and Solana that cost buyers over $22 million. Such rug pulls included touting fake NFT projects like Vault of Gems and Faceless and fleeing with investors’ money. The case is the largest NFT fraud the DOJ has prosecuted. Further, Drake , the Canadian singer, also had his account compromised to promote Solana-based meme coin Anita.

While Solana’s architecture may have been designed for efficiency, it introduces a number of risks that render it more susceptible to scams compared to other networks. The token account structure Solana uses lets attackers reassign ownership of assets using specific commands, leaving funds virtually unrecoverable. You might also like: Solana hits $250, Dogecoin nears $0.5, Lightchain AI soars 30,000% to $5 Also, Solana’s one-step transaction approval—versus Ethereum’s multiphase allowance of contract functions—can result in instant and irreversible losses once a malicious transaction is authorized. The platform’s capacity to group multiple sub-transactions into one approval also compounds the risk of unseen thefts. Scammers also take advantage of Solana’s Durable Nonce capability to postpone the implementation of fraudulent operations, evading alerts and surprising victims. This, along with users’ ignorance of the operational risks of Solana, results in it being a prime target for scams.

According to a recent Bloomberg report , the world’s largest cryptocurrency was up 0.32% to $98,747 at 11:30 in Singapore, with an initial intraday peak of $99,876.70. Like Dogecoin, Ether and other popular coins such as Solana saw an increase of 0.2 percent after a dive on Wednesday. Anticipation of MicroStrategy’s next round of Bitcoin purchases is increasing the price The company’s move may further fuel crypto sentiment if it indicates the firm’s continuing push to accumulate Bitcoin. Trading director Sean McNulty at Arbelos Markets said this newfound optimism is largely a product of the anticipation of the company’s next round of Bitcoin purchases. “The market is being forward-looking about MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buys, and that’s been the single biggest reason for the market to go up. Watching MicroStrategy news is becoming a big part of my day,” he said. Source: Bloomberg December 23rd filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealed that MicroStrategy seeks to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A common stock and preferred stock. Once the company gets approval, it will be granted the freedom to issue more shares, allowing it to raise funds and use them to strengthen its already very large Bitcoin holdings.

Meanwhile, its memecoin rival, Shiba Inu, is capturing attention as analysts predict significant growth for the asset in 2025. Adding to the excitement is 1Fuel, a rising star in the DeFi space, which is set to drive altcoin growth with its anticipated public listing in Q2 2025. With Shiba Inu gaining traction among whales and 1Fuel’s innovative features increasing investor confidence, the altcoin market is gearing up for a dynamic year ahead. Dogecoin Slows Down After Huge Gains Dogecoin hit its all-time high of $0.4672 in early December but has since experienced a steady decline, now resting at $0.336. As the recent crypto market selloff eases, Dogecoin has faced the steepest losses. The largest memecoin by market cap has tumbled by 16% in the last week. Following its three-year high, the original memecoin has shed nearly half its value, causing investors to wonder whether it would recover. While Dogecoin struggles, attention has turned to another memecoin that will explode in the next altcoin rally, which is Shiba Inu. Analysts Predict 250% Growth for Shiba Inu in 2025 Shiba Inu has attracted the attention of a lot of investors, especially since analysts have predicted a staggering 250% growth in 2025. After reaching an all-time high of $0.00003556 in March, SHIB experienced a decline before rebounding to $0.00003293, only to drop again. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating potential for a significant price movement. Analysts suggest that a breakout above the upper resistance line could propel SHIB to a target price of $0.00003255, representing a potential 32% increase from current levels. Despite being a memecoin, the main reason why SHIB has a bullish outlook is Shibarium, its Layer 2 blockchain. Shibarium is making SHIB, making it one of the best utility tokens. Investors are turning to tools like MetaMask and Ledger to securely hold and manage SHIB. 1Fuel OFT Predicted to Grow by 1000% Upon Listing Investors are buzzing about 1Fuel OFT, a promising new altcoin currently in its live presale stage. With stage 1 already complete and stage 2 over 50% finished, the presale has sold more than 86 million tokens. At its current presale value of just $0.012, OFT offers the lowest entry point for investors eager to secure the token before its anticipated public listing in Q2 2025. Analysts predict a 1000% growth upon listing, making it one of the most exciting opportunities in the crypto space right now. Unlike the memecoins that will explode, such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, 1Fuel OFT stands out as a utility token with intrinsic value driven by its robust features. OFT’s growing appeal highlights its potential as one of the best utility tokens to watch in 2025. 1Fuel’s DEX wallet has proven itself as a good alternative to tools like MetaMask and Ledger, especially since it facilitates cross-chain transactions without third-party tools. Its cutting-edge privacy mixer also exceeds the capabilities of wallets like MetaMask and Ledger, which currently lack integrated privacy tools. Investors Anticipate Altcoin Growth in 2025 As 1Fuel OFT gains traction in the altcoin market, it’s becoming a top contender for the next crypto rally. Unlike top memecoins, 1Fuel comes with a comprehensive ecosystem for long-term growth potential. Its value has attracted the attention of many investors, who are rushing to accumulate it in the presale.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 05:55:00

Hackers are now using his account to market questionable tokens and contracts under the pretense of an Animoca Brands coin release. Animoca Brands asks users to remain vigilant and not to interact with Siu’s account On December 26th, Animoca Brands disclosed via their official X account that their co-founder and CEO Yat Siu’s X account had been hacked. They warned users to stay alert, clarifying that the company had not formally issued any crypto tokens or NFTs. The firm added that information concerning the release of Solana-based tokens was also hacker-initiated. The company emphasized : Please DO NOT engage with the account and stay vigilant. We will provide an update when the account is restored. ~Animoca Brands Yat Siu’s account adds to the long list of X accounts hacked to push scam tokens On December 24, the live-streaming platform Kick’s official X account was also compromised. The account was used to promote fraudulent Solana-based tokens. Hackers even pushed the “Kick Token” to users, directing them to malicious wallet links. However, co-founder Bijan Tehrani, dismissed any plans to launch the Kick Token, warning users not to trust any of the scam posts on the token. On December 20, hackers also breached the X account of Vivek Ramaswamy, co-lead of the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). They used his account to propagate false claims of a partnership between the agency and the stablecoin project, under the guise of fostering financial inclusion and fiscal responsibility. Celebrity and rapper Drake’s account also fell victim to a breach, with hackers using his account to market scam token $ANITA. Attackers tied his Anita Max Wynn Tour to the fraudulent token and the crypto betting platform token Stake, hoping to entice unsuspecting users. Crypto investigator, ZachXBT called attention to the hack and debunked any connections of Drake to Stake or the $ANITA token. Moreover, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao even took to X to caution his followers against scam accounts trying to impersonate him. He stressed that his official X handle is @cz_binance, warning that any other accounts starting with ‘cz,’ even those with a blue verification checkmark, are fake.

Both coins have differentiated themselves as community-driven tokens with large user bases. However, as the race for domination in 2025 unfolds, another name is making headlines in the DeFi space. It’s no other than 1Fuel (OFT) . 1FUEL is soaring, having sold out the initial stage of what is now one of the top crypto presales in 2024, with a projected return of more than 500%. So, If you are interested in buying cryptocurrencies with long-term benefits, 1Fuel shows clear signs as a strong contender, alongside SHIB and DOGE ahead of 2025. Could the rise of 1Fuel reshape the dynamics of the meme coin showdown? SHIB: More Than Just A Meme Coin Shiba Inu, dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” has cultivated a devoted following as it distinguished itself as more than just a meme coin. Over the years, SHIB has grown its ecosystem to include the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, NFTs, and staking alternatives. These innovations are designed to give SHIB real-world utility and longevity. SHIB’s tokenomics are also key to its attractiveness, with a deflationary approach and token burns targeted to build value and reduce circulating supply. Shiba Inu’s network utilized a creative token-burning model to accelerate its deflationary goal. This strategy, which is closely linked to the growth of Shibarium (Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution) uses each transaction in the ecosystem to help lower token supply. As the market approaches 2025, SHIB investors are depending on new use cases and a dedicated community to drive growth. DOGE: The Original Meme Coin Dogecoin is indisputably the pioneer of meme coins, having a legacy that no other token can equal. Known for its lighthearted beginnings and strong celebrity endorsements, DOGE won over millions of hearts worldwide. DOGE has also, of course, benefited significantly from the patronage of Elon Musk. Despite its playful beginnings, DOGE has established itself as an authentic cryptocurrency, with growing popularity for microtransactions and tipping systems. Donald Trump’s election triumph caused DOGE to surge by more than 160% in November. However, the market now appears unsure of where DOGE will head next. DOGE’s early November rally was followed by a sluggish climb upward as the price lost momentum and investors began to take profits. Nevertheless, analysts anticipate that Dogecoin bulls may present a case for price suppression, sending the cryptocurrency back up around $0.485. 1Fuel’s Increasing Momentum While SHIB and DOGE occupy the meme coin scene, 1Fuel paves the path as a strong utility token in the DeFi space. Now in the second presale phase and selling for a low price of $0.012/token, 1Fuel has received much attention for its creative solutions that address key blockchain concerns. 1Fuel offers a one-click cross-chain cryptocurrency wallet, peer-to-peer exchange, and staking rewards up to 30% APR, amongst other benefits. Market analysts maintain that 1Fuel’s emphasis on practical applications and flexible user experiences establishes it as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for long-term returns. For individuals interested in buying cryptocurrencies with real-world utility, 1Fuel stands out as a top choice, sparring with meme coins and carving out a niche in the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conclusion SHIB, DOGE, and 1Fuel each offer unique prospects for investors . Shiba Inu continues to shape a system that extends its meme roots, whereas Dogecoin relies on its legacy and community strength. Meanwhile, 1Fuel is emerging as a functional utility token with the potential to reshape DeFi standards. Ahead of 2025, 1Fuel clearly positions itself as a worthy contender for one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in.

The reason? Understanding and deciphering the market sentiments. Though there are many indicators that help in predicting the movement, most of them are delayed, that is why they are called lagging indicators. Let’s explore the possibility of when Bitcoin can reach $110k. Exploring Bitcoin Chart Before we talk about the sentiment side, let’s have a look at what is happening in Bitcoin right now. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $98,268, just 0.08% up as compared to the last 24 hours. The price rose as high as $99,950 a few hours ago but moving average 100 sent it back down. The current support is MA 200. Also this is a zone where previously BTC had faced high resistance so this will also act as support now. Source : Coinglass The concern here is the RSI which is currently at 53.60 and constantly falling alongside price. The trading volume is down by 17.90% today as well. Even though the Fear and Greed Index was recorded at 79 which is extreme greed, the market sentiment feels bearish. The Market Sentiment The market intelligence platform Santiment shared deep insights in their X post. It has described how Bitcoin plays against market sentiments. On December 15, the social media was filled with speculations of BTC touching $110k, however it topped out at $108k, disappointing the market. Bitcoin has jumped to as high as $99.8K on a bullish Christmas crypto performance. Traders are now swinging bullish once again, with speculation of $110K getting rampant. Historically, we will see $110K Bitcoin only after the crowd doesn't expect it, as this image shows. pic.twitter.com/j4w3VQ4Zio — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 26, 2024 The same thing happened when the crypto was at $104k and there were mentions of it reaching $110k, it backed again. If we analyse the history of Bitcoin movement and compare it with market sentiments, things go in the opposite direction of major market mentions. When the market gets filled with high bearishness, suddenly Bitcoin pumps and vice versa. As people are again going super bullish and market sentiment is of greed, we should expect a price drop and not a rise. As soon as people stop expecting the market to rise it will shock them again. Bitcoin Dominance and Exchange Reserves The market dominance of Bitcoin is at 58.43%. This means investors hold more Bitcoin than other cryptos. Historically, whenever BTC dominance fell below this point the price of BTC followed it, so this particular zone can be said to be a support zone. Currently we can see the price is falling however the dominance is rising, this means soon the money will start flowing out of alts and into the btc. But before that the price must take a correction and create a bearish market sentiment. Source : Tradingview BTC exchange reserve data shows that since February 2024, the reserve has been falling and the price has been increasing. This metric shows how much Bitcoin is at the exchanges. A falling number shows that people are moving their crypto out of the crypto to a cold storage, giving a signal for a bullish momentum. Source : CryptoQuant Zooming into the past few days we can see that the exchange reserves increased for a while. This happened because whales moved out their crypto to sell when the price was above $100k. Now, the downside curve is signaling an upcoming bullish movement again. What to Expect? From what we have already discussed, it should be pretty clear by now that the market moves against the market sentiment. Even though we can see the BTC reserve falling, the price is falling as well but the bitcoin market dominance is rising. This is a clear indication that the market is planning to catch traders by surprise. People will go bearish and open short trades, this is an opportunity for the big and smart traders to capture this money from the market and fill their bags. Nothing of this is financial advice but should be taken as an educational content.

Surpassing the buzz around PEPE and BONK, this coin is rapidly gaining momentum and could lead the pack by 2025. Its swift rise is capturing attention.

DOGEN is the new doggie on the Solana memetokens ground alongside BONK, WIF, and Popcat known for their astonishing 1000% growth . Currently undervalued, DOGEN is poised to take this crypto narrative to the next level, potentially breaking records in this bull run. Community-Driven with Real Value DOGEN isn’t just a short-lived hype; it’s a growing movement .

Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world! PEPE: A Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a cryptocurrency launched as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog meme. It runs on Ethereum and is classified as a memecoin. PEPE does not have practical uses, following the theme of playful assets like Dogecoin. It has no transaction tax and uses mechanisms like token burning to increase rarity. A reward system encourages long-term holding. The coin reached a market cap of $1.6 billion in 2023, gaining attention among crypto users. Its roadmap includes goals for social media exposure and exchange listings. Available on platforms like Binance and Uniswap, it remains popular in the memecoin space. PEPE adapts Ethereum technology, offering secure transactions and decentralized access. BONK: Solana-Based Memecoin with Community Focus BONK is a cryptocurrency built on the Solana blockchain. It features a Shiba Inu mascot and aims to strengthen Solana’s community. Half of BONK’s supply was distributed through airdrops to Solana’s NFT and DeFi users. It gained prominence after a Coinbase listing and became the third-largest memecoin by market cap in late 2023. Its value surged over 10,000% year-to-date. BONK supports the Solana ecosystem with tools like its decentralized exchange, BonkSwap. While its high total supply and price swings are notable challenges, BONK’s role in the growing Solana network gives it utility. Its appeal depends on market trends and its further integration into decentralized applications. Conclusion While PEPE and BONK may offer less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as the token for those seeking luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and aiming for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows successful tokens like WIF and Popcat, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

In a heartfelt post, Chen shared that his daughter, Mira, was diagnosed with a rare and challenging brain tumor called craniopharyngioma on September 23rd. Despite the lack of a definitive cure for this condition, Chen and his team of researchers have been working tirelessly to support Dr. Hankinson’s lab in identifying promising new drugs to treat Mira’s tumor. Chen’s Christmas Eve post was a plea for help, asking his followers to support Dr. Hankinson’s groundbreaking research. “If not with funds, I would be just as grateful for a repost or a like on this thread,” he wrote. if you could press a button that cures your child’s brain tumor in exchange for ending your life immediately, every parent would hesitate for zero seconds before fighting to be the first to press it the cruelest thing is that no such button exists. but there is always a move pic.twitter.com/mlAbmeOpvx — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 25, 2024 In a remarkable turn of events, just three hours after his post, Siqi shared that the campaign had already raised $75,000, nearing the goal of $100,000. Overwhelmed by the outpouring of support, Chen expressed his gratitude, writing, “Yi and I are in tears. We are so grateful to all of you.” To further encourage donations, Siqi and his family decided to personally match every dollar raised beyond the $75K mark, up to a total of $100,000. This means that if the campaign reaches $200,000, Hankinson Lab will receive at least $300,000, which could be a game changer for research into craniopharyngiomas. going to take the family out for christmas dinner hope this is worth at least $1.80 when i get back pic.twitter.com/41rp8D2jig — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 26, 2024 However, the fundraising efforts took an unexpected twist. In a follow-up post, Chen revealed that a generous supporter had created a memecoin called $MIRA to help with fundraising. The individual, a random stranger, sent half of the total supply of $MIRA to Chen, and within 20 minutes, the memecoin was valued at an astounding $400,000. As of now, Siqi has successfully raised more than $18 million for Dr. Hankinson’s research efforts, with contributions pouring in from across the globe. He expressed his deep gratitude for the community’s support and continued to encourage donations and shares, hoping that every little bit would bring them closer to finding a cure.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-26 06:59:39

As a result, the hackers are promoting suspicious tokens and contracts under the guise of “Animoca Brands issuing new coins”. The Web3 platform popular for its products like Anichess, The Sandbox, PHANTOM GALAXIES, and Crazy Defense Heroes, has issued a warning asking users to stay vigilant. Yat Siu X Account Promotes Fake Solana-based Tokens The X Account of Yat Siu, founder of Animoca Brands, remains compromised promoting a fake token launch on the Solana blockchain. The Web3 platform took cognizance of the matter immediately that there was no official token launch of NFT launch by them. Thus, it has asked users not to engage with any such posts on Yat Siu’s X timeline. The official announcement noted: “Unfortunately, Yat Siu’s social media account has been compromised. There is no official token or NFT launch from Animoca Brands. The token launch on Solana as claimed in a post was made by the hacker. Please DO NOT engage with the account and stay vigilant”. After a temporary suspension by X, the account seems live again. However, an official confirmation from Animoca Brands is yet to come. In recent days, Yat Siu has been active on the X platform while shilling MOCA Coin during this period. As a result, the MOCA price surged all the way to $0.50 on Christmas day with a 200% surge on the weekly chart. However, the MOCA price has retraced nearly 30% from the top and is currently trading at $0.35, down 6% as of press time. Earlier this year, Animoca Brands co-founder said that he sees NFTs and Web3 gaming as key drivers of a transformation in digital ownership. He highlights the convergence of meme coins and NFTs, with technologies like the Ton protocol fostering synergies across the blockchain ecosystem. Animoca Brands Co-Founder Faces Tough Questions Blockchain security investigator ZachXBT has raised concerns over the compromised X account of Animoca Brands’ co-founder. He questioned why didn’t Yat Siu use advanced security measures, such as a hardware security key, to protect his account. A day before Christmas, ZachXBT had flagged concerns with a pattern identification wherein a threat actor uses phishing emails to gain access to high-profile accounts. “Just yesterday, I warned about phishing emails targeting Siu, likely linked to today’s breach,” ZachXBT noted. Reportedly, the same scammer has stolen more than $500,000 over the past month by compromising more than 15 X accounts including the likes of Kick, Cursor, Alex Blania, The Arena, and Brett. This phishing scam involves impersonating the X team to steal credentials and further launch fraudulent meme coins. Last week, hackers gained access to Vivek Ramaswamy’s X account while promoting a fake collaboration between the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) and USUAL stablecoin.

With remarkable gains in November and December, this investment product is on track to end the year with over 300% growth. This year has been a game-changer for XRP, particularly in the final months, fueled by key developments in regulatory and political change. Grayscale XRP Trust’s Recored 300% Gain Since its relaunch in September 2024, the Grayscale XRP Trust has captured attention with a dramatic rise in its share price. The trust started at $10.85 per share and has soared to $45.46, marking a significant return for early investors. Much of this growth is tied to XRP’s late-year rally, heavily influenced by Donald Trump’s pro-crypto sentiment following his election victory. A key driver of this surge is the pro-crypto wave triggered by Donald Trump’s election victory . His promises to support the crypto industry have reignited enthusiasm among investors, resulting in a bullish run for XRP. Additionally, many believe that the ongoing regulatory uncertainties around XRP are beginning to clear. The asset, long embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC, has seen positive developments, including a partial court victory in July 2023. These factors have boosted investor confidence in XRP’s potential. XRP Regulatory Clarity and ETF Hopes The possibility of greater regulatory clarity for XRP is also sparking excitement. There is growing speculation that XRP could soon secure spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), making them more accessible to institutional investors. Analysts suggest that the approval of XRP ETFs could attract billions of dollars in investment, further solidifying the asset’s position in the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For December 26 , The Push for XRP ETFs The outstanding performance of the Grayscale XRP Trust has sparked discussions about the possibility of spotting XRP ETFs . Prominent crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, also known as Bitboy, recently highlighted the Grayscale XRP Trust’s impressive gains as a catalyst for accelerating ETF approvals. With several asset managers, including Canary Capital and Bitwise, filing applications for spot XRP ETFs, the industry is optimistic about a favorable outcome. If approved, these ETFs could open new doors for institutional participation in XRP. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38130557,https://invezz.com/?p=2405142,1735196647,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Why iDEGEN’s AI-driven rise outpaces XRP in 2025’s crypto race,https://invezz.com/news/2024/12/26/why-idegens-ai-driven-rise-outpaces-xrp-in-2025s-crypto-race/,"The cryptocurrency market continues its roller-coaster ride, with AI-driven tokens emerging as a dynamic force. Among these, iDEGEN has positioned itself as a game-changer in the AI-based memecoin sector, where its innovative auction presale mechanism redefines market engagement. With growing popularity in the US and UK, iDEGEN is drawing comparisons to established tokens like XRP, which is currently priced at $2.25. Despite XRP’s steady market presence, iDEGEN’s unique model and viral adoption provide compelling reasons for its superior positioning in 2025. iDEGEN’s innovation against XRP’s stability iDEGEN operates on an adaptive auction model where token prices fluctuate every five minutes based on demand. This mechanism has fuelled a total raised amount of $9.18 million, signalling strong market interest before the token even reaches exchanges. By contrast, XRP, trading at $2.25 with a $128.84 billion market cap, has displayed stability through whale accumulation and subdued selling pressure. Despite this, XRP’s recent failure to break past the $3.00 resistance and subsequent triangle consolidation pattern highlights a more cautious growth trajectory. Regarding market activity, iDEGEN thrives on volatility, driving enthusiasm among traders. Its price-adjustment strategy, moving up or down by 5% based on buying momentum, makes it a magnet for speculative investments. XRP, while offering resilience with its investor hold rates and accumulation trends, lacks this level of engagement. For risk-tolerant traders, iDEGEN presents an avenue to ride the volatility wave, while XRP’s appeal remains with long-term holders banking on potential ETF launches or favourable regulatory changes. Why iDEGEN outshines XRP in 2025’s altcoin landscape iDEGEN’s standout feature is its dynamic AI integration, which evolves in real-time. Initially modelled to interact with crypto Twitter, iDEGEN’s AI now engages directly with traders and influencers, creating an ever-expanding network effect. Future updates, including Telegram integration and automated video AI capabilities, promise to amplify its viral appeal. This progressive roadmap has already led to the token trending across social platforms, marking it as a cultural phenomenon in the crypto space. XRP, on the other hand, is primarily driven by macroeconomic catalysts such as potential regulatory clarity and the expectation of an ETF approval. While these factors maintain its relevance, they lack the innovative edge iDEGEN brings to the table. Furthermore, XRP’s technical indicators show mixed signals, with its RSI slightly bullish and stochastic oscillator nearing a crossover. This momentum contrasts sharply with iDEGEN’s aggressive market ascent. Another key difference lies in accessibility and adaptability. iDEGEN’s auction presale ensures equitable price discovery, whereas XRP’s centralised Ripple Labs backing limits its flexibility. This decentralised ethos gives iDEGEN an edge in appealing to the broader crypto community, aligning with the sector’s decentralised finance ideals.

38130861,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53150,1735197047,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Says It’s Biggest Mistake to Ignore XRP This Bull Run,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-its-biggest-mistake-to-ignore-xrp-this-bull-run/,"A prominent market analyst has warned that failing to include XRP in a portfolio during the ongoing bull run may be one of investors’ most significant missed opportunities. Crypto Vilian, a well-known chartist and Cambridge graduate, recently analyzed XRP’s historical price action. In a detailed post on X, he highlighted the asset’s current price movements and compared them to its performance during the late 2017 bull run. XRP’s Market Behavior Mirrors 2017 Patterns Crypto Vilian’s analysis identified similarities between XRP’s current trajectory and its historical pattern that led to its all-time high in early 2018. The market structure outlined in his chart illustrates a sequence of phases: a prolonged bearish decline, a gradual recovery, and a consolidation period. These phases were followed by a significant breakout that propelled XRP to its peak price. According to his findings, XRP appears to follow a similar structure over the past seven years. After breaking out of a long-term bearish trend, the asset has recently entered a recovery and consolidation phase. This pattern and the notable breakout in recent months suggest that XRP could be preparing for another upward surge. Crypto Vilian posited that this breakout, if realized, could push XRP to new all-time highs, potentially replicating the explosive gains seen in the 2017/2018 cycle. Based on his projections, XRP might even surpass a $1 trillion market capitalization during this bull run, equating to a price of over $17. One of the Biggest Mistakes The possibility of a trillion-dollar valuation has sparked widespread attention within the crypto community. Xoom, another respected market commentator, underscored the importance of holding XRP during this cycle. He warned that ignoring the asset now could represent a significant misstep for investors aiming to capitalize on the bull market’s potential. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.24, having declined by approximately 10.51% over the past week due to broader market trends dominated by Bitcoin’s recent downturn. Despite this, the asset remains one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies of the cycle, having reached a seven-year high of $2.90 three weeks ago. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Levels and Caution for Investors Although Crypto Vilian’s analysis presents an optimistic outlook, he stressed that XRP’s performance is closely tied to Bitcoin’s trajectory. A bullish Bitcoin market could propel altcoins, including XRP, to new highs, while a bearish trend might dampen their growth. The analyst identified potential price levels for XRP between $8 and $13, which he considers pivotal targets. The asset could see further gains if these levels are exceeded, reaching the technical target associated with a contracting triangle Elliott wave pattern. Such a move would imply nearly 100x growth from XRP’s lows of $0.30. However, Crypto Vilian cautioned investors against aiming to sell at the exact market top. Instead, he recommended taking profits at key levels during the upward trajectory. “After all, no one went broke taking profits early,” he remarked. As XRP continues to trade within a consolidation phase, market analysts are keeping a close eye on its potential for explosive growth.

Fast forward to today, and we see a strikingly similar scenario in the world of cryptocurrency. BTFD Coin presents an incredible chance for those looking to multiply their gains. With a presale price of just $0.000064, investors can secure a jaw-dropping 837.5% return when BTFD Coin lists at $0.0006. Don’t forget to use the bonus code BIG50 for an extra 50% discount on your purchase! Meme coins have skyrocketed in popularity over the years, captivating both seasoned investors and newbies alike. BTFD Coin is ready to take this phenomenon to the next level. With its innovative play-to-earn (P2E) game , a stellar referral program, and enticing staking rewards, BTFD Coin is poised to tap into the vibrant community that fuels meme coin success. It’s not just about the laughs; it’s about real opportunities to engage and earn. The buzz around BTFD Coin’s presale is palpable, with over $4.5 million raised in just a few weeks. As we dive into the details of BTFD Coin and compare it with other emerging players like Fartcoin and Gigachad, it’s clear that BTFD is not just another meme coin; it’s a serious contender in the market. Let’s explore why BTFD Coin stands out as one of the top meme coin presales to buy now. BTFD Coin: The Rising Star of Meme Coins BTFD Coin is making waves in the cryptocurrency ocean, and for good reason. The presale has gone remarkably well, hitting over $4.5 million in just a month. With 59 billion coins sold and more than 6,600 holders, the community is already buzzing about the potential for massive returns. The current presale price of $0.000064, available due to a significant 50% discount, is hard to ignore. Investors can leverage the presale stage to buy in at this discount before the anticipated price jump to $0.0006 upon listing. What does this mean in practical terms? If you invest $40,000 at the current price, you’d snag a whopping 625 million BTFD coins. When the coin hits the expected listing price, that investment could balloon to $375,000! That’s a staggering 837.5% return on your investment, making it one of the top meme coin presales to buy now. But it’s not just about the numbers. BTFD Coin is designed with community engagement in mind. Through its P2E game, users can earn while having fun, and the referral program incentivises spreading the word. The staking rewards offer passive income opportunities, creating a well-rounded investment strategy that resonates with both casual and serious investors. Don’t forget the bonus code BIG50! This code grants you an additional 50% discount when you buy. It’s a smart move to use this code while you can, as it amplifies your purchasing power during the presale. The excitement around BTFD Coin is infectious, and being part of its journey could be one of the best decisions you make this year. Fartcoin: A Meme Coin with a Twist Next up is Fartcoin, a project that’s garnered attention for its quirky branding and community-driven initiatives. While Fartcoin may not have the same financial clout as BTFD, it’s certainly carving out a niche in the meme coin arena. The project has a playful approach, appealing to those who love to embrace the lighter side of cryptocurrency. Fartcoin has been gaining traction, especially among younger investors who appreciate its humorous take on the crypto landscape. The project leverages social media and community events to rally support and boost visibility. Although it pales in comparison to BTFD’s presale success, Fartcoin still has a loyal following ready to ride the wave of its growth. However, the critical distinction lies in the utility and structure of Fartcoin. Unlike BTFD, which boasts a robust P2E game and staking rewards, Fartcoin primarily thrives on its meme culture. This could limit its long-term potential, especially as investors increasingly seek coins that offer tangible benefits beyond just a laugh. As meme coins continue to rise and fall, Fartcoin’s success will hinge on its ability to maintain community engagement and find innovative ways to enhance its value proposition. For now, it’s a fun project but may not be the top choice for those looking to invest seriously. If you want solid returns, BTFD Coin remains the top meme coin presale to buy now. Gigachad: The Heavyweight Contender Enter Gigachad, another name that’s been making headlines in the meme coin sphere. With a focus on building a community around strength and empowerment, Gigachad has attracted a dedicated fan base. Its branding is sharp, and its community initiatives are designed to foster loyalty and engagement. Gigachad has also embraced the meme culture, using humour and relatability to connect with potential investors. The project has received attention for its unique approach, and it’s doing well in the presale arena. However, when compared to BTFD Coin, the differences become apparent. While Gigachad is gaining traction, it lacks the comprehensive ecosystem that BTFD Coin offers. The P2E game, staking options, and rewarding referral programme set BTFD apart as the more enticing option for investors. Gigachad may be fun, but it’s BTFD’s real-world utility that could lead to substantial returns. Investors looking for the top meme coin presales to buy now should consider what each project brings to the table. Gigachad’s community-driven approach is commendable, but when it comes to potential returns and innovative features, BTFD Coin is the clear winner. How to Buy BTFD Coin Go to the Presale Page Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Locate the Bonus code field, enter BIG50, and click “Apply”. Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and review the discounted price. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as a beacon of opportunity in the meme coin landscape. With its presale success, innovative features, and a vibrant community, it’s hard to ignore the potential for massive returns. The current presale price of $0.000064, along with the 50% discount from the BIG50 bonus code, makes this an unmissable chance. As the presale progresses, more investors are joining the movement, and the excitement is palpable. With $4.5 million raised and counting, BTFD Coin’s trajectory is set for success. If you’re serious about finding the top meme coin presales to buy now, look no further than BTFD Coin. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your future in the crypto world. Don’t miss out on this golden opportunity to invest in a project that’s poised for greatness!

However, it was stopped there and pushed south by a few grand amid reports of a growing number of investors realizing profits. What Needs to Change The analytics company Santiment has frequently reasserted the importance of the overall crowd expectations for the underlying asset’s prices. But, what happens is usually the opposite of the general anticipation. The developments in the past 48 hours have only solidified their theory. BTC’s price went from around $94,000 on Christmas Eve to just shy of $100,000 yesterday evening, but its rally was halted at that point, and the asset is back to $98,000 now. Santiment indicated that “traders are now swinging bullish once again, with speculations of $110K getting rampant.” Although this might sound bullish for bitcoin at first, the company reaffirmed its belief that the cryptocurrency tends to oppose what the majority expects by saying, “Historically, we will see $100K Bitcoin only after the crowd doesn’t expect it.” ‍ Bitcoin has jumped to as high as $99.8K on a bullish Christmas crypto performance. Traders are now swinging bullish once again, with speculation of $110K getting rampant.

Data shared by Ali Martinez shows that on December 23 alone, they had realized more than $7 billion in bitcoin profits.

He noted that 1.51 million wallets have spent nearly $150 billion to turn that level into support now. Usually, when new investors see their positions go into red, they tend to start panic selling, which is why it’s important for BTC to remain above $97,300.

As reported by a Japanese media outlet, the government of Japan, on Dec. 20, released its official answer to several queries Senator Satoshi Hamada put forward concerning the adoption of Bitcoin ( BTC ) as part of Japan’s foreign exchange reserves. Under the name of Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru, the statement explained that, at present, Japan has no intention of considering cryptocurrency reserves.

The government responded that it does not have enough knowledge about global movements in that respect and said that discussions on the adoption of cryptocurrencies for reserves are in very preliminary stages. That is, the government has said it would be “difficult to express a view” on this at this point. The response also mentioned that, under Japan’s legal system for special account management, cryptocurrencies such as BTC do not fall under the category of foreign exchange assets. Moreover, a “crypto asset” is not regarded as a “security” pursuant to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act under Japanese law . The Payment Services Act provides the definition of “crypto assets” and requires any provider of crypto-asset exchange service (CAES) to register with the Financial Services Agency. Operating CAES without registration entails criminal penalties, says Anderson Mori & Tomotsune, a full-service law firm in Japan.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 07:23:00

The South Korean government has announced sanctions on the 313 Bureau, a North Korean cyber unit involved in widespread crypto theft. In a Dec. 26 public statement , the government noted that the bureau, which operates under the North Korean Ministry of National Defense, has been linked to numerous cyberattacks aimed at stealing digital assets from around the world. South Korean officials cite data by U.S. blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, which claims that North Korea is responsible for more than 60% of global crypto theft in 2024, totaling a record $1.3 billion. These stolen funds are believed to be funneled into North Korea’s weapons programs, including its missile and nuclear development initiatives. In addition to targeting the 313 Bureau, the sanctions also cover 15 North Korean IT personnel and one related institution. The South Korean government says these individuals and organizations are accused of engaging in foreign currency-earning activities abroad, which directly contribute to the regime’s nuclear and missile programs. “In particular, North Korean IT personnel, working under the Ministry of National Defense and other regime-affiliated organizations, are dispatched to countries in China, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Africa.” South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs You might also like: US shuts down North Korean crypto laundering network The move comes just three days after crypto.news reported that the United States and South Korea are working together to create new mechanisms to prevent crypto thefts linked to North Korea.

This raised the total number of collateral assets supported to over 80 and added more versatility to the trading platform. Amongst those newly included assets were the likes of PEPE, BONK, SUI, DAI, AAVE, and many more, allowing access to numerous strategies touching borrow, margin, and futures trading. With the expansion, it looks to focus on remaining relevant in the changing cryptocurrency market. The exchange boasts up to 5.5 million users and brands itself as a one-stop solution for retail and institutional traders. Moreover, through expansion and offering an expanded range of collateral assets on the platform, it seeks to enhance the user’s ability to risk manage while using many other trading strategies. WhiteBIT Expands Collateral Offering with 60 New Cryptocurrencies WhiteBIT’s expansion in offerings is largely driven by the growing demand for such features within the industry as noted by the company. With the new additions, It supports more than 80 collaterals, allowing users to choose a variety of assets for their margin and futures trading. This further highlights the increasing demand for the assets including PEPE, BONK, SUI, DAI, AAVE, as well as many others. While other traders like the niche collaterals of newer tokens that are in contrast to major leans on trading such as bitcoin and Ethereum, such flexibility WhiteBIT is propagating this through its extension. When it tosses these assets into its system, then WhiteBIT has expanded platform capabilities that enable different types of trading. With new opportunities coming in, users can now use tokens such as PEPE or BONK for more questionable trades or for stablecoins like DAI to encrypt trade in case of fluctuating prices. The focus on bringing in these new collateral assets points to the ability of this exchange to adapt and innovate in a competitive surrounding. The exchange is based on the customer-focused approach which allows both retail clients as well as institutional customers getting access to many advanced trading features that require greater liquidity, such as leveraged trades and margin loans from a very limited number of tokens. The Growing Importance of Collateral in Cryptocurrency Trading The fact that there are more than 80 assets integrated as collateral on WhiteBIT shows how important this collateral is in our cryptocurrency exchange era. The key benefit that WhiteBIT will benefit from is the opportunity to provide users with options that would best fit their risk profiles by using different assets. This is largely due to the use of collaterals in margin, futures trading, and other activities through leveraging cryptocurrency ownership as a crucial aspect of the ecosystem. Currently, with a new type of collateral framework introduced in WhiteBIT, users can now diversify their risk on a relatively wider range of assets instead of basing it on a few. Additionally, the system allows immediate marking to market of collateral that helps traders keep track of their open positions in case their trades were liquidated. This comes in especially handy where prices become very volatile and change promptly. The increase in collateral that is provided over the counter exchange is a strategy that more and more of the cryptocurrency exchanges are adopting as they seek to improve their platforms and reach more people. By allowing several collaterals, WhiteBIT becomes a simple exchange that meets the needs of both first-time traders and those relatively familiar with trading. Additionally, 60 new assets can be used for crypto lending , unlocking new opportunities for those looking to invest and earn income effectively. Crypto Lending allows you to lend your cryptocurrencies to WhiteBIT by selecting a flexible plan of 30, 90, 180, or 360 days. It offers the opportunity to earn up to 13.49% annual income in the same cryptocurrency you lend. This unique tool is ideal for crypto traders seeking to grow their assets with minimal risk. WhiteBIT Spot and Futures Trading Volumes, and WBT Token Performance WhiteBIT has become the first cryptocurrency exchange to obtain a Level 3 certification under the Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS) . It continues to perform strongly in both spot and futures trading markets. The platform’s spot trading volume has surpassed $6.1 billion in the last 24 hours, reflecting its prominence in the European cryptocurrency market. This robust volume is fueled by the recent expansion of collateral options, attracting a wide range of traders. Apart from spot trading, WhiteBIT’s future market has also been quite active as it has registered over $17.2 billion in trading volume in the last 24 hours. The exchange also provides 181 futures contracts and this makes it easy for traders who wish to take up leveraged positions and apply more intricate strategies. Meanwhile, its native token WBT price has maintained a solid performance. Trading at $25, WBT experienced a slight 1% dip in the last 24 hours. Despite this, the token boasts a market cap of $2.17 billion and remains a key component of its ecosystem.

At the end of his thread, he asked X users to help send donations to fund Dr. Todd Hankinson’s research. Hankinson is a professors of Neurosurgery and Pediatrics from the University of Colorado, who Chen claimed “runs the only lab in the world focusing on this tumor.” “Though there is still no cure, with the help of our research team, we have already helped dr. Hankinson’s lab identify promising new drugs for Mira’s tumor. But we need your help,” wrote Chen in his post. The thread reached more than 133,000 users, with many asking Chen to share his crypto wallet addresses, including Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. Not long after, Chen stated that someone launched a meme coin named after his daughter on the Solana network to help raise money for the brain tumor research. uh so some random guy 20 minutes made a SOL memecoin called $MIRA to help with research fundraising and sent me half the entire supply and it's now worth like $400K and i literally don't know what to do because i certainly don't want to rug a bunch of random people https://t.co/P78bLq52fB — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 26, 2024 You might also like: New Binance listings ‘god candle’ led by ACT and PNUT The token developer sent Chen half of its entire supply, which is worth $400,000 at the time. Though, he expressed he was hesitant in selling the tokens because he does not want to rug pull the people who invested in the meme coin. Despite people in the comments saying they donated their funds to MIRA willingly. In the end, Chen declared that he plans to sell 10% of the supply and use 5% of the tokens for Hankinson Lab research, which is worth $49,263. He intends to hold onto the other 5%, adding that he will not be selling more than that without a 24-hour prior notice. He also clarifies that all proceeds will go to funding research for the rare brain tumor at Hankinson Lab and that his family will not receive a single cent from the token. “I just want to say that whoever said crypto has no legitimate use cases, you can tell them that funding for rare disease research is a pretty legitimate use case,” said Chen.

Accordingly, ZachXBT announced that the X account of Yat Siu, co-founder and president of blockchain gaming giant Animoca Brands, was hacked. ZachXBT also noted that the hacker promoted a fake token from Yat Sui's account. Hacker Siu introduced a Solana-based memecoin called Animoca Brands (MOCA), which shares the name of the company's Mocaverse non-fungible token (NFT) collection launched on Pump.fun from his account. The post was later deleted. According to the data, the fake MOCA token reached a market value of $36,700 shortly after it was shared from Siu’s account, but then crashed. Animoca Brands confirmed the hack and fake token launch, stating: “Unfortunately, Siu’s social media account has been compromised. In a shared post, the alleged token launch on Solana was done by the hacker.” This hack also negatively affected the altcoin called The Sandbox (SAND). Having fallen by 8% in the last 24 hours, SAND ranked first among the altcoins that fell the most. https://twitter.com/animocabrands/status/1872094029451772161 *This is not investment advice.

On the other hand, Ethereum shows signs of outperforming Bitcoin in 2025 due to a potential breakout in the ETH/BTC ratio and increasing inflows into ETH-based ETFs. Adding to Bitcoin’s momentum, Israel is launching six Bitcoin-tracking funds next week, and Russia is embracing Bitcoin for global trade as part of its efforts to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. Binance Reserves Signal Investor Confidence in Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC) reserves on Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, have dropped to levels not seen since January of 2024, right before a 90% surge in Bitcoin’s price by March. Bitcoin currently trades close to $98,160, and some analysts suggest that a similar trajectory could see its price reaching $187,500 in the coming months. The decline in reserves dipped below 570,000 BTC according to CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost , and it is considered to be a bullish signal because investors typically move Bitcoin into cold storage during periods of long-term confidence. Binance Bitcoin exchange reserve (Source: CryptoQuant ) This trend is very similar to early 2024 when Binance’s reserves also plummeted before Bitcoin’s price surged to a then all-time high of $73,679 on March 13. According to Darkfost, withdrawals from exchanges often signal positive momentum building in the market, and current conditions align with this historical pattern. Despite this, Bitcoin’s dominance stands at 58.40%, just shy of the critical 60% level, which analysts like Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen believe could trigger a rotation toward other crypto assets. Cowen predicted Bitcoin dominance will reach 60% by December, a milestone it last achieved on Oct. 30. Bitcoin faced some challenges holding above the psychological $100,000 level since first breaking it on Dec. 5. The price stayed below this mark since Dec. 19, after reaching a new high of $108,300 on Dec. 17. Bitcoin’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, predicts that Bitcoin’s price could surpass $105,000 once liquidity returns after the holiday season. He believes the current downtrend is due to typical holiday illiquidity and expects increased market activity post-Christmas. For this week, Lee predicted that Bitcoin will likely trade within the $94,000 to $105,000 range. Israel to Launch Six Bitcoin Funds Bitcoin’s price could also receive a nice boost from the launch of six Bitcoin-tracking funds next week in Israel after the approval by the Israel Securities Authority. These funds will be available for purchase at banks and investment firms from Dec. 31, and will mirror Bitcoin's price movements by using various indexes and strategies. Among the funds, some will track U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), while one will be actively managed to outperform Bitcoin’s performance. The funds will also be managed by leading Israeli firms like Phoenix Investment, IBI-Kessem, Meitav, More, Ayalon, and Migdal, and will charge management fees ranging from 0.25% to 1.5%. The regulatory approval came after two years of requests from asset managers asking for local investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin using Israel’s fiat currency, the shekel. Transactions will initially be processed once daily, and will reflect Bitcoin’s price at the time of execution. Eyal Haim, vice president of Ayalon Mutual Funds, shared that their investment house wanted to engage with the digital currency sector for a long time now by offering mutual funds tied to companies in the field. Since May, Israel also made strides in progressing on its central bank digital currency initiative, the Digital Shekel Challenge . This project plans to encourage innovation by encouraging participants to develop real-time payment systems by using the digital shekel. The Bank of Israel offers a sandbox environment for testing. A key objective of the digital shekel initiative is to increase competition among local banks. While the project has received public support, there are still some concerns about privacy. Russia Embraces Bitcoin for Global Trade Russia is advancing its use of digital financial assets (DFAs), including Bitcoin, in foreign trade as part of its strategy to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov shared these developments in a recent interview on Russia-24, and revealed that legislation has been passed to allow these transactions under an experimental legal framework that was established in September of 2024. According to Siluanov, the adoption of DFAs, like Bitcoin, offers a modern and innovative approach to international settlements. He even described it as a vision for the future of global trade. According to the finance minister, Russia already initiated foreign trade transactions using DFAs and plans to scale these efforts in the coming year. Siluanov also pointed out that Bitcoin mined in the country could be used in these transactions. This shift is made possible by Russia’s legalization of Bitcoin mining earlier in the year, which paved the way for its use in regulated trade operations. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov Despite advocating for the use of digital assets in trade, Siluanov still maintained a more cautious stance on cryptocurrency investments. In November, he warned against speculative investment in cryptocurrencies due to their volatility and the risks involved. Russia’s experimentation with DFAs builds on its earlier efforts to regulate digital assets. The country officially recognized Bitcoin as a digital financial asset in 2021 under the ”On Digital Financial Assets” law, which granted it legal status while restricting its use as a payment method in the nation. Ether Gears Up to Outpace Bitcoin in 2025 Despite these developments, Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of outperforming Bitcoin as 2025 approaches, according to crypto analysts. The ETH/BTC ratio , which is currently close to 0.0356, has attracted a lot of attention. MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe suggested it could break above 0.04 in January 2025. The last time this level was reached was on Dec. 8, when ETH’s price climbed just above $4,000. Van de Poppe expects increased inflows into Ether, potentially accompanied by outflows from Bitcoin. This could lead to Bitcoin price consolidation and trigger an “altcoin run.” Supporting this outlook, Ethereum-based tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mantle (MNT) recently saw impressive gains after recently rising by 7+% and 3+%, respectively. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is still trading below $100,000 after first breaching the six-figure mark on Dec. 5. Analysts also pointed out the growing potential of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Nate Geraci , president of ETF Store, shared that net inflows into ETH ETFs are keeping pace with gold ETFs and are expected to accelerate. Similarly, pseudonymous trader Brent described Ethereum as an undervalued asset, and also compared its potential to a submerged ball ready to surge upward. This optimism aligns with earlier views that Ethereum’s underperformance relative to Bitcoin may be concluding. Benjamin Cowen , founder of Into The Cryptoverse, stated in early December that the ETH/BTC collapse appears to be over, and predicted a stronger performance for Ethereum over the next 6 to 12 months. These factors all point to a promising start to 2025 for Ether.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-26 07:28:20

Crypto traders are pointing to Avalanche ( AVAX ) and Toncoin ( TON ) as these two solid crypto projects are showing signs of recovery. While optimism surrounding AVAX and TON is strong, investors look further for projects with immediate upside potential. Right now, these crypto traders have set their sights on Rollblock’s presale , as it has accumulated over $7.6 million within a short period. This highlights Rollblock’s explosive growth potential, as it captures attention most tokens can only dream of in the crypto space. Let’s investigate why the Rollblock presale is stealing the spotlight as AVAX and TON gear up for their next move. Rollblock presale hits stage 9: Large investors flock in with more gains ahead Rollblock’s ICO launch is making waves in the crypto market, with its new GambleFi protocol attracting significant whale investment. Unsurprisingly, Rollblock is delivering the goods by bringing two coveted values, trust and transparency, into the iGambling sectors. With its innovation on the reliable Ethereum chain, Rollblock is redefining the way online gambling is perceived while ensuring a top-notch gaming experience. This is the game-changer punters have been searching for! Rollblock uses its Ethereum-backed security protocol to ensure that there are no data breaches. Even better, Rollblock ensures that all 7,000 gaming titles on its crypto casino are regulated and audited by top providers like Gaming Anjouan and SolidProof, providing an additional layer of security. Rollblock also appeals to AVAX and TON investors with its unique revenue-sharing model. As part of this system, Rollblock distributes up to 30% of its casino profits. Holders receive the first 40% of this allocation through staking rewards, while the remaining 60% is used for token buybacks that are burned immediately, taking its price to new heights. AVAX price to surge 50% as positive news builds momentum towards $60 The AVAX price has only found new lows since it touched down on its yearly high of $62.38 in March. At one point in the AVAX price decline, it lost 120% as it found a support level at $20. However, based on positive news on the synthetic dollar deUSD coming to Avalanche in collaboration with Securitize, the AVAX price has entered a recovery phase as it trades in the $35 consolidation range. From all indications, the AVAX price is steadily climbing toward its yearly high after its recent breakthrough above a major resistance level. Toncoin to soar amid prolonged range bound price movements The Toncoin’s recent price action has been volatile, with sharp fluctuations in support and resistance levels. Moreover, TON has undergone a 65% slump after reaching its all-time high of $8.25 in June. Several crypto analysts believe that TON is on track to bounce back after briefly falling below $5. These experts see an inverted heads and shoulders on TON’s price charts, suggesting a positive slow and steady trend reversal. When it comes to this move, savvy investors are still cautious not to jump in when the move is still in its early phase. Conclusion Despite AVAX and TON’s signs of market bullishness, Rollblock presale is undoubtedly the highlight of the current market opportunity for traders seeking immediate profit and long-term value. Interestingly, the Rollblock presale is live and active at $0.043. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Ripple CTO Comments on “10x Times” Phrase Schwartz posted an image of a plastic can labeled “Pre-Mix Bubble Solution,” which advertised “10x times the bubbles.” Rather than focusing solely on the claim of a 10x increase, Schwartz highlighted the grammatical redundancy of the phrase. His tweet drew attention from the XRP community , prompting speculation about whether it was a subtle hint toward XRP’s price trajectory. In response, community members debated the implications of a potential 10x increase in XRP’s price. Some interpreted the tweet as a possible reference to XRP reaching $10, while others engaged in broader discussions about the token’s future performance. Ripple Moves 90 Million XRP in Major Transfers Over the weekend, the blockchain tracking platform Whale Alert reported two large XRP transfers conducted by Ripple. The transactions, totaling 90 million XRP, were valued at approximately $200 million. The first transfer involved 50 million XRP worth $111.7 million, while the second moved 40 million XRP valued at $89.7 million. Both transactions were executed within one minute, and the destination wallets for these transfers remain unidentified. In addition, Whale Alert documented other significant XRP transactions totaling 182 million XRP with an aggregate fiat value of $411 million. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analyst Highlights Key Levels for XRP Price Movement Crypto market analyst Ali Martinez recently identified $2.20 as a critical price level for XRP. Posting on his X account, Martinez suggested that XRP could consolidate at this level before attempting a move toward the next resistance at $2.70. However, the analyst also warned that a failure to maintain support at $2.20 could result in a decline to $1.96. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.24, showing minimal price movement after its recent rally. XRP’s Recent Price Fluctuations Last week, XRP experienced a sharp decline, losing over 20% of its value. The token fell from $2.71 to $1.96 before recovering over the weekend to its current price of $2.26. This volatility has kept traders and analysts closely watching the market for further developments. As discussions about XRP’s potential continue to unfold, Schwartz’s tweet and Ripple’s significant token transfers have added fuel to the speculation surrounding the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. Whether XRP can achieve the speculated 10x growth remains uncertain, but the community remains actively engaged in analyzing the token’s performance.

CEOs like Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong and Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse experienced major financial gains after the election results. Armstrong, for example, earned an additional $129 million from stock sales, while Coinbase’s market value surged by $21 billion. Armstrong’s stake in Coinbase increased by nearly $2 billion, bringing its total value to $6.4 billion. Coinbase also made a notable political contribution, donating $74 million to various political action committees (PACs) to support the election. Armstrong’s stock sales were part of his diversification strategy, ensuring continued control over his company. Ripple’s Garlinghouse saw even more dramatic gains after the value of XRP, the company’s native token, soared from $0.50 to $2.32 post-election. This surge in XRP’s value led to a 54.7% increase in its market cap over the past 30 days, sending it to the third position among all digital assets. Garlinghouse also owns more than 6% of Ripple and a significant amount of XRP, which has now increased in value by over three times since the election. “The crypto market is up over $1 trillion since Trump won — that’s the price of Gensler’s foot on the neck of the market, and he’s not even officially gone yet,” Garlinghouse told Coindesk. Although Ripple Labs’ private valuation was last estimated at around $11 billion earlier this year, the election has likely increased the value of Garlinghouse’s stake, causing his personal wealth to soar. Additionally, major investors in crypto firms such as Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z) also enjoyed major gains, outpacing their election-related investments. Ripple and A16Z each donated tens of millions to political causes, with Ripple contributing $73 million and A16Z $70 million.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-26 07:41:15

It hugely impacted the firm’s operation and despite several attempts to recover the funds DMM Bitcoin failed to restore their customer money. As a result, the company decided to stop its business operations and focus on transferring customer accounts to a more secure platform. Growing hack incidents are creating panic in the market reflecting the worse side of investing in digital assets. DMM Bitcoin’s Strategic Steps to Address the Situation In response to the breach and the challenges of recovering from it, DMM Bitcoin announced a plan to liquidate its operations and transfer all customer accounts and assets to SBI VC Trade, a crypto exchange operated by SBI Group. This transfer is scheduled to be completed by March 2025. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO And Crypto Moguls Enjoy Billions in Wealth Growth After Trump’s Election , Ripple’s Role in the Transfer Recently to streamline the account transition process SBI VC Trade, roped its partner Ripple to help DMM Bitcoin’s users by ensuring that their accounts and assets would be safely transferred. Ripple’s involvement adds an extra layer of trust, given SBI’s long-standing relationship with the blockchain company and its reputation for secure digital asset management. This means that DMM Bitcoin users won’t need to open new accounts with SBI, as their existing assets will be transferred directly. Plus, SBI stated they will offer 14 new crypto products to the users, although crypto-to-crypto trading pairs ETH/BTC and leveraged trading will not be included in the offerings, focusing on safer and more stable options for users. This strategic move by DMM Bitcoin aims to restore customer faith and provide a secure environment for trading, while SBI VC Trade’s expertise in handling such transfers ensures a smooth transition for affected users. This incident shows that the crypto exchanges need better security to safeguard their customer funds many hacking incidents are coming majorly from North Korea signaling they know the loopholes in the system and it should be a lesson for other crypto firms. Moreover, Japan’s anti-crypto take on Bitcoin reserve plans can also impact the crypto in the country in a current Bitcoin market scenario. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The community dubbed ETH killer picked up gains in price and on-chain activity alongside other altcoins. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) continued to move sideways, losing strength in overall market dominance. SOL Price Soars 6% Solana’s price is up 6.1% in the last 72 hours alongside surging network activities boosting trading volumes. The asset trades at $194.59, soaring to a market cap above $93 billion. SOL bulls have also picked up new assets and are spotting positive on-chain factors. The new accumulation and offload to other custodians point to possible long-term holdings away from sell pressures. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dominance has fallen since it touched its all-time high above $107K. The top crypto’s outflows led to large losses, with traders losing positions. Bitcoin pulled its worst daily trading after the last bull peak on Dec 23, sliding 1.7%. From that point, altcoins have picked up 4.5% of the total BTC ratio, signaling signs of capital flow. This led to a surge in SOL price, an asset tipped to lead the altcoin season. Solana’s rising institutional demand is a major reason for the price gains above other top assets. Traditionally, SOL outpaces the market during bull seasons. Apart from its institutional flows, Solana’s decentralized finance activities continue its forward trajectory with soaring assets under management (AUM). Furthermore, Solana meme coins have attracted a buzz to the ecosystem from its Q1 frenzy to last month’s gains. Meanwhile, Trader Tardigrade wrote on X on SOL, completing a pullback. “ #Solana could potentially have completed the Pullback. $SOL has fallen onto a Supporting Confluence, which comprises of an Ascending Trendline and a horizontal level from a previous top. Early signs of price rejection and rebound have also been observed at the level, giving more confidence in completing the pullback.” Altcoins Records Significant Growth The market correction led to altcoin declines, wiping out gains recorded in November. The outcome of the US elections saw traders pitch a possible altcoin season at the start of 2025. Capital outflows from Bitcoin will characterize an altcoin season as compared to other crypto assets. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum rose 2%, while XRP regained 4% after sharp declines. Cardano and Tron increased 1%, respectively, while meme coins picked up slightly higher gains as traction builds in the ecosystem.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-26 07:50:44

38131375,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398198,1735199956,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Crypto Scam Alert: Pudgy Penguins NFT Users Targeted by Google Ad Network Phishing,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-scam-alert-pudgy-penguins-nft-users-targeted-by-google-ad-network-phishing/,"The post Crypto Scam Alert: Pudgy Penguins NFT Users Targeted by Google Ad Network Phishing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News An elaborate scam has been detected, where attackers are now utilizing ad networks to perpetrate phishing attacks affecting the users of the Pudgy Penguins NFT project. According to ScamSniffer , the attack was uncovered after a user complained of being led to a fake Pudgy Penguins site through a Singapore news site. Subsequent research showed that this case is part of a malicious advertising campaign aimed at deceiving Web3 wallet users. The Attack Mechanism That Is Quite Sophisticated The high novelty of the campaign is that the Google Ad Network is being used to spread phishing messages. These ads run unpleasant scripts stored in the Adloox tracking domain with the extension .com. In its current form, the code incorporated in the ads searches the users’ browsers for Web3 wallets. If a wallet is found, the user gets transferred to a fake Pudgy Penguins site – pudqypenguin[.]com – which is created only to capture wallet credentials. Although at this moment, it looks like the creators of this campaign focus on Pudgy Penguins NFT users, it is indicated that the same approach can be used against any other Web3 project. This is why the attack remains worrisome to the general crypto world given the flexibility it promises to attackers. The attack also reveals that sites using Prebid.js , a header bidding application programming interface library, may be vulnerable . When these sites use the Adloox analytics module, they run the risk of transmitting scripts in the ads to the user, a clear sign of malware existence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Joins SBI VC Trade to Secure DMM Bitcoin Users Post-Hack , Steps Toward Mitigation As a result of this event, calls for users to be cautious in their interaction with Web3 interfaces have rapidly intensified. To avoid or reduce interaction with such threats, it is suggested to install ad blockers, open cryptocurrency-related sites, and use associated wallets in another browser. Be extremely cautious when entering any wallet directly, and check the URL first. ScamSniffer is another tool that can be used to detect and prevent phishing instances. After the campaign was exposed, the security researcher ZachXBT was very active in notifying Adloox about the problem. The latest Adloox CDN JavaScript files containing the malicious code were removed preventing more harm to users. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Tron Network executive has driven several reactions from the community due to on-chain digital asset movements and partnerships to drive wider adoption. Ethereum continues sideways movement after its price correction alongside Bitcoin. Justin Sun Stress Long-term ETH Holdings In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Justin Sun quelled concerns about offloading part of his Ethereum holdings. Crypto enthusiasts flagged large amounts of ETH flowing from Sun’s wallet to HTX. Fund transfers included assets from Lido Finance and EtherFi, increasing the sale rumours. However, Sun noted that it wasn’t a sale but merely a transfer between wallets. Generally, transfers from other custodians to exchanges are characterized as potential sales due to the ease of transactions, while movements to other custodians signify long-term holdings. The transfer to HTX sparked these concerns, mounting the shift in sentiments. The Tron executive remains bullish on the second-largest cryptocurrency with previous asset movements. However, Sun has moved 108,919 ETH to HTX after the November polls. These inflows came from the price jump that followed Donald Trump’s victory. Bitcoin hit new highs above 90K, driving up other crypto assets. Although Ethereum didn’t hit an all-time high, the largest altcoin attracted huge inflows, taking the price above $4K. This led to some traders recouping gains as the wider market’s profit-taking surged. On the other hand, some traders want mega bullish on the asset, tipping a price surge above $5K to end the year. “ The rumors circulating online about us liquidating ETH are false. This is simply a transfer of ETH between our different wallets. We remain long-term bullish on the Ethereum ecosystem,” Justin Sun tweeted. What’s Next For ETH Price? The last few days have been bearish for ETH prices and other crypto assets. Total liquidation topped $2 billion, sparking doubts over more peaks in the bull cycle. Despite negative trading, hourly trading shows a resurgence of positive signals as many metrics remain green. Ethereum has posted slight gains in the last 24 hours, while other top altcoins have pulled larger numbers. A major reason for the drive in ETH remains institutional investor activities taking funds to a string of weekly inflows. Altcoin traders are still warned about a patch of sideways trading before a bull swing.",Cryptocurrency|News|Justin Sun|Tron News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-26 07:59:19

Zeberg tells his 171,400 followers on the social media platform X that Solana ( SOL ) may be about to surge after a retracement. The analyst uses the Elliott Wave theory to forecast a massive run for Solana. The theory states that an asset tends to witness a five-wave rally with wave three being the longest and the strongest move up. “Altseason has begun and is now about to move into its most explosive phase. Solana has been leading after a strong wave two pullback. It should now begin its most powerful move up towards its final target.” Solana is trading at $196 at time of writing, down 5.5% in the last seven days. Zeberg also believes altcoins will now start outperforming Bitcoin ( BTC ) during this phase of the market cycle. “Wave three in alts now beginning. Hold on!” The analyst predicts Bitcoin will head higher in the short term as 2025 kicks off. “BTC update! Just touched down on daily 50-day simple moving average. Still see this as a potential wave two in a rising wedge. It is my working hypothesis. We should see a nice rally into early January!” Bitcoin is trading for $98,871 at time of writing, flat on the day.

Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Donates 10 Million THB According to an official post by Thailand’s Khao Kheow Open Zoo on December 26, Vitalik Buterin has joined the Wildlife Sponsorship Program and adopted famous pygmy hippo Moo Deng. “I am delighted to accept your invitation to be Moo Deng’s adoptive father while she grows up, and to donate the zoo in her name no less than 10,000,000 THB.” Ethereum co-founder donated 10,000,000 Thai baht to support Moo Deng and her family at the zoo. This came as a support for the Khao Kheow Open Zoo Wildlife Adoption Project. The layout plan shows a total build-up area of 1,600 square meters. As per the letter by Vitalik Buterin, the donation will be made in two installments. The first donation will be completed today, December 26. Also, the remaining 5,00,000 THB is expected to be made within a year. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s donation was a Christmas present. He has sent his ETH and even meme coins he received to charity. Recently, he appreciated meme coins that donate portions of their supply directly to charity, while also suggesting a DAO or directly engaging with charity. MOODENG Price Soars 70% MOODENG price jumped over 70% in the past 24 hours but pared earlier gains.

Key Indicators Point Upwards",https://zycrypto.com/can-ethereum-reclaim-4000-key-indicators-point-upwards/,"Ethereum (ETH) price has dropped below multiple resistance following increased sell pressures. ETH price drop is linked to wider crypto outflows in the same time frame after Bitcoin slumped below the $100K mark. At press time, ETH trades at $3,392, a 1% gain in the last 24 hours and a huge 14% weekly decline. The drop below $3,500 sparked outflows and negative reactions from the community. However, this led to new trade positions and speculations among traders with few days to 2025. This month, Ethereum bulls market $5,000 as a price to end the year; while this looked high, a slight recovery can propel the asset in the coming days. Analyst Flags Bullish ETH Metrics Despite sell pressures, a new CryptoQuant report shows several green zone metrics for Ethereum. The asset’s funding rates are averagely positive. This becomes crucial to know the long-term sentiment in the ecosystem. Present funding rates show that the long position remains dominant on average. An extreme funding rate can spark huge liquidations in anticipation of future sell pressures. Secondly, Ethereum’s institutional fund holdings have grown in recent weeks. The move away from the narrative has ignited whales to make key accumulations, tipping a steady market inflow. Last week, ETH products bagged $51.3 million in inflows, with yearly figures soaring to $4.5 billion. Most consecutive institutional flows were on the back of its staking feature and projected altcoin rally. “ …the Korea Premium Index for Ethereum, which measures the price gap between South Korean exchanges and those in other regions, has not only turned positive but is also showing a substantial premium. This shift highlights the Korean market’s growing interest in Ethereum and bodes well for overall market sentiment,” the analysts added. Furthermore, Ethereum’s Estimated Leverage Ratio is still at its peak, signifying a further price jump despite the fact that it leaves room for risks. The metric shows institutional investors’ propensity to high leverage in the derivatives market. These factors have propelled speculations for a bull swing around the ecosystem. Similarly, a bull run for Bitcoin in January will lead to the altcoin season, a cycle marked by fund flows to Ethereum and other assets. While these factors point north, the asset has recorded sharp outflows in the last two days as bears grip the market. Total liquidations have topped $2 billion since the last dip.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-26 08:08:03

Has the Santa Rally begun?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/stocks-crypto-gains-santa-rally/,"The Santa Rally could have already started, and this year, it’s packing a punch. Every trader worth their salt knows about the magic week that starts on Christmas Eve and stretches to New Year’s Eve. It’s a golden time for the S&P 500, with an average return of 1.3%—a track record that’s hard to argue with. Monday alone saw the index jump by 1.1%, cruising back above the 6,000 mark. History has spoken, and it’s clear: December loves a good rally. Since 2009, only three years—2015, 2016, and 2023—failed to deliver gains during this festive window. Data from the Carson Group shows the rally often comes alive later in the month. And if you zoom out to December 15–31, the S&P 500 has posted a median return of 1.4% since 1950. The odds of back-to-back losses during this stretch are slim, happening only twice in the last 74 years. If the index pulls off another gain, it’ll keep its record of finishing this period higher 80% of the time intact. Equity inflows, options frenzy, and market optimism This year, markets are buzzing with more than just seasonal cheer. Over the past nine weeks, U.S. equity ETFs have sucked in $186 billion—more than twice the average inflow from the first half of 2024. It’s not just about numbers; it’s about appetite. Investors are going all-in, chasing record-high trading volumes . Daily options trading now averages 48 million contracts, with half of those being zero-day-to-expiration (0DTE) options. Last Friday was wild. A record $6.6 trillion worth of options contracts expired, fueling even more trading activity. Election years add an extra kick to the mix. Historically, the S&P 500 climbs an average of 3.7% between Election Day and year-end, finishing higher 67% of the time. This year? It’s already up 4.5% since November 5, blowing past that average and setting the stage for a bigger finale. Meanwhile, the S&P Risk Appetite Index is living its best life. It jumped another two points this month, hitting 41%—its highest level since April 2021. This is a massive surge from where it stood in August, up by a staggering 70% points. If sentiment were a stock, it’d be mooning right now. Crypto starts a comeback Crypto markets are riding the wave too. Bitcoin edged up 0.32% to $98,747 on Thursday, riding on news that MicroStrategy plans to issue more shares to buy even more Bitcoin. The company has been on a buying spree, adding $561 million worth of Bitcoin last week alone. That was the seventh straight week of accumulation. The rest of the crypto gang isn’t sitting idle. Ether , Solana, and even Dogecoin rebounded from midweek losses, riding on Bitcoin’s coattails. But traders are wary of what’s coming. Friday will see a record $43 billion in open interest expire on Deribit, including $13.95 billion in Bitcoin options and $3.77 billion in Ether options. That’s a lot of money on the line, and some are preparing for turbulence as market makers adjust their positions. Though many analysts think Bitcoin might reclaim $100k before January 1st.

For weeks, people have been talking about this laid-back anthropomorphic dog. However, its popularity also brought multiple controversies. One of which is the plagiarism claims by netizens, which tanked the CHILLGUY price by around 14% within a day. CHILLGUY Meme Coin Might Be Plagiarised From Thailand Multiple reports witnessed the Just a Chill Guy meme coin entering social media in October 2023, where Philip Banks claimed to be its creator. However, Philip Banks hated the idea of using his artwork in brand promotions and meme crypto development, leading to him posting a legal threat on X . However, a recent Reddit post revealed new information on the matter, creating a plagiarism controversy. A Reddit user shared an image of a booklet, which raised the suspicion that the meme might be plagiarised from a Thailand booklet. Instead of the CHILLGUY, the booklet called it RELAX BOY, whose face is swapped with the Dog in the CHILLGUY meme coin. Interestingly, the timeline for this booklet publication is a little confusing. A few users added that it is six years old, while others added that it is eight years old. However, there is not enough information about this booklet, and it lacks supporting documents. Interestingly, people suspect the usage of AI technology to create this fake reference. Regardless, investors also doubt this is an attempt to pump the hype around the CHILLGUY meme coin to boost its performance. CHILLGUY Price Dropped 14% But Will Recover If Amid this ‘Just A Chill Guy’ controversy, the CHILLGUY price today dropped 14% and currently trades at $0.1792. With that, its market capitalization has also declined to $179.18M, but there is a 6% surge in trading volume, indicating increased investor interaction. Although the controversy is mere, strong selling pressure has surrounded the token, fueling a downtrend. According to the TradingView technical charts, the CHILLGUY meme coin is in a strong selling zone, where the moving averages on all timeframes and MACD confirm the current downtrend. Moreover, the RSI is neutral, which indicates the continuity of current trends, but it is also near an oversold region. If the token entered the oversold territory, a trend reversal could happen, generating significant buying pressure on the token and aiding in the CHILLGUY price recovery. A few other technical indicators also hint at the same, but only if the buyer entered the market. What’s In There For You? The demand for Solana meme coins is quite high this year. Creators actively launched thousands of cryptos on the Solana network. It includes the ‘Just a Chill Guy” meme coin, which is under a plagiarism controversy, as people claim the meme originated from a 6-8 year-old Thailand booklet character RELAX BOY. However, the lack of proof creates suspicion, leading people to claim that this is to boost the CHILLGUY Price. With that, the CHILLGUY meme coin has entered a downtrend, losing 14% of its value over the last 24 hours, making it a buying opportunity. However, technical analysis indicates a further downtrend unless the buying pressure builds up and pulls the token upward. Regardless, the token is in a long downtrend, as it has moved 74% from its ATH of $0.667, set a month ago. As a result, careful and strategic planning is mandatory before making investment commitments.
