It’s now up an impressive 13% from the multi-week lows it recently hit in the $175 area, but still has a long way to go before it retests its recent highs in the $260s. Solana back to $200 Me and my buddies with a combined total of $17.50 in our wallet: pic.twitter.com/sbaDr7BhMk — Kakashi (@kkashi_yt) December 25, 2024 Indeed, the bulls shouldn’t get overly excited about the rebound just yet. Chart analysis suggests the Solana price remains stuck in a downtrend and remains substantial in both its 21 and 50DMAs. A meaningful break above $220 would be required to confirm an end to the bearish trend. The Fed’s recent hawkish policy shift (towards signaling only two rate cuts in 2025) knocked confidence in risk assets last week. Will that keep the Solana price in a bearish trend? Probably not. Here’s why a recovery back towards its 2024 highs and beyond is likely in early 2025. Solana Price Set to Retest $260 Soon, Here’s Why The Fed won’t be cutting interest rates as much in 2025, which is, on margin, a negative for risk assets. But there are too many other fundamentals to be bullish on right now to get overly worried about this. Firstly, the US economy continues to perform very well. Assuming that continues, this should underpin risk assets (like US stocks) moving forward, a tailwind for crypto. But much more important for crypto is the imminent arrival of the pro-crypto Trump administration and a new pro-crypto US Congress. The US crypto industry is on the cusp of entering into a new golden age, and this should be a boon for all major crypto assets as adoption accelerates. With most major cryptos also still yet to enter the most explosive phase of their bull markets, the Solana price could soon enter lift-off. And a break above the aforementioned downtrend could be the trigger. The blockchain’s on-chain fundamentals are looking very healthy, with trading and transaction volumes and TVL in strong uptrends, per DeFi Llama . Solana’s market cap was last around $94 billion, which is under 25% of Ethereum’s . Its unlikely to overtake Ethereum this cycle, given ETH will also likely see significant expansion. But it wouldn’t be unreasonable to see the Solana price 4-5x from current levels and match Ethereum’s current market cap. With the price still down 25% from its November peaks, Solana is a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now .

To read full editions, subscribe . What better way to celebrate the season than by diving into the holly-jolly madness of holiday memecoins? Pump.fun has been brimming with festive chaos as degens deck the chain with memes and mayhem, so we thought we’d take a moment to unwrap a few of the highlights. First up, the Santas. Purple is the color of the moment, and Santa is apparently taking it in stride. Santa Paws (yes, a cat) appears to be attempting to claw its way to a comeback, while Santa Is Real and Santa Isn’t Real duke it out for festive dominance. Santa wif Hat, meanwhile, is rocking an alarming variety of headgear, from classic red to…let’s just call it “experimental.” And what’s this? Could it be a brigade of naked Santa variants storming the chain, ranging from cheeky to full-on yuletide nightmare fuel ? Aw thanks, frens…you really shouldn’t have. New holidays are making their debuts too. Ever heard of Rizzmas ? Hawktuahnukkah ? Chrismahanukwanzaka ? Me neither, and yet here we are. Degens have made their wish lists loud and clear with aspirational coins like “All I Want for Xmas is (1000X)” and “AllIWANTforXmasIsAMillionBucks.” Ho ho hodl. Oh, and the snowmen…my goodness, the snowmen. They’ve outdone themselves. Frosty the Dough Man — because nothing says “the season of giving” like hoarding bags of cash — is joined by the very swol Abdominal Snowman (you read that right), an alarmingly handsome-Squidward-esque Mewing Snowman, and the ever popular extra thicc Gyatt Snowman, among many , many others . It only gets weirder. There are memecoins featuring homicidal Christmas trees, an unfortunate P. Diddy made of gingerbread, Biden and Trump (both dressed as Santa) kissing under the mistletoe, and a truly inexplicable Jesus made of shrimp (called Shresus, obviously). And then there’s the Grinch. Solana devs can’t get enough of Dr. Seuss’ iconic green grouch. Grinch Mona Lisa? Check . Super Saiyan Grinch? Why not ? Grinch Hawktuah? Sure . If it’s a meme, it’s minting. Finally, if the cold weather is keeping you from touching grass, don’t worry — you can always Touch Snow . From all of us at Lightspeed: Happy holidays, Solana fam!

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 21:34:00

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing five potentially game-changing altcoins for December and January. Table of Contents XYZverse: A new altcoin with 100x potential Ethereum PEPE Shiba Inu Ethena Conclusion As Bitcoin surges beyond the $100,000 milestone, a wave of opportunity sweeps across the crypto landscape. Altcoins are breaking new ground with record highs, and the resurgence of meme tokens could be imminent. Unveiling five altcoins that might be the key to staying ahead in December and January. XYZverse: A new altcoin with 100x potential XYZverse is the world’s first meme coin tailored for sports enthusiasts. Whether a football fanatic, basketball devotee, MMA fan, or gaming enthusiast, XYZverse creates a dynamic ecosystem where profits meet passion. Its ambitious roadmap aims to dominate the meme coin arena, outpacing competitors like Pepe and Shiba Inu. Starting at $0.0001, XYZ has already reached Stage 9 of its presale at $0.001333, and it’s targeting a listing price of $0.1 — a potential 100x gain at current prices. With the presale still open, investors have an opportunity to join the race before the token hits major exchanges. Why XYZverse is December/January powerhouse: Massive profit potential: With a roadmap targeting a 10,000x return, XYZ combines meme coin hype with the massive appeal of sports. Early mover advantage: Investors in the current presale stage are positioning themselves for exponential gains as the project gains momentum. Broad market appeal: By uniting sports and memes, XYZverse will attract a diverse audience, from crypto degens to dedicated sports fans. As the crypto market accelerates and altcoins break new records, XYZverse emerges as a potential game-changer. Its unique value proposition and growth potential make it one of the most exciting altcoins to watch this season. Interested investors can get XYZ via presale and be part of the next crypto championship . You might also like: Altcoins under $1 that could bring big gains this holiday period Ethereum Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has transformed the digital landscape with smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum’s advancements make it a prominent player in the blockchain industry. The growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and its diverse applications underpin its strong position. While market trends fluctuate, Ethereum’s technology and potential keep it at the heart of discussions about crypto’s next steps. PEPE PEPE is a meme coin on Ethereum, serving as a tribute to Pepe the Frog, an internet meme by Matt Furie. PEPE aims to ride the popularity of meme coins like Dogecoin. With no taxes and a simple, straightforward approach, it’s attracting attention for keeping things pure and fun as a meme coin. PEPE’s value skyrocketed in 2023, pushing its market cap to $1.6 billion at one point. Whether it will reach new heights in the current market cycle remains to be seen, but its momentum and community support make it an interesting player to watch. You might also like: Polygon meme coin to overtake PEPE and SHIB in the bull run Shiba Inu Shiba Inu began as a playful nod to Dogecoin but has grown into something more. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB’s place on Ethereum means it can do more. It has launched ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade tokens. Shiba Inu also plans to introduce an NFT platform and a DAO where holders will help make decisions. This shows SHIB’s potential to be more than just a meme coin. In today’s market, investors look for coins that offer real value, and SHIB’s development could make it appealing. While many meme coins come and go, Shiba Inu is building tools and a community that could last. Ethena Ethena aims to be a stable, crypto-native dollar that doesn’t rely on traditional banks. This means ENA can be used without worrying about the banking system. Ethena also brings the Internet Bond, a global savings tool in dollars, accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This bond offers a way to save money and earn interest without needing a bank. In today’s market, where many seek stable and accessible financial options, ENA stands out. The idea of a stablecoin that’s not tied to traditional banks is gaining attention, especially after recent banking uncertainties. By providing both a crypto-native dollar and a global savings instrument, Ethena is positioning ENA to meet the needs of users looking for security and growth in the crypto space. Conclusion While ETH, PEPE, SHIB, and ENA are promising, XYZ stands out as the first all-sport meme coin for fans aiming for massive growth in a community-driven ecosystem.

One such standout in the world of online gambling is Starlight Princess , a slot game developed by Pragmatic Play. This celestial-themed game offers an engaging experience for players who enjoy vibrant graphics and rewarding mechanics. For those curious about diving into the adventure, the Starlight Princess demo oyna option provides a chance to explore the game’s features without financial commitment. In this review, we’ll delve into the unique features, gameplay, and rewards of Starlight Princess while highlighting why it’s a favorite among gambling enthusiasts. We’ll also touch upon how the game fits within the evolving landscape of blockchain and crypto gaming. Starlight Princess: Overview and Theme Starlight Princess is a visually stunning slot game that transports players to a mystical, sky-high kingdom ruled by an enchanting princess. The game’s anime-inspired graphics, vivid colors, and magical soundtrack set it apart from traditional slot games. With a unique cascading reels feature, every spin is filled with the potential for big wins. The Starlight Princess demo oyna feature lets players experience the game’s rich visuals and mechanics without wagering real money. This demo is an excellent way for beginners and seasoned players alike to get familiar with its rules, payout potential, and bonus features. By exploring the demo, players can strategize and decide how to approach the game when they switch to real-money mode. Gameplay Mechanics and Features Starlight Princess offers a fresh take on the traditional slot format, featuring a 6×5 reel setup and a pay-anywhere mechanic. Unlike games where symbols must align on specific paylines, Starlight Princess rewards players for landing clusters of identical symbols anywhere on the grid. Key Features of Starlight Princess: Tumble Feature : Winning symbols disappear after a spin, allowing new symbols to cascade into the grid. This increases the chance of consecutive wins from a single spin, a mechanic that adds excitement and boosts payouts. Multiplier Symbols : The game includes multiplier symbols with values ranging from 2x to 500x. These multipliers can significantly amplify winnings, especially during the Free Spins round. Free Spins Bonus Round : Landing at least four scatter symbols triggers the Free Spins feature, where players are awarded 15 spins. During this round, multipliers accumulate, offering the potential for massive payouts. Buy Free Spins Option : For players eager to jump into the action, the game allows purchasing the Free Spins feature for a set price, bypassing the need to wait for scatter symbols. Starlight Princess and Blockchain Gambling As the gambling industry increasingly incorporates blockchain technology, games like Starlight Princess align well with the expectations of tech-savvy players. Blockchain casinos provide transparency, provably fair gaming, and secure transactions through cryptocurrencies, creating a seamless and trustworthy experience. Here’s how Starlight Princess fits into the blockchain gambling ecosystem: Crypto Integration : Many platforms offering Starlight Princess accept cryptocurrencies, enabling players to enjoy the game with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital assets. Provably Fair Gaming : By leveraging blockchain’s transparent algorithms, casinos can ensure that outcomes in games like Starlight Princess are genuinely random and fair. Decentralized Casinos : Blockchain-powered casinos allow players to maintain greater anonymity and control over their funds, making games like Starlight Princess more accessible to a global audience. Pragmatic Play: The Creator Behind Starlight Princess Pragmatic Play is a leading provider in the online gambling industry, known for its innovative slot games that combine engaging themes with advanced mechanics. The company consistently delivers high-quality titles that cater to a wide range of players. Why Pragmatic Play Stands Out: Diverse Game Portfolio : Beyond Starlight Princess, Pragmatic Play has developed numerous slots, table games, and live casino products, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Player-Centric Design : Each game is designed to offer an intuitive and enjoyable experience, whether played on desktop or mobile devices. Fairness and Security : Pragmatic Play games are rigorously tested for fairness, making them a reliable choice for players. Why Players Love Starlight Princess Starlight Princess appeals to players for several reasons: Engaging Visuals and Theme : The anime-style design and magical atmosphere create an immersive gaming experience. Rewarding Features : The tumble mechanic and multipliers keep the gameplay dynamic and lucrative. Demo Mode : The Starlight Princess demo oyna feature provides a risk-free way to enjoy the game and learn its mechanics. Compatibility with Crypto Gambling : The game’s availability on blockchain casinos makes it a go-to choice for crypto enthusiasts. Tips for Playing Starlight Princess While luck plays a significant role in slot games, here are some tips to enhance your experience: Start with the Demo : Use the Starlight Princess demo oyna feature to familiarize yourself with the gameplay and mechanics. Set a Budget : Determine a budget for real-money play and stick to it to ensure responsible gambling. Take Advantage of Bonuses : Look for casinos offering promotions, such as free spins or deposit bonuses, to extend your gameplay. Understand the Features : Learn how multipliers and the Free Spins round work to maximize your winnings. Final Thoughts Starlight Princess is more than just a slot game—it’s a captivating adventure that combines stunning visuals, rewarding gameplay, and innovative features. Its alignment with the trends in blockchain gambling makes it a must-try for modern players seeking a transparent and engaging experience. For those curious about exploring the enchanting world of Starlight Princess, the Starlight Princess demo oyna option is an excellent starting point. It’s a chance to enjoy the game’s features and prepare for the excitement of real-money play on trusted platforms like 7Slots Casino.

While financial legends like Warren Buffett turned market crashes into windfalls, today’s savvy investors are looking to the world of meme coins to achieve similar success. The crypto landscape is abuzz, with Popcat (POPCAT) struggling to claw back from a massive price drop and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) turning heads with its AI-powered promotion. But the real excitement? It’s all about BTFD Coin’s presale , which has already surged past $4.5 million in funds raised, offering a jaw-dropping 50% festive discount for early investors. This limited-time deal, featuring the bonus code “ BIG50 ,” lets buyers snag $BTFD at just $0.000064—a steal when you consider its post-presale listing price of $0.0006. With a live P2E game, staking rewards, and a thriving community, BTFD Coin is set to redefine the meme coin space. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin stands out among the top meme coin presales to buy today and explore the latest updates on Popcat and Goatseus Maximus. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Festive Bull Run is Here Imagine a world where every market dip is a golden opportunity. This philosophy is at the heart of BTFD Coin, a meme coin inspired by the “Buy The Dip” mantra. With its P2E game beta now live and staking rewards already available, BTFD Coin is poised to redefine what it means to invest in meme coins. The BTFD presale has been nothing short of spectacular. In just its 12th stage, it’s sold over 59 billion tokens to more than 6,600 holders, raising a staggering $4.5 million. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, the current price is $0.000064—a massive 837.5% return for early investors. Here’s the kicker: with the festive 50% discount, investors can grab BTFD coins at a bargain using the code “ BIG50 .” Analysts predict even greater gains when the coin lists at $0.0006 after January 5, 2025. For instance, an investment of $6,500 at the discounted price yields over 101 million BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006, that’s a potential return of over $60,000—a nearly 9x gain! This is why investors are flocking to BTFD’s presale. What sets BTFD apart is its utility-focused ecosystem. The P2E game, though in beta, is already generating buzz for its immersive gameplay. Players can join the Bulls Squad and engage in a gamified crypto experience. Though no rewards are earned during the beta, this is just the beginning of what promises to be a lucrative gaming journey. Add to this the 90% APY staking rewards introduced in Stage 3, and it’s clear that BTFD is more than just hype. Joining the presale is simple. Connect your wallet (like MetaMask or Trust Wallet) on the BTFD presale page , input the code “ BIG50 ,” and enjoy the discounted price. Don’t miss the referral programme—top referrers get 10% of the raised amount in tokens at month’s end. With a maximum supply of 173 billion tokens, BTFD is built on Ethereum’s robust blockchain, ensuring security, scalability, and accessibility for all investors. The BTFD presale isn’t just a chance to buy into a coin; it’s an invitation to join a community driven by resilience and strategic thinking. The world’s financial history—like the 1973 oil shock—has shown that buying during downturns often leads to monumental gains. BTFD embraces this ethos, giving every investor a shot at turning market chaos into personal triumph. Popcat (POPCAT): Bouncing Back from the Meme Market Dip Popcat—a coin inspired by the viral internet meme—has had a rollercoaster year. After reaching an all-time high of $2.06 in November 2024, the token faced a brutal 65% price decline over the last 30 days. This dip left many questioning its long-term viability. However, all is not lost for POPCAT. Currently priced at $0.825, Popcat has found support at the $1 mark, sparking renewed optimism among traders. Analysts note that maintaining this support could trigger a rally, with potential resistance levels offering significant upside. The coin’s developers have also been active in stabilising its community, emphasising its integration within the Solana blockchain for fast and cost-effective transactions. Popcat’s story highlights the unpredictable nature of meme coins. It serves as a reminder that while these investments carry high risk, they also offer opportunities for those who can navigate their volatility. For those who believe in Popcat’s potential, this could be an ideal time to enter the market at a discount. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): AI Meets Meme Coin Mania Goatseus Maximus has quickly become a topic of fascination in the meme coin world, thanks in large part to its association with Truth Terminal—an AI created by New Zealand developer Andy Ayrey. The AI’s promotional prowess has catapulted GOAT into the spotlight, making it a unique player in the crypto space. Despite reaching an all-time high of $1.35 in November 2024, GOAT’s price has since dropped to $0.49. This decline reflects the volatility typical of meme coins but hasn’t dampened the enthusiasm of its community.

Viewing the dip as a chance for a low market entry, these whales now purchase Dogecoin in large volumes , with the latest transactions recording a 270 million buy. Dogecoin Whales Scoop Up 270 Million DOGE The recent decline in the Dogecoin price has prompted large-scale investors, typically called “whales,” to accumulate more tokens. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez disclosed in an X (formerly Twitter) post on Tuesday that Dogecoin whales have bought a whopping 270 million DOGE tokens in the last five days. This massive 270 million DOGE buy is part of a broader accumulation trend noticed across the meme coin’s network. Since November, Martinez has recorded whales buying hundreds of millions of DOGE during the downtrend. On December 21, the analyst revealed that Dogecoin whales had purchased 250 million DOGE during the recent market dip . This bold move was made as investors saw DOGE’s decline as a favorable entry point, a behavior often associated with more prominent players who buy tokens at a lower price in hopes of long-term gains. The recent DOGE buying spree by whales could indicate strong confidence in the Coin’s future. Martinez has also expressed optimism in the meme coin’s price prospects, highlighting in a previous X post that DOGE could experience another parabolic rally to a $20 ATH. While bullish sentiment for DOGE’s price remains strong , Dogecoin whales are taking advantage of the current market conditions and declining prices to increase their holdings and prepare for a potential rally. With the Dogecoin price currently trading at $0.33, the recent 270 million DOGE buy is approximately valued at $89 million. Pattern Repetition Could See DOGE Price Reaching $5 Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade has presented a chart illustrating a recurring historical trend pattern in the Dogecoin price movement. The analyst suggests that a repetition of this historical trend could trigger a parabolic rally for Dogecoin . The red curved lines in the chart highlight DOGE’s rounded consolidation phases in different cycles, while the green ascending lines underscore a steady bullish trend. Each consolidation period in the chart has led to a significant rally, where Dogecoin’s price explodes at the end of the trend. Based on the recurrent historical pattern, DOGE is seemingly exiting its recent consolidation phase , indicating that a potential breakout may be on the horizon. Trader Tardigrade has predicted that the breakout could trigger a price increase as high as $5, marking new all-time highs for DOGE . At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.33, reflecting a 3.5% increase in the last 24 hours. A surge to $5 would require the meme coin to record a staggering 1,415% surge from its current price.",Altcoin News|Dogecoin|Analyst|crypto|Crypto Analyst|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|FLOKI|ONDO|BONK|SEI|JUP|BSV|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2024-12-25 22:00:33

Table of Contents XYZ: Taking the spotlight with 16,900% growth forecast XRP Cardano Conclusion A new presale token from Polygon is drawing attention from investors who once favored XRP and Cardano (ADA). Predictions for this token suggest gains as high as 16,900%, stirring excitement in the cryptocurrency market. XYZ: Taking the spotlight with 16,900% growth forecast XYZ — the first-ever all-sports meme coin — is emerging as a must-watch contender. Combining the energy of meme culture with the passion of sports fans, XYZ is blazing its trail in the crypto space with a forecasted 16,900% surge, potentially rivaling the hype around XRP and Cardano. Why XYZ is capturing investor interest: A new era in meme coins XYZ aims to bring a unique blend of sports, entertainment, and decentralized finance to the table. Its XYZVerse ecosystem will merge prediction markets, sports betting, and interactive dApps, creating a playground for millions of gamblers and crypto enthusiasts alike. Undervalued yet poised for massive growth Currently in its presale phase, XYZ is a hidden gem for early investors. By its Token Generation Event (TGE), XYZ is projected to outperform past meme coin sensations like BOME and WIF. Its roadmap also includes CEX/DEX listings, entertainment platforms, and token burns, ensuring a robust ecosystem and sustained price growth. Community-driven success Unlike many presale tokens, XYZ empowers its community.

Intrigued investors can join the XYZ presale for the potential 16,900% opportunity. XRP XRP is a digital currency aiming to make money transfer faster. It’s built on the XRP Ledger — a decentralized system that allows for swift, low-cost, and secure transactions. XRP doesn’t require a bank account for settlements, making it accessible to people everywhere. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and efficiency compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be slower and more expensive to use. XRP’s ability to facilitate seamless payment transfers across different currencies aligns well with the growing demand for quick and borderless transactions. As financial systems evolve, XRP’s technology positions it as a potential key player. Its focus on real-world application and partnerships in the banking sector also make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Cardano Cardano is a layer-1 blockchain that allows developers to build decentralized finance apps, create new crypto tokens, and develop games. Similar to Ethereum’s ETH, ADA can be used to store value, make payments, and earn rewards through staking on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake system, which is much more energy-efficient than the traditional proof-of-work model used by Bitcoin. Additionally, Cardano’s blockchain is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions quickly — potentially up to a million per second. In the current market, where sustainability and scalability are highly valued, ADA presents an attractive option. As Ethereum faces challenges with high fees and scaling, Cardano’s approach might give it an edge. Conclusion XRP and ADA remain strong options, but XYZ could dominate the 2024 bull run.

Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov spoke about alternatives to the US dollar for international trade during an interview on Russia-24 on Dec. 25. Siluanov highlighted that the government has authorized foreign trade transactions using DFAs and Bitcoin, adding that such methods are already in practice and set for expansion. “We Can Use Mined Bitcoin” Siluanov emphasized that adopting DFAs in foreign trade is a logical step under current circumstances, enabling the use of modern infrastructure. He described this approach as an innovation in global settlement systems, stating, “That is the future.” Russia is leveraging its experimental legal framework, effective since September 2024, to integrate DFAs — including Bitcoin — into international trade. Siluanov explained, “We can pay for the delivery of goods with digital financial assets. It is also possible to use Bitcoin, which we mined here in the Russian Federation, within the experimental regime.” Russia Legalizes Mining and Scales DFA Use The minister noted that Russia legalized Bitcoin mining earlier in 2024, paving the way for such transactions. He added, “We say that they need to be developed and expanded, and I am sure that next year, it will be a reality.” Siluanov Cautions Against Crypto Investment Amid Bitcoin Highs While advocating for DFA use in trade, Siluanov has warned against viewing cryptocurrency as an investment vehicle. In a speech on Nov. 6, he stated, “Some people see cryptocurrency as a source of quick money. I don’t recommend it as a means of investment.” His remarks underline the dual approach of promoting DFAs in trade while cautioning against speculative risks for individual investors.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 22:18:28

So, investors are treading very carefully. That’s why many Avalanche (AVAX) holders are switching. The same can be said for SUI. However, SUI investors are a bit more confident. Regardless, both are looking for something more stable. And this is where FX Guys ($FXG) comes in. FX Guys is a new crypto trading platform. As such, it brings massive utility to the market. So, experts are confident that it will do really well after its launch. Namely, they say that $FXG’s price will rise by at least 20x soon! >>>JOIN FXGuys HERE The Avalanche Token Price Might Fall Further Due to Sell-Offs AVAX’s price has been going up and down this whole month. Namely, AVAX’s price started off strong at the beginning of December 2024. However, a market-wide dip caused AVAX’s price to fall. Then, AVAX’s price recovered shortly after. Avalanche investors thought that the rise would continue. However, another market-wide dip proved otherwise. And due to that, AVAX’s price tumbled once again. More specifically, Avalanche’s price went below $35 on December 20, 2024. And then it rose again soon after to reach its current price of $38. This up-and-down movement is very worrying for Avalanche investors. That’s why they’re looking for something more stable. And they’ve found FX Guys! As a result, Avalanche investors are now bidding heavily on this project. As for AVAX, experts foresee its price dropping by another 20% soon. That’s because Avalanche investors are shedding their holdings to invest in more promising tokens. SUI Shows Strenght as Its Price Recovers SUI is showing massive strength right now. Unlike other altcoins, SUI is doing really well in this up-and-down market. Namely, SUI’s price has already recovered from its recent losses. Now, the SUI price stands at $4.60. Also, SUI’s charts are green in all timeframes. This just shows how resilient SUI is. However, SUI investors are still skeptical. That’s because of the current market volatility. Experts agree with them, recommending extreme caution to everyone right now. They say that SUI’s price can dip again soon due to the volatility. Per expert analysis, SUI’s price will fall by around 15% in the next couple of weeks. So, SUI investors are also looking to diversify right now. Most of them are investing in a new crypto trading platform! Of course, we’re talking about FX Guys! >>>JOIN FXGuys HERE FX Guys: The New Crypto Trading Platform Attracting Traders There are many reasons why everyone is talking about FX Guys right now.

Some claim the published image is from Thailand and was printed eight years ago, while others point to a publication in Vietnam six years ago. Overall, the controversy is creating additional social media hype around the token, where some hype up the plagiarism, while others believe the entire story is to create more FUD around the token. Reverse image search shows this came from a Vietnamese book 6 years ago The artist who claimed to have the rights to #chillguy is a fraud Send the #OGchillguy pic.twitter.com/0aODGjVgAP — DD (@onchainbookie) December 25, 2024 Previously, Chillguy was considered the original creation of cartoonist Phillip Banks. Banks himself was touchy about using the image, even intending legal action to protect his creation. Despite this, the image was widely used on TikTok and became the avatar of a whole collection of meme tokens. Up to 30 versions of CHILLGUY or similar tickers exist, spreading on Ethereum, Solana, and Base. The main version was the one affected by the discovery of what social media considers plagiarism. Is CHILLGUY still the original? Some doubted the evidence of actual plagiarism, where claims were made that the character was taken from a Vietnamese leaflet created six years ago. Skeptics did not see additional evidence and suggested the image may be AI-generated or manipulated in some way. Phillip Banks has posted an Instagram image suggesting the suspicions are unfounded and the plagiarism is based on a faked image. Banks has not communicated through X to explicitly refute the claims and rarely pays attention to the meme community. The story was appealing enough that some of the large influencer accounts repeated the message of suspected plagiarism. Others found evidence that Banks denied all claims, while the image raised red flags of being AI-generated . Others noted that the booklet is not actually years old, and may be printed after the creation of Chillguy. In fact, when showing the reverse image search, Google indexes the age of subreddits, and not the image itself, which may be more recently printed. CHILLGUY controversy produces new meme token According to the original claims of plagiarism, the booklet called the character ‘Relax Boy’. This is just the name that the meme market needed, immediately launching RELAXBOY on Solana. The token graduated to Raydium and is already in price discovery mode. RELAXBOY was created based on the plagiarism claims, going through a boom and crash just hours after creation. | Source: DexScreener RELAXBOY is just hours old and has already gone through a 700X rally, followed by a 67% crash. The new asset still has just $232K in locked liquidity, though the token is creating a social media movement. Just hours after the token’s launch, CHILLGUY whales bought in . For traders, the actual verification of the image is less important. The spreading of images and rumors on TikTok shows the short video social app may also play a big role in the meme token market. If RELAXBOY was not enough, the market also produced Just a Chill Dog (CHILLDOG) , playing on the remixed illustration hype. The new asset is just as risky as RELAXBOY, though both tokens have seen intentions of creating social media movements and rising to a higher valuation.

Amid this growing institutional adoption, the Bank of Italy has taken a notably critical stance. In its Economic and Financial Occasional Paper, it labeled Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) services – widely celebrated for their accessibility – as “crime-as-a-service.” Bank of Italy Raises Red Flag on Bitcoin P2P The Bank of Italy’s report from November 2024 highlighted the growing role of Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) services as tools for money laundering in jurisdictions with weak regulations. These services, described as “crime-as-a-service,” exploit regulatory loopholes, allowing illicit actors to obscure the origins of illegally obtained funds. The 131-year-old financial institution targeted unregulated P2P platforms and informal exchange networks, in particular, that evade traditional Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols and end up creating pathways for illegal activities. These methods enable criminals to bypass the scrutiny of centralized financial intermediaries by leveraging the pseudonymity of blockchain transactions. Regulatory Gaps The Bank of Italy’s report also highlighted the challenges posed by decentralized financial (DeFi) systems in combating money laundering. While centralized finance (CeFi) platforms can be regulated similarly to traditional financial institutions, their decentralized counterparts, on the other hand, operate without intermediaries, making oversight far more complex. The pseudonymity inherent in blockchain technology allows users to engage in transactions through unlinked addresses, effectively concealing their identities. This has sparked a debate between those who praise blockchain for its transparency and immutability and critics who highlight its potential for abuse. The report points to emerging solutions like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), which enable selective disclosure of information to mitigate illicit activities without compromising user privacy. However, these innovations, though promising, fall short of providing the continuous due diligence necessary to identify suspicious activities systematically, as per the Bank of Italy.

With its robust ecosystem and continued upgrades, the platform aims to offer significant utility and scalability, making it a foundational asset in the cryptocurrency space. Whales are drawn to Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), which has seen exponential growth and is poised for further expansion in the coming bull cycle. Accumulating Ethereum not only provides exposure to the broader crypto market but also positions investors to benefit from the increasing adoption of smart contract platforms worldwide. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu initially captured the attention of crypto whales for its explosive price movements. However, SHIB has evolved beyond its meme origins, with recent developments, such as the Shibarium Layer-2 scaling solution adding to its utility. Whales are also attracted to SHIB’s deflationary tokenomics, with regular token burns reducing supply and increasing scarcity to potentially increase price with demand. As Shiba Inu integrates further into DeFi and explores metaverse opportunities, it solidifies its potential for high upsides in the next bull run. Conclusion While ETH and SHIB remain strong choices, crypto whales are also focusing on XYZ, a meme coin uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem in the current bull run.

Investors and traders are actively exploring the top altcoins under $1 to invest in 2025. The current market sentiment appears positive as leading assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL) show signs of upside momentum. Based on technical analysis and recent whale activity, these are the top 10 altcoins under $1 to invest in for 2025. Additionally, this article will help you identify the best altcoin with the potential to generate significant returns. Cardano (ADA) ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies currently consolidating within a tight range between $0.86 and $0.97 over the past seven days. ADA is among the cryptocurrencies that could experience significant gains in the coming days if it breaks out from this narrow range. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if ADA breaks above the $0.97 mark and closes a daily candle above this level, it could potentially soar by 65%, reaching the $1.62 mark in the future. However, the altcoin may encounter resistance at the $1.24 level during its upward momentum. Hedera (HBAR) HBAR, the native token of Hedera, has been making waves amidst ongoing market uncertainty with its impressive upward momentum. Over the past three days, while major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) have struggled to gain traction, HBAR has surged by more than 40%. Source: Trading View With its recent rally, HBAR has broken out of a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern and appears to be retesting the breakout level. If it successfully retests this level, there is a strong possibility that the altcoin could soar by 200%, reaching the $0.98 mark in the future. This strong bullish price action pattern attracts traders and investors, making HBAR an ideal altcoin to consider for investment under $1 in 2025. Stellar (XLM) Following the presidential election results, Stellar’s native token, XLM, has garnered significant attention from crypto enthusiasts due to its impressive upward momentum. According to CoinMarketCap data, XLM has surged by more than 460%. However, after such a notable rally, XLM now appears to be undergoing a price correction. Source: Trading View Amid this ongoing correction, XLM has formed a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern on the daily timeframe and is currently on the verge of a breakout. Based on historical momentum, a successful breakout could propel XLM by 125%, nearing the $0.95 mark in the coming days. Tron (TRX) TRX, the native token of the Tron blockchain, has garnered attention similar to XLM with its impressive rally following the presidential election. According to data, TRX has surged by more than 165%. However, it currently appears to be undergoing a price correction, experiencing a 42% decline. Experts and analysts view this recent decline as an ideal buying opportunity. Source: Trading View Amid this price action, TRX has formed a descending triangle pattern and is on the verge of a breakout. Based on historical momentum, if the altcoin breaks out of this pattern and closes a daily candle above the $0.26 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 70%, reaching the $0.44 mark in the future. This bullish price action positions TRX as one of the top altcoins to consider under $1 in 2025, with significant rally potential. Jupiter (JUP) JUP, the native token of Jupiter, a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange and a successful project on the Solana blockchain, has been struggling over the past few days, along with other major cryptocurrencies. However, following a price decline of over 44%, JUP has reached a crucial support level where it has historically experienced upward momentum. Source: Trading View Since the beginning of 2024, JUP has tested this trendline support five times, and on each occasion, it has rallied significantly. Experts and analysts anticipate a similar rally this time. Based on price action, JUP has begun moving upward, with a strong possibility of soaring by 55% to reach the $1.40 mark in the coming days. The Graph (GRT) Amid the recent price correction, GRT, the native token of The Graph, has experienced a significant price decline of over 40%. Following this decline, GRT has reached a golden Fibonacci level while also receiving support from a strong 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and a horizontal support level at the $0.20 mark. Source: Trading View This support zone suggests an ideal buying opportunity, as long-term holders appear to be accumulating GRT at this level, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Based on recent price action, if GRT holds this support level and sustains itself above the $0.20 mark, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 60%, reaching the $0.35 level in the future. Kaspa (KAS) KAS, the native token of Kaspa, is drawing significant attention from crypto enthusiasts as tech billionaire Elon Musk reportedly shows interest in the token. Since the beginning of November 2024, KAS has been trading within a parallel channel pattern between $0.11 and $0.19. Source: Trading View Amid the recent price correction, KAS failed to break out of this channel pattern and has fallen to its lower boundary. However, the altcoin’s daily chart indicates that its price is currently consolidating. Based on recent price action, if market sentiment shifts positively, there is a strong possibility that KAS could rally by 60% to reach the $0.19 level in the coming days. Additionally, the altcoin’s daily chart suggests that KAS is an excellent choice for investment under $1 in 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular and world’s largest crypto meme coin by market cap, has been struggling over the past few days. Amid the price decline, DOGE broke below a crucial support level of $0.326 but has managed to hold this level and consolidate over the past seven days. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if DOGE sustains itself above the $0.30 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 40% to reach the $0.47 level in the future. Furthermore, it has the potential to soar by 75% if it breaks out above the $0.47 mark. Popcat (POPCAT) Popcat (POPCAT), a top Solana-based meme coin, has experienced a price decline of over 60% during the recent market drop. However, the meme coin is currently consolidating near a crucial support level at the $0.75 mark for the past seven days. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if POPCAT holds above the $0.70 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 150% to reach the $1.95 mark in the future. While this target may not be easy to achieve, POPCAT could potentially reach it in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB), the popular and second-largest crypto meme coin by market cap, is poised for upside momentum after forming a bullish price action pattern. Based on recent price action, SHIB has broken out of a consolidation zone following a successful retest of the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. Source: Trading View Following this breakout, there is a strong possibility that SHIB could rally by 75% to reach the $0.000040 mark. During this rally, the $0.000030 level may act as a hurdle for the meme coin.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 22:50:00

The tokens are set to hit the market in three transactions of 200 million, 300 million, and 500 million XRP. The clock for the three escrows will tick on the first minutes of 2025, freeing 1 billion XRP tokens in addition to the 57.2 billion currently in circulation. The January release represents 2.63% of the total 38 billion of XRP that is still locked in Ripple’s escrow accounts. To be specific, Ripple (24) address will unlock 200 and 300 million XRP that were locked in the escrow on December 1, 2024, and January 1, 2021, respectively. Then, Ripple (25) will release 500 million XRP that were locked on January 1, 2021. These will be the last transactions from Ripple (24) and (25), although there are numerous escrows held by other Ripple-controlled addresses. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which create new tokens “on the go” as a reward for miners/validators that keep the blockchain safe, Ripple pre-mined the entire supply of 100 billion XRP at the very inception of the network. In 2017, 55 billion XRP were locked in an escrow system hardcoded to release 1 billion XRP each month to ensure gradual and controlled distribution. The scheduled unlocks help Ripple fund its operations, invest in ecosystem development, and provide liquidity for its payment solutions. While the real amount of XRP that actually enters circulation every month is often lower than 1 billion due to the company re-locking a portion of tokens into a new escrow, this nevertheless creates a significant amount of selling pressure. With Ripple currently trading above the coveted $2 mark, it remains an open question whether XRP will see a proportional demand increase to sustain current price levels. Nevertheless, the promise of the nearing altcoin season leaves room for cautious optimism. VanEck experts call the start of the altcoin season As Bitcoin struggles to stay above the psychologically important $100,000 mark, VanEck experts claim that the “altcoin season” may be already in full force. The asset manager even suggested November 27 as the start day for the rise of altcoins in this cycle. For context, the term “altcoin season” refers to the periods when cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (so-called altcoins) outperform the king of crypto. The hotly anticipated altseasons historically follow after Bitcoin dominance peaks near 60%, as traders seek higher returns in alternative assets. According to VanEck analyst Matthew Sigel, the relationship between Bitcoin dominance and altcoin performance can be explained through the cyclical nature of capital flows in cryptocurrency driven by investor psychology. When new capital enters the market during Bitcoin's rise, it encourages a ”risk-on” sentiment, motivating investors to seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in altcoins. Increased appetite for risk often benefits more nascent crypto sectors, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The ”altseasons” are identified when over 60% of the top 50 altcoins by market cap, excluding the stablecoins and Bitcoin-backed assets, outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Data from Artemis’s Altcoin Season Index quoted by VanEck in a report indicates that altcoins are doing reasonably well. The index tracks how the top 50 altcoins compare to Bitcoin performance, taking on the values between 0 and 1, where 0.6 is a cutoff value that signals the start of the altcoin season. The current score of 0.64 suggests a moderate altcoin performance, a sign of a major altcoin pump still ahead. According to CoinMarketCap , the current state of the cryptocurrency market is neither altcoin season nor Bitcoin season. The platform uses a much more stringent standard for calculating the altseason index, defined as 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. With the current score of 49 sitting firmly in the middle, the altcoin rally seems like a more distant perspective than suggested by VanEck. At the same time, the index climbed as high as 82 on December 8, indicating a strong potential for a retest. Crypto analyst Ash Crypto recently made a prediction for the altcoin season to start in Q1 2025, drawing parallels between the Bitcoin performance in 2020 and 2024. In both cases, November saw strong gains in the cryptocurrency market, followed by a pullback in December. The subsequent reversal in Bitcoin dominance set the stage for the “mega altseason,” which analyst hopes to return in 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is hovering around the $99k mark. With the wave of pro-crypto policymakers brought by Trump into his administration, many experts expect Bitcoin to reach new highs in 2025. VanEck set its base price target for BTC at $180k by 2025, citing Bitcoin’s growing adoption as an institutional reserve asset, rising altcoin speculation, and powerful synergies between crypto and AI as potential catalysts in the upcoming year.",News|Altcoins|Ripple,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-25 22:53:08

Lookonchain reports that a whale suddenly created 30 new wallets to accumulate $34.1 million worth of LINK tokens from Binance. “Suspicious LINK accumulation spotted! Over the past 5 days, 30 newly created wallets have withdrawn 1.37M LINK ($34.1M) from Binance.” Source: Lookonchain/X At time of writing, Chainlink is trading at $24.04, up 34% in the last month. Earlier this week, Chainlink released Smart Value Recapture (SVR), a solution aiming to allow DeFi solutions to recapture non-toxic Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) from the leading oracle’s price feeds. “Based on real-world testing, we believe Chainlink SVR can expect to achieve a realistic value recapture rate of approximately 40% (i.e., for every $100 that would have been leaked via liquidation MEV, $40 was recaptured). While some alternative solutions have claimed to achieve a higher efficiency rate for recapturing liquidation MEV, we have not seen conclusive real-world data to showcase this. We believe that 40% is a conservative but realistic estimate—real life performance will be needed to gather actual data.” On the same day as the announcement from Chainlink, Aave , the biggest lending platform in crypto, proposed using SVR. Specifically, the proposal was about activating a pilot program of SVR oracles on Aave v3 to recapture MEV from the platform’s liquidations to return its own ecosystem. The proposal is currently awaiting questions and feedback from the community.

This Must-Watch Presale is Making Splashes in Crypto,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bitcoin-this-must-watch-presale-is-making-splashes-in-crypto/,"The cryptocurrency market has been buzzing lately with fresh developments. Bitcoin, the king of cryptos, remains in the limelight as its price dances between key moving averages. But while Bitcoin continues to hold its ground, there’s another name that’s quietly stealing the show: Qubetics ($TICS) . As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is revolutionising blockchain technology with innovations that aim to address issues Bitcoin and its contemporaries have left unresolved. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto; it’s a game-changer. From bridging blockchains to simplifying decentralised processes, Qubetics is raising the bar. And with its ongoing presale raising over $7.8 million, it’s clear that people are paying attention. Let’s explore why Qubetics and Bitcoin are among the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025 , and how they stack up against each other. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Innovation Qubetics is capturing attention for all the right reasons. Its 14th presale stage has already sold over 376 million tokens to 11,800 holders, raising an impressive $7.8 million. At $0.0377 per token, there’s a growing sense of urgency to snag $TICS before its price jumps by 10% this weekend. Crypto analysts are buzzing with excitement about Qubetics’ potential. By the presale’s end, $TICS is projected to reach $0.25, offering a return on investment of 564%. And post-presale, the numbers soar—$TICS could hit $1, providing a staggering 2,555% ROI. But it doesn’t stop there. With a $15 target after its mainnet launch, the potential ROI skyrockets to an astonishing 39,729%. Investing $100,000 at the current price could mean owning 2,652,519 tokens, which could translate to $39.7 million if the $15 milestone is achieved. QubeQode IDE: Revolutionising Real-World Applications The heart of Qubetics lies in its QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) , a powerful tool tailored for professionals, businesses, and individuals alike. Imagine a local artisan in São Paulo looking to sell handcrafted goods internationally. QubeQode IDE simplifies creating and launching a decentralised e-commerce platform, eliminating the need for tech expertise. Picture a logistics company in Mexico streamlining its supply chain using smart contracts designed through QubeQode. No middlemen, no delays—just seamless, automated transactions. Or think about a software developer in Argentina creating custom dApps for clients worldwide without needing to switch between multiple blockchains. By uniting blockchains and offering user-friendly tools, Qubetics ensures accessibility, efficiency, and trust. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Qubetics stands out for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and its real-world applications. Combine that with the excitement of its presale, and it’s easy to see why it’s among the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): The Original Crypto Titan Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of cryptocurrency, with its price currently hovering between key support and resistance levels. According to market analysts, BTC is dancing between the 21-day and 50-day simple moving averages, approximately $99,600 and $94,650, respectively. While it may not exhibit the explosive gains of younger altcoins, Bitcoin’s stability continues to make it a favourite among long-term investors. This year has seen Bitcoin reclaim its status as digital gold, with institutional interest spiking. However, regulatory headwinds and macroeconomic factors like interest rate cuts in 2025 are likely to influence its trajectory. Bitcoin’s Legacy and Use Cases Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its universality. From rural villages in Paraguay to bustling cities like Rio de Janeiro, Bitcoin is used for remittances, savings, and even everyday purchases. It’s the go-to for those who want financial freedom without the hassles of traditional banking. Bitcoin also serves as the foundation of many crypto portfolios. While it doesn’t have the bells and whistles of newer projects like Qubetics, its robustness and wide adoption make it irreplaceable. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Bitcoin’s resilience, universal appeal, and foundational role in the crypto world make it one of the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025. While its growth may not be as meteoric as altcoins, it remains a safe bet for long-term value. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics and Bitcoin are standout options for those seeking the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025. Bitcoin offers reliability and a proven track record, making it a cornerstone for any crypto portfolio. On the other hand, Qubetics is shaking up the blockchain landscape with its innovative QubeQode IDE and ambitious presale milestones. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio or ride the wave of an emerging star, now’s the time to act. Don’t let the opportunity pass you by—Qubetics and Bitcoin are here to reshape your financial future.

38117855,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322722,1735169909,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38117855.jpeg,Dogecoin Price Rallies to $0.33 – Will the Triangle Pattern Spark a Rally?,https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-rallies-to-0-33-will-the-triangle-pattern-spark-a-rally/,"The Dogecoin (DOGE) price has rallied back to $0.33 after falling as low as the $0.26s last week, and is forming a triangle pattern that could soon be the catalyst for a bullish breakout. That means that a short-term pump for the Dogecoin price back to it recent highs in the $0.48 could be on the cards in the coming days. Of course, the 21 and 50DMAs in the $0.37-38 area could offer stiff resistance, given they also coincide with some recent lows. But good vibes are likely to continue into the year’s end. Why? Well, major cryptos are tentatively recovering from a Fed-induced sell-off last week on their more hawkish than expected interest rate projections . But most major cryptos remain well below their pre-hawkish Fed meeting levels, suggesting the scope for further recovery is there. And there are a lot of tailwinds to support the crypto market right now. That’s because we are on the cusp of entering a new golden age for crypto markets in the US, but also globally. The incoming Trump administration and Congress are likely to spur a significant acceleration in the adoption of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, not least admin hopes that they establish a US strategic Bitcoin reserve. JUST IN: VanEck predicts #Bitcoin will be worth $3 million and used as a global reserve asset by 2050. pic.twitter.com/TEsvd9S34L — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) October 28, 2024 The grounds are thus fertile for the emergence of a new meme coin/alt-coin season, of which we have already seen flashes of since Trump’s emphatic election victory. Dogecoin , the oldest and still biggest meme coin, would surely lead any future meme season. That’s even more the case given that Elon Musk’ s new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) is set to be established under the Trump administration. Department of Government Efficiency pic.twitter.com/HFeHYNIkJN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 7, 2024 Musk’s new department aims to slash government fraud and waste, and will be hugely controversial and nearly constantly in the news. That all but guarantees that Dogecoin retains a leading portion of meme coin market “mind share”, guaranteeing continued market leadership. How High Will the Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Rally This Cycle? A recovery back to recent highs in the Dogecoin market is thus very likely in early 2025 as Trump returns to the White House. Bulls will be hoping for an eventual rally back to the 2021 record highs above $0.70, as well as a potential surge to $1.0 for the first time. However, might this be the end of the road for Dogecoin? Well, analysis of past Dogecoin cycles suggest the bulls need to be aiming bigger and higher, with this rally likely to far exceed where many expect. Dogecoin has been through three market cycles since its inception in 2014, and these cycles can offer clues about what could be in store for DOGE in 2025. When drawing a Fibonacci extension upwards from the prior bear market low to the prior bear market high, it can be seen that Dogecoin has always rallied well beyond the 4.236 Fibonacci level, exceeding this Fibonacci extension by over 10x during its 2021 rally. The 4.236 Fibonacci extension level from the 2022 bear market lows back to the 2021 highs suggests that Dogecoin should at least hit $3 per token this cycle. But as history has shown, Dogecoin has routinely blown well past this level. Given that context, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a $10 Dogecoin price this cycle. Of course, that would imply a multi-trillion-dollar market cap, which might be a bit much to ask. But Dogecoin could definitely 10x from current levels to reach a market cap in the $100s of billions, making it a strong candidate for best meme coin to buy now. Meme Coin Alternative With Massive Potential – Meme Index (MEMEX) For most investors, securing 10x gains is a best-case scenario. But in crypto, many degens are on the hunt for the next 100x project that will make them rich. One of the best ways to bag 100x gains is by getting into a new meme coin before it really takes off. One new meme coin that has caught the eyes of analysts at cryptonews.com is Meme Index (MEMEX) . Meme Index introduces the world’s first decentralized meme coin index, allowing investors to diversify across various meme coins through community governance. With the meme coin market cap reaching a whopping $137 billion in 2024, analysts suspect that demand for an innovative investment vehicle such as this could be very high. That’s certainly the case with Meme Index, which has already raised close to half a million dollars in MEMEX presale token sales. The project’s potential lies in its ability to offer different risk levels with indexes like Titan, Moonshot, Midcap, and Frenzy, catering to a broad investor base. Only a Chill Guy can handle the twists and turns of a Frenzy Index. pic.twitter.com/1QHv0IvF0i — Meme Index (@memecoin_index) December 17, 2024 Moreover, MEMEX holders can stake tokens for high APYs, encouraging long-term holding and potentially increasing token value. It should come as no surprise that flocks of experts have already come out to throw their support behind MEMEX . Michael Wrubel and Austin Hilton both recently hailed the project’s potential in YouTube videos to their more than 600,000 combined subscribers. Meme Index has already passed major audits from the likes of Coinsult and SOLIDProof and can be purchased with ETH, USDT or bank card.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 00:06:00

He was accused by some of creating false visuals and spreading misinformation because he used generative AI to create the photos. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupted airspace, Keyzer couldn’t travel anymore and chose to use generative artificial intelligence (AI) to produce a series of photographs about Russia. The AI-generated photos of Russia were included in his book Putin’s Dream , which was released in November. Creating Putin’s Dream To create the AI photos series, De Keyzer used real photos of Russia. Apparently, he visited Russia twelve times in a single year during the late 1980s. During the last days of the USSR, De Keyzer took pictures of the customs that would soon be lost. He has more photos from inside the prison camps in Siberia, which were taken in the 2000s. De Keyzer uploaded his own photos from the 80s and 2000s into an AI software. He then modified the output to fit his aesthetic preferences , and produced the Putin’s Dream series , The photojournalist explained that the usage of generative AI as a tool was for reflecting on the atrocities of the war in Ukraine, which was essentially the result of one man’s imagination. De Keyzer, who is pleased with the outcome, claims that the new visuals he has included in Putin’s Dream are a reflection of his earlier photography, which frequently examined power structures and propaganda. The artist sought to produce realistic AI-generated photos while fusing his trademark comedy, surrealism, and irony. His Instagram post announcing Putin’s Dream was met with scathing criticism despite his openness about utilizing AI. Many people called the photographs “fake,” but he also received some good feedback applauding the creative approach to photography. Magnum Photos, an international photographic cooperative, faced criticism as well since De Keyzer is a part of it . A week after , Magnum published a response on its website . “Magnum Photos respects and values the creative freedom of our photographers, supporting their diverse explorations and perspectives.” Other Magnum members like Jonas Bendiksen and Michael Christopher Brown have been experimenting with AI-generated photos. De Keyzer isn’t the only artist who faced backlash for using AI. Boris Eldagsen experienced criticism too, after winning the Sony World Photography Prize with an AI image. People create 34 million AI images daily Between 2022 and 2023, text-to-image AI algorithms produced over 15 billion images. An average of 34 million photos have been created every day since the debut of DALLE-2 . Adobe Firefly, a collection of AI algorithms integrated into Adobe Photoshop, is the product with the quickest rate of growth. Within three months of its introduction, it had produced one billion photographs. Midjourney has the highest number of users, with 15 million members , compared to other image generation platforms . In contrast, 30 million people use Adobe Creative Cloud, which includes graphic design and video editing tools, such as the generative AI tool Adobe Firefly. Roughly 80% of the photos, or 12.59 billion, were produced using open-source LLM models, platforms, and apps based on Stable Diffusion.

Shiba Inu, the “Dogecoin killer” that began as a meme, went from zero to a market cap in the billions, making early investors look like geniuses. Those lucky enough to scoop up Shiba Inu in its ICO at a minuscule price are now sitting pretty, while others are left asking, “Why didn’t I buy in earlier?” But here’s the good news: If you missed out on Shiba Inu’s ICO, BTFD Coin is your second chance at redemption. The presale for BTFD Coin is already crushing it, with over $4.5 million raised and nearly 60 billion coins sold. Now, with a 50% discount available using the BIG50 code, this is your opportunity to buy in at a price that could make you the next crypto success story. It’s the same kind of savvy move that was made back in 1973 during the oil market crash, where those who bought in during the panic were rewarded with significant gains when prices recovered. And just like those investors, you can seize this moment and potentially watch your investment grow. The Shiba Inu ICO: Making Millionaires Overnight Let’s rewind to 2020 when Shiba Inu launched its ICO. Initially priced at next to nothing, Shiba Inu seemed like a joke to many, but it turned out to be one of the most successful meme coins in history. The Shiba Inu community, or Shiba Army, grew quickly, and the coin’s popularity reached new heights with the celebrity endorsement of Elon Musk and other crypto moguls. The ICO price? Just a tiny fraction of a cent. And yet, today, Shiba Inu’s market cap is valued at 13 billion dollars. If you missed the chance to buy Shiba Inu at its ICO price, you’re probably thinking, “What if I had invested then?” Well, that moment has passed, but don’t let that be the end of your meme coin journey. BTFD Coin is here to offer a fresh opportunity, and it’s got everything to make waves just like Shiba Inu did. BTFD Coin: A New Era of Meme Coins, With Massive Potential BTFD Coin is poised to take over where Shiba Inu left off. The presale is well underway, and things are looking spectacular. With over $4.5 million raised, a growing community of 6,600 bulls, and a promising roadmap, BTFD Coin is on a fast track to success. The coin is currently priced at $0.000064 thanks to the BIG50 code, giving you more bang for your buck. So, why should you care about BTFD Coin? Let’s break it down: Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game: BTFD Coin’s P2E game offers rewards and engages the community in a fun way, making the token even more valuable for holders. Staking Rewards: Get rewarded handsomely with an APY of 90%, which means you can sit back, stake your tokens, and watch your portfolio grow. The Bulls Squad: This is no ordinary community. The Bulls Squad is a group of passionate investors committed to growing BTFD Coin and supporting each other’s investments. They’re your crypto family, rooting for success! A History-Inspired Move But here’s the kicker: the 50% discount on BTFD Coin’s presale is inspired by a historic event—the 1973 oil market crash. During this time, savvy investors realised that buying assets at their lowest point during times of panic was the smartest move. After the crash, the oil market rebounded, and those who made the purchase saw huge returns. The BIG50 code is BTFD Coin’s version of this strategy —an opportunity to buy in when prices are still low before the market takes off. It’s your chance to make a bold, strategic move. Let’s translate that into numbers: if you invest $4,000 at the presale price of $0.000064, you’ll get approximately 62,500,000 BTFD Coins. Hopefully, the coin will hit its predicted value of $0.0006 post-launch, and your investment could skyrocket to $37,500—that’s a 9x return! How to Buy BTFD Coin at the Discounted Price Noq Ready to grab your BTFD Coin while the price is still reduced? Here’s how (but act fast!): Head to the Presale Page . Connect Your Wallet: Click “Connect Wallet” and choose your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Apply the Discount Code: In the Bonus Code field, enter BIG50 and click “Apply”. This will unlock your 50% discount. Select Your Purchase: Choose the amount of $BTFD you’d like to buy and double-check the discounted price. Confirm Your Purchase: Hit “Buy Now”, approve the transaction in your wallet, and you’re in! Conclusion: Invest in BTFD Coin’s Presale at the 50% Discount Today Shiba Inu may have had its moment, but BTFD Coin is the new wave —and with its 50% discount, this is the perfect time to get involved. With a promising presale, a Play-to-Earn game, 90% staking rewards, and a passionate community behind it, BTFD Coin is ready to make a big splash in the crypto world. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by! Use the BIG50 code today, get your discounted coins, and become part of the Bulls Squad before the price takes off after January 5th.
