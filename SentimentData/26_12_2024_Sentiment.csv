It’s now up an impressive 13% from the multi-week lows it recently hit in the $175 area, but still has a long way to go before it retests its recent highs in the $260s. Solana back to $200 Me and my buddies with a combined total of $17.50 in our wallet: pic.twitter.com/sbaDr7BhMk — Kakashi (@kkashi_yt) December 25, 2024 Indeed, the bulls shouldn’t get overly excited about the rebound just yet. Chart analysis suggests the Solana price remains stuck in a downtrend and remains substantial in both its 21 and 50DMAs. A meaningful break above $220 would be required to confirm an end to the bearish trend. The Fed’s recent hawkish policy shift (towards signaling only two rate cuts in 2025) knocked confidence in risk assets last week. Will that keep the Solana price in a bearish trend? Probably not. Here’s why a recovery back towards its 2024 highs and beyond is likely in early 2025. Solana Price Set to Retest $260 Soon, Here’s Why The Fed won’t be cutting interest rates as much in 2025, which is, on margin, a negative for risk assets. But there are too many other fundamentals to be bullish on right now to get overly worried about this. Firstly, the US economy continues to perform very well. Assuming that continues, this should underpin risk assets (like US stocks) moving forward, a tailwind for crypto. But much more important for crypto is the imminent arrival of the pro-crypto Trump administration and a new pro-crypto US Congress. The US crypto industry is on the cusp of entering into a new golden age, and this should be a boon for all major crypto assets as adoption accelerates. With most major cryptos also still yet to enter the most explosive phase of their bull markets, the Solana price could soon enter lift-off. And a break above the aforementioned downtrend could be the trigger. The blockchain’s on-chain fundamentals are looking very healthy, with trading and transaction volumes and TVL in strong uptrends, per DeFi Llama . Solana’s market cap was last around $94 billion, which is under 25% of Ethereum’s . Its unlikely to overtake Ethereum this cycle, given ETH will also likely see significant expansion. But it wouldn’t be unreasonable to see the Solana price 4-5x from current levels and match Ethereum’s current market cap. With the price still down 25% from its November peaks, Solana is a strong candidate for best crypto to buy now .

To read full editions, subscribe . What better way to celebrate the season than by diving into the holly-jolly madness of holiday memecoins? Pump.fun has been brimming with festive chaos as degens deck the chain with memes and mayhem, so we thought we’d take a moment to unwrap a few of the highlights. First up, the Santas. Purple is the color of the moment, and Santa is apparently taking it in stride. Santa Paws (yes, a cat) appears to be attempting to claw its way to a comeback, while Santa Is Real and Santa Isn’t Real duke it out for festive dominance. Santa wif Hat, meanwhile, is rocking an alarming variety of headgear, from classic red to…let’s just call it “experimental.” And what’s this? Could it be a brigade of naked Santa variants storming the chain, ranging from cheeky to full-on yuletide nightmare fuel ? Aw thanks, frens…you really shouldn’t have. New holidays are making their debuts too. Ever heard of Rizzmas ? Hawktuahnukkah ? Chrismahanukwanzaka ? Me neither, and yet here we are. Degens have made their wish lists loud and clear with aspirational coins like “All I Want for Xmas is (1000X)” and “AllIWANTforXmasIsAMillionBucks.” Ho ho hodl. Oh, and the snowmen…my goodness, the snowmen. They’ve outdone themselves. Frosty the Dough Man — because nothing says “the season of giving” like hoarding bags of cash — is joined by the very swol Abdominal Snowman (you read that right), an alarmingly handsome-Squidward-esque Mewing Snowman, and the ever popular extra thicc Gyatt Snowman, among many , many others . It only gets weirder. There are memecoins featuring homicidal Christmas trees, an unfortunate P. Diddy made of gingerbread, Biden and Trump (both dressed as Santa) kissing under the mistletoe, and a truly inexplicable Jesus made of shrimp (called Shresus, obviously). And then there’s the Grinch. Solana devs can’t get enough of Dr. Seuss’ iconic green grouch. Grinch Mona Lisa? Check . Super Saiyan Grinch? Why not ? Grinch Hawktuah? Sure . If it’s a meme, it’s minting. Finally, if the cold weather is keeping you from touching grass, don’t worry — you can always Touch Snow . From all of us at Lightspeed: Happy holidays, Solana fam!

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 21:34:00

Table of Contents XYZverse: A new altcoin with 100x potential Ethereum PEPE Shiba Inu Ethena Conclusion As Bitcoin surges beyond the $100,000 milestone, a wave of opportunity sweeps across the crypto landscape. Altcoins are breaking new ground with record highs, and the resurgence of meme tokens could be imminent. Unveiling five altcoins that might be the key to staying ahead in December and January. XYZverse: A new altcoin with 100x potential XYZverse is the world’s first meme coin tailored for sports enthusiasts. Whether a football fanatic, basketball devotee, MMA fan, or gaming enthusiast, XYZverse creates a dynamic ecosystem where profits meet passion. Its ambitious roadmap aims to dominate the meme coin arena, outpacing competitors like Pepe and Shiba Inu. Starting at $0.0001, XYZ has already reached Stage 9 of its presale at $0.001333, and it’s targeting a listing price of $0.1 — a potential 100x gain at current prices. With the presale still open, investors have an opportunity to join the race before the token hits major exchanges. Why XYZverse is December/January powerhouse: Massive profit potential: With a roadmap targeting a 10,000x return, XYZ combines meme coin hype with the massive appeal of sports. Early mover advantage: Investors in the current presale stage are positioning themselves for exponential gains as the project gains momentum. Broad market appeal: By uniting sports and memes, XYZverse will attract a diverse audience, from crypto degens to dedicated sports fans. As the crypto market accelerates and altcoins break new records, XYZverse emerges as a potential game-changer. Its unique value proposition and growth potential make it one of the most exciting altcoins to watch this season. Interested investors can get XYZ via presale and be part of the next crypto championship . You might also like: Altcoins under $1 that could bring big gains this holiday period Ethereum Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has transformed the digital landscape with smart contracts and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Ethereum’s advancements make it a prominent player in the blockchain industry. The growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) and its diverse applications underpin its strong position. While market trends fluctuate, Ethereum’s technology and potential keep it at the heart of discussions about crypto’s next steps. PEPE PEPE is a meme coin on Ethereum, serving as a tribute to Pepe the Frog, an internet meme by Matt Furie. PEPE aims to ride the popularity of meme coins like Dogecoin. With no taxes and a simple, straightforward approach, it’s attracting attention for keeping things pure and fun as a meme coin. PEPE’s value skyrocketed in 2023, pushing its market cap to $1.6 billion at one point. Whether it will reach new heights in the current market cycle remains to be seen, but its momentum and community support make it an interesting player to watch. You might also like: Polygon meme coin to overtake PEPE and SHIB in the bull run Shiba Inu Shiba Inu began as a playful nod to Dogecoin but has grown into something more. Unlike Dogecoin, SHIB’s place on Ethereum means it can do more. It has launched ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade tokens. Shiba Inu also plans to introduce an NFT platform and a DAO where holders will help make decisions. This shows SHIB’s potential to be more than just a meme coin. In today’s market, investors look for coins that offer real value, and SHIB’s development could make it appealing. While many meme coins come and go, Shiba Inu is building tools and a community that could last. Ethena Ethena aims to be a stable, crypto-native dollar that doesn’t rely on traditional banks. This means ENA can be used without worrying about the banking system. Ethena also brings the Internet Bond, a global savings tool in dollars, accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This bond offers a way to save money and earn interest without needing a bank. In today’s market, where many seek stable and accessible financial options, ENA stands out. The idea of a stablecoin that’s not tied to traditional banks is gaining attention, especially after recent banking uncertainties. By providing both a crypto-native dollar and a global savings instrument, Ethena is positioning ENA to meet the needs of users looking for security and growth in the crypto space. Conclusion While ETH, PEPE, SHIB, and ENA are promising, XYZ stands out as the first all-sport meme coin for fans aiming for massive growth in a community-driven ecosystem.

One such standout in the world of online gambling is Starlight Princess , a slot game developed by Pragmatic Play. This celestial-themed game offers an engaging experience for players who enjoy vibrant graphics and rewarding mechanics. For those curious about diving into the adventure, the Starlight Princess demo oyna option provides a chance to explore the game’s features without financial commitment. In this review, we’ll delve into the unique features, gameplay, and rewards of Starlight Princess while highlighting why it’s a favorite among gambling enthusiasts. We’ll also touch upon how the game fits within the evolving landscape of blockchain and crypto gaming. Starlight Princess: Overview and Theme Starlight Princess is a visually stunning slot game that transports players to a mystical, sky-high kingdom ruled by an enchanting princess. The game’s anime-inspired graphics, vivid colors, and magical soundtrack set it apart from traditional slot games. With a unique cascading reels feature, every spin is filled with the potential for big wins. The Starlight Princess demo oyna feature lets players experience the game’s rich visuals and mechanics without wagering real money. This demo is an excellent way for beginners and seasoned players alike to get familiar with its rules, payout potential, and bonus features. By exploring the demo, players can strategize and decide how to approach the game when they switch to real-money mode. Gameplay Mechanics and Features Starlight Princess offers a fresh take on the traditional slot format, featuring a 6×5 reel setup and a pay-anywhere mechanic. Unlike games where symbols must align on specific paylines, Starlight Princess rewards players for landing clusters of identical symbols anywhere on the grid. Key Features of Starlight Princess: Tumble Feature : Winning symbols disappear after a spin, allowing new symbols to cascade into the grid. This increases the chance of consecutive wins from a single spin, a mechanic that adds excitement and boosts payouts. Multiplier Symbols : The game includes multiplier symbols with values ranging from 2x to 500x. These multipliers can significantly amplify winnings, especially during the Free Spins round. Free Spins Bonus Round : Landing at least four scatter symbols triggers the Free Spins feature, where players are awarded 15 spins. During this round, multipliers accumulate, offering the potential for massive payouts. Buy Free Spins Option : For players eager to jump into the action, the game allows purchasing the Free Spins feature for a set price, bypassing the need to wait for scatter symbols. Starlight Princess and Blockchain Gambling As the gambling industry increasingly incorporates blockchain technology, games like Starlight Princess align well with the expectations of tech-savvy players. Blockchain casinos provide transparency, provably fair gaming, and secure transactions through cryptocurrencies, creating a seamless and trustworthy experience. Here’s how Starlight Princess fits into the blockchain gambling ecosystem: Crypto Integration : Many platforms offering Starlight Princess accept cryptocurrencies, enabling players to enjoy the game with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other digital assets. Provably Fair Gaming : By leveraging blockchain’s transparent algorithms, casinos can ensure that outcomes in games like Starlight Princess are genuinely random and fair. Decentralized Casinos : Blockchain-powered casinos allow players to maintain greater anonymity and control over their funds, making games like Starlight Princess more accessible to a global audience. Pragmatic Play: The Creator Behind Starlight Princess Pragmatic Play is a leading provider in the online gambling industry, known for its innovative slot games that combine engaging themes with advanced mechanics. The company consistently delivers high-quality titles that cater to a wide range of players. Why Pragmatic Play Stands Out: Diverse Game Portfolio : Beyond Starlight Princess, Pragmatic Play has developed numerous slots, table games, and live casino products, ensuring there’s something for everyone. Player-Centric Design : Each game is designed to offer an intuitive and enjoyable experience, whether played on desktop or mobile devices. Fairness and Security : Pragmatic Play games are rigorously tested for fairness, making them a reliable choice for players. Why Players Love Starlight Princess Starlight Princess appeals to players for several reasons: Engaging Visuals and Theme : The anime-style design and magical atmosphere create an immersive gaming experience. Rewarding Features : The tumble mechanic and multipliers keep the gameplay dynamic and lucrative. Demo Mode : The Starlight Princess demo oyna feature provides a risk-free way to enjoy the game and learn its mechanics. Compatibility with Crypto Gambling : The game’s availability on blockchain casinos makes it a go-to choice for crypto enthusiasts. Tips for Playing Starlight Princess While luck plays a significant role in slot games, here are some tips to enhance your experience: Start with the Demo : Use the Starlight Princess demo oyna feature to familiarize yourself with the gameplay and mechanics. Set a Budget : Determine a budget for real-money play and stick to it to ensure responsible gambling. Take Advantage of Bonuses : Look for casinos offering promotions, such as free spins or deposit bonuses, to extend your gameplay. Understand the Features : Learn how multipliers and the Free Spins round work to maximize your winnings. Final Thoughts Starlight Princess is more than just a slot game—it’s a captivating adventure that combines stunning visuals, rewarding gameplay, and innovative features. Its alignment with the trends in blockchain gambling makes it a must-try for modern players seeking a transparent and engaging experience. For those curious about exploring the enchanting world of Starlight Princess, the Starlight Princess demo oyna option is an excellent starting point. It’s a chance to enjoy the game’s features and prepare for the excitement of real-money play on trusted platforms like 7Slots Casino.

While financial legends like Warren Buffett turned market crashes into windfalls, today’s savvy investors are looking to the world of meme coins to achieve similar success. The crypto landscape is abuzz, with Popcat (POPCAT) struggling to claw back from a massive price drop and Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) turning heads with its AI-powered promotion. But the real excitement? It’s all about BTFD Coin’s presale , which has already surged past $4.5 million in funds raised, offering a jaw-dropping 50% festive discount for early investors. This limited-time deal, featuring the bonus code “ BIG50 ,” lets buyers snag $BTFD at just $0.000064—a steal when you consider its post-presale listing price of $0.0006. With a live P2E game, staking rewards, and a thriving community, BTFD Coin is set to redefine the meme coin space. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin stands out among the top meme coin presales to buy today and explore the latest updates on Popcat and Goatseus Maximus. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Festive Bull Run is Here Imagine a world where every market dip is a golden opportunity. This philosophy is at the heart of BTFD Coin, a meme coin inspired by the “Buy The Dip” mantra. With its P2E game beta now live and staking rewards already available, BTFD Coin is poised to redefine what it means to invest in meme coins. The BTFD presale has been nothing short of spectacular. In just its 12th stage, it’s sold over 59 billion tokens to more than 6,600 holders, raising a staggering $4.5 million. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, the current price is $0.000064—a massive 837.5% return for early investors. Here’s the kicker: with the festive 50% discount, investors can grab BTFD coins at a bargain using the code “ BIG50 .” Analysts predict even greater gains when the coin lists at $0.0006 after January 5, 2025. For instance, an investment of $6,500 at the discounted price yields over 101 million BTFD tokens. When the price hits $0.0006, that’s a potential return of over $60,000—a nearly 9x gain! This is why investors are flocking to BTFD’s presale. What sets BTFD apart is its utility-focused ecosystem. The P2E game, though in beta, is already generating buzz for its immersive gameplay. Players can join the Bulls Squad and engage in a gamified crypto experience. Though no rewards are earned during the beta, this is just the beginning of what promises to be a lucrative gaming journey. Add to this the 90% APY staking rewards introduced in Stage 3, and it’s clear that BTFD is more than just hype. Joining the presale is simple. Connect your wallet (like MetaMask or Trust Wallet) on the BTFD presale page , input the code “ BIG50 ,” and enjoy the discounted price. Don’t miss the referral programme—top referrers get 10% of the raised amount in tokens at month’s end. With a maximum supply of 173 billion tokens, BTFD is built on Ethereum’s robust blockchain, ensuring security, scalability, and accessibility for all investors. The BTFD presale isn’t just a chance to buy into a coin; it’s an invitation to join a community driven by resilience and strategic thinking. The world’s financial history—like the 1973 oil shock—has shown that buying during downturns often leads to monumental gains. BTFD embraces this ethos, giving every investor a shot at turning market chaos into personal triumph. Popcat (POPCAT): Bouncing Back from the Meme Market Dip Popcat—a coin inspired by the viral internet meme—has had a rollercoaster year. After reaching an all-time high of $2.06 in November 2024, the token faced a brutal 65% price decline over the last 30 days. This dip left many questioning its long-term viability. However, all is not lost for POPCAT. Currently priced at $0.825, Popcat has found support at the $1 mark, sparking renewed optimism among traders. Analysts note that maintaining this support could trigger a rally, with potential resistance levels offering significant upside. The coin’s developers have also been active in stabilising its community, emphasising its integration within the Solana blockchain for fast and cost-effective transactions. Popcat’s story highlights the unpredictable nature of meme coins. It serves as a reminder that while these investments carry high risk, they also offer opportunities for those who can navigate their volatility. For those who believe in Popcat’s potential, this could be an ideal time to enter the market at a discount. Goatseus Maximus (GOAT): AI Meets Meme Coin Mania Goatseus Maximus has quickly become a topic of fascination in the meme coin world, thanks in large part to its association with Truth Terminal—an AI created by New Zealand developer Andy Ayrey. The AI’s promotional prowess has catapulted GOAT into the spotlight, making it a unique player in the crypto space. Despite reaching an all-time high of $1.35 in November 2024, GOAT’s price has since dropped to $0.49. This decline reflects the volatility typical of meme coins but hasn’t dampened the enthusiasm of its community.

Table of Contents XYZ: Taking the spotlight with 16,900% growth forecast XRP Cardano Conclusion A new presale token from Polygon is drawing attention from investors who once favored XRP and Cardano (ADA). Predictions for this token suggest gains as high as 16,900%, stirring excitement in the cryptocurrency market. XYZ: Taking the spotlight with 16,900% growth forecast XYZ — the first-ever all-sports meme coin — is emerging as a must-watch contender.

It’s built on the XRP Ledger — a decentralized system that allows for swift, low-cost, and secure transactions. XRP doesn’t require a bank account for settlements, making it accessible to people everywhere. In today’s market, XRP stands out for its speed and efficiency compared to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which can be slower and more expensive to use. XRP’s ability to facilitate seamless payment transfers across different currencies aligns well with the growing demand for quick and borderless transactions. As financial systems evolve, XRP’s technology positions it as a potential key player. Its focus on real-world application and partnerships in the banking sector also make it an attractive option in the current market cycle. Cardano Cardano is a layer-1 blockchain that allows developers to build decentralized finance apps, create new crypto tokens, and develop games. Similar to Ethereum’s ETH, ADA can be used to store value, make payments, and earn rewards through staking on the Cardano network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake system, which is much more energy-efficient than the traditional proof-of-work model used by Bitcoin. Additionally, Cardano’s blockchain is divided into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions quickly — potentially up to a million per second. In the current market, where sustainability and scalability are highly valued, ADA presents an attractive option. As Ethereum faces challenges with high fees and scaling, Cardano’s approach might give it an edge. Conclusion XRP and ADA remain strong options, but XYZ could dominate the 2024 bull run.

Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov spoke about alternatives to the US dollar for international trade during an interview on Russia-24 on Dec. 25. Siluanov highlighted that the government has authorized foreign trade transactions using DFAs and Bitcoin, adding that such methods are already in practice and set for expansion. “We Can Use Mined Bitcoin” Siluanov emphasized that adopting DFAs in foreign trade is a logical step under current circumstances, enabling the use of modern infrastructure. He described this approach as an innovation in global settlement systems, stating, “That is the future.” Russia is leveraging its experimental legal framework, effective since September 2024, to integrate DFAs — including Bitcoin — into international trade. Siluanov explained, “We can pay for the delivery of goods with digital financial assets. It is also possible to use Bitcoin, which we mined here in the Russian Federation, within the experimental regime.” Russia Legalizes Mining and Scales DFA Use The minister noted that Russia legalized Bitcoin mining earlier in 2024, paving the way for such transactions. He added, “We say that they need to be developed and expanded, and I am sure that next year, it will be a reality.” Siluanov Cautions Against Crypto Investment Amid Bitcoin Highs While advocating for DFA use in trade, Siluanov has warned against viewing cryptocurrency as an investment vehicle. In a speech on Nov. 6, he stated, “Some people see cryptocurrency as a source of quick money. I don’t recommend it as a means of investment.” His remarks underline the dual approach of promoting DFAs in trade while cautioning against speculative risks for individual investors.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 22:18:28

So, investors are treading very carefully. That’s why many Avalanche (AVAX) holders are switching. The same can be said for SUI. However, SUI investors are a bit more confident. Regardless, both are looking for something more stable. And this is where FX Guys ($FXG) comes in. FX Guys is a new crypto trading platform. As such, it brings massive utility to the market. So, experts are confident that it will do really well after its launch. Namely, they say that $FXG’s price will rise by at least 20x soon! >>>JOIN FXGuys HERE The Avalanche Token Price Might Fall Further Due to Sell-Offs AVAX’s price has been going up and down this whole month. Namely, AVAX’s price started off strong at the beginning of December 2024. However, a market-wide dip caused AVAX’s price to fall. Then, AVAX’s price recovered shortly after. Avalanche investors thought that the rise would continue. However, another market-wide dip proved otherwise. And due to that, AVAX’s price tumbled once again. More specifically, Avalanche’s price went below $35 on December 20, 2024. And then it rose again soon after to reach its current price of $38. This up-and-down movement is very worrying for Avalanche investors. That’s why they’re looking for something more stable. And they’ve found FX Guys! As a result, Avalanche investors are now bidding heavily on this project. As for AVAX, experts foresee its price dropping by another 20% soon. That’s because Avalanche investors are shedding their holdings to invest in more promising tokens. SUI Shows Strenght as Its Price Recovers SUI is showing massive strength right now. Unlike other altcoins, SUI is doing really well in this up-and-down market. Namely, SUI’s price has already recovered from its recent losses. Now, the SUI price stands at $4.60. Also, SUI’s charts are green in all timeframes. This just shows how resilient SUI is. However, SUI investors are still skeptical. That’s because of the current market volatility. Experts agree with them, recommending extreme caution to everyone right now. They say that SUI’s price can dip again soon due to the volatility. Per expert analysis, SUI’s price will fall by around 15% in the next couple of weeks. So, SUI investors are also looking to diversify right now. Most of them are investing in a new crypto trading platform! Of course, we’re talking about FX Guys! >>>JOIN FXGuys HERE FX Guys: The New Crypto Trading Platform Attracting Traders There are many reasons why everyone is talking about FX Guys right now. First, it is a new crypto trading platform that has yet to launch. As such, it has virtually infinite room for growth.

CHILLGUY slid from $0.19 to $0.17 after the news, extending its slide from mid-December. Chillguy extended its losses, sliding from $0.19 to $0.17 within minutes. The price action followed a series of social media posts showing evidence that the main image of the meme was plagiarized from a booklet distributed in Thailand. The original image was posted on Reddit, pointing to a single image of the booklet page. The lack of other images or additional information raised doubts about the authenticity of the evidence. Additionally, the versions of the pamphlet are conflicted. Some claim the published image is from Thailand and was printed eight years ago, while others point to a publication in Vietnam six years ago. Overall, the controversy is creating additional social media hype around the token, where some hype up the plagiarism, while others believe the entire story is to create more FUD around the token. Reverse image search shows this came from a Vietnamese book 6 years ago The artist who claimed to have the rights to #chillguy is a fraud Send the #OGchillguy pic.twitter.com/0aODGjVgAP — DD (@onchainbookie) December 25, 2024 Previously, Chillguy was considered the original creation of cartoonist Phillip Banks. Banks himself was touchy about using the image, even intending legal action to protect his creation. Despite this, the image was widely used on TikTok and became the avatar of a whole collection of meme tokens. Up to 30 versions of CHILLGUY or similar tickers exist, spreading on Ethereum, Solana, and Base. The main version was the one affected by the discovery of what social media considers plagiarism. Is CHILLGUY still the original? Some doubted the evidence of actual plagiarism, where claims were made that the character was taken from a Vietnamese leaflet created six years ago. Skeptics did not see additional evidence and suggested the image may be AI-generated or manipulated in some way. Phillip Banks has posted an Instagram image suggesting the suspicions are unfounded and the plagiarism is based on a faked image. Banks has not communicated through X to explicitly refute the claims and rarely pays attention to the meme community. The story was appealing enough that some of the large influencer accounts repeated the message of suspected plagiarism. Others found evidence that Banks denied all claims, while the image raised red flags of being AI-generated . Others noted that the booklet is not actually years old, and may be printed after the creation of Chillguy. In fact, when showing the reverse image search, Google indexes the age of subreddits, and not the image itself, which may be more recently printed. CHILLGUY controversy produces new meme token According to the original claims of plagiarism, the booklet called the character ‘Relax Boy’. This is just the name that the meme market needed, immediately launching RELAXBOY on Solana. The token graduated to Raydium and is already in price discovery mode. RELAXBOY was created based on the plagiarism claims, going through a boom and crash just hours after creation. | Source: DexScreener RELAXBOY is just hours old and has already gone through a 700X rally, followed by a 67% crash. The new asset still has just $232K in locked liquidity, though the token is creating a social media movement. Just hours after the token’s launch, CHILLGUY whales bought in . For traders, the actual verification of the image is less important. The spreading of images and rumors on TikTok shows the short video social app may also play a big role in the meme token market. If RELAXBOY was not enough, the market also produced Just a Chill Dog (CHILLDOG) , playing on the remixed illustration hype. The new asset is just as risky as RELAXBOY, though both tokens have seen intentions of creating social media movements and rising to a higher valuation.

In its Economic and Financial Occasional Paper, it labeled Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) services – widely celebrated for their accessibility – as “crime-as-a-service.” Bank of Italy Raises Red Flag on Bitcoin P2P The Bank of Italy’s report from November 2024 highlighted the growing role of Bitcoin peer-to-peer (P2P) services as tools for money laundering in jurisdictions with weak regulations. These services, described as “crime-as-a-service,” exploit regulatory loopholes, allowing illicit actors to obscure the origins of illegally obtained funds. The 131-year-old financial institution targeted unregulated P2P platforms and informal exchange networks, in particular, that evade traditional Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols and end up creating pathways for illegal activities. These methods enable criminals to bypass the scrutiny of centralized financial intermediaries by leveraging the pseudonymity of blockchain transactions. Regulatory Gaps The Bank of Italy’s report also highlighted the challenges posed by decentralized financial (DeFi) systems in combating money laundering. While centralized finance (CeFi) platforms can be regulated similarly to traditional financial institutions, their decentralized counterparts, on the other hand, operate without intermediaries, making oversight far more complex. The pseudonymity inherent in blockchain technology allows users to engage in transactions through unlinked addresses, effectively concealing their identities. This has sparked a debate between those who praise blockchain for its transparency and immutability and critics who highlight its potential for abuse. The report points to emerging solutions like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), which enable selective disclosure of information to mitigate illicit activities without compromising user privacy. However, these innovations, though promising, fall short of providing the continuous due diligence necessary to identify suspicious activities systematically, as per the Bank of Italy.

Among the altcoins being stockpiled in preparation for the next bull run, this first-ever all-sports meme coin is turning heads with its projected 9,900% surge and unique approach to blending meme culture with the excitement of sports. XYZ offers more than just meme coin hype — it seeks to redefine the space with its XYZVerse ecosystem, which will integrate prediction markets, sports betting, and interactive dApps. By tapping into the massive gambling and sports fanbase, XYZ is positioning itself as a major player. Currently priced at $0.001333 in its presale, XYZ is undervalued. By the Token Generation Event (TGE), its price is forecasted to climb to $0.1, delivering a 9,900% ROI for early investors. Whales recognize the opportunity to maximize gains before XYZ hits major centralized and decentralized exchanges. What sets XYZ apart in the crowded market: Whale-friendly tokenomics: With consistent token burns, strong liquidity, and revenue streams, XYZ will ensure long-term value and price stability. Massive market appeal: The blend of sports and meme culture attracts gamblers, sports enthusiasts, and crypto degens alike, creating a broad, engaged user base. Community-driven growth: Whales value projects with robust communities, and XYZ will reward active contributors with airdropped tokens while empowering them to influence the ecosystem’s direction.

With its robust ecosystem and continued upgrades, the platform aims to offer significant utility and scalability, making it a foundational asset in the cryptocurrency space. Whales are drawn to Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), which has seen exponential growth and is poised for further expansion in the coming bull cycle. Accumulating Ethereum not only provides exposure to the broader crypto market but also positions investors to benefit from the increasing adoption of smart contract platforms worldwide. Shiba Inu Shiba Inu initially captured the attention of crypto whales for its explosive price movements. However, SHIB has evolved beyond its meme origins, with recent developments, such as the Shibarium Layer-2 scaling solution adding to its utility. Whales are also attracted to SHIB’s deflationary tokenomics, with regular token burns reducing supply and increasing scarcity to potentially increase price with demand. As Shiba Inu integrates further into DeFi and explores metaverse opportunities, it solidifies its potential for high upsides in the next bull run. Conclusion While ETH and SHIB remain strong choices, crypto whales are also focusing on XYZ, a meme coin uniting sports fans in a community-driven ecosystem in the current bull run.

Investors and traders are actively exploring the top altcoins under $1 to invest in 2025. The current market sentiment appears positive as leading assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL) show signs of upside momentum. Based on technical analysis and recent whale activity, these are the top 10 altcoins under $1 to invest in for 2025. Additionally, this article will help you identify the best altcoin with the potential to generate significant returns. Cardano (ADA) ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, is one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies currently consolidating within a tight range between $0.86 and $0.97 over the past seven days. ADA is among the cryptocurrencies that could experience significant gains in the coming days if it breaks out from this narrow range. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if ADA breaks above the $0.97 mark and closes a daily candle above this level, it could potentially soar by 65%, reaching the $1.62 mark in the future. However, the altcoin may encounter resistance at the $1.24 level during its upward momentum. Hedera (HBAR) HBAR, the native token of Hedera, has been making waves amidst ongoing market uncertainty with its impressive upward momentum. Over the past three days, while major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and Ethereum (ETH) have struggled to gain traction, HBAR has surged by more than 40%. Source: Trading View With its recent rally, HBAR has broken out of a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern and appears to be retesting the breakout level. If it successfully retests this level, there is a strong possibility that the altcoin could soar by 200%, reaching the $0.98 mark in the future. This strong bullish price action pattern attracts traders and investors, making HBAR an ideal altcoin to consider for investment under $1 in 2025. Stellar (XLM) Following the presidential election results, Stellar’s native token, XLM, has garnered significant attention from crypto enthusiasts due to its impressive upward momentum. According to CoinMarketCap data, XLM has surged by more than 460%. However, after such a notable rally, XLM now appears to be undergoing a price correction. Source: Trading View Amid this ongoing correction, XLM has formed a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern on the daily timeframe and is currently on the verge of a breakout. Based on historical momentum, a successful breakout could propel XLM by 125%, nearing the $0.95 mark in the coming days. Tron (TRX) TRX, the native token of the Tron blockchain, has garnered attention similar to XLM with its impressive rally following the presidential election. According to data, TRX has surged by more than 165%. However, it currently appears to be undergoing a price correction, experiencing a 42% decline. Experts and analysts view this recent decline as an ideal buying opportunity. Source: Trading View Amid this price action, TRX has formed a descending triangle pattern and is on the verge of a breakout. Based on historical momentum, if the altcoin breaks out of this pattern and closes a daily candle above the $0.26 mark, there is a strong possibility it could surge by 70%, reaching the $0.44 mark in the future. This bullish price action positions TRX as one of the top altcoins to consider under $1 in 2025, with significant rally potential. Jupiter (JUP) JUP, the native token of Jupiter, a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange and a successful project on the Solana blockchain, has been struggling over the past few days, along with other major cryptocurrencies. However, following a price decline of over 44%, JUP has reached a crucial support level where it has historically experienced upward momentum. Source: Trading View Since the beginning of 2024, JUP has tested this trendline support five times, and on each occasion, it has rallied significantly. Experts and analysts anticipate a similar rally this time. Based on price action, JUP has begun moving upward, with a strong possibility of soaring by 55% to reach the $1.40 mark in the coming days. The Graph (GRT) Amid the recent price correction, GRT, the native token of The Graph, has experienced a significant price decline of over 40%. Following this decline, GRT has reached a golden Fibonacci level while also receiving support from a strong 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and a horizontal support level at the $0.20 mark. Source: Trading View This support zone suggests an ideal buying opportunity, as long-term holders appear to be accumulating GRT at this level, according to the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Based on recent price action, if GRT holds this support level and sustains itself above the $0.20 mark, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 60%, reaching the $0.35 level in the future. Kaspa (KAS) KAS, the native token of Kaspa, is drawing significant attention from crypto enthusiasts as tech billionaire Elon Musk reportedly shows interest in the token. Since the beginning of November 2024, KAS has been trading within a parallel channel pattern between $0.11 and $0.19. Source: Trading View Amid the recent price correction, KAS failed to break out of this channel pattern and has fallen to its lower boundary. However, the altcoin’s daily chart indicates that its price is currently consolidating. Based on recent price action, if market sentiment shifts positively, there is a strong possibility that KAS could rally by 60% to reach the $0.19 level in the coming days. Additionally, the altcoin’s daily chart suggests that KAS is an excellent choice for investment under $1 in 2025. Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE), the popular and world’s largest crypto meme coin by market cap, has been struggling over the past few days. Amid the price decline, DOGE broke below a crucial support level of $0.326 but has managed to hold this level and consolidate over the past seven days. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if DOGE sustains itself above the $0.30 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 40% to reach the $0.47 level in the future. Furthermore, it has the potential to soar by 75% if it breaks out above the $0.47 mark. Popcat (POPCAT) Popcat (POPCAT), a top Solana-based meme coin, has experienced a price decline of over 60% during the recent market drop. However, the meme coin is currently consolidating near a crucial support level at the $0.75 mark for the past seven days. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if POPCAT holds above the $0.70 level, there is a strong possibility it could rally by 150% to reach the $1.95 mark in the future. While this target may not be easy to achieve, POPCAT could potentially reach it in 2025. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB), the popular and second-largest crypto meme coin by market cap, is poised for upside momentum after forming a bullish price action pattern. Based on recent price action, SHIB has broken out of a consolidation zone following a successful retest of the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe. Source: Trading View Following this breakout, there is a strong possibility that SHIB could rally by 75% to reach the $0.000040 mark. During this rally, the $0.000030 level may act as a hurdle for the meme coin.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-25 22:50:00

The tokens are set to hit the market in three transactions of 200 million, 300 million, and 500 million XRP. The clock for the three escrows will tick on the first minutes of 2025, freeing 1 billion XRP tokens in addition to the 57.2 billion currently in circulation. The January release represents 2.63% of the total 38 billion of XRP that is still locked in Ripple’s escrow accounts. To be specific, Ripple (24) address will unlock 200 and 300 million XRP that were locked in the escrow on December 1, 2024, and January 1, 2021, respectively. Then, Ripple (25) will release 500 million XRP that were locked on January 1, 2021. These will be the last transactions from Ripple (24) and (25), although there are numerous escrows held by other Ripple-controlled addresses. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which create new tokens “on the go” as a reward for miners/validators that keep the blockchain safe, Ripple pre-mined the entire supply of 100 billion XRP at the very inception of the network. In 2017, 55 billion XRP were locked in an escrow system hardcoded to release 1 billion XRP each month to ensure gradual and controlled distribution. The scheduled unlocks help Ripple fund its operations, invest in ecosystem development, and provide liquidity for its payment solutions. While the real amount of XRP that actually enters circulation every month is often lower than 1 billion due to the company re-locking a portion of tokens into a new escrow, this nevertheless creates a significant amount of selling pressure. With Ripple currently trading above the coveted $2 mark, it remains an open question whether XRP will see a proportional demand increase to sustain current price levels. Nevertheless, the promise of the nearing altcoin season leaves room for cautious optimism. VanEck experts call the start of the altcoin season As Bitcoin struggles to stay above the psychologically important $100,000 mark, VanEck experts claim that the “altcoin season” may be already in full force. The asset manager even suggested November 27 as the start day for the rise of altcoins in this cycle. For context, the term “altcoin season” refers to the periods when cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (so-called altcoins) outperform the king of crypto. The hotly anticipated altseasons historically follow after Bitcoin dominance peaks near 60%, as traders seek higher returns in alternative assets. According to VanEck analyst Matthew Sigel, the relationship between Bitcoin dominance and altcoin performance can be explained through the cyclical nature of capital flows in cryptocurrency driven by investor psychology. When new capital enters the market during Bitcoin's rise, it encourages a ”risk-on” sentiment, motivating investors to seek higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities in altcoins. Increased appetite for risk often benefits more nascent crypto sectors, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The ”altseasons” are identified when over 60% of the top 50 altcoins by market cap, excluding the stablecoins and Bitcoin-backed assets, outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Data from Artemis’s Altcoin Season Index quoted by VanEck in a report indicates that altcoins are doing reasonably well. The index tracks how the top 50 altcoins compare to Bitcoin performance, taking on the values between 0 and 1, where 0.6 is a cutoff value that signals the start of the altcoin season. The current score of 0.64 suggests a moderate altcoin performance, a sign of a major altcoin pump still ahead. According to CoinMarketCap , the current state of the cryptocurrency market is neither altcoin season nor Bitcoin season. The platform uses a much more stringent standard for calculating the altseason index, defined as 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperforming Bitcoin. With the current score of 49 sitting firmly in the middle, the altcoin rally seems like a more distant perspective than suggested by VanEck. At the same time, the index climbed as high as 82 on December 8, indicating a strong potential for a retest. Crypto analyst Ash Crypto recently made a prediction for the altcoin season to start in Q1 2025, drawing parallels between the Bitcoin performance in 2020 and 2024. In both cases, November saw strong gains in the cryptocurrency market, followed by a pullback in December. The subsequent reversal in Bitcoin dominance set the stage for the “mega altseason,” which analyst hopes to return in 2025. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is hovering around the $99k mark. With the wave of pro-crypto policymakers brought by Trump into his administration, many experts expect Bitcoin to reach new highs in 2025. VanEck set its base price target for BTC at $180k by 2025, citing Bitcoin’s growing adoption as an institutional reserve asset, rising altcoin speculation, and powerful synergies between crypto and AI as potential catalysts in the upcoming year.",News|Altcoins|Ripple,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-25 22:53:08

Lookonchain reports that a whale suddenly created 30 new wallets to accumulate $34.1 million worth of LINK tokens from Binance. “Suspicious LINK accumulation spotted! Over the past 5 days, 30 newly created wallets have withdrawn 1.37M LINK ($34.1M) from Binance.” Source: Lookonchain/X At time of writing, Chainlink is trading at $24.04, up 34% in the last month. Earlier this week, Chainlink released Smart Value Recapture (SVR), a solution aiming to allow DeFi solutions to recapture non-toxic Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) from the leading oracle’s price feeds. “Based on real-world testing, we believe Chainlink SVR can expect to achieve a realistic value recapture rate of approximately 40% (i.e., for every $100 that would have been leaked via liquidation MEV, $40 was recaptured). While some alternative solutions have claimed to achieve a higher efficiency rate for recapturing liquidation MEV, we have not seen conclusive real-world data to showcase this. We believe that 40% is a conservative but realistic estimate—real life performance will be needed to gather actual data.” On the same day as the announcement from Chainlink, Aave , the biggest lending platform in crypto, proposed using SVR. Specifically, the proposal was about activating a pilot program of SVR oracles on Aave v3 to recapture MEV from the platform’s liquidations to return its own ecosystem. The proposal is currently awaiting questions and feedback from the community.

This Must-Watch Presale is Making Splashes in Crypto,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bitcoin-this-must-watch-presale-is-making-splashes-in-crypto/,"The cryptocurrency market has been buzzing lately with fresh developments. Bitcoin, the king of cryptos, remains in the limelight as its price dances between key moving averages. But while Bitcoin continues to hold its ground, there’s another name that’s quietly stealing the show: Qubetics ($TICS) . As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics is revolutionising blockchain technology with innovations that aim to address issues Bitcoin and its contemporaries have left unresolved. Qubetics isn’t just another crypto; it’s a game-changer. From bridging blockchains to simplifying decentralised processes, Qubetics is raising the bar. And with its ongoing presale raising over $7.8 million, it’s clear that people are paying attention. Let’s explore why Qubetics and Bitcoin are among the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025 , and how they stack up against each other. Qubetics ($TICS): The Future of Blockchain Innovation Qubetics is capturing attention for all the right reasons. Its 14th presale stage has already sold over 376 million tokens to 11,800 holders, raising an impressive $7.8 million. At $0.0377 per token, there’s a growing sense of urgency to snag $TICS before its price jumps by 10% this weekend. Crypto analysts are buzzing with excitement about Qubetics’ potential. By the presale’s end, $TICS is projected to reach $0.25, offering a return on investment of 564%. And post-presale, the numbers soar—$TICS could hit $1, providing a staggering 2,555% ROI. But it doesn’t stop there. With a $15 target after its mainnet launch, the potential ROI skyrockets to an astonishing 39,729%. Investing $100,000 at the current price could mean owning 2,652,519 tokens, which could translate to $39.7 million if the $15 milestone is achieved. QubeQode IDE: Revolutionising Real-World Applications The heart of Qubetics lies in its QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE) , a powerful tool tailored for professionals, businesses, and individuals alike. Imagine a local artisan in São Paulo looking to sell handcrafted goods internationally. QubeQode IDE simplifies creating and launching a decentralised e-commerce platform, eliminating the need for tech expertise. Picture a logistics company in Mexico streamlining its supply chain using smart contracts designed through QubeQode. No middlemen, no delays—just seamless, automated transactions. Or think about a software developer in Argentina creating custom dApps for clients worldwide without needing to switch between multiple blockchains. By uniting blockchains and offering user-friendly tools, Qubetics ensures accessibility, efficiency, and trust. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Qubetics stands out for its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and its real-world applications. Combine that with the excitement of its presale, and it’s easy to see why it’s among the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): The Original Crypto Titan Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of cryptocurrency, with its price currently hovering between key support and resistance levels. According to market analysts, BTC is dancing between the 21-day and 50-day simple moving averages, approximately $99,600 and $94,650, respectively. While it may not exhibit the explosive gains of younger altcoins, Bitcoin’s stability continues to make it a favourite among long-term investors. This year has seen Bitcoin reclaim its status as digital gold, with institutional interest spiking. However, regulatory headwinds and macroeconomic factors like interest rate cuts in 2025 are likely to influence its trajectory. Bitcoin’s Legacy and Use Cases Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its universality. From rural villages in Paraguay to bustling cities like Rio de Janeiro, Bitcoin is used for remittances, savings, and even everyday purchases. It’s the go-to for those who want financial freedom without the hassles of traditional banking. Bitcoin also serves as the foundation of many crypto portfolios. While it doesn’t have the bells and whistles of newer projects like Qubetics, its robustness and wide adoption make it irreplaceable. Why Did This Coin Make It to This List? Bitcoin’s resilience, universal appeal, and foundational role in the crypto world make it one of the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025. While its growth may not be as meteoric as altcoins, it remains a safe bet for long-term value. The Final Thoughts Based on our research and analysis, Qubetics and Bitcoin are standout options for those seeking the top cryptos to buy today for significant gains in 2025. Bitcoin offers reliability and a proven track record, making it a cornerstone for any crypto portfolio. On the other hand, Qubetics is shaking up the blockchain landscape with its innovative QubeQode IDE and ambitious presale milestones. If you’re looking to diversify your portfolio or ride the wave of an emerging star, now’s the time to act. Don’t let the opportunity pass you by—Qubetics and Bitcoin are here to reshape your financial future.

38117855,https://cryptonews.com/?p=322722,1735169909,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/38117855.jpeg,Dogecoin Price Rallies to $0.33 – Will the Triangle Pattern Spark a Rally?,https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-rallies-to-0-33-will-the-triangle-pattern-spark-a-rally/,"The Dogecoin (DOGE) price has rallied back to $0.33 after falling as low as the $0.26s last week, and is forming a triangle pattern that could soon be the catalyst for a bullish breakout. That means that a short-term pump for the Dogecoin price back to it recent highs in the $0.48 could be on the cards in the coming days. Of course, the 21 and 50DMAs in the $0.37-38 area could offer stiff resistance, given they also coincide with some recent lows. But good vibes are likely to continue into the year’s end. Why? Well, major cryptos are tentatively recovering from a Fed-induced sell-off last week on their more hawkish than expected interest rate projections . But most major cryptos remain well below their pre-hawkish Fed meeting levels, suggesting the scope for further recovery is there. And there are a lot of tailwinds to support the crypto market right now. That’s because we are on the cusp of entering a new golden age for crypto markets in the US, but also globally. The incoming Trump administration and Congress are likely to spur a significant acceleration in the adoption of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies, not least admin hopes that they establish a US strategic Bitcoin reserve. JUST IN: VanEck predicts #Bitcoin will be worth $3 million and used as a global reserve asset by 2050. pic.twitter.com/TEsvd9S34L — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) October 28, 2024 The grounds are thus fertile for the emergence of a new meme coin/alt-coin season, of which we have already seen flashes of since Trump’s emphatic election victory. Dogecoin , the oldest and still biggest meme coin, would surely lead any future meme season. That’s even more the case given that Elon Musk’ s new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) is set to be established under the Trump administration. Department of Government Efficiency pic.twitter.com/HFeHYNIkJN — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) September 7, 2024 Musk’s new department aims to slash government fraud and waste, and will be hugely controversial and nearly constantly in the news. That all but guarantees that Dogecoin retains a leading portion of meme coin market “mind share”, guaranteeing continued market leadership. How High Will the Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Rally This Cycle? A recovery back to recent highs in the Dogecoin market is thus very likely in early 2025 as Trump returns to the White House. Bulls will be hoping for an eventual rally back to the 2021 record highs above $0.70, as well as a potential surge to $1.0 for the first time. However, might this be the end of the road for Dogecoin? Well, analysis of past Dogecoin cycles suggest the bulls need to be aiming bigger and higher, with this rally likely to far exceed where many expect. Dogecoin has been through three market cycles since its inception in 2014, and these cycles can offer clues about what could be in store for DOGE in 2025. When drawing a Fibonacci extension upwards from the prior bear market low to the prior bear market high, it can be seen that Dogecoin has always rallied well beyond the 4.236 Fibonacci level, exceeding this Fibonacci extension by over 10x during its 2021 rally. The 4.236 Fibonacci extension level from the 2022 bear market lows back to the 2021 highs suggests that Dogecoin should at least hit $3 per token this cycle. But as history has shown, Dogecoin has routinely blown well past this level. Given that context, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect a $10 Dogecoin price this cycle. Of course, that would imply a multi-trillion-dollar market cap, which might be a bit much to ask. But Dogecoin could definitely 10x from current levels to reach a market cap in the $100s of billions, making it a strong candidate for best meme coin to buy now. Meme Coin Alternative With Massive Potential – Meme Index (MEMEX) For most investors, securing 10x gains is a best-case scenario. But in crypto, many degens are on the hunt for the next 100x project that will make them rich. One of the best ways to bag 100x gains is by getting into a new meme coin before it really takes off. One new meme coin that has caught the eyes of analysts at cryptonews.com is Meme Index (MEMEX) . Meme Index introduces the world’s first decentralized meme coin index, allowing investors to diversify across various meme coins through community governance. With the meme coin market cap reaching a whopping $137 billion in 2024, analysts suspect that demand for an innovative investment vehicle such as this could be very high. That’s certainly the case with Meme Index, which has already raised close to half a million dollars in MEMEX presale token sales. The project’s potential lies in its ability to offer different risk levels with indexes like Titan, Moonshot, Midcap, and Frenzy, catering to a broad investor base. Only a Chill Guy can handle the twists and turns of a Frenzy Index. pic.twitter.com/1QHv0IvF0i — Meme Index (@memecoin_index) December 17, 2024 Moreover, MEMEX holders can stake tokens for high APYs, encouraging long-term holding and potentially increasing token value. It should come as no surprise that flocks of experts have already come out to throw their support behind MEMEX . Michael Wrubel and Austin Hilton both recently hailed the project’s potential in YouTube videos to their more than 600,000 combined subscribers. Meme Index has already passed major audits from the likes of Coinsult and SOLIDProof and can be purchased with ETH, USDT or bank card.

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY.

He was accused by some of creating false visuals and spreading misinformation because he used generative AI to create the photos. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine disrupted airspace, Keyzer couldn’t travel anymore and chose to use generative artificial intelligence (AI) to produce a series of photographs about Russia. The AI-generated photos of Russia were included in his book Putin’s Dream , which was released in November. Creating Putin’s Dream To create the AI photos series, De Keyzer used real photos of Russia. Apparently, he visited Russia twelve times in a single year during the late 1980s. During the last days of the USSR, De Keyzer took pictures of the customs that would soon be lost. He has more photos from inside the prison camps in Siberia, which were taken in the 2000s. De Keyzer uploaded his own photos from the 80s and 2000s into an AI software. He then modified the output to fit his aesthetic preferences , and produced the Putin’s Dream series , The photojournalist explained that the usage of generative AI as a tool was for reflecting on the atrocities of the war in Ukraine, which was essentially the result of one man’s imagination. De Keyzer, who is pleased with the outcome, claims that the new visuals he has included in Putin’s Dream are a reflection of his earlier photography, which frequently examined power structures and propaganda. The artist sought to produce realistic AI-generated photos while fusing his trademark comedy, surrealism, and irony. His Instagram post announcing Putin’s Dream was met with scathing criticism despite his openness about utilizing AI. Many people called the photographs “fake,” but he also received some good feedback applauding the creative approach to photography. Magnum Photos, an international photographic cooperative, faced criticism as well since De Keyzer is a part of it . A week after , Magnum published a response on its website . “Magnum Photos respects and values the creative freedom of our photographers, supporting their diverse explorations and perspectives.” Other Magnum members like Jonas Bendiksen and Michael Christopher Brown have been experimenting with AI-generated photos. De Keyzer isn’t the only artist who faced backlash for using AI. Boris Eldagsen experienced criticism too, after winning the Sony World Photography Prize with an AI image. People create 34 million AI images daily Between 2022 and 2023, text-to-image AI algorithms produced over 15 billion images. An average of 34 million photos have been created every day since the debut of DALLE-2 . Adobe Firefly, a collection of AI algorithms integrated into Adobe Photoshop, is the product with the quickest rate of growth. Within three months of its introduction, it had produced one billion photographs. Midjourney has the highest number of users, with 15 million members , compared to other image generation platforms . In contrast, 30 million people use Adobe Creative Cloud, which includes graphic design and video editing tools, such as the generative AI tool Adobe Firefly. Roughly 80% of the photos, or 12.59 billion, were produced using open-source LLM models, platforms, and apps based on Stable Diffusion.

Shiba Inu, the “Dogecoin killer” that began as a meme, went from zero to a market cap in the billions, making early investors look like geniuses. Those lucky enough to scoop up Shiba Inu in its ICO at a minuscule price are now sitting pretty, while others are left asking, “Why didn’t I buy in earlier?” But here’s the good news: If you missed out on Shiba Inu’s ICO, BTFD Coin is your second chance at redemption. The presale for BTFD Coin is already crushing it, with over $4.5 million raised and nearly 60 billion coins sold. Now, with a 50% discount available using the BIG50 code, this is your opportunity to buy in at a price that could make you the next crypto success story. It’s the same kind of savvy move that was made back in 1973 during the oil market crash, where those who bought in during the panic were rewarded with significant gains when prices recovered. And just like those investors, you can seize this moment and potentially watch your investment grow. The Shiba Inu ICO: Making Millionaires Overnight Let’s rewind to 2020 when Shiba Inu launched its ICO. Initially priced at next to nothing, Shiba Inu seemed like a joke to many, but it turned out to be one of the most successful meme coins in history. The Shiba Inu community, or Shiba Army, grew quickly, and the coin’s popularity reached new heights with the celebrity endorsement of Elon Musk and other crypto moguls. The ICO price? Just a tiny fraction of a cent. And yet, today, Shiba Inu’s market cap is valued at 13 billion dollars. If you missed the chance to buy Shiba Inu at its ICO price, you’re probably thinking, “What if I had invested then?” Well, that moment has passed, but don’t let that be the end of your meme coin journey. BTFD Coin is here to offer a fresh opportunity, and it’s got everything to make waves just like Shiba Inu did. BTFD Coin: A New Era of Meme Coins, With Massive Potential BTFD Coin is poised to take over where Shiba Inu left off. The presale is well underway, and things are looking spectacular. With over $4.5 million raised, a growing community of 6,600 bulls, and a promising roadmap, BTFD Coin is on a fast track to success. The coin is currently priced at $0.000064 thanks to the BIG50 code, giving you more bang for your buck. So, why should you care about BTFD Coin? Let’s break it down: Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game: BTFD Coin’s P2E game offers rewards and engages the community in a fun way, making the token even more valuable for holders. Staking Rewards: Get rewarded handsomely with an APY of 90%, which means you can sit back, stake your tokens, and watch your portfolio grow. The Bulls Squad: This is no ordinary community. The Bulls Squad is a group of passionate investors committed to growing BTFD Coin and supporting each other’s investments. They’re your crypto family, rooting for success! A History-Inspired Move But here’s the kicker: the 50% discount on BTFD Coin’s presale is inspired by a historic event—the 1973 oil market crash. During this time, savvy investors realised that buying assets at their lowest point during times of panic was the smartest move. After the crash, the oil market rebounded, and those who made the purchase saw huge returns. The BIG50 code is BTFD Coin’s version of this strategy —an opportunity to buy in when prices are still low before the market takes off. It’s your chance to make a bold, strategic move. Let’s translate that into numbers: if you invest $4,000 at the presale price of $0.000064, you’ll get approximately 62,500,000 BTFD Coins. Hopefully, the coin will hit its predicted value of $0.0006 post-launch, and your investment could skyrocket to $37,500—that’s a 9x return! How to Buy BTFD Coin at the Discounted Price Noq Ready to grab your BTFD Coin while the price is still reduced? Here’s how (but act fast!): Head to the Presale Page . Connect Your Wallet: Click “Connect Wallet” and choose your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Apply the Discount Code: In the Bonus Code field, enter BIG50 and click “Apply”. This will unlock your 50% discount. Select Your Purchase: Choose the amount of $BTFD you’d like to buy and double-check the discounted price. Confirm Your Purchase: Hit “Buy Now”, approve the transaction in your wallet, and you’re in! Conclusion: Invest in BTFD Coin’s Presale at the 50% Discount Today Shiba Inu may have had its moment, but BTFD Coin is the new wave —and with its 50% discount, this is the perfect time to get involved. With a promising presale, a Play-to-Earn game, 90% staking rewards, and a passionate community behind it, BTFD Coin is ready to make a big splash in the crypto world. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by! Use the BIG50 code today, get your discounted coins, and become part of the Bulls Squad before the price takes off after January 5th.

Crypto strategist Ali Martinez tells his 103,200 followers on the social media platform X that Dogecoin may be following in the footsteps of its 2017 and 2021 market cycles when the memecoin ignited a meteoric ascent after witnessing a severe correction. “In 2017, when Dogecoin began a parabolic run, it surged 212%, retraced 40%, then rallied 5,000%. In 2021, it went up 476%, retraced 56%, then skyrocketed 12,000%. Now, in 2024, DOGE is up 440% and has retraced by 46%. If history repeats, another parabolic rally is on the way!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Looking at the trader’s chart, it seems that he predicts Dogecoin will soar above $1 if his parabolic rally materializes. Zooming in, Martinez says DOGE is flashing a bullish signal on the daily chart based on the Tom DeMark (TD) Sequential Indicator. Traders use the TD Sequential Indicator to predict potential trend reversals for tokens based on the closing prices of their 13 previous bars or candles. “The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the Dogecoin DOGE daily chart, anticipating a price rebound!” Source: Ali Martinez/X At time of writing, DOGE is worth $0.32. Turning to Bitcoin ( BTC ), the trader says that the crypto king may be mirroring its early 2024 price action when it breached an immediate support level before triggering new rallies. “Throw it back! Bitcoin BTC.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that Bitcoin will briefly dip below $90,000 if it follows the early 2024 pattern. At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $94,133.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 01:33:10

Discover Why Qubetics Could Be the Next Big Investment Opportunity of the Decade,https://timestabloid.com/failed-to-join-stellars-groundbreaking-start-discover-why-qubetics/,"The cryptocurrency market is always evolving, and every few years, a project comes along that changes the game. Remember Stellar (XLM)? It launched as a bold new project aimed at revolutionising cross-border payments, and those who got in early have reaped the rewards. From empowering unbanked communities to creating efficient global payment systems, Stellar made its mark as a forward-thinking blockchain solution. But if you missed Stellar’s early rocket ride, don’t fret. Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping up as the best crypto presale to buy this week, combining cutting-edge technology with practical real-world applications. With its ongoing presale already raising over $7.8 million, Qubetics is positioning itself as the investment opportunity of the decade. Qubetics ($TICS): A Game-Changer for Everyday Crypto Transactions Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency—it’s a revolution in usability. At its core lies the multi-chain wallet, a tool designed to simplify crypto management for businesses, professionals, and everyday users alike. Unlike traditional wallets, Qubetics enables seamless transactions across multiple blockchains, making it an essential tool for anyone navigating the complex world of digital currencies. Imagine you’re a business owner running a global e-commerce store. You want to accept crypto payments but don’t want to deal with volatility or complicated conversions. Enter Qubetics. Its smart contract conversion mechanism instantly converts crypto payments into fiat currency at the point of sale, ensuring financial stability for your business. Now picture a freelancer working with international clients. Payments come in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptos, but managing these assets is often a hassle. With Qubetics, payments are converted into local currency instantly, streamlining financial management and eliminating unnecessary stress. Even for the average crypto investor, Qubetics is a game-changer. Its multi-chain compatibility allows users to manage diverse portfolios effortlessly, swapping tokens across blockchains with ease. Plus, integration with everyday tools like Apple Pay and Google Pay makes crypto transactions feel as simple as using a debit card. The Qubetics presale is in full swing, with over 376 million tokens sold and $7.8 million raised so far. Currently priced at $0.0377, $TICS tokens are a steal in their 14th presale stage. But don’t wait too long—the price is set to rise by 10% in Stage 15 this weekend. If you’re on the hunt for the best crypto presale to buy this week, Qubetics is your golden ticket. Stellar (XLM): A Blockchain Veteran with a Global Vision Stellar is a name that’s hard to ignore in the blockchain space. Launched with the goal of revolutionising cross-border payments, Stellar aimed to create a decentralised network that could handle international transactions faster and cheaper than traditional banking systems. Its mission to connect unbanked populations with the global financial system has earned it a loyal following and a solid reputation. Stellar’s real-world partnerships set it apart. Collaborations with financial institutions, NGOs, and governments have helped it build a strong use case for its technology. From facilitating low-cost remittances to enabling microtransactions, Stellar has proven its ability to deliver on its promises. The crypto’s price trajectory has been impressive as well, with analysts predicting continued growth as more industries adopt its technology. However, for new investors, Stellar may not offer the same explosive growth potential it did during its early days. Its established position in the market makes it a stable choice, but the biggest gains have already been realised by its earliest backers. For those who missed out on Stellar’s rise, Qubetics offers an exciting alternative, combining innovation, real-world applicability, and early-stage investment potential. How Qubetics Stands Out While both Qubetics and Stellar share a commitment to real-world impact, their approaches differ significantly. Stellar focuses on revolutionising international payments and connecting the unbanked, while Qubetics aims to make crypto accessible for everyone, regardless of their experience level or technical expertise. Qubetics’ multi-chain wallet is a standout feature, bridging the gap between crypto and everyday life. By integrating with familiar tools like Apple Pay and Google Pay, it ensures that using crypto is as easy as tapping your phone. Whether you’re managing a diverse investment portfolio or accepting payments as a business owner, Qubetics provides the tools you need to succeed. Stellar may have paved the way for global payment innovation, but Qubetics is taking things a step further by solving usability issues and catering to a broader audience. For those looking for the best crypto presale to buy this week , Qubetics offers a unique opportunity to invest in the future of blockchain technology. The cryptocurrency market is full of stories about missed opportunities, but it also offers plenty of second chances. Qubetics is shaping up to be one of the most exciting opportunities of the decade, with its innovative wallet, practical solutions, and massive early success. If you regret missing out on Stellar’s early days, now’s your chance to make up for it. With $7.8 million raised and over 376 million tokens sold, Qubetics is proving that it has what it takes to make waves in the crypto world. Don’t wait until the 15th stage kicks in with a 10% price hike—secure your $TICS tokens today and position yourself for future success.

Is it innovative features, promising price action, or a mix? As digital assets dominate the financial space, the spotlight shines brightly on three standout performers making waves. Stellar’s technical resilience has caught analysts’ attention, and Monero continues solidifying its position as a privacy coin leader. However, the real excitement builds around Qubetics ($TICS) and its game-changing wallet innovation alongside a red-hot presale. This article will discuss the latest developments and updates for Qubetics, Stellar, and Monero, the top coins to buy and hold now. Qubetics Wallet: The Future of Secure Digital Transactions Qubetics ($TICS) has revolutionised digital finance management with its advanced wallet , which now offers a virtual card feature. Imagine creating a secure virtual card directly within the wallet app—this is precisely what Qubetics enables its users to do. Whether it’s for online shopping or subscribing to digital services, this feature adds unparalleled convenience. Users gain enhanced control as these virtual cards can be instantly generated, monitored, and deactivated, ensuring the utmost security for primary payment methods. The virtual card isn’t just about functionality; it’s about empowering users. With seamless usability, it positions Qubetics Wallet as a must-have tool for digital finance enthusiasts. Recently, Qubetics also hosted an AMA session to engage with its growing community, addressing questions and showcasing the innovative roadmap ahead. It’s no surprise Qubetics is being recognised as one of the top coins to buy and hold now, with features that redefine user expectations in blockchain technology. Qubetics Partners with SWFT Blockchain for Next-Gen Wallet Innovation Qubetics has partnered with SWFT Blockchain to enhance its wallet’s capabilities in a groundbreaking collaboration. This partnership brings unmatched cross-chain functionality, allowing users to execute lightning-fast transactions across multiple blockchains. Whether it’s swapping assets or managing diverse portfolios, the wallet offers a seamless experience tailored to modern users.

This partnership underscores Qubetics’ commitment to innovation, making it a leader in blockchain advancements and reinforcing its position among the top coins to buy and hold now. Stellar ($XLM): Resistance Levels and Bullish Patterns Stellar’s ($XLM) recent price movements have captured analysts’ interest. As of the latest update, the digital asset trades around $0.43 and consolidates within a bullish flag formation. Notably, a renowned analyst, Dark Defender, highlighted a critical resistance level at $0.6367. Once this level is breached, XLM could target the $0.9203 Fibonacci level, marking a significant third wave in its Elliott Wave pattern. The ultimate target for the fifth wave is $2.3961, showcasing Stellar’s potential for upward growth. With such promising technical indicators, Stellar is undoubtedly a contender among the top coins to buy and hold now, offering robust potential for both short-term and long-term gains. Monero ($XMR): Privacy at Its Core Monero ($XMR) remains a top choice for those prioritising privacy and security. Known for its focus on anonymous transactions, Monero continues to innovate to preserve financial privacy. The blockchain ensures transaction details, such as sender, receiver, and amount, remain private, a feature unmatched by most cryptocurrencies. This privacy-centric approach cements Monero’s status as one of the top coins to buy and hold now, particularly for investors who value discretion and security. Qubetics Presale: Unmissable Opportunities in Phase 14 If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to invest, here it is. Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 14, and the momentum is electrifying. Each phase brings a 10% price increase, culminating in a 20% hike in the final stage. Currently priced at $0.037 per $TICS token, the presale has already raised an impressive $7.8 million. The structured price increase fuels a sense of urgency among investors, making Qubetics a compelling opportunity. Early adopters stand to gain significantly as the presale progresses, aligning perfectly with its growing reputation as one of the top coins to buy and hold now . With its innovative wallet and forward-thinking approach, Qubetics isn’t just building a cryptocurrency; it’s creating a legacy. Conclusion: A Future Filled with Promise Stellar ($XLM), Monero ($XMR), and Qubetics ($TICS) each bring unique strengths to the table. Stellar’s technical patterns point towards significant price surges, and Monero continues to dominate the privacy niche. However, Qubetics steals the spotlight with its innovative wallet and an electrifying presale. For investors seeking the top coins to buy and hold now, Qubetics stands out as a cryptocurrency and a revolutionary ecosystem.

This recovery follows a sharp 14.5% correction from its $108,275 all-time high on Dec. 17. Despite the recent volatility, Bitcoin derivatives maintained a neutral-to-bullish stance, supporting the potential for a rally above $105,000. Derivatives Signal Market Optimism Bitcoin futures monthly contracts are trading at a 12% premium over spot prices, signaling strong demand for leveraged long positions. Premiums between 5% and 10% are considered neutral, making the current level robust. Additionally, Bitcoin put (sell) options are at a 2% discount compared to call (buy) options. When significant corrections are expected, this indicator typically exceeds 6%, showing a preference for puts. Traditional Market Recovery Boosts Bitcoin Traditional financial markets also supported Bitcoin’s recent rise above $98,000. The S&P 500 index erased its monthly losses on Dec. 24, and the US 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.59%, up from 4.23% two weeks earlier. Higher Treasury yields often reflect inflation expectations, making scarce assets like Bitcoin more attractive during economic uncertainty. Economic Concerns and Stagnation Fears Bitcoin’s correlation with the S&P 500 index remains high at 64%, tying its performance to broader economic trends. The US Federal Reserve has reduced its 2025 interest rate-cut projections from four to two, lowering the immediate risks to corporate earnings and real estate markets. Margin and Derivatives Markets Stay Bullish On OKX, the Bitcoin long-to-short margin ratio is at 25x in favor of longs. Excessive confidence typically pushes this ratio above 40x, while bearish sentiment sees it drop below 5x. Despite record outflows from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF on Dec. 24, Bitcoin’s resilience at $92,458 reinforces optimism about reaching $105,000 and beyond.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 01:56:00

The crypto market continues to astound, bringing news of groundbreaking innovations and opportunities each day. From AI-powered decentralised systems to altcoins reshaping market dominance, the crypto space is alive with possibilities. Recently, Bittensor’s remarkable strides in AI and Bitcoin’s evolving market dynamics have been making waves. Amidst these developments, Qubetics ($TICS) has emerged as a frontrunner, captivating the crypto community with its unique features and a presale, generating unprecedented excitement. This article will delve into the latest updates for Qubetics, Bittensor, and Bitcoin, highlighting why these are among the top cryptos to buy for 2025. Qubetics Wallet: A Revolution in Digital Finance Management What if managing your digital finances became as effortless as generating a card for online purchases? The Qubetics Wallet introduces a game-changing feature—users can now generate virtual cards directly within the app. This innovative tool enhances convenience and adds a robust layer of security. Virtual cards can be created and managed effortlessly, giving users control over their digital transactions without exposing their primary payment methods. This feature caters to the growing demand for secure, seamless online transactions, empowering users to explore the world of digital payments without compromise. Qubetics recently hosted a highly engaging AMA session , addressing key questions and reinforcing its commitment to user-centric innovation. With these advancements, Qubetics is setting new benchmarks in digital finance. As one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025, Qubetics inspires confidence and curiosity among investors. Excitement Peaks: Explosive Rewards with Qubetics Presale Investors, take note—this is your moment. Qubetics is now in Presale Phase 14, offering TICS tokens at a current price of $0.037.

As one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025 , Qubetics is crafting a narrative of success, community involvement, and innovation. Don’t miss your opportunity to join the ranks of those already capitalising on this presale sensation. Bittensor (TAO): AI-Powered Innovation at Its Core Bittensor (TAO) is pioneering the integration of AI and blockchain with its decentralised machine learning network. Acting as a collective intelligence system, it incentivises participants to contribute computational resources in exchange for access to its shared knowledge pool. While trading 25% below its all-time high of $767.68, Bittensor’s long-term prospects remain promising. With recent listings on major exchanges like Binance and KuCoin, coupled with surging interest in AI-driven technologies, Bittensor is poised to make further strides. Despite potential short-term corrections, analysts remain optimistic about its ability to redefine decentralised AI development. Bitcoin: Altcoin Season on the Horizon? Bitcoin’s market dominance has long been a barometer for crypto trends, and recent insights suggest altcoins are gearing up for a significant moment. Following a hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve, Pantera Capital’s Cosmo Jiang noted that altcoin capital flows are beginning to gain traction. Bitcoin dominance dipped from 60% to 54%, indicating a shift towards broader crypto investment. This trend signals potential opportunities for altcoins to shine, particularly as investors seek to diversify. As the crypto market matures, Bitcoin’s role as a steadying force remains pivotal, even as attention turns towards emerging contenders. Qubetics Partners with SWFT Blockchain for Next-Gen Wallet Innovation In a bold move to redefine blockchain transactions, Qubetics has partnered with SWFT Blockchain to launch an advanced wallet featuring unparalleled cross-chain functionality.

Is it the potential for groundbreaking innovation, financial freedom, or the thrill of joining the next big thing before it skyrockets? Whatever your reason, the crypto world is buzzing with updates, and savvy investors are keeping their eyes on the top altcoins to buy now. Recent news about Immutable X and Bitcoin Cash has stirred the market, but the standout opportunity is Qubetics ($TICS), an ambitious project redefining blockchain interoperability. This article will delve into the developments of all three coins: Qubetics, Immutable X, and Bitcoin Cash. Qubetics: The Future of Blockchain Interoperability In today’s blockchain ecosystem, fragmentation is a major hurdle. Many networks operate in silos, making it difficult for data, assets, and functionality to flow seamlessly across different chains. This disconnect slows innovation and limits the potential of decentralised applications. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), an innovative project to unify diverse networks into a single, collaborative Web3 framework . By integrating cross-chain functionality, Qubetics paves the way for smooth asset transfers and efficient data sharing. It’s not just a blockchain; it’s a bridge for ecosystems, empowering developers, enterprises, and users alike. Imagine a world where decentralised technologies operate without barriers—Qubetics is making that a reality. Recently, Qubetics hosted an AMA session to engage with its community, answering pressing questions and building trust. With such interactive efforts, the project strengthens its community ties and underscores its commitment to transparency. It’s no wonder Qubetics is gaining recognition as one of the top altcoins to buy now. Immutable X: Advancing Scalability in NFTs Immutable X continues to push boundaries in the NFT space. As a Layer 2 scaling solution on Ethereum, it enhances transaction speeds and reduces gas fees while maintaining Ethereum’s security and decentralisation. Recent updates reveal further advancements in user accessibility and developer tools, making creating and trading NFTs easier than ever. This project is a driving force in the blockchain space, proving that scalability and user experience can go hand-in-hand. Immutable X’s progress positions it as a serious contender for anyone eyeing innovative solutions in the NFT ecosystem. Bitcoin Cash: A Reliable Choice for Fast Transactions Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is making headlines with its growing adoption among merchants worldwide. Known for its fast and cost-effective transactions, BCH is proving its utility as a practical cryptocurrency for everyday use. Recent reports highlight significant growth in payment integrations, making BCH a go-to option for businesses and consumers alike. While Bitcoin Cash may not generate the same hype as newer projects, its steady progress and practical applications keep it relevant in the cryptocurrency landscape. Exciting Opportunities as Qubetics ($TICS) Presale Hits Phase 14 The Qubetics presale is in full swing, an opportunity you don’t want to miss. Currently, in Phase 14, the presale offers weekly price hikes of 10%, culminating in a final stage increase of 20%. Currently, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.037, with over $7.8 million raised, 11,800+ holders, and 376 million tokens sold. What makes this presale particularly compelling? The potential for a 563.81% return on investment. With a post-presale price target of $0.25 per token, early adopters have a rare chance to capitalise on this impressive growth. These figures alone make Qubetics one of the top altcoins to buy now . The next phase is just around the corner, and the momentum is building. With each passing week, the value of $TICS rises, turning every delay into a missed opportunity. Are you ready to join a project with such promising prospects? Conclusion: Seize the Moment with Qubetics In a market teeming with options, Qubetics, Immutable X, and Bitcoin Cash each offer unique opportunities. Analysts are optimistic about all three, but Qubetics is the most compelling choice for investors seeking high ROI potential. Its innovative approach to blockchain interoperability and the exciting presale dynamics cement its place among the top altcoins to buy now. The presale’s ticking clock adds urgency, reminding investors that timing is everything. Don’t let this chance slip by—Qubetics is not just another project but a blockchain technology revolution.

BTC might continue to rise if it clears the $100,00 resistance zone. Bitcoin started a decent upward move above the $96,000 zone. The price is trading above $96,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $98,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $96,000 support zone. Bitcoin Price Could Regain Momentum Bitcoin price started a decent upward move above the $95,000 resistance zone. BTC was able to climb above the $96,500 and $97,000 resistance levels. The pair cleared the $98,000 resistance level and traded close to the $100,000 resistance level. A high was formed at $99,400 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a test of the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $92,415 swing low to the $99,400 high. Bitcoin price is now trading above $96,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $99,200 level. The first key resistance is near the $99,500 level or the recent high. A clear move above the $99,500 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $100,000. A close above the $100,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $102,200 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $103,500 level. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $100,000 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $98,200 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $96,000 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $92,415 swing low to the $99,400 high. The next support is now near the $95,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $93,200 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $97,000, followed by $96,000.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 02:55:14

This $0.003 Token Will Soar Past $10 Faster,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-solana-sol-price-cross-1100-in-q1-2025-this-0-003-token-will-soar-past-10-faster/,"As Solana (SOL) continues to make waves with its high-speed blockchain capabilities, investors are speculating whether it can achieve the ambitious $1,100 price target by Q1 2025. While Solana’s strong ecosystem and past performance are encouraging, a new contender— Lightchain AI (LCAI) —is drawing significant attention. Priced at just $0.003, LCAI is gaining traction for its potential to surpass $10 in value even more rapidly. With cutting-edge technology and an accessible entry point, LCAI may outpace some of the most established altcoins in the upcoming bull market. Solana’s Journey to $1,100 Prospects and Challenges Solana has come up as a top blockchain place, known for its fast deals and growth, mostly thanks to its smart Proof of History (PoH) way of agreeing. This ease has pulled in builders looking at shared money (DeFi) apps and unique tokens (NFTs). Yet, Solana has faced problems that could affect its chance to hit $1,100. Most importantly, t͏he network has had a few shutdowns, bringing up worries about its trustworthiness and central control. These breaks have caused doubts about the network’s ability for big business use. Also, Solana sees more rivals from old platforms like Ethereum and new ones such as Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI joins smart thinking with blockchain tech, giving better tools that attract a wide mix of fields. Market state, with rules that are not clear and swings, add to the troubles around Solana’s price path. While some thinkers feel good, guessing that Solana might hit $1,100 in this strong rise, other warn to be careful saying of the told problems. Lightchain AI (LCAI) $0.003 Gem With Unmatched Growth Potential While Solana battles scalability and stiff competition, Lightchain AI is storming onto the scene, blending blockchain with artificial intelligence in a way that’s turning heads. This altcoin isn’t just another player—it’s a game-changer, tackling real-world problems with cutting-edge tech and paving the way for explosive growth. Here’s why Lightchain AI is the project everyone’s buzzing about. Revolutionary Consensus Mechanism (PoI) Goodbye, outdated mining systems! Lightchain’s Proof of Intelligence (PoI) flips the script. Instead of wasting resources on pointless computations, PoI incentivizes AI-powered tasks that actually matter—like solving real problems while being environmentally friendly. That’s right, it’s green tech with purpose! 2. Real Utility with AIVM Forget blockchains with vague promises. The AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) is the secret sauce fueling AI-focused decentralized apps (dApps). From predictive modeling to natural language processing (NLP), developers are already calling this the smartest platform for their big ideas. It’s not just promises—it’s real utility in action. 3. Numbers That Make You Double-Take A presale price of $0.003? You don’t see that every day for a project this innovative. Let’s break it down. $300 gets you 100,000 $LCAI tokens. If $LCAI hits $1 by 2025 (a very real possibility), that’s $100,000 in your pocket. Investors who got in early on Solana and Binance Coin saw similar mind-blowing gains—now it’s Lightchain AI’s turn. 4. A Rock-Solid Roadmap (With Real Progress) This is no “fly-by-night” operation. The Lightchain Roadmap is detailed, transparent, and already delivering. Phase 1 Prototype Development + Community Building Phase 2 Testnet Rollout + Performance Tweaks Phase 3 Mainnet Launch Testnets? Up and running. Validator nodes? Ready to roll. Partnerships? Already in the works. 2024 is going to be huge, and if Lightchain AI nails even half of its roadmap, 100x gains might sound conservative. Why AI-Blockchain Crossovers Are the Future The buzz around AI and blockchain isn’t just hype—it’s a full-blown revolution. Together, these two technologies are set to transform industries like fintech, healthcare, and beyond. What makes Lightchain AI special? Transparent governance through decentralization Boosted productivity in machine learning tasks Privacy-first frameworks for trustless data sharing This is Web3 innovation at its peak—solving today’s problems while building tomorrow’s solutions. AI alone is exciting, but when paired with blockchain, its potential is amplified. Ready to dive into the project that’s redefining the game? Lightchain AI isn’t just following trends—it’s creating them. Why Smart Investors Are Betting on Lightchain AI The key to massive crypto gains lies in early-stage investments, and Lightchain AI (LCAI) is ticking all the boxes. With a low entry point of just $0.003, LCAI is accessible to investors of all sizes. Unlike many speculative tokens, it offers real-world utility through its AI integration, addressing practical needs. Momentum is building as both institutional and retail investors take notice, with its presale success hinting at explosive future growth. What truly sets Lightchain AI apart is its innovative technology, blending AI and blockchain in a way that outshines the competition. As it prepares for its token launch, LCAI is a project to watch for potential 100x gains. Whether Solana hits $1,100 by Q1 2025 or not, Lightchain AI is positioned to soar past $10 in record time. Why Lightchain AI Is the Future of AI and Blockchain It’s clear that Lightchain AI is a project with immense potential, offering investors a unique opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for AI and blockchain integration. With its efficient consensus mechanism, real utility, low entry point, and solid roadmap, the project is well-positioned to capture a share of the booming DeFi market. Furthermore, Lightchain AI brings much-needed innovation to the blockchain industry by tackling real-world problems with cutting-edge technology. As other projects struggle with scalability and competition, Lightchain AI stands out as an innovative solution that has already gained traction among developers and investors alike. If you’re looking for a project that not only promises growth but also offers tangible utility and a strong development roadmap, look no further than Lightchain AI. It’s not just a gem—it’s the future of AI and blockchain.

Imagine being one of the early adopters who turned small investments into massive wealth. For many, that opportunity came and went, leaving latecomers watching from the sidelines, wondering if another chance like WIF would ever come around. Well, here’s the good news: history is repeating itself, but this time with BTFD Coin (BTFD) . Taking the meme coin craze to unprecedented heights, BTFD Coin combines innovation with community-driven momentum. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, lucrative 90% APY staking rewards, and a referral programme that rewards loyal supporters, BTFD is rewriting the rulebook on what a meme coin can achieve. And right now, thanks to a festive 50% presale price rollback—offering tokens at just $0.000064—there’s never been a better time to seize the dip. Use the code BIG50 before January 5, 2025, and claim your spot in what could be the year’s biggest crypto opportunity. BTFD Coin: Your Next Big Opportunity For those who felt left out of the WIF surge, BTFD Coin is here to rewrite your crypto story. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, BTFD embraces the iconic “Buy The Dip” philosophy, offering investors the chance to seize market lows and ride the highs. Currently, in its 12th presale stage, BTFD Coin is priced at just $0.000064, following a festive 50% price rollback. The presale has already raised over $4.5 million, with more than 59 billion tokens sold to 6,600+ bullish holders. But what makes BTFD stand out? Beyond its catchy name and presale buzz, this token offers real utility: Play-to-Earn (P2E) Game : The beta version of BTFD’s P2E game went live during Stage 10 of the presale, creating excitement among gamers and investors alike. Although rewards aren’t available during the beta, the full launch promises a unique way to earn while playing. 90% APY Staking Rewards : Staking went live on December 2, 2024, offering investors a generous 90% annual percentage yield. This feature alone makes BTFD a strong contender for both short-term gains and long-term growth. Referral Programme : The BTFD Rewards Programme incentivises community growth by offering 10% of the raised amount in BTFD tokens to top referrers. Massive ROI Potential : Starting at $0.000004 per coin, BTFD has already delivered an 837.5% ROI in its presale stages. Analysts predict a listing price of $0.0006, representing significant upside potential for early investors. Let’s break down what a $2,000 investment at the current presale price of $0.000064 could mean for you. You’d acquire approximately 31.25 million BTFD tokens . When the price hits $0.0006 post-presale, your initial investment could grow to $18,750—a staggering 837.5% return! Dogwifhat (WIF): The Wealth You Missed Dogwifhat burst onto the Solana blockchain as a meme coin with a twist, quickly gaining attention for its rapid price swings and high-risk, high-reward nature. As of December 2024, WIF is trading at $2.01 with a market cap of $2 billion, but it wasn’t always this way. In its early days, WIF was available for a fraction of its current price, offering massive wealth-building potential to those who dared to invest early. The allure of Dogwifhat was its community-driven approach combined with the Solana network’s speed and efficiency. Early investors saw their portfolios skyrocket as WIF gained popularity. However, many newcomers found themselves chasing the hype too late, missing the golden window of opportunity. Analysts often cite WIF as a textbook example of why timing is critical in crypto investing. But the glory days of WIF don’t have to be a distant memory. History has a habit of repeating itself, and the ongoing BTFD presale is shaping up to be the next big thing in the meme coin world. Why Act Now? The crypto market rewards decisiveness. Just like the early days of WIF, BTFD Coin is presenting an unparalleled opportunity for investors to get in on the ground floor. With over 59 billion coins already sold, this presale won’t last forever. The festive 50% discount (using the code BIG50 ) ends on January 5, 2025, making this the perfect time to act. Here’s how you can secure your BTFD Coin tokens: Visit the BTFD presale page . Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.). Enter the bonus code BIG50 to unlock the 50% discount. Specify the number of tokens you want to buy and confirm your purchase. It’s as simple as that. Don’t let another opportunity slip through your fingers. Conclusion: From WIF to BTFD—Your Second Chance Awaits Dogwifhat gave early investors a chance to generate life-changing wealth, but many missed out. Now, BTFD Coin is the ongoing top crypto presale , offering innovation, community-driven growth, and massive earning potential. With its P2E game, staking rewards, and referral incentives, BTFD isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement. So, don’t wait. Join the BTFD community today and claim your stake before the presale ends. Remember, the biggest gains come to those who act early. Will you be among them?

Donald Saves Crypto (DONALCRY), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONALCRY is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Saves Crypto can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Saves Crypto could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Saves Crypto launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Saves Crypto on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Saves Crypto by entering its contract address – Gyy3ss5Yj2ioZWuz6BNbDPGUGUxhwoCskRuU2cGo9k2Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONALCRY. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 04:23:19

The goal behind this decision is to mitigate risks associated with the company’s reliance on Canadian dollar-denominated assets, which marks a pivotal move toward diversifying its reserves. Matador Embraces Bitcoin Citing concerns over Canada’s dependence on oil exports and rising national debt, Matador highlighted the potential devaluation and loss of purchasing power of the Canadian dollar as key motivators. As part of its strategy, the company will make an initial $4.5 million allocation to Bitcoin in December 2024. It will also consider further acquisitions through measured buying programs. The firm also plans to transition the majority of its cash reserves from CAD to USD. Matador expressed its confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a long-term store of value, particularly as institutional interest in the cryptocurrency continues to rise across the world. The move also aligns with a growing trend among corporations seeking to hedge against currency debasement and explore alternatives to traditional financial assets like bonds. The latest move is also expected to drive Matador’s digital gold platform, which will enable users to trade digital gold backed by reserves at the Royal Canadian Mint. The Board picked Bitcoin over alternatives due to its stability, security, and growing use by institutions, making it the strongest foundation for the project, the company said in a statement . Following the development, Sunny Ray, President of Matador, commented, “Matador’s Board and management believe in using Bitcoin to future-proof our treasury. This step also supports our mission to explore using Bitcoin as a platform for our gold-based products.” Bitcoin Adoption Boom Firms like MicroStrategy , Metaplanet , and more have ramped up their Bitcoin holdings, while others have newly joined the growing trend. New research revealed that Bitcoin’s institutional adoption has grown significantly. As reported, BTC holdings rose to 31% of total supply. MicroStrategy leads with 440,000 BTC, worth over $46 billion. Meanwhile, ETFs have attracted large inflows, while the US, China, and El Salvador maintain substantial reserves. Combined, governments hold 2.45% of Bitcoin’s circulation, which is almost $49.36 billion. Additionally, several US states, including Ohio , Pennsylvania, and Texas, are exploring Bitcoin reserves as a strategy to safeguard public funds and adapt to modern financial innovations.

Leading the pack are $PENGU and $FARTCOIN. Investors and enthusiasts are now speculating on whether new meme coin presales like Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) and Flockerz ($FLOCK) could follow suit. Pudgy Penguins and Fartcoin Lead Christmas Meme Coin Rally The crypto market saw an explosive rally this Christmas Eve, with meme coins stealing the spotlight. While Bitcoin reclaimed $98,000, bringing renewed enthusiasm across the sector, it was Pengu and Fartcoin that captivated investors by reaching ranks #5 and #10 in the meme coin market cap rankings. Pudgy Penguins Reaches the Meme Coin Top 5 Pengu, the official token of the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection, managed to reach a market cap of over $2.2 billion and claim the fifth spot in the meme coin market cap rankings. Spiking from $0.028 on December 24 to $0.038 today, the token has experienced a substantial 35% increase in just one day. While the momentum has subsided somewhat, the meme coin managed to keep most of the gains it made. However, while in consolidation at the moment, $PENGU’s push through the descending triangle chart pattern fueled additional speculation of further price gains. The token’s performance follows its controversial launch on December 17, which initially caused Pudgy Penguins NFT prices to plummet due to a large number of airdrop claims leading to additional sell pressure. Despite early backlash from NFT holders, Pengu’s accessibility has attracted a broader investor base. Analysts now predict the token could reach $0.05 before facing significant resistance. Fartcoin’s Meteoric Rise Not to be outdone, Fartcoin has become the 10th-largest meme coin after a record-breaking post-launch rally. Recording a jaw-dropping daily price increase of 1,712.76%, Fartcoin’s surge has even garnered attention from traditional finance figures. Charlie Billelo, a prominent TradFi financial analyst, highlighted Fartcoin’s rise on Twitter, adding credibility to the coin’s momentum: “With a market cap of $1.3 billion, Fartcoin is now worth more than 786 companies in the Russel 3,000 Index.” You’ll see tradfi accounts tweet about Bitcoin from time to time, rarely ever any alts But now we see tradfi accounts blasting out 3 tweets in a row about fartcoin No other coin has had this effect pic.twitter.com/vDDTsqkJOZ — HornHairs (@CryptoHornHairs) December 19, 2024 With the meme coin market regaining investor confidence, both Pengu and Fartcoin have become symbols of the sector’s resilience. Wall Street Pepe and Flockerz Next Meme Coins to Explode? As established meme coins like Pengu and Fartcoin dominate the market, attention is shifting toward up-and-coming projects, with investors hoping to get in as early as possible and catch the best token prices. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) and Flockerz ($FLOCK) have generated significant buzz in recent days, with presales showing promising results. Wall Street Pepe combines the appeal of the Pepe meme with a clever nod to Wall Street traders, creating a narrative of beating crypto trading whales at their game that has resonated with investors. The project has been raising close to $2 million daily, raising over $35 million to date in its presale, demonstrating its potential to capture the next wave of meme coin mania. The WEPE presale’s success lies in its community-focused approach, emphasizing the utility it will provide its investors – in the form of alpha calls, trading groups and competitions, short and long calls, etc. With its launch on the horizon, analysts predict that $WEPE could rival top-tier meme coins once it hits the open market. Flockerz , a bird-themed meme coin, has also garnered substantial attention, raising close to $8 million during its presale. Built around the FlockTopia DAO, the project introduces a Vote-to-Earn protocol, rewarding participants for engaging with the community.

ADA is consolidating and facing hurdles near the $0.920 and $0.950 levels. ADA price started a downward move below the $1.00 support zone. The price is trading below $0.950 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.92 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.950 resistance zone. Cardano Price Starts Fresh Decline After struggling to clear the $1.00 resistance zone, Cardano started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA declined below the $0.9650 and $0.950 support levels. The recent high was formed at $0.9495 before the price dipped. There was a move below the $0.920 support level. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.8628 swing low to the $0.9495 high. Cardano price is now trading below $0.925 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.920 zone. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.92 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $0.9350. The next key resistance might be $0.950. If there is a close above the $0.950 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.00 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.050 in the near term. More Losses in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.920 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.8950 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.8628 swing low to the $0.9495 high. The next major support is near the $0.865 level. A downside break below the $0.8650 level could open the doors for a test of $0.820. The next major support is near the $0.8050 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.8950 and $0.8650.

However, a rising star has entered the spotlight: Yeti Ouro (YETIO). This innovative token captures the imagination and can potentially deliver exponential gains. Analysts speculate that a $1,000 investment in Yeti Ouro could transform into $100,000 by 2025. With a 20% holiday bonus on YETIO purchases from December 24th to 26th, along with a referral campaign and meme contest, this project creates significant excitement. Pepe Coin Price Analysis: A Resilient Meme Token Inspired by the iconic Pepe the Frog meme, Pepe Coin has become a favorite among crypto traders. After recent market turbulence, Pepe Coin price has bounced back, proving its resilience. However, its primary appeal lies in its meme-based community, with little utility to back long-term growth. 1-month Pepe price chart- source: CoinMarketCap The absence of utility leaves space for tokens like Yeti Ouro to shine. YETIO is more than another meme coin; it embodies the fun and exuberance of meme culture while providing real value through harnessing it in the Yeti Go ecosystem, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game. While Pepe Coin may find short-term hype, Yeti Ouro provides a solid argument for long-term investment. New Market Leader: Yeti Ouro Yeti Ouro is on track to be the next big thing in cryptocurrency! Yeti Ouro combines the excitement of meme coins with real-world use cases built on the Ethereum blockchain. Its ecosystem will centre on Yeti Go, an Unreal Engine-based racing game where players can obtain rewards through YETIO tokens. Yeti Ouro stands out for its approach to value creation amongst its community. Tokenomics: The token has a capped supply of 1 billion, ensuring it will always retain an element of scarcity while staking and token burns, promising long-term price increases. That’s why from December 24th to December 26th, Yeti Ouro will give a 20% bonus for all acquired tokens, the best time for investors to enter the project. The referral campaign gives users the opportunity to receive additional rewards for inviting others to participate in the presale, creating a culture of membership and joint success. Yeti Ouro also hosted other community initiatives, cementing its status as a project to watch. The current Meme Contest inspires creativity and empowers participants to receive YETIO tokens. The contest has attracted considerable attention on social media, with an offer of a prize pool worth $3,500. The 10% referral program also allows community members to cash in. By spreading their customized referral links, users can attract additional people into the ecosystem and increase their wallet balance. The Path To $100,000 Yeti Ouro stands to be a market leader through its mix of scarcity, utility, and community involvement. Analysts expect the token’s ‘meme’ status to repeat the success of early meme coins Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With finite supply and an innovative use case in the P2E gaming space, Yeti Ouro could be the ticket to huge returns for early investors. With its well-structured tokenomics and growth potential, a $1,000 investment today could result in significant gains for investors who buy into Yeti Ouro. Investors looking to get in on the ground floor of this project will find even more value in the 20% bonus over the holiday period. Join the Yeti Ouro Revolution As Pepe Coin regains strength, Yeti Ouro will emerge as the next big opportunity in cryptocurrency. With its innovative ecosystem, community-focused initiatives, and holiday bonuses, Yeti Ouro is proving to be more than just a meme coin—it’s a utility-driven token with real potential.

Experts predict that the price of the Bonk coin may rise to $0.0000600. Also, they say the value of Lunex Network (LNEX) and Stellar (XLM) could cross $1 in the coming months. In the meantime, investors are taking advantage of the downtrend to stock their portfolios. Analyst Forecasts Uptrend For Bonk (BONK) Despite Price Drop The Bonk token has plunged to former lows after a recent correction. CoinMarketCap data showed its price soared to a peak of $0.000058 before it began to lose momentum. Currently, the value of Bonk (BONK) has dropped by 8.1% on the biweekly chart. Still, analysts believe the correction is just a phase. They expect another uptrend to begin in the coming days. One of such analysts is LEVERAGED_LABS. They forecast the Bonk price might rally to two price targets in the coming weeks. The first target is $0.00006000.

According to a report by Coinpost , Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru issued an official statement on 20th December in response to Senator (Rassho) Hamada Satoshi’s question. The government admitted it doesn’t have detailed information on how other nations will adopt Bitcoin into national reserves as these discussions are still in their early stages. Earlier this month, on December 11th, Senator Hamada proposed that Japan consider joining other countries in turning part of its foreign exchange reserves into Bitcoin. The government, however, submitted its reply, pointing out that crypto-assets do not conform to the current legal definition of foreign exchange. Moreover, Japan’s reserves aim to stabilize foreign currency-denominated assets and bond markets. Japan remains cautious about keeping Bitcoin in the national reserve Japan’s top priorities are safety and liquidity, which means its stance on Bitcoin’s price swings does not match that. At a time when an increasing consensus is gaining steam within and outside of Japan over whether to put crypto assets into national reserves, Ishiba’s response is cautious. Meanwhile, in the United States, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell recently said that the Fed cannot hold Bitcoin, but President-elect Trump and some Republican lawmakers want a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

With massive potential, the countries globally are planning to tap this trillion-dollar industry to support their economy. Japan’s Cautious Response While the market is bullish in the long term, the Japanese government has officially responded to the idea of holding Bitcoin as part of its national reserves , taking a cautious approach. This came after Senator Hamada Satoshi suggested that Japan should consider following in the footsteps of countries like the U.S. and others, which are reportedly exploring the idea of strategic Bitcoin reserves. Hamada believes that incorporating Bitcoin could strengthen Japan’s economy and act as a safeguard against potential financial risks. The government clarified that it currently has no detailed understanding of similar developments in other countries and pointed out that discussions about Bitcoin reserves are still in their early stages. They explained that the legal framework governing Japan’s foreign exchange reserves prioritizes safety and stability, which are not characteristics typically associated with volatile assets like Bitcoin. In simple terms, the government doesn’t see Bitcoin fitting into its current system, which is focused on maintaining steady foreign currency reserves. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Russia Turns to Bitcoin to Fight Sanctions , Global Interest in Bitcoin Reserves This cautious approach comes as other regions are also debating the role of Bitcoin in national financial strategies.

However, on a global scale political leaders, including President-elect Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers, are pushing for the adoption of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. In Europe, MEP Sara Knafo urged the EU to adopt Bitcoin reserves , opposing a digital euro. She highlighted Bitcoin’s decentralization as a defense against authoritarian overreach. NON à l’euro numérique OUI à une réserve nationale stratégique de BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/o886lk9uV8 — Sarah Knafo (@knafo_sarah) December 16, 2024 While Japan is restricting innovation other nations are planning to add Bitcoin as a strategic reserve to support innovation. It will be interesting to see if Japan joins the trend or not. With Trump’s aggressive planning to become the top leader in Bitcoin , it will be a challenge for other countries to enter the game later. On the flip side, economists also see the downside of Bitcoin Reserve calling it a gamble, though Bitcoin is on a rising trend historically it can drop to its lowest as well creating a liquidation and overall economic crash hence a cautious approach is required while evaluating such high-risk assets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

SBI VC Trade said that the exchange’s customers will have their accounts ready by March 2025 following the transfer of custody assets. Also, the crypto trading platform expands spot crypto trading offerings for its customers. Ripple Partner SBI to Help DMM Bitcoin Users In a major relief to the users of hacked crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin, Ripple’s partner SBI announced a fresh deal with the company. The announcement notes that by March 8, 2025, SBI VC Trade will transfer the customer accounts and custody assets of DMM Bitcoin users to its own platform. Thus, users don’t need to open a separate account with SBI. Following the $320 million breach of DMM’s crypto wallets, the exchange has been unsuccessful in recovering customer’s funds. Earlier this month, the exchange announced that it would liquidate and transfer the customers over to SBI. Now, SBI VC Trade is willing to offer a helping hand to DMM Bitcoin customers. As a result, the Ripple partner will introduce 14 crypto products that are currently handled by DMM but not by SBI. However, SBI cleared that crypto-to-crypto trading pairs, such as ETH/BTC, are not part of their planner offerings. Additionally, SBI VC Trade clarified that leveraged trading would not be part of the transfer, and unsettled leveraged trading positions would remain ineligible for migration. There are no immediate plans to introduce leveraged trading pairs available on DMM Bitcoin at this time. North Korea Behind the Hack, Says FBI Crypto exchange DMM reported a major hack earlier this year in May, in a security breach of servers, wherein hackers stole 4,500 Bitcoins worth $320 million back then. DMM assured its customers that it would fully compensate for the losses and restore their accounts. As a result, Ripple partner SBI is now working with DMM on this matter. During the investigation in the following months, America’s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) revealed that North Korean hackers linked to the crime group TraderTraitor were behind this hack. FBI investigation shows that a North Korean threat actor posed as a recruiter on LinkedIn while targeting an employee of DMM Bitcoin. This employee was responsible for maintaining the company’s wallet management system. As part of the pre-employment test, the attacker sent a malicious link which the employee unknowingly uploaded to their GitHub page. The threat actor then exploited this vulnerability later, reported the FBI. In a recent development, the US Treasury Department dismantled a North Korean cryptocurrency laundering scheme, by sanctioning a UAE-based exchange, used to launder millions of dollars. North Korea’s Lazarus Group is popular for conducting all the crypto-hacking activities with top crypto exchanges like Upbit also falling victim to it.

Modern Portfolio Theory shows that the most efficient portfolio is one that includes everything that possibly can be invested in, including such alternative assets as collectibles. Many adherents of Modern Portfolio Theory do not include alternative assets such as collectibles in their portfolios because high transaction and other costs and risks associated with them. Bitcoin does not have the high transaction and other costs and risks associated with many other alternative assets, which is why mainstream investors are including it pursuant to MPT. As the price of any asset such as Bitcoin rises, adherents to Modern Portfolio Theory should buy more to maintain its proportion in the Market Portfolio. Those who have profited from Bitcoin’s ( BTC-USD ) surge to over $100,000, owe their good fortune, more than any other factor, to Harry Markowitz whose 1952 paper Portfolio Selection for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1990, led to what is now referred to as Modern Portfolio Theory. As taught in finance courses, Modern Portfolio Theory says that the most efficient portfolio is the Market Portfolio, one that includes all assets. Students are sometimes surprised when told that everything that one can possibly invest in, including baseball cards and beanie babies should be included in the most efficient portfolio. This has created a situation where professional portfolio managers who might not include baseball cards and beanie babies in their portfolios might now include Bitcoin. Anyone who has taken a graduate finance course and many others are familiar with the work of Markowitz which led to Modern Portfolio Theory. This led to the Capital Asset Pricing Model and Jensen's alpha which is the Alpha in ""Seeking Alpha."" In my Seeking Alpha article 30% Yielding MORL, MORT And The mREITS: A Real World Application And Test Of Modern Portfolio Theory I gave a concise explanation of how and why Modern Portfolio Theory leads to the conclusion that the most efficient portfolio is one that includes all assets. I have reproduced it below. Those who are familiar with this topic may want to skip down to Why Bitcoin is the Perfect Asset to Benefit from Modern Portfolio Theory . The basis for the theory is that investors evaluate all assets in terms of expected return and risk. Risk can be quantified by standard deviation. Any asset is more efficient than another asset if it has a higher expected return than the other asset but no more risk or has the same expected return but less risk. Markowitz CAL frontier (Wikipedia) Markowitz frontier.jpg If all possible assets and portfolios of assets are plotted on a graph with expected return on the vertical axis and risk on the horizontal assets as shown above, there will be some assets and portfolios of assets that are more efficient than others. The most efficient assets and portfolios of assets, those which have the highest expected return for any given level of risk (standard deviation) form the Efficient Frontier. This, as shown above, is the line connecting those assets and portfolios of assets that are more efficient than those below then in terms of risk and return. Portfolios of assets will generally be more efficient than individual assets. Compare investing all of your money in one security that had an expected return of 10% with some level of risk, to a portfolio comprised of 20 securities each with an expected return of 10% with same level of risk as the single security. The portfolio would provide the exact same expected return of 10% but with less risk than the individual security. Thus, the portfolio is more efficient than any of the individual assets in the portfolio. This principle of diversification has led to the boom in index funds and ETFs. Markowitz demonstrated that the most efficient portfolio will be the Market Portfolio, which consists of all assets that anyone could invest in. That would include not just all domestic and international stocks and bonds but all other assets as well including art and collectibles such as baseball cards. In a model where a risk free interest rate exists at which all investors can borrow and lend, all investors should own the Market Portfolio, as the line labeled ""Best possible CAL"" on the graph indicates. The best possible capital asset allocation for any investor, regardless of risk preferences, lies along a capital asset line that connects the risk free rate with the Efficient Frontier. The risk or standard deviation of an investment at the risk free rate is zero. A line originating at the point of the risk free interest rate on the Expected return vertical axis and zero on the Standard Deviation axis can be drawn to tangency point on the Efficient Frontier. Any investor should invest at some point on that Best possible CAL. An extremely risk averse investor should invest only in the risk free asset. Someone slightly less risk averse should have most of their assets in the risk free asset with the remainder in the market portfolio. A risk seeking investor could have 200% of their assets in the Market portfolio by buying on margin by borrowing at the risk free rate. The important implication is that any point on the best possible CAL is more efficient than any individual asset or portfolio below that point, since it has a higher return with the same risk. Modern Portfolio Theory has had its ups and downs in both the financial and academic communities. Critics of the theory and model point to the difficulty in determining or creating a ""market portfolio"" and the assumption that investors can borrow and lend at a risk free rate. Many use the S&P 500 ( SPX ) as a proxy for the market portfolio and the T-bill rate as the risk free rate. There still remain numerous issues with the model. One could argue that the Wilshire 5000 is a better proxy than the S&P 500. Why Bitcoin is the Perfect Asset to Benefit from Modern Portfolio Theory. Some market participants who may be devoted adherents to Modern Portfolio Theory, probably do not include baseball cards, beanie babies and similar alternative assets in either their own portfolios or those they manage. Those adherents could cite various reasons for why certain risk and cost factors associated with alternative assets are sufficient to make one forgo the benefits of the Market Portfolio, which should include those alternative assets according to Modern Portfolio Theory. The risks associated with those alternative assets include what might be called fashion risk and the associated dual-use risk. Residential real estate and collectibles have dual uses, both as investments and that they can generate utility for their owners, separate from any returns they may generate as investments. Certainly, there are some who invest in art and other collectibles purely for investment purposes, and keep their collections locked in warehouses. However, those only interested in capital gains from collectibles, may have to bid against buyers who love the objects in question and have no compunction about paying too much. More importantly what might be called fashion risk can occur if the objects in question fall out of favor with collectors. Some collectibles now have various metrics that can lend themselves to evaluation that comes closer to that of securities such as stocks and bonds, which have metrics such as earnings, yields and ratings, However, even those collectibles that have metrics that can lend themselves to evaluation have fashion risk. Coins are an example of collectibles that now have various metrics that can lend themselves to evaluation that comes closer to that of securities but have fashion risk. Rarity and condition are metrics that can be used to evaluate coins. The mintage number of any American coin is known and there are a number of professional rating agencies that can assign a number from 1 to 70 for any coin, where 70 is the highest grade indicating a pristine flawless coin. Any coin graded 60 or above is in the uncirculated category. However, just knowing the mintage and condition of a coin does not necessarily mean that you know its relative value. For example, there were only 3,700 gold US one dollar coins minted in 1865 and 52,000 Standing Liberty quarters minted in 1916. However, in any given condition, a1916 Standing Liberty quarter is worth considerably more than an 1865 gold dollar. In terms of investment outcomes, in 1916, an 1865 gold dollar was already a collector item and could have been purchased in uncirculated condition for about $10, according to Gemini 1.5. For $10, in 1916 someone could have acquired 40 uncirculated Standing Liberty quarters, each of which is now worth about $70,000 in grade 67 according to pgcs-coinfacts . The same service shows an 1865 gold dollar in grade 67 at $42,500 . Diamonds are dual use and still in many investment portfolios. However, lab-grown diamonds, which cannot be differentiated from natural diamonds, without extremely sophisticated equipment, if at all, now are taking an estimated 50% of the bridal diamond market . A similar situation occurred when the development of cultured pearls caused a massive decline in the value of natural pearls. Alternative investments such as oil and metals, which can have transactions costs as low as securities, have considerable custodian costs, including insurance. Crude oil for spot delivery actually went negative during the pandemic as there was no capacity to store it. Many collectibles have enormous transaction costs. For example, in the Sotheby’s auction sale NY7617 NYC June 4, 2001, I sold a small bench that I had been using as a seat to take off muddy shoes in my summer home, when I sold the home. I had bought It from the artist for $1,200 in 1987. It had faded from being exposed to the sun through a skylight and someone had left a cold can of soda on it, which left a noticeable ring. Sotheby's included it in the June 4, 2001 catalog and gave it an estimate of $4,000-6,000. It sold for $12,000. However, I received only $7,200, even though I had absolutely minimized the costs involved, by taking it to Sotheby's in my own car. Later that year I saw an identical bench from that artist in a store in Santa Fe NM, in much better condition offered at $4,000. Bitcoin has none of the transaction or custodial costs associated with other alternative assets. It really cannot now be considered a dual use asset like collectibles and residential real estate. At one point it was thought that it would have some use for transactions, especially those involving illicit activities, that does not seem to be materializing. In my 2018 articles The Cryptocurrency Craze May Be Not So Crazy and Cryptos Revisited I pointed out that in a blockchain, all transactions are recorded by all participants of the blockchain, this could lead to digital cryptocurrency eventually replacing money as we know it today. But before this could occur, I also suggested that government could take control of the cryptocurrency universe. The government would then know the exact real identity of all blockchain wallet owners, giving government knowledge of all transactions. Possibly, the individuals in a group known as DarkSide which extorted a ransomware payment from Colonial Pipeline in May 2021 did not read my articles, since on June 7, 2021, a press release from the Department of Justice included: WASHINGTON - The Department of Justice today announced that it has seized 63.7 bitcoins currently valued at approximately $2.3 million. These funds allegedly represent the proceeds of a May 8, ransom payment to individuals in a group known as DarkSide, which had targeted Colonial Pipeline, resulting in critical infrastructure being taken out of operation. The seizure warrant was authorized earlier today by the Honorable Laurel Beeler, U.S. Magistrate Judge for the Northern District of California. “Following the money remains one of the most basic, yet powerful tools we have,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco for the U.S. Department of Justice. Where Does That Leave Bitcoin? While in the future, Bitcoin will probably not be used in transactions any more than gold is today, that doesn't mean that, like gold, it will not inexorably be included increasingly in institutional and professionally managed portfolios. Those adhering to Modern Portfolio Theory, which increasing seem to be including the vast majority of portfolio managers who have not been able to consistently beat the S&P 500, do not have any of the reasons that limit their investments in collectibles, to preclude their including some of the 21 million Bitcoin in their market portfolios. That does not mean that Bitcoin will not continue to be very volatile and subject to event risk. However, just as Madoff on Enron did not permanently impair the stock market, various scandals and exchange collapses such as FTX will not permanently impair the Bitcoin market. One feature of the Modern Portfolio Theory conclusion that the total market portfolio will be the most efficient portfolio for all investors regardless of their risk aversion or risk seeking, is that since the weighting of an individual asset or asset class in the market portfolio, is that asset’s proportion of the total market value of all assets. Thus, as an asset class increases in price, adherence to Modern Portfolio Theory requires that more of it be purchased. In the short term there may be some disappointment when it becomes obvious that the USA has no business having a sovereign wealth fund and especially that the American government should not buy Bitcoin, anymore that the US Government should buy dollars for investment purposes. However, it is possible that countries for whom having sovereign wealth funds makes sense, they might increasingly be buying Bitcoin, since those running those funds probably studied Modern Portfolio Theory in whatever college or university they attended.",BTC-USD,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-26 05:35:39

Vulnerabilities on the Solana blockchain This is not the first time that Solana blockchain has been used to execute a scam. Solana’s infrastructure makes users prone to specific vulnerabilities. A recent case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice shone a light on this issue, with the Justice Department charging two California men, Gabriel Hay and Gavin Mayo, with running NFT rug pulls on Ethereum and Solana that cost buyers over $22 million. Such rug pulls included touting fake NFT projects like Vault of Gems and Faceless and fleeing with investors’ money. The case is the largest NFT fraud the DOJ has prosecuted. Further, Drake , the Canadian singer, also had his account compromised to promote Solana-based meme coin Anita.

While Solana’s architecture may have been designed for efficiency, it introduces a number of risks that render it more susceptible to scams compared to other networks. The token account structure Solana uses lets attackers reassign ownership of assets using specific commands, leaving funds virtually unrecoverable. You might also like: Solana hits $250, Dogecoin nears $0.5, Lightchain AI soars 30,000% to $5 Also, Solana’s one-step transaction approval—versus Ethereum’s multiphase allowance of contract functions—can result in instant and irreversible losses once a malicious transaction is authorized. The platform’s capacity to group multiple sub-transactions into one approval also compounds the risk of unseen thefts. Scammers also take advantage of Solana’s Durable Nonce capability to postpone the implementation of fraudulent operations, evading alerts and surprising victims. This, along with users’ ignorance of the operational risks of Solana, results in it being a prime target for scams.

Meanwhile, its memecoin rival, Shiba Inu, is capturing attention as analysts predict significant growth for the asset in 2025. Adding to the excitement is 1Fuel, a rising star in the DeFi space, which is set to drive altcoin growth with its anticipated public listing in Q2 2025. With Shiba Inu gaining traction among whales and 1Fuel’s innovative features increasing investor confidence, the altcoin market is gearing up for a dynamic year ahead. Dogecoin Slows Down After Huge Gains Dogecoin hit its all-time high of $0.4672 in early December but has since experienced a steady decline, now resting at $0.336. As the recent crypto market selloff eases, Dogecoin has faced the steepest losses. The largest memecoin by market cap has tumbled by 16% in the last week. Following its three-year high, the original memecoin has shed nearly half its value, causing investors to wonder whether it would recover. While Dogecoin struggles, attention has turned to another memecoin that will explode in the next altcoin rally, which is Shiba Inu. Analysts Predict 250% Growth for Shiba Inu in 2025 Shiba Inu has attracted the attention of a lot of investors, especially since analysts have predicted a staggering 250% growth in 2025. After reaching an all-time high of $0.00003556 in March, SHIB experienced a decline before rebounding to $0.00003293, only to drop again. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, indicating potential for a significant price movement. Analysts suggest that a breakout above the upper resistance line could propel SHIB to a target price of $0.00003255, representing a potential 32% increase from current levels. Despite being a memecoin, the main reason why SHIB has a bullish outlook is Shibarium, its Layer 2 blockchain. Shibarium is making SHIB, making it one of the best utility tokens. Investors are turning to tools like MetaMask and Ledger to securely hold and manage SHIB. 1Fuel OFT Predicted to Grow by 1000% Upon Listing Investors are buzzing about 1Fuel OFT, a promising new altcoin currently in its live presale stage. With stage 1 already complete and stage 2 over 50% finished, the presale has sold more than 86 million tokens. At its current presale value of just $0.012, OFT offers the lowest entry point for investors eager to secure the token before its anticipated public listing in Q2 2025. Analysts predict a 1000% growth upon listing, making it one of the most exciting opportunities in the crypto space right now. Unlike the memecoins that will explode, such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, 1Fuel OFT stands out as a utility token with intrinsic value driven by its robust features. OFT’s growing appeal highlights its potential as one of the best utility tokens to watch in 2025. 1Fuel’s DEX wallet has proven itself as a good alternative to tools like MetaMask and Ledger, especially since it facilitates cross-chain transactions without third-party tools. Its cutting-edge privacy mixer also exceeds the capabilities of wallets like MetaMask and Ledger, which currently lack integrated privacy tools. Investors Anticipate Altcoin Growth in 2025 As 1Fuel OFT gains traction in the altcoin market, it’s becoming a top contender for the next crypto rally. Unlike top memecoins, 1Fuel comes with a comprehensive ecosystem for long-term growth potential. Its value has attracted the attention of many investors, who are rushing to accumulate it in the presale.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 05:55:00

Hackers are now using his account to market questionable tokens and contracts under the pretense of an Animoca Brands coin release. Animoca Brands asks users to remain vigilant and not to interact with Siu’s account On December 26th, Animoca Brands disclosed via their official X account that their co-founder and CEO Yat Siu’s X account had been hacked. They warned users to stay alert, clarifying that the company had not formally issued any crypto tokens or NFTs. The firm added that information concerning the release of Solana-based tokens was also hacker-initiated. The company emphasized : Please DO NOT engage with the account and stay vigilant. We will provide an update when the account is restored. ~Animoca Brands Yat Siu’s account adds to the long list of X accounts hacked to push scam tokens On December 24, the live-streaming platform Kick’s official X account was also compromised. The account was used to promote fraudulent Solana-based tokens. Hackers even pushed the “Kick Token” to users, directing them to malicious wallet links. However, co-founder Bijan Tehrani, dismissed any plans to launch the Kick Token, warning users not to trust any of the scam posts on the token. On December 20, hackers also breached the X account of Vivek Ramaswamy, co-lead of the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). They used his account to propagate false claims of a partnership between the agency and the stablecoin project, under the guise of fostering financial inclusion and fiscal responsibility. Celebrity and rapper Drake’s account also fell victim to a breach, with hackers using his account to market scam token $ANITA. Attackers tied his Anita Max Wynn Tour to the fraudulent token and the crypto betting platform token Stake, hoping to entice unsuspecting users. Crypto investigator, ZachXBT called attention to the hack and debunked any connections of Drake to Stake or the $ANITA token. Moreover, former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao even took to X to caution his followers against scam accounts trying to impersonate him. He stressed that his official X handle is @cz_binance, warning that any other accounts starting with ‘cz,’ even those with a blue verification checkmark, are fake.

Both coins have differentiated themselves as community-driven tokens with large user bases. However, as the race for domination in 2025 unfolds, another name is making headlines in the DeFi space. It’s no other than 1Fuel (OFT) . 1FUEL is soaring, having sold out the initial stage of what is now one of the top crypto presales in 2024, with a projected return of more than 500%. So, If you are interested in buying cryptocurrencies with long-term benefits, 1Fuel shows clear signs as a strong contender, alongside SHIB and DOGE ahead of 2025. Could the rise of 1Fuel reshape the dynamics of the meme coin showdown? SHIB: More Than Just A Meme Coin Shiba Inu, dubbed the “Dogecoin Killer,” has cultivated a devoted following as it distinguished itself as more than just a meme coin. Over the years, SHIB has grown its ecosystem to include the ShibaSwap decentralized exchange, NFTs, and staking alternatives. These innovations are designed to give SHIB real-world utility and longevity. SHIB’s tokenomics are also key to its attractiveness, with a deflationary approach and token burns targeted to build value and reduce circulating supply. Shiba Inu’s network utilized a creative token-burning model to accelerate its deflationary goal. This strategy, which is closely linked to the growth of Shibarium (Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain solution) uses each transaction in the ecosystem to help lower token supply. As the market approaches 2025, SHIB investors are depending on new use cases and a dedicated community to drive growth. DOGE: The Original Meme Coin Dogecoin is indisputably the pioneer of meme coins, having a legacy that no other token can equal. Known for its lighthearted beginnings and strong celebrity endorsements, DOGE won over millions of hearts worldwide. DOGE has also, of course, benefited significantly from the patronage of Elon Musk. Despite its playful beginnings, DOGE has established itself as an authentic cryptocurrency, with growing popularity for microtransactions and tipping systems. Donald Trump’s election triumph caused DOGE to surge by more than 160% in November. However, the market now appears unsure of where DOGE will head next. DOGE’s early November rally was followed by a sluggish climb upward as the price lost momentum and investors began to take profits. Nevertheless, analysts anticipate that Dogecoin bulls may present a case for price suppression, sending the cryptocurrency back up around $0.485. 1Fuel’s Increasing Momentum While SHIB and DOGE occupy the meme coin scene, 1Fuel paves the path as a strong utility token in the DeFi space. Now in the second presale phase and selling for a low price of $0.012/token, 1Fuel has received much attention for its creative solutions that address key blockchain concerns. 1Fuel offers a one-click cross-chain cryptocurrency wallet, peer-to-peer exchange, and staking rewards up to 30% APR, amongst other benefits. Market analysts maintain that 1Fuel’s emphasis on practical applications and flexible user experiences establishes it as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for long-term returns. For individuals interested in buying cryptocurrencies with real-world utility, 1Fuel stands out as a top choice, sparring with meme coins and carving out a niche in the larger cryptocurrency ecosystem. Conclusion SHIB, DOGE, and 1Fuel each offer unique prospects for investors . Shiba Inu continues to shape a system that extends its meme roots, whereas Dogecoin relies on its legacy and community strength. Meanwhile, 1Fuel is emerging as a functional utility token with the potential to reshape DeFi standards. Ahead of 2025, 1Fuel clearly positions itself as a worthy contender for one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in.

The reason? Understanding and deciphering the market sentiments. Though there are many indicators that help in predicting the movement, most of them are delayed, that is why they are called lagging indicators. Let’s explore the possibility of when Bitcoin can reach $110k. Exploring Bitcoin Chart Before we talk about the sentiment side, let’s have a look at what is happening in Bitcoin right now. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $98,268, just 0.08% up as compared to the last 24 hours. The price rose as high as $99,950 a few hours ago but moving average 100 sent it back down. The current support is MA 200. Also this is a zone where previously BTC had faced high resistance so this will also act as support now. Source : Coinglass The concern here is the RSI which is currently at 53.60 and constantly falling alongside price. The trading volume is down by 17.90% today as well. Even though the Fear and Greed Index was recorded at 79 which is extreme greed, the market sentiment feels bearish. The Market Sentiment The market intelligence platform Santiment shared deep insights in their X post. It has described how Bitcoin plays against market sentiments. On December 15, the social media was filled with speculations of BTC touching $110k, however it topped out at $108k, disappointing the market. Bitcoin has jumped to as high as $99.8K on a bullish Christmas crypto performance. Traders are now swinging bullish once again, with speculation of $110K getting rampant. Historically, we will see $110K Bitcoin only after the crowd doesn't expect it, as this image shows. pic.twitter.com/j4w3VQ4Zio — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 26, 2024 The same thing happened when the crypto was at $104k and there were mentions of it reaching $110k, it backed again. If we analyse the history of Bitcoin movement and compare it with market sentiments, things go in the opposite direction of major market mentions. When the market gets filled with high bearishness, suddenly Bitcoin pumps and vice versa. As people are again going super bullish and market sentiment is of greed, we should expect a price drop and not a rise. As soon as people stop expecting the market to rise it will shock them again. Bitcoin Dominance and Exchange Reserves The market dominance of Bitcoin is at 58.43%. This means investors hold more Bitcoin than other cryptos. Historically, whenever BTC dominance fell below this point the price of BTC followed it, so this particular zone can be said to be a support zone. Currently we can see the price is falling however the dominance is rising, this means soon the money will start flowing out of alts and into the btc. But before that the price must take a correction and create a bearish market sentiment. Source : Tradingview BTC exchange reserve data shows that since February 2024, the reserve has been falling and the price has been increasing. This metric shows how much Bitcoin is at the exchanges. A falling number shows that people are moving their crypto out of the crypto to a cold storage, giving a signal for a bullish momentum. Source : CryptoQuant Zooming into the past few days we can see that the exchange reserves increased for a while. This happened because whales moved out their crypto to sell when the price was above $100k. Now, the downside curve is signaling an upcoming bullish movement again. What to Expect? From what we have already discussed, it should be pretty clear by now that the market moves against the market sentiment. Even though we can see the BTC reserve falling, the price is falling as well but the bitcoin market dominance is rising. This is a clear indication that the market is planning to catch traders by surprise. People will go bearish and open short trades, this is an opportunity for the big and smart traders to capture this money from the market and fill their bags. Nothing of this is financial advice but should be taken as an educational content.

Join the Dogen Army today and conquer the crypto world! PEPE: A Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a cryptocurrency launched as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog meme. It runs on Ethereum and is classified as a memecoin. PEPE does not have practical uses, following the theme of playful assets like Dogecoin. It has no transaction tax and uses mechanisms like token burning to increase rarity. A reward system encourages long-term holding. The coin reached a market cap of $1.6 billion in 2023, gaining attention among crypto users. Its roadmap includes goals for social media exposure and exchange listings. Available on platforms like Binance and Uniswap, it remains popular in the memecoin space. PEPE adapts Ethereum technology, offering secure transactions and decentralized access. BONK: Solana-Based Memecoin with Community Focus BONK is a cryptocurrency built on the Solana blockchain. It features a Shiba Inu mascot and aims to strengthen Solana’s community. Half of BONK’s supply was distributed through airdrops to Solana’s NFT and DeFi users. It gained prominence after a Coinbase listing and became the third-largest memecoin by market cap in late 2023. Its value surged over 10,000% year-to-date. BONK supports the Solana ecosystem with tools like its decentralized exchange, BonkSwap. While its high total supply and price swings are notable challenges, BONK’s role in the growing Solana network gives it utility. Its appeal depends on market trends and its further integration into decentralized applications. Conclusion While PEPE and BONK may offer less short-term potential, DOGEN emerges as the token for those seeking luxury and success. With an expected 700% growth by the end of the presale and aiming for thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows successful tokens like WIF and Popcat, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

In a heartfelt post, Chen shared that his daughter, Mira, was diagnosed with a rare and challenging brain tumor called craniopharyngioma on September 23rd. Despite the lack of a definitive cure for this condition, Chen and his team of researchers have been working tirelessly to support Dr. Hankinson’s lab in identifying promising new drugs to treat Mira’s tumor. Chen’s Christmas Eve post was a plea for help, asking his followers to support Dr. Hankinson’s groundbreaking research. “If not with funds, I would be just as grateful for a repost or a like on this thread,” he wrote. if you could press a button that cures your child’s brain tumor in exchange for ending your life immediately, every parent would hesitate for zero seconds before fighting to be the first to press it the cruelest thing is that no such button exists. but there is always a move pic.twitter.com/mlAbmeOpvx — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 25, 2024 In a remarkable turn of events, just three hours after his post, Siqi shared that the campaign had already raised $75,000, nearing the goal of $100,000. Overwhelmed by the outpouring of support, Chen expressed his gratitude, writing, “Yi and I are in tears. We are so grateful to all of you.” To further encourage donations, Siqi and his family decided to personally match every dollar raised beyond the $75K mark, up to a total of $100,000. This means that if the campaign reaches $200,000, Hankinson Lab will receive at least $300,000, which could be a game changer for research into craniopharyngiomas. going to take the family out for christmas dinner hope this is worth at least $1.80 when i get back pic.twitter.com/41rp8D2jig — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 26, 2024 However, the fundraising efforts took an unexpected twist. In a follow-up post, Chen revealed that a generous supporter had created a memecoin called $MIRA to help with fundraising. The individual, a random stranger, sent half of the total supply of $MIRA to Chen, and within 20 minutes, the memecoin was valued at an astounding $400,000. As of now, Siqi has successfully raised more than $18 million for Dr. Hankinson’s research efforts, with contributions pouring in from across the globe. He expressed his deep gratitude for the community’s support and continued to encourage donations and shares, hoping that every little bit would bring them closer to finding a cure.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-26 06:59:39

As a result, the hackers are promoting suspicious tokens and contracts under the guise of “Animoca Brands issuing new coins”. The Web3 platform popular for its products like Anichess, The Sandbox, PHANTOM GALAXIES, and Crazy Defense Heroes, has issued a warning asking users to stay vigilant. Yat Siu X Account Promotes Fake Solana-based Tokens The X Account of Yat Siu, founder of Animoca Brands, remains compromised promoting a fake token launch on the Solana blockchain. The Web3 platform took cognizance of the matter immediately that there was no official token launch of NFT launch by them. Thus, it has asked users not to engage with any such posts on Yat Siu’s X timeline. The official announcement noted: “Unfortunately, Yat Siu’s social media account has been compromised. There is no official token or NFT launch from Animoca Brands. The token launch on Solana as claimed in a post was made by the hacker. Please DO NOT engage with the account and stay vigilant”. After a temporary suspension by X, the account seems live again. However, an official confirmation from Animoca Brands is yet to come. In recent days, Yat Siu has been active on the X platform while shilling MOCA Coin during this period. As a result, the MOCA price surged all the way to $0.50 on Christmas day with a 200% surge on the weekly chart. However, the MOCA price has retraced nearly 30% from the top and is currently trading at $0.35, down 6% as of press time. Earlier this year, Animoca Brands co-founder said that he sees NFTs and Web3 gaming as key drivers of a transformation in digital ownership. He highlights the convergence of meme coins and NFTs, with technologies like the Ton protocol fostering synergies across the blockchain ecosystem. Animoca Brands Co-Founder Faces Tough Questions Blockchain security investigator ZachXBT has raised concerns over the compromised X account of Animoca Brands’ co-founder. He questioned why didn’t Yat Siu use advanced security measures, such as a hardware security key, to protect his account. A day before Christmas, ZachXBT had flagged concerns with a pattern identification wherein a threat actor uses phishing emails to gain access to high-profile accounts. “Just yesterday, I warned about phishing emails targeting Siu, likely linked to today’s breach,” ZachXBT noted. Reportedly, the same scammer has stolen more than $500,000 over the past month by compromising more than 15 X accounts including the likes of Kick, Cursor, Alex Blania, The Arena, and Brett. This phishing scam involves impersonating the X team to steal credentials and further launch fraudulent meme coins. Last week, hackers gained access to Vivek Ramaswamy’s X account while promoting a fake collaboration between the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) and USUAL stablecoin.

With remarkable gains in November and December, this investment product is on track to end the year with over 300% growth. This year has been a game-changer for XRP, particularly in the final months, fueled by key developments in regulatory and political change. Grayscale XRP Trust’s Recored 300% Gain Since its relaunch in September 2024, the Grayscale XRP Trust has captured attention with a dramatic rise in its share price. The trust started at $10.85 per share and has soared to $45.46, marking a significant return for early investors. Much of this growth is tied to XRP’s late-year rally, heavily influenced by Donald Trump’s pro-crypto sentiment following his election victory. A key driver of this surge is the pro-crypto wave triggered by Donald Trump’s election victory . His promises to support the crypto industry have reignited enthusiasm among investors, resulting in a bullish run for XRP. Additionally, many believe that the ongoing regulatory uncertainties around XRP are beginning to clear. The asset, long embroiled in a legal battle with the SEC, has seen positive developments, including a partial court victory in July 2023. These factors have boosted investor confidence in XRP’s potential. XRP Regulatory Clarity and ETF Hopes The possibility of greater regulatory clarity for XRP is also sparking excitement. There is growing speculation that XRP could soon secure spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), making them more accessible to institutional investors. Analysts suggest that the approval of XRP ETFs could attract billions of dollars in investment, further solidifying the asset’s position in the market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For December 26 , The Push for XRP ETFs The outstanding performance of the Grayscale XRP Trust has sparked discussions about the possibility of spotting XRP ETFs . Prominent crypto influencer Ben Armstrong, also known as Bitboy, recently highlighted the Grayscale XRP Trust’s impressive gains as a catalyst for accelerating ETF approvals. With several asset managers, including Canary Capital and Bitwise, filing applications for spot XRP ETFs, the industry is optimistic about a favorable outcome. If approved, these ETFs could open new doors for institutional participation in XRP. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

38130557,https://invezz.com/?p=2405142,1735196647,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Why iDEGEN’s AI-driven rise outpaces XRP in 2025’s crypto race,https://invezz.com/news/2024/12/26/why-idegens-ai-driven-rise-outpaces-xrp-in-2025s-crypto-race/,"The cryptocurrency market continues its roller-coaster ride, with AI-driven tokens emerging as a dynamic force. Among these, iDEGEN has positioned itself as a game-changer in the AI-based memecoin sector, where its innovative auction presale mechanism redefines market engagement. With growing popularity in the US and UK, iDEGEN is drawing comparisons to established tokens like XRP, which is currently priced at $2.25. Despite XRP’s steady market presence, iDEGEN’s unique model and viral adoption provide compelling reasons for its superior positioning in 2025. iDEGEN’s innovation against XRP’s stability iDEGEN operates on an adaptive auction model where token prices fluctuate every five minutes based on demand. This mechanism has fuelled a total raised amount of $9.18 million, signalling strong market interest before the token even reaches exchanges. By contrast, XRP, trading at $2.25 with a $128.84 billion market cap, has displayed stability through whale accumulation and subdued selling pressure. Despite this, XRP’s recent failure to break past the $3.00 resistance and subsequent triangle consolidation pattern highlights a more cautious growth trajectory. Regarding market activity, iDEGEN thrives on volatility, driving enthusiasm among traders. Its price-adjustment strategy, moving up or down by 5% based on buying momentum, makes it a magnet for speculative investments. XRP, while offering resilience with its investor hold rates and accumulation trends, lacks this level of engagement. For risk-tolerant traders, iDEGEN presents an avenue to ride the volatility wave, while XRP’s appeal remains with long-term holders banking on potential ETF launches or favourable regulatory changes. Why iDEGEN outshines XRP in 2025’s altcoin landscape iDEGEN’s standout feature is its dynamic AI integration, which evolves in real-time. Initially modelled to interact with crypto Twitter, iDEGEN’s AI now engages directly with traders and influencers, creating an ever-expanding network effect. Future updates, including Telegram integration and automated video AI capabilities, promise to amplify its viral appeal. This progressive roadmap has already led to the token trending across social platforms, marking it as a cultural phenomenon in the crypto space. XRP, on the other hand, is primarily driven by macroeconomic catalysts such as potential regulatory clarity and the expectation of an ETF approval. While these factors maintain its relevance, they lack the innovative edge iDEGEN brings to the table. Furthermore, XRP’s technical indicators show mixed signals, with its RSI slightly bullish and stochastic oscillator nearing a crossover. This momentum contrasts sharply with iDEGEN’s aggressive market ascent. Another key difference lies in accessibility and adaptability. iDEGEN’s auction presale ensures equitable price discovery, whereas XRP’s centralised Ripple Labs backing limits its flexibility. This decentralised ethos gives iDEGEN an edge in appealing to the broader crypto community, aligning with the sector’s decentralised finance ideals.

38130861,https://timestabloid.com/?p=53150,1735197047,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Says It’s Biggest Mistake to Ignore XRP This Bull Run,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-its-biggest-mistake-to-ignore-xrp-this-bull-run/,"A prominent market analyst has warned that failing to include XRP in a portfolio during the ongoing bull run may be one of investors’ most significant missed opportunities. Crypto Vilian, a well-known chartist and Cambridge graduate, recently analyzed XRP’s historical price action. In a detailed post on X, he highlighted the asset’s current price movements and compared them to its performance during the late 2017 bull run. XRP’s Market Behavior Mirrors 2017 Patterns Crypto Vilian’s analysis identified similarities between XRP’s current trajectory and its historical pattern that led to its all-time high in early 2018. The market structure outlined in his chart illustrates a sequence of phases: a prolonged bearish decline, a gradual recovery, and a consolidation period. These phases were followed by a significant breakout that propelled XRP to its peak price. According to his findings, XRP appears to follow a similar structure over the past seven years. After breaking out of a long-term bearish trend, the asset has recently entered a recovery and consolidation phase. This pattern and the notable breakout in recent months suggest that XRP could be preparing for another upward surge. Crypto Vilian posited that this breakout, if realized, could push XRP to new all-time highs, potentially replicating the explosive gains seen in the 2017/2018 cycle. Based on his projections, XRP might even surpass a $1 trillion market capitalization during this bull run, equating to a price of over $17. One of the Biggest Mistakes The possibility of a trillion-dollar valuation has sparked widespread attention within the crypto community. Xoom, another respected market commentator, underscored the importance of holding XRP during this cycle. He warned that ignoring the asset now could represent a significant misstep for investors aiming to capitalize on the bull market’s potential. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.24, having declined by approximately 10.51% over the past week due to broader market trends dominated by Bitcoin’s recent downturn. Despite this, the asset remains one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies of the cycle, having reached a seven-year high of $2.90 three weeks ago. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Levels and Caution for Investors Although Crypto Vilian’s analysis presents an optimistic outlook, he stressed that XRP’s performance is closely tied to Bitcoin’s trajectory. A bullish Bitcoin market could propel altcoins, including XRP, to new highs, while a bearish trend might dampen their growth. The analyst identified potential price levels for XRP between $8 and $13, which he considers pivotal targets. The asset could see further gains if these levels are exceeded, reaching the technical target associated with a contracting triangle Elliott wave pattern. Such a move would imply nearly 100x growth from XRP’s lows of $0.30. However, Crypto Vilian cautioned investors against aiming to sell at the exact market top. Instead, he recommended taking profits at key levels during the upward trajectory. “After all, no one went broke taking profits early,” he remarked. As XRP continues to trade within a consolidation phase, market analysts are keeping a close eye on its potential for explosive growth.

Fast forward to today, and we see a strikingly similar scenario in the world of cryptocurrency. BTFD Coin presents an incredible chance for those looking to multiply their gains. With a presale price of just $0.000064, investors can secure a jaw-dropping 837.5% return when BTFD Coin lists at $0.0006. Don’t forget to use the bonus code BIG50 for an extra 50% discount on your purchase! Meme coins have skyrocketed in popularity over the years, captivating both seasoned investors and newbies alike. BTFD Coin is ready to take this phenomenon to the next level. With its innovative play-to-earn (P2E) game , a stellar referral program, and enticing staking rewards, BTFD Coin is poised to tap into the vibrant community that fuels meme coin success. It’s not just about the laughs; it’s about real opportunities to engage and earn. The buzz around BTFD Coin’s presale is palpable, with over $4.5 million raised in just a few weeks. As we dive into the details of BTFD Coin and compare it with other emerging players like Fartcoin and Gigachad, it’s clear that BTFD is not just another meme coin; it’s a serious contender in the market. Let’s explore why BTFD Coin stands out as one of the top meme coin presales to buy now. BTFD Coin: The Rising Star of Meme Coins BTFD Coin is making waves in the cryptocurrency ocean, and for good reason. The presale has gone remarkably well, hitting over $4.5 million in just a month. With 59 billion coins sold and more than 6,600 holders, the community is already buzzing about the potential for massive returns. The current presale price of $0.000064, available due to a significant 50% discount, is hard to ignore. Investors can leverage the presale stage to buy in at this discount before the anticipated price jump to $0.0006 upon listing. What does this mean in practical terms? If you invest $40,000 at the current price, you’d snag a whopping 625 million BTFD coins. When the coin hits the expected listing price, that investment could balloon to $375,000! That’s a staggering 837.5% return on your investment, making it one of the top meme coin presales to buy now. But it’s not just about the numbers. BTFD Coin is designed with community engagement in mind. Through its P2E game, users can earn while having fun, and the referral program incentivises spreading the word. The staking rewards offer passive income opportunities, creating a well-rounded investment strategy that resonates with both casual and serious investors. Don’t forget the bonus code BIG50! This code grants you an additional 50% discount when you buy. It’s a smart move to use this code while you can, as it amplifies your purchasing power during the presale. The excitement around BTFD Coin is infectious, and being part of its journey could be one of the best decisions you make this year. Fartcoin: A Meme Coin with a Twist Next up is Fartcoin, a project that’s garnered attention for its quirky branding and community-driven initiatives. While Fartcoin may not have the same financial clout as BTFD, it’s certainly carving out a niche in the meme coin arena. The project has a playful approach, appealing to those who love to embrace the lighter side of cryptocurrency. Fartcoin has been gaining traction, especially among younger investors who appreciate its humorous take on the crypto landscape. The project leverages social media and community events to rally support and boost visibility. Although it pales in comparison to BTFD’s presale success, Fartcoin still has a loyal following ready to ride the wave of its growth. However, the critical distinction lies in the utility and structure of Fartcoin. Unlike BTFD, which boasts a robust P2E game and staking rewards, Fartcoin primarily thrives on its meme culture. This could limit its long-term potential, especially as investors increasingly seek coins that offer tangible benefits beyond just a laugh. As meme coins continue to rise and fall, Fartcoin’s success will hinge on its ability to maintain community engagement and find innovative ways to enhance its value proposition. For now, it’s a fun project but may not be the top choice for those looking to invest seriously. If you want solid returns, BTFD Coin remains the top meme coin presale to buy now. Gigachad: The Heavyweight Contender Enter Gigachad, another name that’s been making headlines in the meme coin sphere. With a focus on building a community around strength and empowerment, Gigachad has attracted a dedicated fan base. Its branding is sharp, and its community initiatives are designed to foster loyalty and engagement. Gigachad has also embraced the meme culture, using humour and relatability to connect with potential investors. The project has received attention for its unique approach, and it’s doing well in the presale arena. However, when compared to BTFD Coin, the differences become apparent. While Gigachad is gaining traction, it lacks the comprehensive ecosystem that BTFD Coin offers. The P2E game, staking options, and rewarding referral programme set BTFD apart as the more enticing option for investors. Gigachad may be fun, but it’s BTFD’s real-world utility that could lead to substantial returns. Investors looking for the top meme coin presales to buy now should consider what each project brings to the table. Gigachad’s community-driven approach is commendable, but when it comes to potential returns and innovative features, BTFD Coin is the clear winner. How to Buy BTFD Coin Go to the Presale Page Click “Connect Wallet” and select your wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet). Locate the Bonus code field, enter BIG50, and click “Apply”. Input the amount of $BTFD you want to buy and review the discounted price. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as a beacon of opportunity in the meme coin landscape. With its presale success, innovative features, and a vibrant community, it’s hard to ignore the potential for massive returns. The current presale price of $0.000064, along with the 50% discount from the BIG50 bonus code, makes this an unmissable chance. As the presale progresses, more investors are joining the movement, and the excitement is palpable. With $4.5 million raised and counting, BTFD Coin’s trajectory is set for success. If you’re serious about finding the top meme coin presales to buy now, look no further than BTFD Coin. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your future in the crypto world. Don’t miss out on this golden opportunity to invest in a project that’s poised for greatness!

However, it was stopped there and pushed south by a few grand amid reports of a growing number of investors realizing profits. What Needs to Change The analytics company Santiment has frequently reasserted the importance of the overall crowd expectations for the underlying asset’s prices. But, what happens is usually the opposite of the general anticipation. The developments in the past 48 hours have only solidified their theory. BTC’s price went from around $94,000 on Christmas Eve to just shy of $100,000 yesterday evening, but its rally was halted at that point, and the asset is back to $98,000 now. Santiment indicated that “traders are now swinging bullish once again, with speculations of $110K getting rampant.” Although this might sound bullish for bitcoin at first, the company reaffirmed its belief that the cryptocurrency tends to oppose what the majority expects by saying, “Historically, we will see $100K Bitcoin only after the crowd doesn’t expect it.” ‍ Bitcoin has jumped to as high as $99.8K on a bullish Christmas crypto performance. Traders are now swinging bullish once again, with speculation of $110K getting rampant.

Data shared by Ali Martinez shows that on December 23 alone, they had realized more than $7 billion in bitcoin profits.

He noted that 1.51 million wallets have spent nearly $150 billion to turn that level into support now. Usually, when new investors see their positions go into red, they tend to start panic selling, which is why it’s important for BTC to remain above $97,300.

As reported by a Japanese media outlet, the government of Japan, on Dec. 20, released its official answer to several queries Senator Satoshi Hamada put forward concerning the adoption of Bitcoin ( BTC ) as part of Japan’s foreign exchange reserves. Under the name of Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru, the statement explained that, at present, Japan has no intention of considering cryptocurrency reserves.

The government responded that it does not have enough knowledge about global movements in that respect and said that discussions on the adoption of cryptocurrencies for reserves are in very preliminary stages. That is, the government has said it would be “difficult to express a view” on this at this point. The response also mentioned that, under Japan’s legal system for special account management, cryptocurrencies such as BTC do not fall under the category of foreign exchange assets. Moreover, a “crypto asset” is not regarded as a “security” pursuant to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act under Japanese law . The Payment Services Act provides the definition of “crypto assets” and requires any provider of crypto-asset exchange service (CAES) to register with the Financial Services Agency. Operating CAES without registration entails criminal penalties, says Anderson Mori & Tomotsune, a full-service law firm in Japan.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN.

This raised the total number of collateral assets supported to over 80 and added more versatility to the trading platform. Amongst those newly included assets were the likes of PEPE, BONK, SUI, DAI, AAVE, and many more, allowing access to numerous strategies touching borrow, margin, and futures trading. With the expansion, it looks to focus on remaining relevant in the changing cryptocurrency market. The exchange boasts up to 5.5 million users and brands itself as a one-stop solution for retail and institutional traders. Moreover, through expansion and offering an expanded range of collateral assets on the platform, it seeks to enhance the user’s ability to risk manage while using many other trading strategies. WhiteBIT Expands Collateral Offering with 60 New Cryptocurrencies WhiteBIT’s expansion in offerings is largely driven by the growing demand for such features within the industry as noted by the company. With the new additions, It supports more than 80 collaterals, allowing users to choose a variety of assets for their margin and futures trading. This further highlights the increasing demand for the assets including PEPE, BONK, SUI, DAI, AAVE, as well as many others. While other traders like the niche collaterals of newer tokens that are in contrast to major leans on trading such as bitcoin and Ethereum, such flexibility WhiteBIT is propagating this through its extension. When it tosses these assets into its system, then WhiteBIT has expanded platform capabilities that enable different types of trading. With new opportunities coming in, users can now use tokens such as PEPE or BONK for more questionable trades or for stablecoins like DAI to encrypt trade in case of fluctuating prices. The focus on bringing in these new collateral assets points to the ability of this exchange to adapt and innovate in a competitive surrounding. The exchange is based on the customer-focused approach which allows both retail clients as well as institutional customers getting access to many advanced trading features that require greater liquidity, such as leveraged trades and margin loans from a very limited number of tokens. The Growing Importance of Collateral in Cryptocurrency Trading The fact that there are more than 80 assets integrated as collateral on WhiteBIT shows how important this collateral is in our cryptocurrency exchange era. The key benefit that WhiteBIT will benefit from is the opportunity to provide users with options that would best fit their risk profiles by using different assets. This is largely due to the use of collaterals in margin, futures trading, and other activities through leveraging cryptocurrency ownership as a crucial aspect of the ecosystem. Currently, with a new type of collateral framework introduced in WhiteBIT, users can now diversify their risk on a relatively wider range of assets instead of basing it on a few. Additionally, the system allows immediate marking to market of collateral that helps traders keep track of their open positions in case their trades were liquidated. This comes in especially handy where prices become very volatile and change promptly. The increase in collateral that is provided over the counter exchange is a strategy that more and more of the cryptocurrency exchanges are adopting as they seek to improve their platforms and reach more people. By allowing several collaterals, WhiteBIT becomes a simple exchange that meets the needs of both first-time traders and those relatively familiar with trading. Additionally, 60 new assets can be used for crypto lending , unlocking new opportunities for those looking to invest and earn income effectively. Crypto Lending allows you to lend your cryptocurrencies to WhiteBIT by selecting a flexible plan of 30, 90, 180, or 360 days. It offers the opportunity to earn up to 13.49% annual income in the same cryptocurrency you lend. This unique tool is ideal for crypto traders seeking to grow their assets with minimal risk. WhiteBIT Spot and Futures Trading Volumes, and WBT Token Performance WhiteBIT has become the first cryptocurrency exchange to obtain a Level 3 certification under the Cryptocurrency Security Standard (CCSS) . It continues to perform strongly in both spot and futures trading markets. The platform’s spot trading volume has surpassed $6.1 billion in the last 24 hours, reflecting its prominence in the European cryptocurrency market. This robust volume is fueled by the recent expansion of collateral options, attracting a wide range of traders. Apart from spot trading, WhiteBIT’s future market has also been quite active as it has registered over $17.2 billion in trading volume in the last 24 hours. The exchange also provides 181 futures contracts and this makes it easy for traders who wish to take up leveraged positions and apply more intricate strategies. Meanwhile, its native token WBT price has maintained a solid performance. Trading at $25, WBT experienced a slight 1% dip in the last 24 hours. Despite this, the token boasts a market cap of $2.17 billion and remains a key component of its ecosystem. The combination of strong trading volumes and WBT’s steady performance reinforces its status as a leading platform for both retail and institutional traders.

The South Korean government has announced sanctions on the 313 Bureau, a North Korean cyber unit involved in widespread crypto theft. In a Dec. 26 public statement , the government noted that the bureau, which operates under the North Korean Ministry of National Defense, has been linked to numerous cyberattacks aimed at stealing digital assets from around the world. South Korean officials cite data by U.S. blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, which claims that North Korea is responsible for more than 60% of global crypto theft in 2024, totaling a record $1.3 billion. These stolen funds are believed to be funneled into North Korea’s weapons programs, including its missile and nuclear development initiatives. In addition to targeting the 313 Bureau, the sanctions also cover 15 North Korean IT personnel and one related institution. The South Korean government says these individuals and organizations are accused of engaging in foreign currency-earning activities abroad, which directly contribute to the regime’s nuclear and missile programs. “In particular, North Korean IT personnel, working under the Ministry of National Defense and other regime-affiliated organizations, are dispatched to countries in China, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Africa.” South Korea’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs You might also like: US shuts down North Korean crypto laundering network The move comes just three days after crypto.news reported that the United States and South Korea are working together to create new mechanisms to prevent crypto thefts linked to North Korea.

The thread reached more than 133,000 users, with many asking Chen to share his crypto wallet addresses, including Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. Not long after, Chen stated that someone launched a meme coin named after his daughter on the Solana network to help raise money for the brain tumor research. uh so some random guy 20 minutes made a SOL memecoin called $MIRA to help with research fundraising and sent me half the entire supply and it's now worth like $400K and i literally don't know what to do because i certainly don't want to rug a bunch of random people https://t.co/P78bLq52fB — Siqi Chen (@blader) December 26, 2024 You might also like: New Binance listings ‘god candle’ led by ACT and PNUT The token developer sent Chen half of its entire supply, which is worth $400,000 at the time. Though, he expressed he was hesitant in selling the tokens because he does not want to rug pull the people who invested in the meme coin. Despite people in the comments saying they donated their funds to MIRA willingly. In the end, Chen declared that he plans to sell 10% of the supply and use 5% of the tokens for Hankinson Lab research, which is worth $49,263. He intends to hold onto the other 5%, adding that he will not be selling more than that without a 24-hour prior notice. He also clarifies that all proceeds will go to funding research for the rare brain tumor at Hankinson Lab and that his family will not receive a single cent from the token. “I just want to say that whoever said crypto has no legitimate use cases, you can tell them that funding for rare disease research is a pretty legitimate use case,” said Chen.

Accordingly, ZachXBT announced that the X account of Yat Siu, co-founder and president of blockchain gaming giant Animoca Brands, was hacked. ZachXBT also noted that the hacker promoted a fake token from Yat Sui's account. Hacker Siu introduced a Solana-based memecoin called Animoca Brands (MOCA), which shares the name of the company's Mocaverse non-fungible token (NFT) collection launched on Pump.fun from his account. The post was later deleted. According to the data, the fake MOCA token reached a market value of $36,700 shortly after it was shared from Siu’s account, but then crashed. Animoca Brands confirmed the hack and fake token launch, stating: “Unfortunately, Siu’s social media account has been compromised. In a shared post, the alleged token launch on Solana was done by the hacker.” This hack also negatively affected the altcoin called The Sandbox (SAND). Having fallen by 8% in the last 24 hours, SAND ranked first among the altcoins that fell the most. https://twitter.com/animocabrands/status/1872094029451772161 *This is not investment advice.

On the other hand, Ethereum shows signs of outperforming Bitcoin in 2025 due to a potential breakout in the ETH/BTC ratio and increasing inflows into ETH-based ETFs. Adding to Bitcoin’s momentum, Israel is launching six Bitcoin-tracking funds next week, and Russia is embracing Bitcoin for global trade as part of its efforts to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. Binance Reserves Signal Investor Confidence in Bitcoin Bitcoin (BTC) reserves on Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, have dropped to levels not seen since January of 2024, right before a 90% surge in Bitcoin’s price by March. Bitcoin currently trades close to $98,160, and some analysts suggest that a similar trajectory could see its price reaching $187,500 in the coming months. The decline in reserves dipped below 570,000 BTC according to CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost , and it is considered to be a bullish signal because investors typically move Bitcoin into cold storage during periods of long-term confidence. Binance Bitcoin exchange reserve (Source: CryptoQuant ) This trend is very similar to early 2024 when Binance’s reserves also plummeted before Bitcoin’s price surged to a then all-time high of $73,679 on March 13. According to Darkfost, withdrawals from exchanges often signal positive momentum building in the market, and current conditions align with this historical pattern. Despite this, Bitcoin’s dominance stands at 58.40%, just shy of the critical 60% level, which analysts like Into The Cryptoverse founder Benjamin Cowen believe could trigger a rotation toward other crypto assets. Cowen predicted Bitcoin dominance will reach 60% by December, a milestone it last achieved on Oct. 30. Bitcoin faced some challenges holding above the psychological $100,000 level since first breaking it on Dec. 5. The price stayed below this mark since Dec. 19, after reaching a new high of $108,300 on Dec. 17. Bitcoin’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, predicts that Bitcoin’s price could surpass $105,000 once liquidity returns after the holiday season. He believes the current downtrend is due to typical holiday illiquidity and expects increased market activity post-Christmas. For this week, Lee predicted that Bitcoin will likely trade within the $94,000 to $105,000 range. Israel to Launch Six Bitcoin Funds Bitcoin’s price could also receive a nice boost from the launch of six Bitcoin-tracking funds next week in Israel after the approval by the Israel Securities Authority. These funds will be available for purchase at banks and investment firms from Dec. 31, and will mirror Bitcoin's price movements by using various indexes and strategies. Among the funds, some will track U.S.-based Bitcoin ETFs, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), while one will be actively managed to outperform Bitcoin’s performance. The funds will also be managed by leading Israeli firms like Phoenix Investment, IBI-Kessem, Meitav, More, Ayalon, and Migdal, and will charge management fees ranging from 0.25% to 1.5%. The regulatory approval came after two years of requests from asset managers asking for local investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin using Israel’s fiat currency, the shekel. Transactions will initially be processed once daily, and will reflect Bitcoin’s price at the time of execution. Eyal Haim, vice president of Ayalon Mutual Funds, shared that their investment house wanted to engage with the digital currency sector for a long time now by offering mutual funds tied to companies in the field. Since May, Israel also made strides in progressing on its central bank digital currency initiative, the Digital Shekel Challenge . This project plans to encourage innovation by encouraging participants to develop real-time payment systems by using the digital shekel. The Bank of Israel offers a sandbox environment for testing. A key objective of the digital shekel initiative is to increase competition among local banks. While the project has received public support, there are still some concerns about privacy. Russia Embraces Bitcoin for Global Trade Russia is advancing its use of digital financial assets (DFAs), including Bitcoin, in foreign trade as part of its strategy to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov shared these developments in a recent interview on Russia-24, and revealed that legislation has been passed to allow these transactions under an experimental legal framework that was established in September of 2024. According to Siluanov, the adoption of DFAs, like Bitcoin, offers a modern and innovative approach to international settlements. He even described it as a vision for the future of global trade. According to the finance minister, Russia already initiated foreign trade transactions using DFAs and plans to scale these efforts in the coming year. Siluanov also pointed out that Bitcoin mined in the country could be used in these transactions. This shift is made possible by Russia’s legalization of Bitcoin mining earlier in the year, which paved the way for its use in regulated trade operations. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov Despite advocating for the use of digital assets in trade, Siluanov still maintained a more cautious stance on cryptocurrency investments. In November, he warned against speculative investment in cryptocurrencies due to their volatility and the risks involved. Russia’s experimentation with DFAs builds on its earlier efforts to regulate digital assets. The country officially recognized Bitcoin as a digital financial asset in 2021 under the ”On Digital Financial Assets” law, which granted it legal status while restricting its use as a payment method in the nation. Ether Gears Up to Outpace Bitcoin in 2025 Despite these developments, Ethereum (ETH) is showing signs of outperforming Bitcoin as 2025 approaches, according to crypto analysts. The ETH/BTC ratio , which is currently close to 0.0356, has attracted a lot of attention. MN Capital founder Michael van de Poppe suggested it could break above 0.04 in January 2025. The last time this level was reached was on Dec. 8, when ETH’s price climbed just above $4,000. Van de Poppe expects increased inflows into Ether, potentially accompanied by outflows from Bitcoin. This could lead to Bitcoin price consolidation and trigger an “altcoin run.” Supporting this outlook, Ethereum-based tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mantle (MNT) recently saw impressive gains after recently rising by 7+% and 3+%, respectively. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is still trading below $100,000 after first breaching the six-figure mark on Dec. 5. Analysts also pointed out the growing potential of spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Nate Geraci , president of ETF Store, shared that net inflows into ETH ETFs are keeping pace with gold ETFs and are expected to accelerate. Similarly, pseudonymous trader Brent described Ethereum as an undervalued asset, and also compared its potential to a submerged ball ready to surge upward. This optimism aligns with earlier views that Ethereum’s underperformance relative to Bitcoin may be concluding. Benjamin Cowen , founder of Into The Cryptoverse, stated in early December that the ETH/BTC collapse appears to be over, and predicted a stronger performance for Ethereum over the next 6 to 12 months. These factors all point to a promising start to 2025 for Ether.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-26 07:28:20

Crypto traders are pointing to Avalanche ( AVAX ) and Toncoin ( TON ) as these two solid crypto projects are showing signs of recovery. While optimism surrounding AVAX and TON is strong, investors look further for projects with immediate upside potential. Right now, these crypto traders have set their sights on Rollblock’s presale , as it has accumulated over $7.6 million within a short period. This highlights Rollblock’s explosive growth potential, as it captures attention most tokens can only dream of in the crypto space. Let’s investigate why the Rollblock presale is stealing the spotlight as AVAX and TON gear up for their next move. Rollblock presale hits stage 9: Large investors flock in with more gains ahead Rollblock’s ICO launch is making waves in the crypto market, with its new GambleFi protocol attracting significant whale investment. Unsurprisingly, Rollblock is delivering the goods by bringing two coveted values, trust and transparency, into the iGambling sectors. With its innovation on the reliable Ethereum chain, Rollblock is redefining the way online gambling is perceived while ensuring a top-notch gaming experience. This is the game-changer punters have been searching for! Rollblock uses its Ethereum-backed security protocol to ensure that there are no data breaches. Even better, Rollblock ensures that all 7,000 gaming titles on its crypto casino are regulated and audited by top providers like Gaming Anjouan and SolidProof, providing an additional layer of security. Rollblock also appeals to AVAX and TON investors with its unique revenue-sharing model. As part of this system, Rollblock distributes up to 30% of its casino profits. Holders receive the first 40% of this allocation through staking rewards, while the remaining 60% is used for token buybacks that are burned immediately, taking its price to new heights. AVAX price to surge 50% as positive news builds momentum towards $60 The AVAX price has only found new lows since it touched down on its yearly high of $62.38 in March. At one point in the AVAX price decline, it lost 120% as it found a support level at $20. However, based on positive news on the synthetic dollar deUSD coming to Avalanche in collaboration with Securitize, the AVAX price has entered a recovery phase as it trades in the $35 consolidation range. From all indications, the AVAX price is steadily climbing toward its yearly high after its recent breakthrough above a major resistance level. Toncoin to soar amid prolonged range bound price movements The Toncoin’s recent price action has been volatile, with sharp fluctuations in support and resistance levels. Moreover, TON has undergone a 65% slump after reaching its all-time high of $8.25 in June. Several crypto analysts believe that TON is on track to bounce back after briefly falling below $5. These experts see an inverted heads and shoulders on TON’s price charts, suggesting a positive slow and steady trend reversal. When it comes to this move, savvy investors are still cautious not to jump in when the move is still in its early phase. Conclusion Despite AVAX and TON’s signs of market bullishness, Rollblock presale is undoubtedly the highlight of the current market opportunity for traders seeking immediate profit and long-term value. Interestingly, the Rollblock presale is live and active at $0.043. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Ripple CTO Comments on “10x Times” Phrase Schwartz posted an image of a plastic can labeled “Pre-Mix Bubble Solution,” which advertised “10x times the bubbles.” Rather than focusing solely on the claim of a 10x increase, Schwartz highlighted the grammatical redundancy of the phrase. His tweet drew attention from the XRP community , prompting speculation about whether it was a subtle hint toward XRP’s price trajectory. In response, community members debated the implications of a potential 10x increase in XRP’s price. Some interpreted the tweet as a possible reference to XRP reaching $10, while others engaged in broader discussions about the token’s future performance. Ripple Moves 90 Million XRP in Major Transfers Over the weekend, the blockchain tracking platform Whale Alert reported two large XRP transfers conducted by Ripple. The transactions, totaling 90 million XRP, were valued at approximately $200 million. The first transfer involved 50 million XRP worth $111.7 million, while the second moved 40 million XRP valued at $89.7 million. Both transactions were executed within one minute, and the destination wallets for these transfers remain unidentified. In addition, Whale Alert documented other significant XRP transactions totaling 182 million XRP with an aggregate fiat value of $411 million. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analyst Highlights Key Levels for XRP Price Movement Crypto market analyst Ali Martinez recently identified $2.20 as a critical price level for XRP. Posting on his X account, Martinez suggested that XRP could consolidate at this level before attempting a move toward the next resistance at $2.70. However, the analyst also warned that a failure to maintain support at $2.20 could result in a decline to $1.96. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.24, showing minimal price movement after its recent rally. XRP’s Recent Price Fluctuations Last week, XRP experienced a sharp decline, losing over 20% of its value. The token fell from $2.71 to $1.96 before recovering over the weekend to its current price of $2.26. This volatility has kept traders and analysts closely watching the market for further developments. As discussions about XRP’s potential continue to unfold, Schwartz’s tweet and Ripple’s significant token transfers have added fuel to the speculation surrounding the cryptocurrency’s trajectory. Whether XRP can achieve the speculated 10x growth remains uncertain, but the community remains actively engaged in analyzing the token’s performance.

CEOs like Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong and Ripple’s Brad Garlinghouse experienced major financial gains after the election results. Armstrong, for example, earned an additional $129 million from stock sales, while Coinbase’s market value surged by $21 billion. Armstrong’s stake in Coinbase increased by nearly $2 billion, bringing its total value to $6.4 billion. Coinbase also made a notable political contribution, donating $74 million to various political action committees (PACs) to support the election. Armstrong’s stock sales were part of his diversification strategy, ensuring continued control over his company. Ripple’s Garlinghouse saw even more dramatic gains after the value of XRP, the company’s native token, soared from $0.50 to $2.32 post-election. This surge in XRP’s value led to a 54.7% increase in its market cap over the past 30 days, sending it to the third position among all digital assets. Garlinghouse also owns more than 6% of Ripple and a significant amount of XRP, which has now increased in value by over three times since the election. “The crypto market is up over $1 trillion since Trump won — that’s the price of Gensler’s foot on the neck of the market, and he’s not even officially gone yet,” Garlinghouse told Coindesk. Although Ripple Labs’ private valuation was last estimated at around $11 billion earlier this year, the election has likely increased the value of Garlinghouse’s stake, causing his personal wealth to soar. Additionally, major investors in crypto firms such as Andreessen Horowitz (A16Z) also enjoyed major gains, outpacing their election-related investments. Ripple and A16Z each donated tens of millions to political causes, with Ripple contributing $73 million and A16Z $70 million.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-26 07:41:15

It hugely impacted the firm’s operation and despite several attempts to recover the funds DMM Bitcoin failed to restore their customer money. As a result, the company decided to stop its business operations and focus on transferring customer accounts to a more secure platform. Growing hack incidents are creating panic in the market reflecting the worse side of investing in digital assets. DMM Bitcoin’s Strategic Steps to Address the Situation In response to the breach and the challenges of recovering from it, DMM Bitcoin announced a plan to liquidate its operations and transfer all customer accounts and assets to SBI VC Trade, a crypto exchange operated by SBI Group. This transfer is scheduled to be completed by March 2025. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO And Crypto Moguls Enjoy Billions in Wealth Growth After Trump’s Election , Ripple’s Role in the Transfer Recently to streamline the account transition process SBI VC Trade, roped its partner Ripple to help DMM Bitcoin’s users by ensuring that their accounts and assets would be safely transferred. Ripple’s involvement adds an extra layer of trust, given SBI’s long-standing relationship with the blockchain company and its reputation for secure digital asset management. This means that DMM Bitcoin users won’t need to open new accounts with SBI, as their existing assets will be transferred directly. Plus, SBI stated they will offer 14 new crypto products to the users, although crypto-to-crypto trading pairs ETH/BTC and leveraged trading will not be included in the offerings, focusing on safer and more stable options for users. This strategic move by DMM Bitcoin aims to restore customer faith and provide a secure environment for trading, while SBI VC Trade’s expertise in handling such transfers ensures a smooth transition for affected users. This incident shows that the crypto exchanges need better security to safeguard their customer funds many hacking incidents are coming majorly from North Korea signaling they know the loopholes in the system and it should be a lesson for other crypto firms. Moreover, Japan’s anti-crypto take on Bitcoin reserve plans can also impact the crypto in the country in a current Bitcoin market scenario. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The community dubbed ETH killer picked up gains in price and on-chain activity alongside other altcoins. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) continued to move sideways, losing strength in overall market dominance. SOL Price Soars 6% Solana’s price is up 6.1% in the last 72 hours alongside surging network activities boosting trading volumes. The asset trades at $194.59, soaring to a market cap above $93 billion. SOL bulls have also picked up new assets and are spotting positive on-chain factors. The new accumulation and offload to other custodians point to possible long-term holdings away from sell pressures. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dominance has fallen since it touched its all-time high above $107K. The top crypto’s outflows led to large losses, with traders losing positions. Bitcoin pulled its worst daily trading after the last bull peak on Dec 23, sliding 1.7%. From that point, altcoins have picked up 4.5% of the total BTC ratio, signaling signs of capital flow. This led to a surge in SOL price, an asset tipped to lead the altcoin season. Solana’s rising institutional demand is a major reason for the price gains above other top assets. Traditionally, SOL outpaces the market during bull seasons. Apart from its institutional flows, Solana’s decentralized finance activities continue its forward trajectory with soaring assets under management (AUM). Furthermore, Solana meme coins have attracted a buzz to the ecosystem from its Q1 frenzy to last month’s gains. Meanwhile, Trader Tardigrade wrote on X on SOL, completing a pullback. “ #Solana could potentially have completed the Pullback. $SOL has fallen onto a Supporting Confluence, which comprises of an Ascending Trendline and a horizontal level from a previous top. Early signs of price rejection and rebound have also been observed at the level, giving more confidence in completing the pullback.” Altcoins Records Significant Growth The market correction led to altcoin declines, wiping out gains recorded in November. The outcome of the US elections saw traders pitch a possible altcoin season at the start of 2025. Capital outflows from Bitcoin will characterize an altcoin season as compared to other crypto assets. In the last 24 hours, Ethereum rose 2%, while XRP regained 4% after sharp declines. Cardano and Tron increased 1%, respectively, while meme coins picked up slightly higher gains as traction builds in the ecosystem.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-26 07:50:44

According to ScamSniffer , the attack was uncovered after a user complained of being led to a fake Pudgy Penguins site through a Singapore news site. Subsequent research showed that this case is part of a malicious advertising campaign aimed at deceiving Web3 wallet users. The Attack Mechanism That Is Quite Sophisticated The high novelty of the campaign is that the Google Ad Network is being used to spread phishing messages. These ads run unpleasant scripts stored in the Adloox tracking domain with the extension .com. In its current form, the code incorporated in the ads searches the users’ browsers for Web3 wallets. If a wallet is found, the user gets transferred to a fake Pudgy Penguins site – pudqypenguin[.]com – which is created only to capture wallet credentials. Although at this moment, it looks like the creators of this campaign focus on Pudgy Penguins NFT users, it is indicated that the same approach can be used against any other Web3 project. This is why the attack remains worrisome to the general crypto world given the flexibility it promises to attackers. The attack also reveals that sites using Prebid.js , a header bidding application programming interface library, may be vulnerable . When these sites use the Adloox analytics module, they run the risk of transmitting scripts in the ads to the user, a clear sign of malware existence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Joins SBI VC Trade to Secure DMM Bitcoin Users Post-Hack , Steps Toward Mitigation As a result of this event, calls for users to be cautious in their interaction with Web3 interfaces have rapidly intensified. To avoid or reduce interaction with such threats, it is suggested to install ad blockers, open cryptocurrency-related sites, and use associated wallets in another browser.

The Tron Network executive has driven several reactions from the community due to on-chain digital asset movements and partnerships to drive wider adoption. Ethereum continues sideways movement after its price correction alongside Bitcoin. Justin Sun Stress Long-term ETH Holdings In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Justin Sun quelled concerns about offloading part of his Ethereum holdings. Crypto enthusiasts flagged large amounts of ETH flowing from Sun’s wallet to HTX. Fund transfers included assets from Lido Finance and EtherFi, increasing the sale rumours. However, Sun noted that it wasn’t a sale but merely a transfer between wallets. Generally, transfers from other custodians to exchanges are characterized as potential sales due to the ease of transactions, while movements to other custodians signify long-term holdings. The transfer to HTX sparked these concerns, mounting the shift in sentiments. The Tron executive remains bullish on the second-largest cryptocurrency with previous asset movements. However, Sun has moved 108,919 ETH to HTX after the November polls. These inflows came from the price jump that followed Donald Trump’s victory. Bitcoin hit new highs above 90K, driving up other crypto assets. Although Ethereum didn’t hit an all-time high, the largest altcoin attracted huge inflows, taking the price above $4K. This led to some traders recouping gains as the wider market’s profit-taking surged. On the other hand, some traders want mega bullish on the asset, tipping a price surge above $5K to end the year. “ The rumors circulating online about us liquidating ETH are false. This is simply a transfer of ETH between our different wallets. We remain long-term bullish on the Ethereum ecosystem,” Justin Sun tweeted. What’s Next For ETH Price? The last few days have been bearish for ETH prices and other crypto assets. Total liquidation topped $2 billion, sparking doubts over more peaks in the bull cycle. Despite negative trading, hourly trading shows a resurgence of positive signals as many metrics remain green. Ethereum has posted slight gains in the last 24 hours, while other top altcoins have pulled larger numbers. A major reason for the drive in ETH remains institutional investor activities taking funds to a string of weekly inflows. Altcoin traders are still warned about a patch of sideways trading before a bull swing.",Cryptocurrency|News|Justin Sun|Tron News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-26 07:59:19

Zeberg tells his 171,400 followers on the social media platform X that Solana ( SOL ) may be about to surge after a retracement. The analyst uses the Elliott Wave theory to forecast a massive run for Solana. The theory states that an asset tends to witness a five-wave rally with wave three being the longest and the strongest move up. “Altseason has begun and is now about to move into its most explosive phase. Solana has been leading after a strong wave two pullback. It should now begin its most powerful move up towards its final target.” Solana is trading at $196 at time of writing, down 5.5% in the last seven days. Zeberg also believes altcoins will now start outperforming Bitcoin ( BTC ) during this phase of the market cycle. “Wave three in alts now beginning. Hold on!” The analyst predicts Bitcoin will head higher in the short term as 2025 kicks off. “BTC update! Just touched down on daily 50-day simple moving average. Still see this as a potential wave two in a rising wedge. It is my working hypothesis. We should see a nice rally into early January!” Bitcoin is trading for $98,871 at time of writing, flat on the day.

Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin Donates 10 Million THB According to an official post by Thailand’s Khao Kheow Open Zoo on December 26, Vitalik Buterin has joined the Wildlife Sponsorship Program and adopted famous pygmy hippo Moo Deng. “I am delighted to accept your invitation to be Moo Deng’s adoptive father while she grows up, and to donate the zoo in her name no less than 10,000,000 THB.” Ethereum co-founder donated 10,000,000 Thai baht to support Moo Deng and her family at the zoo. This came as a support for the Khao Kheow Open Zoo Wildlife Adoption Project. The layout plan shows a total build-up area of 1,600 square meters.

At press time, ETH trades at $3,392, a 1% gain in the last 24 hours and a huge 14% weekly decline. The drop below $3,500 sparked outflows and negative reactions from the community. However, this led to new trade positions and speculations among traders with few days to 2025. This month, Ethereum bulls market $5,000 as a price to end the year; while this looked high, a slight recovery can propel the asset in the coming days. Analyst Flags Bullish ETH Metrics Despite sell pressures, a new CryptoQuant report shows several green zone metrics for Ethereum. The asset’s funding rates are averagely positive. This becomes crucial to know the long-term sentiment in the ecosystem. Present funding rates show that the long position remains dominant on average. An extreme funding rate can spark huge liquidations in anticipation of future sell pressures. Secondly, Ethereum’s institutional fund holdings have grown in recent weeks. The move away from the narrative has ignited whales to make key accumulations, tipping a steady market inflow. Last week, ETH products bagged $51.3 million in inflows, with yearly figures soaring to $4.5 billion. Most consecutive institutional flows were on the back of its staking feature and projected altcoin rally. “ …the Korea Premium Index for Ethereum, which measures the price gap between South Korean exchanges and those in other regions, has not only turned positive but is also showing a substantial premium. This shift highlights the Korean market’s growing interest in Ethereum and bodes well for overall market sentiment,” the analysts added. Furthermore, Ethereum’s Estimated Leverage Ratio is still at its peak, signifying a further price jump despite the fact that it leaves room for risks. The metric shows institutional investors’ propensity to high leverage in the derivatives market. These factors have propelled speculations for a bull swing around the ecosystem. Similarly, a bull run for Bitcoin in January will lead to the altcoin season, a cycle marked by fund flows to Ethereum and other assets. While these factors point north, the asset has recorded sharp outflows in the last two days as bears grip the market. Total liquidations have topped $2 billion since the last dip.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-26 08:08:03

Has the Santa Rally begun?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/stocks-crypto-gains-santa-rally/,"The Santa Rally could have already started, and this year, it’s packing a punch. Every trader worth their salt knows about the magic week that starts on Christmas Eve and stretches to New Year’s Eve. It’s a golden time for the S&P 500, with an average return of 1.3%—a track record that’s hard to argue with. Monday alone saw the index jump by 1.1%, cruising back above the 6,000 mark. History has spoken, and it’s clear: December loves a good rally. Since 2009, only three years—2015, 2016, and 2023—failed to deliver gains during this festive window. Data from the Carson Group shows the rally often comes alive later in the month. And if you zoom out to December 15–31, the S&P 500 has posted a median return of 1.4% since 1950. The odds of back-to-back losses during this stretch are slim, happening only twice in the last 74 years. If the index pulls off another gain, it’ll keep its record of finishing this period higher 80% of the time intact. Equity inflows, options frenzy, and market optimism This year, markets are buzzing with more than just seasonal cheer. Over the past nine weeks, U.S. equity ETFs have sucked in $186 billion—more than twice the average inflow from the first half of 2024. It’s not just about numbers; it’s about appetite. Investors are going all-in, chasing record-high trading volumes . Daily options trading now averages 48 million contracts, with half of those being zero-day-to-expiration (0DTE) options. Last Friday was wild. A record $6.6 trillion worth of options contracts expired, fueling even more trading activity. Election years add an extra kick to the mix. Historically, the S&P 500 climbs an average of 3.7% between Election Day and year-end, finishing higher 67% of the time. This year? It’s already up 4.5% since November 5, blowing past that average and setting the stage for a bigger finale. Meanwhile, the S&P Risk Appetite Index is living its best life. It jumped another two points this month, hitting 41%—its highest level since April 2021. This is a massive surge from where it stood in August, up by a staggering 70% points. If sentiment were a stock, it’d be mooning right now. Crypto starts a comeback Crypto markets are riding the wave too. Bitcoin edged up 0.32% to $98,747 on Thursday, riding on news that MicroStrategy plans to issue more shares to buy even more Bitcoin. The company has been on a buying spree, adding $561 million worth of Bitcoin last week alone. That was the seventh straight week of accumulation. The rest of the crypto gang isn’t sitting idle. Ether , Solana, and even Dogecoin rebounded from midweek losses, riding on Bitcoin’s coattails. But traders are wary of what’s coming. Friday will see a record $43 billion in open interest expire on Deribit, including $13.95 billion in Bitcoin options and $3.77 billion in Ether options. That’s a lot of money on the line, and some are preparing for turbulence as market makers adjust their positions. Though many analysts think Bitcoin might reclaim $100k before January 1st.

For weeks, people have been talking about this laid-back anthropomorphic dog. However, its popularity also brought multiple controversies. One of which is the plagiarism claims by netizens, which tanked the CHILLGUY price by around 14% within a day. CHILLGUY Meme Coin Might Be Plagiarised From Thailand Multiple reports witnessed the Just a Chill Guy meme coin entering social media in October 2023, where Philip Banks claimed to be its creator. However, Philip Banks hated the idea of using his artwork in brand promotions and meme crypto development, leading to him posting a legal threat on X . However, a recent Reddit post revealed new information on the matter, creating a plagiarism controversy. A Reddit user shared an image of a booklet, which raised the suspicion that the meme might be plagiarised from a Thailand booklet. Instead of the CHILLGUY, the booklet called it RELAX BOY, whose face is swapped with the Dog in the CHILLGUY meme coin. Interestingly, the timeline for this booklet publication is a little confusing. A few users added that it is six years old, while others added that it is eight years old. However, there is not enough information about this booklet, and it lacks supporting documents. Interestingly, people suspect the usage of AI technology to create this fake reference. Regardless, investors also doubt this is an attempt to pump the hype around the CHILLGUY meme coin to boost its performance. CHILLGUY Price Dropped 14% But Will Recover If Amid this ‘Just A Chill Guy’ controversy, the CHILLGUY price today dropped 14% and currently trades at $0.1792. With that, its market capitalization has also declined to $179.18M, but there is a 6% surge in trading volume, indicating increased investor interaction. Although the controversy is mere, strong selling pressure has surrounded the token, fueling a downtrend. According to the TradingView technical charts, the CHILLGUY meme coin is in a strong selling zone, where the moving averages on all timeframes and MACD confirm the current downtrend. Moreover, the RSI is neutral, which indicates the continuity of current trends, but it is also near an oversold region. If the token entered the oversold territory, a trend reversal could happen, generating significant buying pressure on the token and aiding in the CHILLGUY price recovery. A few other technical indicators also hint at the same, but only if the buyer entered the market. What’s In There For You? The demand for Solana meme coins is quite high this year. Creators actively launched thousands of cryptos on the Solana network. It includes the ‘Just a Chill Guy” meme coin, which is under a plagiarism controversy, as people claim the meme originated from a 6-8 year-old Thailand booklet character RELAX BOY. However, the lack of proof creates suspicion, leading people to claim that this is to boost the CHILLGUY Price. With that, the CHILLGUY meme coin has entered a downtrend, losing 14% of its value over the last 24 hours, making it a buying opportunity. However, technical analysis indicates a further downtrend unless the buying pressure builds up and pulls the token upward. Regardless, the token is in a long downtrend, as it has moved 74% from its ATH of $0.667, set a month ago. As a result, careful and strategic planning is mandatory before making investment commitments.

This unusual activity has sparked speculation about potential institutional involvement, with rumors swirling about BlackRock exploring a partnership with Chainlink. Such a move would not only validate the project but could also attract substantial capital inflows. Suspicious $LINK accumulation spotted!

Over $40 million worth of $LINK was purchased when the price briefly dropped to $20, with trading volume surpassing $1 billion. This stealthy accumulation underscores the growing interest in Chainlink, particularly as whispers of institutional adoption gain momentum. Chainlink: Setting Up for a Breakout to $38?

Meanwhile, whales have… pic.twitter.com/fKhAu7Oj2c — Crypto Town Hall (@Crypto_TownHall) December 25, 2024 Technical indicators further bolster the bullish sentiment. $LINK is trading within an ascending channel, signaling a strong upward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 45, suggesting plenty of room for further gains. This technical setup aligns with growing market optimism surrounding Chainlink’s potential. On a broader scale, macroeconomic factors could also support $LINK’s growth. Former U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance for the 2024 election introduces a tailwind that could drive a wave of adoption across the sector. If combined with institutional validation from a player like BlackRock, Chainlink could be positioned for explosive growth. As institutional rumors and technical strength converge, all eyes are on $LINK. Whether these developments lead to a breakout or merely reflect speculative hype, the token is undeniably at the center of the crypto spotlight. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance emerges as the next Dogecoin, promising a massive 18,400% rally with its real-world asset tokenization solution. Table of Contents Rexas Finance: The next Dogecoin Rexas Finance poised for an 18,400% rally Conclusion One of the most recognizable tokens in crypto history, Dogecoin (DOGE), has paid enormous rewards to early adopters. Showing the explosive possibilities of meme coins, the token rose from fractions of a penny to an ATH of $0.74. The market is enthusiastic as a fresh cryptocurrency promises to be the next DOGE. This fresh competitor is a possible game-changer since it is expected to turn a $450 investment into an impressive $83,250 within 100 days. Rexas Finance: The next Dogecoin Rexas Finance has been attracting considerable interest as the cryptocurrency that will replicate Dogecoin’s achievements. Unlike DOGE , which began as a meme coin, RXS is a new effort meant to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and actual assets. The technology lets users tokenize almost any real-world asset, real estate, art, intellectual property, or goods, allowing flawless ownership and blockchain trading. Rexas Finance’s use presents it as more than simply a cryptocurrency; it’s a platform that will completely reshape the worldwide financial landscape. Priced at $0.15 as of writing, the RXS presale, currently in its 10th stage, has shown amazing momentum. Stage 9 closed considerably ahead of time, and earlier presale stages sold out faster than expected. The presale’s success thus far indicates great investor confidence, as it has generated nearly $30.68 million. Unlike many other initiatives, the Rexas Finance team prioritized community ownership. By declining venture capital funding, it ensured that regular investors could participate in the project’s success. This original strategy has inspired hope since many believe RXS will be the next major cryptocurrency with exponential gains. Analysts expect an 18,400% increase to a price of $27.75 within 100 days, and with its listing on major platforms, including CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, RXS is positioned for a huge boom. Though RXS provides a more substantial basis with practical uses, Dogecoin and Rexas Finance have interesting similarities. DOGE depends on community buzz and celebrity sponsorships, while RXS is supported by a clear use case in tokenizing actual assets (RWAs). By allowing users to tokenize assets with only a few clicks from anywhere globally, RXS has entered a trillion-dollar market, fueling its long-term expansion. Rexas Finance’s possibilities go far beyond transient benefits. Unlike other cryptocurrencies, its creative method of real-world asset tokenizing distinguishes it. On the blockchain, investors can tokenize and sell real estate, gold, and even intellectual property, removing obstacles to access and supporting fractional ownership. This distributes access to priceless resources and creates fresh paths for wealth-building. Rexas Finance poised for an 18,400% rally Foreasts of an 18,400% increase make Rexas Finance rapidly rising as a must-watch coin. The project’s capacity to provide outstanding returns results from its unique mix of utility, creativity, and community support. Unlike speculative initiatives, RXS appeals to individual and institutional investors since it is based on addressing actual issues. Analysts predict a quick rise in price since the presale stages are selling out quickly, and the coin is approaching public listing. Its listing on leading platforms like Coinmarketcap and Coingecko, robust community support, and the rising acceptance of real-world asset tokenization will drive this increasing trend. For those who lost out on DOGE’s impressive ascent, RXS gives a second shot to ride the wave of a high-potential crypto project. Furthermore, the choice to start without any participation from venture capital has sparked a grassroots movement akin to the early years of DOGE. Demand has surged due to the buzz about the presale, effective marketing, and early uptake. With the token predicted to hit $27.75 in 100 days, investors saw RXS as a possibility for life-changing rewards. With this pricing aim, a $450 investment would become $83,250, with returns in line with DOGE’s renowned performance. Conclusion Rexas Finance has all the ingredients to become the next Dogecoin. With its approach to real-world asset tokenization, strong presale performance, and predictions of an 18,400% rally, RXS is poised to make an $83,250 return from a $450 investment in just 100 days. As the token prepares for its public launch and listings on major platforms, the time to invest in RXS is now.

This includes the overall AI narrative and five related sub-narratives. Although this reflects a modest increase from 2023’s 11.32% share, the AI narrative lost ground to the rapid rise of memecoins. Real World Assets (RWA) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) also saw a notable uptick in attention. The RWA narrative jumped to 8.64% interest in 2024, up from 6.48% in 2023, climbing from 6th to 3rd place. These trends illustrate the shifting focus of crypto investors, with memecoins continuing to dominate while AI and RWA narratives gain steady traction. As the market evolves, these themes are likely to shape investment decisions and drive innovation in the crypto space throughout the year. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Despite this massive uptrend, can DOGE price hit the $50 or $100 mark? Let’s explore. Will Dogecoin Price Hit $50 or $100? Dogecoin is the original top meme coin , created in 2013 as a joke. DOGE’s initial purpose was not to be a serious investment opportunity. Hence, Dogecoin, a dog-based crypto, does not have a unique value proposition, a robust development team, or a clear roadmap for growth. Its price appreciation is mostly driven by cycles of hype and frenzy. Hence, the chances of Dogecoin price hitting the $50 or $100 mark are highly unlikely. The second reason is that DOGE’s value would need to surge by an unprecedented amount. To be precise, with the current circulating supply of 147 billion, the market capitalization needs to shoot up 14,900% from the current $49 billion for Dogecoin’s price to hit $50. This would put DOGE’s hypothetical market cap at $7.3 trillion. In the second scenario, where Dogecoin’s value would hit $100, its market capitalization would need to surge 29,900% and hit $14.7 trillion. To conclude, both outlooks where Dogecoin price hits $50 or $100 are highly unlikely. Other Reasons Why DOGE Will Never Hit $50 or $100 The cryptocurrency market is highly competitive, with plenty of other tokens that showcase robust technology, stronger development teams, and clearer use cases. Hence, capital rotation could occur, preventing DOGE from surging higher and reaching the theoretical values of $50 or $100. As noted above, Dogecoin’s fundamental value proposition, a meme coin, is lacking. In an ever-evolving crypto space, coins that offer more value and higher returns are investors’ first choice. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that DOGE will hit the double—or triple-digit marks. The nominal rise in market caps for Dogecoin’s price to hit $50 or $100 is absurd. To reach the aforementioned values, the market cap would have to multiply by 105-210. DOGE/USDT 1-week chart Furthermore, the Dogecoin price prediction suggests DOGE would increase by 15,661% and $31,422% to hit the desired targets, which is impossible considering the market conditions.

According to the Bangkok Post , Thailand is working towards making the ex-Prime Minister’s suggestion for a Bitcoin ( BTC ) payment pilot project a reality. Binance’s Thai arm will reportedly support the pilot project that aims to establish Phuket as a Bitcoin sandbox for tourism. “Given our country’s reliance on tourism and foreign inflows, integrating cryptocurrencies into Phuket’s economy could align well with Thailand’s strategic strengths, potentially attracting tech-savvy visitors and investors.” Nirun Fuwattananukul, chief executive of Gulf Binance, a joint venture between Binance Thailand and Gulf Innova. Fuwattananukul viewed the idea as a positive step towards boosting Thailand’s position in the global economy as more and more regions like the U.S . and Japan are looking towards making use of Bitcoin as an alternative currency. He believes Thailand “must not be left behind” in regard to crypto adoption. Though unlike those countries, Thailand is bound by government law to restrict payments to only its local currency. Therefore, the Bitcoin pilot project will give the central bank a chance to assess the risks and benefits associated with cryptocurrency. “Introducing Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as a payment method could have implications for monetary flow and the Bank of Thailand’s ability to manage economic stability,” said Fuwattananukul.

According to the Gulf Binance head, both the central bank and SEC will need to work together to align their regulatory frameworks and coordinate in seeing this pilot project through. Key considerations would include consumer protection, anti-money laundering measures, and the potential impact on Thailand’s financial stability. “The regulatory framework would also need to ensure that crypto payments operate within the country’s existing monetary policies and currency controls,” he said. As previously reported by crypto.news in November, Binance has been eyeing Thailand as a key market for pushing widespread crypto adoption as the country progressively becomes more open to crypto regulations. Binance chief marketing officer Rachel Conlan said Thailand was among the top 20 Binance markets, with local crypto penetration estimated at 12%, double the global average of 6%.

The MA 20 also failed to provide any support. On December 23, we witnessed a death cross over in this time frame that suggested a price dip which we are looking at right now. Source : Tradingview 10.06% fall in the trading activity suggests that traders are keeping distance from ethereum today. Even though the open interest has seen a surge of around a billion dollars, the long/short ratio is at 0.846. Breaking it down we can see that 54.17% of the total open future trades for ETH are shorts, suggesting the traders are indeed bearish for the price movement. Source : Coinglass Exchange Reserves and ETFS Flow According to the data by CryptoQuant, Ethereum exchange reserves are going down. This means investors are moving their assets from exchanges to cold wallets. This signals the rising confidence in the crypto and an upcoming price rise. At the time of writing, the exchanges only hold 19.05 million ETH tokens. Source : CryptoQuant Farside data revealed that on the last open day of ETFS, i.e. on December 24, they only witnessed an inflow of $53.6 million and there was no outflow. Blackrock’s ETHA received the highest inflow of $43.90 followed by ETHW by Bitwise – $6.19 million and Fidelity’s FETH – $3.45 million. What to expect? Even though the market feels it is going into a bearish mode however, the drop in exchange reserves clearly highlight investors’ confidence. This price might be going down however the momentum is building slowly. People will keep wondering why is Ethereum down today and the market maker will make money from their lack of knowledge. As we discussed in our Bitcoin analysis earlier, the market takes the traders by surprise and when people are bearish, crypto will start to move in the other direction.

Bitcoin Stopped at $100K Bitcoin went through a massive correction last week following the latest FOMC meeting. It dumped all the way from $108,000 to $92,000 in a matter of days. It bounced off on Friday and Saturday as the bulls drove it to almost $99,500. However, it failed there and retraced hard once again at the start of the business week toward $92,000 once more. The bulls stepped up again at this point and initiated a notable price increase that pushed bitcoin up to $99,200 on Christmas Eve and almost $100,000 yesterday evening. Once again, though, the cryptocurrency was stopped at this point. The subsequent rejection has driven it south hard, as the asset now struggles below $96,000.

On December 6, the government officially published the bill in its Gazette, and by December 18, it had advanced to the first reading in the Legislative Council. This process, consisting of three readings, will involve thorough debates, examinations, and potential amendments before it can be signed into law by Hong Kong’s chief executive. If enacted, the Stablecoins Bill aims to address the growing demand for regulatory clarity in the crypto space. Its introduction reflects Hong Kong’s intent to position itself as a global hub for digital assets while safeguarding market participants and fostering innovation. Key Features of the Stablecoins Bill The Stablecoins Bill is designed with three core components: licensing for issuers, stablecoin-specific offerings, and marketing restrictions coupled with enhanced consumer protections. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the region’s central bank, will oversee the licensing process. Issuers must comply with stringent requirements, including evaluations of their resources, governance structures, reserve assets, and mechanisms for maintaining stablecoin value. Only regulated entities and platforms will be permitted to issue or market stablecoins within Hong Kong. Beyond licensing, the bill introduces a framework to protect consumers, targeting all market participants involved in issuing and distributing stablecoins. This approach mirrors Europe’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, which have reshaped the stablecoin market across the continent. Implications for the Stablecoin Landscape Should the bill pass into law, Hong Kong’s stablecoin market could undergo transformative changes. A similar shift occurred in Europe following MiCA’s implementation , where compliant issuers like Circle and Societe Generale captured 91% of the market share by late 2024. Meanwhile, non-compliant players, such as Tether, were forced to withdraw certain offerings. Analysts believe that Hong Kong could replicate this success, fostering a stablecoin ecosystem built on trust and compliance. As global regulators tighten their grip on digital assets, Hong Kong’s proactive stance may provide a blueprint for other jurisdictions navigating the complexities of stablecoin oversight. By aligning regulatory measures with consumer protection and market stability, the Stablecoins Bill positions Hong Kong as a key player in the evolving crypto landscape .

The token, popular for its relaxed attitude, has fallen by 20% , sliding from $0.22 to $0.17. This drop comes after claims that its mascot may not be original but copied from a Thai booklet character named RELAXBOY. Is CHILLGUY Copied From Thailand? CHILLGUY has been a trending topic in the crypto world, with its mascot “Just a Chill Guy” winning hearts on the internet. The meme coin saw massive popularity after launching in late 2023. However, new allegations have surfaced, questioning its originality. A Reddit user recently posted an image of a Thai booklet featuring a character called RELAXBOY. The image closely resembles CHILLGUY, sparking debates about possible plagiarism. Some users claimed that the booklet is at least six years old, while others suggested it could be older. The similarity is striking, as the booklet’s character looks nearly identical to CHILLGUY, except with a different face. Legal and Social Media Drama Philip Banks, who claims to have created the original “Just a Chill Guy” meme, has already expressed his dislike for using the meme in promotions or crypto projects. He even issued legal warnings, which had previously affected CHILLGUY’s price. Now, the new plagiarism claims have added more pressure on the token. Some users have suggested the booklet reference could be fabricated using AI, aiming to stir controversy and reignite interest in the token. Regardless of the truth, the ongoing debates have contributed to heightened selling pressure on CHILLGUY, causing a notable decline in its market value. ChillGuy Market Impact As of today, CHILLGUY’s price has dropped to $0.1732 today, down 16.6% in the past 24 hours. Its market value has fallen to $173.58 million.

With tech giants like Meta, Google, and Microsoft scaling back their spending, the semiconductor market risks a significant downturn. Doug Lefever, CEO of chip-testing machine giant Advantest, warns that any cutbacks in data center development could ripple through the supply chain with brutal force. “The concentration of hyperscalers in the market makes any slowdown in data center buildout a major issue,” Lefever said. While he avoided labeling it a “bubble,” he cautioned about cycles that could hit the industry hard. And with no immediate slowdown in sight, all eyes are on the next possible growth catalyst: artificial intelligence smartphones. AI smartphones: Waiting for the killer app AI smartphones are still a gamble , but the potential for a breakout moment keeps the industry on edge. Lefever described demand as “slow” but predicted a revolution if the right app triggers mass adoption. “Everyone’s waiting for that killer app. When it happens, people will replace their phones like crazy,” he said. For companies like Advantest, the stakes are high. Based in Tokyo, the company supplies chip-testing machines critical to Nvidia’s advanced GPUs. Advantest holds more than half of the global market in this niche, and demand for its equipment has exploded as semiconductors become more advanced. These machines now test chips 10 to 20 times throughout production, compared to just a handful of tests five years ago. The testing process has grown even more complex with Nvidia’s new Blackwell GPUs , which require three to four times longer to test than their predecessors. This trend allowed Advantest to raise its fiscal 2024 income target by 16%, aiming for ¥122 billion ($792 million). Increased demand has also driven massive stock gains. Advantest’s share price soared 80% this year and over 500% in the past five years. However, concerns about US-China tensions under President-elect Donald Trump briefly cooled investor enthusiasm. US-China tensions and chip resilience The company’s exposure to China has decreased, with 20–25% of its revenue now tied to the region. Although US sanctions want to restrict China’s chip production capabilities, Advantest has largely avoided direct impact. When a major Chinese customer was hit by sanctions, Advantest quickly recovered lost sales through other clients. “We thought it could take a year to offset those losses, but it only took months,” Lefever said. Despite these challenges, Nvidia continues to dominate Wall Street. The company’s stock, up more than 180% this year, has propelled its market cap to over $3 trillion. NVDA is now the second-most valuable company in the US and a top performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Retail investors are also fueling Nvidia’s momentum. The company has nearly doubled net inflows compared to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY). It’s on track to surpass Tesla as the most-bought stock, a feat amplified by its 10-to-1 stock split earlier this year. While Nvidia hasn’t experienced the inflated price-to-earnings multiples seen with Tesla or Palantir, its retail investor base remains substantial. This enthusiasm was evident during a New York City watch party in August, where fans gathered to celebrate Nvidia’s earnings report.

Source: TradingView Aptos was bullish in the last quarter of 2024, rising from $7.23 to $15.33 in the first two weeks of December. At current levels, the William Alligator is feeding signaling high volatility, while the relative strength index is now in neutral territory. The MACD histogram indicator signals negative price momentum. Aptos 4-hour chart price analysis Aptos/ USD 4-hour chart. TradingView The 4-hour chart differs from the daily chart with dropping volatility and waning positive price momentum on the MACD histograms. If Apto’s price drops, watch the $8.5 level on the chart at the channel’s lower trendline. The cryptocurrency could find resistance near a range of narrow consolidation. Investors should monitor the $10.0 level upon an upside revival. A rally into this area would likely face resistance from an earlier high at the flattening 200-day EMA.

Is Aptos a good investment? APTOS’s design prioritizes scalability, reliability, and upgradeability. It is notable for using the MOVE programming language, developed by Facebook and now META. While the current trend is bearish, predictions paint a different narrative. Will Aptos reach $10? Yes, Aptos rose above $10 this year. The move came as the market recovered from previous highs. Will Aptos reach $100? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, Aptos will reach the $100 mark in 2030. Will Aptos reach $1000? Per the Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely that Aptos will get to $1000 before 2030. Does Aptos have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, Aptos will trade higher in years to come. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

This article explores these promising tokens that could offer diversification and growth opportunities for a balanced investment portfolio. Trump’s victory triggers crypto shake-up: XYZ poised for a 99,900% surge Wall Street has been keeping a close eye on altcoins to include in a balanced 2025 portfolio, and the aftermath of Donald Trump’s election win has thrown fresh fuel onto the crypto fire. While established tokens limp ahead with modest gains, a new meme coin contender, XYZ, is stepping into the spotlight, vowing to deliver a seismic 99,900% profit that puts previous meme coin surges to shame. Recent high-fliers like PNUT (4,500% upswing) and FRED (6,000% explosion) seemed unstoppable, until they collapsed under heavy selling pressure. Now, investors are hunting for more reliable high-growth projects that could earn a seat at the table with Wall Street powerhouses. Enter XYZ, the first all-sports meme coin designed for true crypto enthusiasts craving outsized returns. Built on a strong community and an adrenaline-fueled sports ethos, XYZ is pouncing on the post-election crypto bull wave to prove it’s more than just another short-lived fad. With fresh market momentum ignited by Trump’s victory, XYZ aims to dominate the competition and earn a place in savvy portfolios. Envision a token bolstered by sports culture, robust tokenomics, and a no-quit attitude, one that aligns well with the forward-looking strategies of today’s institutional investors.

In the current crypto market, stability and accessibility are crucial. ENA stands out by providing a stablecoin that isn’t dependent on banks, which can be a big advantage. As trust in traditional financial systems wavers, a crypto dollar like ENA could gain popularity. Polkadot Polkadot is making waves in the crypto world by connecting different blockchains. Imagine sending value and data between Bitcoin and Ethereum without any middlemen. That’s what Polkadot does. It uses a technology called parachains to make transactions faster and more scalable. In today’s market, Polkadot stands out with its focus on interoperability. While many cryptocurrencies build their own ecosystems, Polkadot aims to connect them all.

""Nobody Understands!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/avalanche-ceo-emin-gun-sirer-talks-about-avax-bitcoin-and-ethereum-nobody-understands/,"Important statements have been made about Avalanche (AVAX), one of the altcoins closely followed by Turkish investors. Avalanche founder Emin Gün Sirer stated in his statement that AVAX is similar to Bitcoin (BTC) and listed their similarities. Emin Gun Sirer drew attention to a critical aspect of Avalanche in his X post, emphasizing its similarity to Bitcoin's 21 million supply. At this point, the famous CEO pointed out that AVAX has a supply of 715.74 million and said that this aspect is similar to BTC. Implying that the limited supply feature is the cornerstone of Bitcoin’s value, Sirer argued that it attracts long-term investors and increases confidence in its deflationary nature. The famous CEO said that this feature is the same in AVAX, and that AVAX's limited supply and deflation mechanism of burning transaction fees make a difference, and compared it to Ethereum (ETH). Stating that Avalanche is similar to Bitcoin but different from Ethereum in these aspects, Sirer stated that no one understands this similarity and difference. “Not enough people understand that AVAX has a limited supply like Bitcoin and is similar but different from Ethereum.” Emin Gün Sirer underlined the similarity of AVAX to Bitcoin and increased speculations about a possible AVAX price increase. At this point, experts said that the current price of AVAX indicates upward momentum. Experts stated that $34.71 is an important support area for AVAX and stated that the AVAX price could reach $64 and $79 in the short term. Avalanche continues to trade at $38.4 at the time of writing. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Avalanche CEO Emin Gün Sirer Talks About AVAX, Bitcoin and Ethereum!

38135190,https://coinpedia.org/?p=398220,1735207299,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Web3 Gaming: The Role of Rewards in Achieving Mainstream Adoption,https://coinpedia.org/information/web3-gaming-the-role-of-rewards-in-achieving-mainstream-adoption/,"The post Web3 Gaming: The Role of Rewards in Achieving Mainstream Adoption appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Web3 gaming has surged in popularity following the debut of Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the Metaverse during the 2021 bull run. According to the latest report by DApp Radar, the blockchain gaming sector accounted for the largest share of on-chain activity, with a 28% market dominance while the average number of daily active wallets stood at $6.8 million. But despite the remarkable growth within the last three years, it is evident that Web3 gaming is yet to achieve the levels of adoption that stakeholders envisioned in the earlier days. For context, a popular Web2 game such as Fortnite has over 650 million registered players while Call of Duty (CoD) enjoys over 100 million monthly users as per the latest statistics . So, what are Web3 games missing to achieve mainstream adoption? The most obvious shortcoming is the quality of Web3 games, but more importantly, are players getting the value that was initially promised in the concept of incentivized gameplays and can these rewards be redeemed for external value outside the crypto ecosystem? Incentives: The Key to Mainstream Adoption in Web3 Gaming The Web 3.0 ecosystem is often touted as the incentivized economy; what this means is that participants are rewarded with value, often in the form of tokens or in-game items in the case of Web3 games. This model has seen pioneer blockchain networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum achieve mainstream adoption for the simple fact that miners and validators are compensated with ‘valuable’ digital assets. Similarly, the Web3 gaming ecosystem has an opportunity to bounce back to its glory by paying more attention to the lucrativeness and sustainability of the incentivization models. There have been several instances where games such as Axie Infinity that almost went globally viral became just another name in the industry. To provide some context, SLP, the reward token for Axie Infinity players, is down 99% from its all-time high. A two-fold Shock and Awe Approach On the brighter side, innovators in the Web3 gaming ecosystem have the flexibility to try out more flexible incentivization models. A two-fold shock and awe approach is one of the effective ways that stakeholders in this space can leverage to achieve mainstream adoption. But what exactly does this strategy entail? Simply put, this means allocating a significant amount of funds towards life changing rewards for participating or completing tasks in a Web3 game, massive prize pools and the scalable infrastructure to match the level of incentives in more advanced gaming ecosystems such as the esports industry. A good example of a Web3 gaming ecosystem that is already implementing an incredible rewards strategy is Funtico . This full stack chain-agnostic platform is designed to bridge the gap between the fun and the rewards aspect by introducing a Web3 gaming ecosystem that is fueled by incredible rewards. At the core, Funtico prioritizes big rewards for the Web3 games within its ecosystem. The platform features multiple tournaments, including branded tournaments, community tournaments, leaderboards and private rooms that organizations looking to host organized Web3 gaming tournaments can leverage to incentivize the players. Currently, Funtico is running a tournament dubbed “THE BIG BANTER SHOWDOWN Quarter Final” for one of its in-house games, Formula Funtico, with a prize pool of up to $5000 USDT. The platform’s tap-to-earn game, Lucky Funatic, also features big prize pool tournaments coupled with the thrill of players seamlessly engaging with the game by simply tapping to earn these rewards. It is also interesting to observe other Web3 games in the tap-to-earn ecosystem that are using the incentive model to attract more users such as Hamster Kombat. This TON-based game involves a gameplay where players act as hamsters tasked with running a crypto exchange to earn in-game rewards. More importantly, the shock approach doesn’t end with initial rewards. Many are the times when Web3 gamers have been left holding devalued coins as was the case with Axie Infinity, not to mention the fact that most Web3 gaming ecosystems lack sustainable continuity models hence no more incentives for users that have already been onboarded. For Web3 gaming innovators to consistently attract new audiences, innovators need to adopt more sustainable incentivization elements such as affiliate programs coupled with advanced UI, transparency and superior gaming systems that can not only match the likes of Fortnite and CoD but enhance the participation with rewards that can be redeemed both internally and externally. Wrap Up As mentioned in the introduction, the Web3 gaming ecosystem is one of the most active crypto sub sectors but it is still nowhere close to the levels of adoption it should be. While implementing more ‘incentivized tokenomics’ may seem cliche, the key is in making these rewards sustainable. The next era of Web3 gaming adoption will likely be defined by incredible rewards that are not limited by speculative narratives but by the value these rewards provide to players and the models innovators use to keep them valuable for longer periods, accompanied by more incentive programs throughout the lifecycle of Web3 games.",Information|Web3,EN,0,0,AXS|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|MINING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-26 10:01:39

Provided by the analytics platform Alternative, the index has shifted from the “Greed” zone into the “Extreme Greed” zone, reflecting heightened optimism among cryptocurrency investors. This significant rise signals a notable shift in market sentiment, driven by improved momentum and increasing activity across key factors tracked by the index. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a widely followed metric that evaluates investor sentiment in the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating “Extreme Fear” and higher scores representing “Extreme Greed.” How the Index is Calculated The index is derived from six key factors, each contributing to the overall score: Volatility (25%) : High volatility often correlates with fear, while stability indicates confidence. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Increasing trading volume and momentum are signs of greed. Social Media (15%) : Sentiment analysis on platforms like Twitter tracks public opinion. Surveys (15%) : Polling market participants helps gauge collective sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Higher Bitcoin dominance may indicate fear as investors retreat to safer assets. Google Trends (10%) : Searches for crypto-related terms often reflect market interest levels. What Does ‘Extreme Greed’ Mean? The “Extreme Greed” zone indicates heightened optimism and confidence among investors, often driven by rising prices and strong market momentum. While this can signal bullish sentiment, it also serves as a cautionary flag for potential market corrections. Historical Trends In bull markets , Extreme Greed often precedes significant rallies as euphoria drives prices higher. In bear markets , such levels can signal overconfidence, making the market vulnerable to sharp corrections. Factors Driving the Current Sentiment Market Momentum A surge in trading volume and strong price performance across major cryptocurrencies have fueled optimism, boosting the index. Social Media Buzz Conversations around Bitcoin and altcoins have intensified, with mentions of bullish price targets dominating platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Bitcoin Dominance A balanced Bitcoin dominance level suggests diversification into altcoins, reflecting broad confidence in the market. Improved Economic Outlook Global macroeconomic conditions, including reduced inflation concerns and favorable regulatory developments, have created a conducive environment for crypto growth. Implications of Extreme Greed While Extreme Greed indicates strong bullish sentiment, it also carries risks. Positive Indicators Bullish Momentum : Rising prices and market participation can attract more investors, sustaining the rally. Increased Adoption : Positive sentiment can drive mainstream and institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. Potential Risks Overvaluation : Overconfidence can lead to inflated asset prices, making the market susceptible to corrections. Market Volatility : Sudden shifts in sentiment can trigger sharp price swings. Comparison to Past Market Cycles The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has historically been a reliable predictor of market behavior: 2021 Bull Market : The index reached the Extreme Greed zone before Bitcoin’s peak at $69,000, followed by a sharp correction. 2023 Recovery : Moderate levels of greed signaled steady growth as the market recovered from a prolonged bear phase. The current surge to 79 aligns with patterns seen in the early stages of bull markets, indicating room for further growth but also the potential for volatility. Investor Strategies in an Extreme Greed Market Navigating the cryptocurrency market during Extreme Greed requires a balanced approach: Take Profits : Lock in gains on assets that have seen significant price increases. Diversify Holdings : Spread investments across different assets to mitigate risks. Monitor Sentiment : Stay informed about shifts in the index and other sentiment indicators. Avoid Overleveraging : Limit exposure to high-risk trades that could amplify losses in the event of a correction. What’s Next for the Crypto Market? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s rise to 79 suggests that the market is riding a wave of optimism. Key factors to watch include: Price Movements : Sustained rallies could push the index higher, while corrections may bring it back to neutral levels. Regulatory News : Developments in crypto regulations could significantly influence market sentiment. Macro Trends : Broader economic factors, such as interest rate decisions and inflation data, will play a crucial role in shaping the market. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaching 79 and entering the “Extreme Greed” zone reflects heightened investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. While this surge signals bullish sentiment and potential for further growth, it also calls for caution as markets may be vulnerable to corrections. Investors should remain vigilant, balancing optimism with strategic risk management to navigate the dynamic crypto landscape effectively.

Recent changes in legislation have enabled this shift, offering companies an alternative to traditional payment systems that are hindered by geopolitical restrictions. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov confirmed the development, emphasizing its role in countering economic pressures. This strategic move underscores Russia’s efforts to adopt alternative financial mechanisms, with the potential to reshape global trade dynamics. Why Russian Firms Are Turning to Cryptocurrency Western sanctions have limited Russia’s access to traditional international banking systems, including the SWIFT network. This has forced businesses to explore decentralized financial systems like cryptocurrency, which are not subject to the same geopolitical constraints. Key reasons for the shift include: Circumventing Sanctions Cryptocurrencies operate independently of traditional banking systems, allowing Russian firms to engage in international trade without relying on sanctioned financial intermediaries. Increased Government Support Recent laws in Russia now allow the use of cryptocurrencies mined within the country for foreign trade transactions, providing a legal framework for adoption. Decentralized Nature of Crypto Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin offer a decentralized payment mechanism, reducing reliance on centralized systems influenced by Western policies. Finance Minister’s Confirmation In an interview with the Russia 24 television channel, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov highlighted the growing role of cryptocurrency in Russia’s international trade strategy. “Cryptocurrencies mined in Russia are being used for foreign trade transactions, and we expect this approach to expand next year,” Siluanov stated. The minister’s comments reflect the government’s endorsement of crypto adoption as a key tool for mitigating economic isolation. Putin’s Critique of the Dollar’s Dominance Russian President Vladimir Putin has long criticized the politicization of the U.S. dollar in global trade. Earlier this month, he reiterated these concerns, stating that the U.S. is undermining the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency by using it as a tool for political leverage. Putin’s remarks highlight a growing trend among nations to seek alternatives to the dollar, with cryptocurrencies emerging as a viable option. Cryptocurrency Mining and Usage in Russia Russia is one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency mining hubs, thanks to its abundant energy resources and cold climate, which reduce mining costs. By leveraging domestically mined cryptocurrencies for international trade, Russia is effectively monetizing its mining capabilities while bypassing traditional financial barriers. Implications for Global Trade Russia’s adoption of cryptocurrency for international trade could have significant implications: Increased Crypto Adoption : Other sanctioned nations may follow Russia’s lead, accelerating global cryptocurrency adoption. Shift in Global Reserve Assets : The move away from the U.S. dollar could prompt broader diversification in global trade payments. Regulatory Challenges : Western nations may introduce new regulations to counteract the use of cryptocurrencies for sanction evasion. Potential Benefits and Risks for Russia Benefits : Resilience Against Sanctions : Cryptocurrencies provide an alternative payment system unaffected by Western financial controls. Economic Efficiency : Faster and cheaper cross-border transactions reduce trade friction. Financial Independence : Reduces reliance on traditional currencies and systems. Risks : Volatility : Cryptocurrencies are known for price fluctuations, which could impact trade values. Regulatory Backlash : Increased scrutiny from international regulators could create challenges. Security Concerns : Dependence on digital assets exposes trade transactions to potential cyber threats. Global Response to Russia’s Crypto Adoption The international community is closely monitoring Russia’s growing reliance on cryptocurrency. While some nations see it as a workaround to sanctions, others view it as a legitimate use of decentralized finance. Sanctioning Entities : Western nations may consider stricter regulations or targeted measures to curtail Russia’s use of cryptocurrencies. Neutral Parties : Countries not involved in sanctions may see this as an opportunity to strengthen trade ties with Russia through crypto-based systems. Crypto Advocates : Proponents of decentralized finance view this as a validation of cryptocurrency’s potential to enable financial inclusion. What This Means for the Crypto Market Russia’s shift toward cryptocurrency could have far-reaching effects on the global crypto market: Increased Demand for Bitcoin : As one of the most widely accepted cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin could see heightened demand. Mainstream Legitimacy : The use of crypto for international trade could boost its reputation as a viable alternative to traditional systems. Regulatory Evolution : Governments may need to update regulations to address the growing use of crypto in international trade. Conclusion Russia’s adoption of cryptocurrency for international trade marks a significant milestone in the global financial landscape. By leveraging Bitcoin and other digital assets, the country is navigating around Western sanctions and exploring a new frontier in decentralized trade systems. While this approach offers numerous benefits, it also raises questions about global trade dynamics, regulatory responses, and the future role of cryptocurrencies in the international economy. As Russia continues to expand its use of cryptocurrency in 2025, the world will be watching closely to understand the broader implications for finance, trade, and geopolitics.

The prominent Bitcoin advocate had previously predicted that Ethereum would be labeled an unregistered security, and he believed it would never be approved for a spot ETF. Let’s find out what changed his views. What Changed in Saylor’s Views? In a recent interview on the Altcoin Daily channe l, Michael Saylor admitted he was wrong about Ethereum. He explained that his views changed in the second quarter of the year. The turning point came when former President Donald Trump began supporting the crypto community. Trump recognized the growing influence of digital assets, and this helped change the way people saw crypto. Saylor pointed out that this shift, along with the growing support from the political right has made the future look much better for Ethereum and other digital assets. He thinks the change in politics has opened the door to a more positive future for crypto. Saylor’s Key Expectation Meanwhile, Saylor sees two possible futures for the crypto world. In the first scenario, Bitcoin stays the only digital asset recognized as a commodity, while Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies remain in a gray area with unclear regulations. The second scenario, which seems more likely now, is the end of the “war on crypto.” This would provide a clear definition of digital assets and allow the industry to thrive under a more manageable regulatory environment. Bright Future Ahead for Bitcoin and Ethereum With the prospect of a digital assets framework becoming a reality, Saylor believes that Bitcoin is poised for significant growth. Instead of growing at a rate of 20-40% per year, Bitcoin could see a much more rapid surge, potentially pushing Bitcoin to a $280 trillion asset class. As for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, they will likely experience a new lease on life with the emergence of a clear regulatory structure, which Saylor describes as a “crypto renaissance.” He sees a future where millions of new digital assets will be created, leading to the growth of exchanges, wallets, and applications. While there may be setbacks, Saylor believes this shift will bring new opportunities and a thriving digital economy. Need for a Clear Framework As per Michael Saylor, the crypto market as a whole now has new hope. He believes that other digital assets will thrive if a clear regulatory framework is set. In addition to this the rise of tokenized assets, including stablecoins, could help grow the industry from a $100 billion to a $1 trillion market. Ethereum, along with Bitcoin, stands to benefit as the digital economy rapidly evolves, bringing millions of new digital assets to life.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-26 11:26:02

The shift is the culmination of a rally that kicked off on Christmas Eve when the token gained over 30% in 24 hours. PENGU Rises Data from the crypto price tracking website CoinGecko shows that the broader Solana meme coin market has experienced explosive growth, with its total valuation rising to $18.2 billion, a 10.3% increase over the last day. Anchoring this performance was PENGU, which posted an 11.2% jump in the past 24 hours and a remarkable 22.3% rise in the last seven days. The meme coin, airdropped to members of the globally successful Pudgy Penguins NFT community on December 17, has not been without controversy. Soon after the token’s launch, the floor prices of the NFT collection plunged by more than 50%, wiping out any gains made since early November. According to analysts, this was largely because the value of the collection was partly pegged on exclusive access to the brand, with the introduction of PENGU making investment in the NFTs more accessible, therefore diluting their worth. On its rollout, the coin shot to a record high of $0.0684 before dropping to a record low of $0.0114. It then see-sawed for the next few days, moving between $0.038 on December 18 to $0.0231 on December 20. However, since December 23, it has been making steady gains, going as high as $0.0417 on Boxing Day, a price that pushed its market cap to $2.62 billion. BONK Falls Conversely, the previous king of the Solana meme coins, BONK, showed more modest improvements in its price over the last seven days, going up 6.9% in that period. Further, across two weeks, it lost 17% of its value, with CoinGecko data showing another 23% plunge over 30 days, putting its market cap at just over $2.5 billion and allowing PENGU to surpass it. The competition doesn’t end there. Other meme tokens like dogwifhat (WIF) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) are vying for investor attention. On Christmas Eve, the former reached an all-time high of $1.02, pushing its overall worth beyond the $1 billion mark. However, despite Fartcoin being among the top gainers across seven days with a price increase of 13.1%, it has plummeted 15% since December 25. With a unit currently changing hands at about $$0.986, its $1.072 billion market cap is still some ways behind WIF’s $1.9 billion.

This massive surge marks the highest TVL Ethereum has recorded since April 2022, igniting discussions about the likelihood of a huge price rally in the coming months. Ethereum TVL Hits New Milestone With $90 Billion Growth Data from DeFi TVL aggregator DefiLlama reveals that Ethereum’s TVL has surged past $90 billion, reaching its highest level since April 2022. This unexpected resurgence signifies a potential comeback for the altcoin giant, further solidifying its position at the forefront of the DeFi ecosystem. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Inverse Head And Shoulders Pattern Says ETH Will Touch $12,000 A surging TVL generally signals an increased usage and adoption of Ethereum’s blockchain ecosystem. It reflects both interest and confidence from institutional and individual investors, underscoring a potential shift in market sentiment from bearish to bullish. The massive growth in Ethereum’s TVL has also sparked debates about its potential impacts on the altcoin’s price trajectory. Various analysts are speculating that this distinct milestone could trigger a price recovery for Ethereum, which has been experiencing a prolonged consolidation since its decline below $4,000. Commenting on Ethereum’s $90 billion TVL growth, crypto analyst ‘Bitcoin Buddha’ suggested that the top altcoin could be at the beginning of its next bull run, driven by market sentiment and steady bullish momentum. The analyst also cautions that not holding ETH could lead to regret, predicting an bullish altcoin season and an Ethereum bull run by 2025. Echoing this enthusiasm, a crypto member known as ‘CR’ emphasized that 2025 could be a pivotal year, as he anticipates a potential bull rally for Ethereum. The price of ETH is currently trading at $3,368, reflecting more than a 15% crash from its previous price high around the $4,000 mark. While Ethereum’s $90 billion TVL growth is a major development, DefiLlama has recorded a significant drop, with the TVL currently at $69.31 billion. Despite this decline, analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum’s future price prospects. Analysts Strong Bullish Stance On Ethereum Price Potential Various crypto community analysts are super bullish on Ethereum’s future outlook, projecting massive price rallies by 2025. According to crypto analyst Mags, Ethereum is gearing up for a massive price rally that could propel it to a new all-time high of $7,297.

As a result, his recommended portfolio emphasizes precious metals such as gold and silver alongside cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Solana ( SOL ). Part of his advocacy for alternative assets stems from a distrust of fiat currency, which he deems “fake money” destined for a crash. Interestingly, Kiyosaki has expressed gratitude for investors opting for alternative assets, noting they are avoiding putting their money in the traditional institutions, which he terms a “Den of Thieves.” But how would an investment in Kiyosaki’s preferred assets have performed in 2024? Kiyosaki portfolio 2024 returns Kiyosaki’s portfolio includes gold, silver, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Bitcoin has rallied 126.59% after peaking above the coveted $100,000 spot. Bitcoin year-to-date price chart. Source: Finbold On the other hand, Ethereum grew by 47.49% and Solana by 86.49% over the same period. Precious metals also recorded substantial gains in 2024, with gold increasing by 27.35% and silver by 24.00%. Now, if you allocated $1,000 equally among these five assets at the start of the year, a $200 investment in Bitcoin would now be worth $453.18. With a 47.49% gain, Ethereum would have turned $200 into $294.98. Solana’s performance would have grown the $200 investment to $372.98. Gold, often seen as a safe-haven asset, would have increased the $200 investment to $254.70, while silver’s rise would have brought its value to $248.00. Combining these returns, the total portfolio would now be valued at $1,623.84, representing a 62.38% gain in less than a year. The portfolio has largely benefited from positive price action in 2024, backed by strong fundamentals. Precious metals rallied to new highs amid economic uncertainty. At the same time, Bitcoin hit a record high of $108,000, primarily driven by the impact of the halving and post-election optimism surrounding Donald Trump’s election, who is widely considered to implement pro-cryptocurrency policies. Kiyosaki’s alternative asset outlook Kiyosaki, who has long projected a global economic crash, maintains that Bitcoin, gold, and silver are central to protecting wealth. Global crash has started. Europe, China. USA going down . Depression ahead? Please be smarter with your money. Hang on to your job and your money. Biggest problem are our leaders and educators. As I have often asked “What did school teach you about money?” Regardless of… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 23, 2024 Amid ongoing debates on the ideal store of value, he has dismissed these arguments as baseless, asserting that both asset classes serve the same purpose. Indeed, with Bitcoin’s recent drop below $100,000, the financial educator has criticized individuals complaining about the correction, viewing it instead as an ideal opportunity to accumulate the asset. Overall, with Kiyosaki predicting that Bitcoin could reach a high of $350,000 in 2025, he maintains that it is not too late to buy the asset.

This merger aims to streamline the Bitget ecosystem, enhancing user benefits by integrating on-chain and off-chain activities and expanding its utility into everyday transactions via PayFi in 2025. BGB Price Soars Following Merger Announcement On December 26, Bitget informed the strategic merger of Bitget wallet token and Bitget token, which has led to a significant surge in the BGB price. The need to integrate on-chain and off-chain functionalities drove this merger, aiming to enhance its overall utility and value within the Bitget ecosystem. The token will leverage the strengths of both Bitget’s exchange and wallet services, creating a more cohesive platform for users. As part of the merger, BWB holders will exchange their tokens for BGB at a rate of 0.08563 BGB per BWB, based on the 7-day average closing price. For instance, if you hold 100,000 BWB, you would receive 8,563 Bitget tokens after the swap. This consolidation not only simplifies the token structure of Bitget but also positions it to benefit from the combined user base of over 100 million from both services. Bitget is one of the top crypto exchanges globally by trading volume. Bitget Wallet is also a leading decentralized wallet. This merger is expected to boost its market presence. It reflects Bitget’s goal of building a strong ecosystem. The token will act as a central element, increasing its liquidity and utility in blockchain applications. Exchange Future Volume and Price Dynamics After the merger announcement, the BGB token price exchanged hands at $6.86, showing a 30% increase in the last 24 hours. The price ranged between $5.46 and $6.97. This reflects significant market activity and strong investor interest in its potential. Simultaneously, Bitget Wallet Token (BWB) also jumped about 31% to $0.565, with its one-day trading volume skyrocketing 260% to $26.08 million. Notably, the crypto has touched a high of $06968 in the last 24 hours. Over the last 30 days, the token has added about 109%. Meanwhile, the Bitget token is set to expand its role significantly. Starting in 2025, it will enter offline PayFi applications. Users can use it for real-world transactions such as dining, travel, and shopping.

Cointelegraph, citing analytics from Laevitas, reported that Bitcoin futures monthly contracts are trading at a 12% premium to spot market prices, significantly above the neutral range of 5% to 10%. This trend underscores the growing demand for leveraged long positions, signaling bullish sentiment despite recent price fluctuations. Simultaneously, Bitcoin options data shows a persistent discount on put options relative to call options, further supporting a positive market outlook. Futures Contracts: A Bullish Premium Bitcoin futures are standardized contracts allowing traders to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price on a future date. The premium observed in futures contracts—currently at 12%—is a key indicator of market sentiment. Neutral Range : A 5% to 10% premium indicates a balanced market outlook. Bullish Signal : The current 12% premium reflects heightened confidence among traders, suggesting expectations of higher Bitcoin prices in the coming months. This elevated premium implies robust demand for leveraged long positions, where traders bet on price increases to amplify potential returns. Options Data: Call Options Outperform Puts Bitcoin options offer another lens to gauge market sentiment. These contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call options) or sell (put options) Bitcoin at a set price before the contract expires. Current Trend : One-month Bitcoin options show put options trading at a 2% discount to call options, a pattern that has persisted for two weeks. Market Interpretation : Typically, when traders anticipate a downturn, put options trade at a premium of 6% or higher. The current discount suggests that traders do not foresee a major correction in the near term. What the Data Tells Us About Market Sentiment The combination of bullish futures premiums and discounted put options paints a picture of strong market confidence: Optimistic Traders : The data indicates that traders are positioning themselves for price increases rather than hedging against downturns. Stabilizing Volatility : Despite recent fluctuations, the market appears to be pricing in resilience, with no immediate signs of panic. Institutional Confidence : The consistent demand for leveraged long positions and call options often aligns with institutional investor activity, reflecting broader confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Historical Context: Bitcoin Futures and Options in Action This isn’t the first time Bitcoin’s futures and options markets have signaled bullish trends: 2021 Bull Run : Elevated futures premiums and call option dominance preceded Bitcoin’s rally to its all-time high of $69,000. 2023 Recovery : Similar patterns emerged during Bitcoin’s recovery from a bear market, signaling renewed investor optimism. These historical parallels suggest that current trends could foreshadow another leg up in Bitcoin’s price. Factors Driving Bullish Sentiment Several underlying factors contribute to the strong market confidence reflected in futures and options data: Institutional Adoption : Increased involvement from institutions adds liquidity and stability to Bitcoin markets. Macroeconomic Environment : With global economic uncertainties, Bitcoin remains an attractive hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Technological Advancements : Developments in Bitcoin’s network, including scalability and security improvements, enhance its value proposition. Regulatory Clarity : Gradual progress in crypto regulations has bolstered investor confidence, reducing fears of sudden crackdowns. Potential Risks and Considerations Despite the optimistic outlook, investors should remain aware of potential risks: Price Volatility : Bitcoin’s historical volatility means that even bullish trends can experience sharp corrections. Market Overexposure : High leverage in futures trading can amplify losses during market downturns. Regulatory Uncertainty : While progress has been made, unexpected regulatory developments could disrupt market dynamics. Investor Strategies in the Current Market Given the current market sentiment, investors might consider the following strategies: Long Positions : Leveraged long positions could benefit from the anticipated price increases. Options Trading : Call options present an opportunity to profit from bullish sentiment with limited risk exposure. Diversified Portfolios : Balancing Bitcoin holdings with other assets can mitigate risk while capitalizing on market opportunities. Conclusion Bitcoin futures and options data highlight strong market confidence, with a 12% futures premium and discounted put options signaling bullish sentiment despite recent volatility. This trend underscores traders’ optimism about Bitcoin’s near-term prospects, driven by institutional adoption, macroeconomic factors, and technological advancements. However, as with any market, risks remain. Investors should approach opportunities with informed caution, balancing optimism with strategic planning.

The breach resulted in Siu’s account being used to promote a fraudulent token called Animoca Brands (MOCA), launched on the Solana blockchain through the memecoin platform Pump.fun. Animoca Brands Warns Against Fake Token On December 26, Animoca Brands posted an official warning to its X followers, stating, “Unfortunately [Siu’s] social media account has been compromised. The token launch on Solana as claimed in a post was made by the hacker.” The firm quickly clarified that neither Siu nor Animoca Brands had any involvement in the token’s creation or promotion. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT identified the attack as part of a broader phishing campaign targeting crypto-focused accounts on X . According to ZachXBT, the hacker likely used a phishing email masquerading as a copyright infringement notice from the X team. The email tricked victims into resetting their account passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA) credentials on a phishing site controlled by the attacker. Phishing Scheme Behind the Breach This phishing campaign has compromised at least 15 crypto-related X accounts since late November. The attacker deployed a fake MOCA token linked to Siu’s hacked account, which briefly spiked to a market cap of $36,700 before crashing to $6,200, as reported by analytics platform Birdeye. The token’s value plummeted almost immediately after the fraudulent post, leaving the market with minimal trading activity. The hacker’s address, responsible for deploying the MOCA token, matches those used in similar attacks over the past month, which have collectively netted the attacker approximately $500,000. Security Concerns The breach of Yat Siu’s account follows a series of similar incidents, including attacks on the accounts of RuneMine, a Bitcoin infrastructure provider. Earlier this month, popular rapper Drake also faced a similar hack , when his attacked account started promoting a Solana-based memecoin ANITA. The attack on Siu notes the growing threat of social engineering tactics used by cybercriminals to exploit high-profile individuals in the crypto space.

Currently back at just above $95,000, what do the last few days of 2024 hold for the king of the cryptocurrencies? No more rally into end of year? As we enter the last gasps of 2024 a Christmas rally has perhaps been wiped off of Santa’s Christmas to-do list once and for all. While there could potentially be one more surge from the bulls, which could take the price back to the top of the ascending channel and a new all-time high, the clock is starting to run down, and this latest reversal may have some more legs in it yet. U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF outflow continues On the buy and sell side of things, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded a fourth straight trading day of net outflows. 3.57K BTC left the ETFs on Wednesday, making this an outflow total of 15.5K BTC (around $1.5 billion) for the period of these four days. MicroStrategy aiming to provide rocket fuel for Bitcoin price With this said, many Bitcoin bulls across social media are still predicting higher prices going into Q1 of 2025. This might be in part due to MicroStrategy calling a special shareholder’s meeting where the board seeks to increase the authorised Class A common stock from 330 million to 10.33 billion, and preferred shares from 5 million to 1.005 billion. The vote is very likely to be positive for the company, given that Chairman Michael Saylor holds nearly 50% of the voting power. The resulting authorisation would allow MicroStrategy to go ahead with a future massive buying spree which has the potential to create a virtuous buying circle that forces the price of Bitcoin up and MicroStrategy’s stock price along with it. How far will $BTC price fall? Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC shows that the price rose back to once more retest the bottom of the ascending channel, from where it was rejected again. $BTC is now heading back down, and it just remains to be seen where a bounce might take place. The current price level is a good horizontal support level at around $95,600. If the price falls further, and there is a good chance this might be the case, there is support at $94,300, then an ascending trendline around $92,600, and finally the main ascending trendline which stretches all the way back to the 2021 bull market double top, which would be at around $91,000. Concerns on the 2-week chart Source: TradingView Zooming right out into the 2-week chart, there are some concerns that need to be kept in mind. The current 2-week candle is enveloping the previous one, which is bearish. However, Sunday’s close is still a few days off. Also, at the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI, which signals price momentum, is shaping to roll over. Once again, there is still time for this to change. The 80.00 level may act as support, which it has done in the past. In the meantime, the weekly Stochastic is on the way down. This would take at least another month to bottom, before potentially rising again and providing that all-important upside momentum.

The SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple, alleging that the cryptocurrency XRP is an unregistered security, has been a long saga filled with twists, turns, and dramatic courtroom showdowns. Let’s look back at the major milestones of this battle, and where things stand heading into 2025. The SEC’s Bold Move: XRP Declared an Unregistered Security In late 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped a bombshell on Ripple Labs – creators of the XRP cryptocurrency. The SEC accused Ripple of raising billions of dollars through unregistered XRP sales, claiming that XRP was a security akin to a stock like Apple or Tesla, rather than a decentralized digital asset like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This lawsuit quickly became one of the most watched cases in the crypto world, not just for Ripple’s future, but for the future of crypto regulation in the United States. A Year of Legal Challenges and Small Wins for Ripple Though the lawsuit’s origins go back to 2020, 2024 has been a pivotal year for Ripple as they continue to challenge the SEC’s claims in court. While the battle is ongoing, Ripple has secured some important legal victories, giving it a significant lead in the case. Here’s a month-by-month look at the key developments: January: SEC Pushes for Financial Disclosure The SEC’s aggressive legal stance continued into the new year. In January 2024, the SEC filed a motion to compel Ripple Labs to disclose financial documents related to XRP sales after the legal action was initiated in 2020. The request to reveal sensitive financial data was met with resistance from Ripple, which argued that such disclosure could harm its business interests and violate privacy. February: A Legal Extension for Ripple By February 2024, Ripple was granted an extension in its legal battle. Judge Analisa Torres, presiding over the case, agreed to extend the timeline for Ripple to provide detailed financial statements covering 2022-2023. This victory was significant for Ripple, as it bought them more time to prepare their defense. March: SEC Seeks $2 Billion Penalty In March 2024, the stakes were raised when the SEC pushed for an astonishing $2 billion in fines and penalties against Ripple for the alleged unregistered sales of XRP. This figure, disclosed by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, sent shockwaves through the crypto industry. Ripple, however, vehemently opposed the penalty, calling it disproportionate and unjustified. April: Ripple Disputes the $2 Billion Fine By April, Ripple doubled down on its defense, rejecting the SEC’s demand for the $2 billion fine. Ripple argued that the proposed penalties were extreme and didn’t align with the facts of the case. The dispute highlighted the growing divide between Ripple and the SEC and set the stage for a bitter legal showdown. May: Tensions Over Business Dealings In May 2024, tensions intensified when Ripple sought to seal exhibits related to its business dealings, particularly discounting details for major XRP buyers. The SEC, however, pushed back, claiming that transparency was essential to ensure fair judgment in the case. This dispute over confidentiality further complicated the already contentious legal battle. June: Settlement Talks on the Horizon By June, there were signs that a settlement could be on the horizon. Ripple filed a notice regarding the Terraform Labs settlement, which resulted in a $4.47 billion agreement. Ripple continued to advocate for a much smaller settlement, around $10 million, but the SEC demanded a much larger fine of $102.6 million related to XRP sales that were considered illegal under securities laws. July: Major Legal Victory for Ripple July 2024 marked a win for Ripple. A federal judge ruled that the sale of XRP on public exchanges did not violate securities laws, a major victory for Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency industry. However, the court also ruled that Ripple had violated securities law in its sales to institutional investors, like hedge funds, a decision that continued to leave the door open for future legal challenges. August: A $125 Million Fine Instead of $2 Billion In August 2024, Ripple saw another victory when Judge Torres ruled that the company would face a fine of $125 million, a far cry from the $2 billion the SEC had originally sought. This decision was a huge relief for Ripple, though it remained locked in a battle over penalties and other legal implications of the case. October: The SEC Appeals The battle took another turn in October when the SEC announced its decision to appeal a court ruling that restricted its ability to regulate the sales of XRP on public exchanges. The SEC argued that Judge Torres’ ruling, which determined that XRP’s public sales were not subject to investor protection laws, was a blow to the regulator’s authority over the crypto markets. The appeal was filed with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, leaving the industry on edge as the case continued to unfold. November: Trump Takes Over In early November, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the SEC to submit its main brief by January 15, 2025. The SEC requested an extension, which Ripple is opposing. Ripple is pushing for the court to uphold Judge Torres’s earlier ruling that XRP is not a security under the Howey test, a significant win for the company. November also saw a political shift, with Donald Trump’s re-election victory seen as a positive for the crypto industry. Many believe Trump’s win could influence future cryptocurrency regulations, including the ongoing Ripple case. December: New Dates Revealed In December, the legal battle intensified when plaintiff Bradley Sostack filed an appeal against rulings in Ripple’s favor. On December 23, 2024, the plaintiff was required to submit a mediation questionnaire, an important step in the legal process. Appeal transcripts are due by January 30, 2025, and Ripple must respond to the plaintiff by April 7, 2025. What’s Next for Ripple and the SEC? As we close out 2024, the Ripple-SEC saga remains unresolved. Ripple continues to make legal headway, securing smaller victories and defending itself against the SEC’s massive fines. The case is not just about Ripple’s future but the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. With both sides digging in their heels, the battle is set to continue into 2025, and the cryptocurrency world will be watching closely to see whether Ripple can finally put the legal drama behind it – or if the SEC will manage to set a precedent for crypto regulation moving forward.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|LUNA|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-26 11:56:39

The Economic Times reported on Dec. 26 that the Income Tax Department of India had unearthed a multi-faceted nexus involving hawala operators as well as cryptocurrency transactions after it raided a couple of wedding planners in Jaipur. The raids led to the seizure of $2 million, i.e. Rs 20 crores in cash and jewellery, from at least 20 wedding planners in Jaipur. Three crypto wallets linked to the rackets were also seized. Of these, two wallets were linked to local platforms and the third to a major global crypto exchange.

The stricter KYC implementation on registered crypto exchanges has made the depositing of hawala-acquired crypto extremely hard. It is suspected that the accused possibly abused exchanges with more relaxed KYC policies or employed intermediaries to exchange cash for checks to buy crypto by means of local exchanges.

The nexus, officials suspect, extends beyond the borders of Jaipur, with connections to several major cities, including Mumbai, Hyderabad and Delhi. The raids also unveiled a network of resorts, hotel owners, catering and decoration services that permitted customers to make payment either in cash or through banking channels. The authorities are now looking at conducting similar raids in other cities as part of an overall crackdown on unaccountable transactions in the wedding and events industry.

One standout opportunity is the Lightchain AI (LCAI) Presale , offering early access to a token backed by innovative technology and immense growth potential. Alongside LCAI, Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are also gaining attention as top picks for this year’s Crypto Christmas. Whether you’re drawn to cutting-edge advancements, established market leaders, or the power of community-driven projects, these three tokens are ones to watch this season. Lightchain AI Innovator in AI-Blockchain Integration Lightchain AI’s Memecoin Launchpad paves the way for creators and developers to innovate freely and monetize their ideas with ease. Leveraging AI-driven tools, this platform fosters a secure and dynamic environment to support the growing creative economy, unlocking limitless potential and fueling a thriving ecosystem. At its core, Lightchain AI boasts revolutionary technical architecture designed to meet tomorrow’s challenges. With its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), it streamlines AI-specific tasks like model training and inference on the blockchain. The Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism secures the network while rewarding nodes for valuable AI computations. Advanced scalability features such as sharding and Layer 2 solutions ensure seamless, high-speed AI tasks. Combining Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and Homomorphic Encryption, Lightchain AI protects sensitive data with state-of-the-art privacy and security, building trust for both developers and users. Ethereum King of Smart Contracts Ethereum (ETH) stays a top place in the crypto world, especially doing well in areas of money that is not controlled by banks (DeFi) and unique digital items (NFTs). The platform's move to a Proof of Stake (PoS) way of agreeing has greatly made its ability to handle more work better and use less power. This change has caused about 99.98% drop in Ethereum's use of energy͏ making it more green for both users and developers. In the DeFi area Etherum keeps a strong place with its whole worth locked (TVL) hit a two-year top of $80 billion This growth shows Ethereum's strong setup and its power to back many types of money uses. In the NFT place, Ethereum's part of the market has had some ups and downs. As of December 2023, Ethereum made up 34.6% of NFT trade volume, which is $1.41 billion dollars. While Ethereum stays a big name in this area; other blockchains are slowly getting more attention. Looking to the future, Ethereum's forthcoming Pectra upgrade, planned for early 2025, aims to further enhance the platform's scalability, security, and user experience. This upgrade is anticipated to strengthen Ethereum's position as a premier platform for both DeFi and NFTs by delivering improved performance and reducing transaction costs. Dogecoin Meme Coin with Staying Power Dogecoin (DOGE) started as a joke, but it’s grown into one of the most recognized cryptocurrencies out there—thanks to its passionate community and some high-profile endorsements. The Dogecoin community is the heart of its success, keeping the market active and creating a strong sense of belonging for its users. This community-driven energy has been key to keeping Dogecoin relevant in the ever-competitive crypto world. When it comes to adoption, Dogecoin is making waves as a payment option. With low transaction fees and fast processing times, it’s an appealing choice for businesses. For example, places like Williamsburg Pizza in New York and University Sports Grill in Arizona now accept Dogecoin for purchases like food and drinks. Celebrities have also helped boost Dogecoin’s popularity. Big names like Elon Musk and Mark Cuban have shown their support, shining a spotlight on the cryptocurrency and making it even more appealing to the market. While Dogecoin still thrives largely on speculation, its strong community, growing use for payments, and celebrity backing are keeping it firmly in the spotlight of the crypto world. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

One of these was Japan. However, Japan was among the countries that were not keen on Bitcoin reserves. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said that his government currently does not have enough information about the Bitcoin strategic reserve plans of the United States and other countries, local news agency CoinPost reported. Stating that Japan cannot yet decide whether to implement a Bitcoin reserve, Ishiba said, “It is difficult for the government to express its views on Bitcoin.” The prime minister's response came to a question from People's Protection Party Councilor Satoshi Hamada. Hamada said, “I think Japan should consider following the example of the United States and converting some of its foreign exchange reserves into crypto assets such as Bitcoin,” and asked the government for an official opinion on the matter. In response, Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba said that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin do not fall into the category of foreign exchange and added that “the government considers that the volatility of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, is inconsistent with the current system.” The prime minister’s response once again shows that the Japanese government is cautious about including cryptocurrencies in its national reserve strategy, while Trump and Republican lawmakers continue to move forward with creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. However, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the Fed would not participate in the Bitcoin reserve plan. *This is not investment advice.

Based on its innovative approach to tokenizing real-world assets, analysts are predicting that RXS will skyrocket to $1 and eventually $10. Rexas Finance has Impressive Presale Success and Strong Community Engagement, which makes it a solid contender in the Crypto market. Rexas Finance Presale Gains 317% Boosting Investor Interest At the moment, Rexas Finance’s presale price at $0.15 has led to investors taking notice, with the project achieving an incredible 317% price increase since inception. The project is flexible to users that want to tokenize tangible assets like real estate, intellectual property as well as art, linking the physical and digital economies. Rexas Finance with its presale that has now raised over $22.42 million shows the high level of investor confidence and market potential. The platform's unique ability to fractionalize ownership appeals to individual and institutional investors who seek diversified opportunities. It has a dedicated community of early adopters and has already raked in nearly 392,000 participants and paid out nearly $1 million in a prize campaign. Projections in the markets put RXS on track to reach $10 just with its anticipated launch price of $0.20 being 7,900% higher than now. Cardano (ADA): This Asset May Enter Upcoming $5 Cup The price of Cardano currently stands at $1.14, having gained 6% in 24 hours. The momentum of this cryptocurrency indicates it is on the verge of breaking out above the $1.20 resistance level, which could spark a big rally. According to analysts, ADA might test its all-time high of $3.10 before it hits the projected $5 milestone. The broader crypto resurgence, which sees Bitcoin reach over $100K, also boosts the favourable environment for ADA recovery. RSI—61, on the other hand, shows support for a bullish point of view. The good news is that with 86% of ADA holders in profit, the sentiment is still bullish, but the road to $5 might be lengthier in 2024. Comparing Prospects: ADA’s Potential Growth Loses Against Rexas Finance We have an established position of steady growth, giving us room to continue to grow slowly while enjoying a solid foundation, but Rexas Finance represents exponential potential with a truly innovative and robust use case. The overall goal of RXS is to make asset ownership as democratic as possible and provide unparalleled flexibility and convenience to the global user base.

38139146,https://finbold.com/?p=223130,1735214716,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,AI predicts Polygon price as Aave threats to leave the blockchain,https://finbold.com/ai-predicts-polygon-price-as-aave-threats-to-leave-the-blockchain/,"Polygon (POL, formerly MATIC ) is going through a significant crisis as the AaveDAO is set to vote on a proposal to leave the blockchain due to security concerns. Finbold turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze this context and provide a Polygon price prediction if this comes true. Finbold covered Polygon-Aave drama last week, as POL’s price reacted negatively to Aave’s ( AAVE ) response to the $1 billion-bridge proposal. At that time, Polygon was trading at $0.594, down 38.65% year-to-date. Why is Aave DAO considering leaving the Polygon blockchain In summary, Allez Labs, along with Morpho and Yearn, proposed transferring about $1.3 billion of the Polygon-Ethereum bridge to their protocols for liquidity supply and yield generation. Many decentralized finance ( DeFi ) users and analysts expressed concern to this proposal, including relevant leadership from Aave, the world’s leading DeFi protocol and competitor of the proponents. As a result, Marc Zeller and EzR3aL, two of the most influential figures on Aave’s governance’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) said they plan to support Aave protocol leaving the Polygon blockchain due to security concerns in a vote expected to happen in January 2025. This could be a significant hit for Polygon price and ecosystem, considering Aave represents around 40% of Polygon’s presence in DeFi, according to a DL News’ s report on December 26. Meanwhile, Polygon accounts for only 1.5% of Aave revenue, an argument Zeller used to justify his position. “Polygon is 1.5% of Aave DAO revenue,” Marc Zeller commented in a related thread. “In what world do we risk a billion of bad debt for this?” Grok AI’s POL price prediction amid Polygon-Aave drama As of this writing, POL (formerly MATIC) is trading at $0.485, down nearly 50% year-to-date. This also represents an 18% drop from when we reported Polygon-Aave’s drama for the first time on December 17. Polygon (POL, formerly MATIC) 2024 price chart. Source: Finbold Grok AI: Polygon price bearish prediction First, Grok AI believes the immediate response to Aave leaving Polygon would be bearish for POL’s price, predicting a crash. This, according to xAI’s model— paralleled to Google —could create a sell-off driving Polygon to as low as $0.30. “The loss of such a major player could shake investor confidence, leading to a sell-off. Given POL’s already negative performance year-to-date as of late 2024, an additional drop might push the price below current levels, potentially testing lower support levels like $0.30 or even lower if market sentiment turns very bearish.” – Grok AI output on the Polygon-Aave drama The AI expects a bounce up after testing the price support. Nevertheless, Grok doubles down on the bearish stance, saying Polygon will hardly surpass $0.50 in 2025. Grok AI analyzing Polygon implication if Aave DAO votes to leave. Source: Grok / Finbold The bullish case On the other hand, Grok also considers a potential upside, with a bullish price prediction for Polygon in 2025. For that to happen, the AI says Polygon’s leadership must be able to deal with the ongoing crisis and loss of confidence from investors, besides delivering a solid work next year, capable of attracting significant demand for its ecosystem. “If Polygon adapts and grows despite this setback, predictions could range from $0.63 to $1.91 by the end of 2025, as suggested by some analyses, assuming market conditions remain favorable for altcoins.” – Grok AI Grok AI Bearish and Bullish price prediction for Polygon. Source: Grok / Finbold As things develop, investors must understand the security risks using bridged assets could incur to the ecosystem and closely watch what happens next regarding AaveDAO’s decision.

Table of Contents Avalanche powering smart contracts with speed and flexibility Lightchain AI redefining blockchain with artificial intelligence Head-to-head Lightchain AI vs. Avalanche Investor perspectives: What sets them apart? Which token delivers better long-term returns? Future of blockchain innovation The cryptocurrency market is ever-evolving, with groundbreaking projects pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. One standout opportunity is the Lightchain AI (LCAI) Presale , a chance to get in early on a project that seamlessly integrates artificial intelligence into blockchain systems. Meanwhile, Avalanche (AVAX), a leading smart contract platform, continues to dominate the space with its speed and scalability. Both tokens bring unique approaches to blockchain innovation, offering exciting opportunities for investors. Let’s dive into what sets these two apart and evaluate which might deliver better long-term returns. Avalanche powering smart contracts with speed and flexibility Avalanche has made a name for itself as one of the quickest and most trusted blockchains, drawing in builders with its great transaction speed and changeable blockchain answers by Subnets. It’s strong home for many things like money systems, art sales sites, and game apps which makes it a common pick for new͏ ideas in block chain. Avalanche can handle more than 4,500 trades each second (TPS), and is made for growth. Also, its changeable Subnet setup lets builders make custom blockchains, which adds to its use full ness. But, Avalanche’s main interest still lies in old blockchain markets such as DeFi and NFTs which, even though they are successful, limits its reach to the industries beyond those niche. Lightchain AI redefining blockchain with artificial intelligence In contrast to Avalanche’s focus on smart contracts, Lightchain AI stands out by integrating blockchain with artificial intelligence to solve real-world challenges. Its features set it apart from other emerging projects. Using a unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus model, it rewards nodes for completing AI tasks such as model training, turning the blockchain into a productive AI network. Lightchain AI also brings tangible benefits to industries like healthcare, logistics, and supply chain management through its AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps). Furthermore, its optimized infrastructure ensures scalability, allowing it to handle complex AI workloads without sacrificing network efficiency. By merging blockchain and AI, Lightchain AI pushes beyond traditional financial applications, making it appealing to a wider range of industries and use cases. Head-to-head Lightchain AI vs. Avalanche Aspect Avalanche (AVAX) Lightchain AI (LCAI) Core Focus Smart contracts, DeFi, and NFTs AI-powered decentralized solutions Market Position Established Emerging Innovation Fast transactions, Subnets AI integration, PoI consensus Long-Term Utility Developer-friendly infrastructure Real-world AI applications Scalability High Optimized for AI computations Tokenomics Fixed supply Deflationary with token burning Investor perspectives: What sets them apart? Avalanche stability and expansion Avalanche is perfect for investors seeking exposure to a well-established ecosystem. With its speed, scalability, and growing partnerships, it’s a reliable bet for steady growth. However, its market saturation and dependency on specific sectors (DeFi and NFTs) might limit explosive returns. Lightchain AI innovation and early-stage potential Lightchain AI, on the other hand, is ideal for those willing to invest early in a smart project. Its presale pricing of $0.003 offers ground-floor access to a token with exponential growth potential. By addressing diverse industries through AI integration, Lightchain AI positions itself as a transformative force in blockchain. Which token delivers better long-term returns? Choosing between Avalanche and Lightchain AI depends on your investment strategy. For steady growth Avalanche offers a proven platform with a growing user base and ecosystem. It’s a solid choice for moderate, reliable returns. For exponential returns Lightchain AI’s unique combination of blockchain and AI, coupled with its deflationary tokenomics, makes it a high-risk, high-reward option for investors seeking early-stage growth opportunities. Future of blockchain innovation Avalanche and Lightchain AI represent two different paths to success in the crypto world. Avalanche leverages its established position to dominate traditional blockchain markets, while Lightchain AI pioneers new territory by integrating AI for broader applications. With the potential to revolutionize industries and drive blockchain adoption, both tokens offer exciting prospects for long-term investors. As the market continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how these two projects fare and what new innovations they bring to the table.

Users are cautioned to avoid sending emails about SHIFU tokens and urged to verify information through official channels. ‘Protect Yourself This Christmas’ Despite the festive season, scammers don’t have days off and are always on the lookout for new victims. One particular group in the cryptocurrency sector , which bad actors attack quite regularly , is the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community. A few days ago, Shibarium Trustwatch (an X account that aims to provide security) alerted users to be extra cautious with several common crypto scams. The first is giveaways, which offer “free” tokens, merchandise, or NFTs. “Remember, free stuff is never truly free – providing personal information puts you at risk,” the team warned. Second, the community should stay vigilant for phishing emails. Fraudsters often send emails to victims, claiming to be from official SHIB-related projects, thus trying to steal their login credentials. Next on the list are social media accounts. The team cautioned that scammers create fake profiles on social media platforms pretending to be influencers, developers, or official accounts that offer tempting deals. “Verify handles and avoid DMs offering quick profits,” Shibarium Trustwatch warned. Ponzi schemes, fake charity appeals, fake customer support, and malicious links are the other things the SHIB community should be careful about. “Providing personal information or falling for these scams doesn’t just put you at risk – it may lead to your data being sold on the dark web, where hackers can use it for identity theft or other malicious activities. Scammers exploit trust, kindness, and generosity, especially during the holiday season, so we must stay vigilant. Let’s keep the Shibarmy strong and safe this holiday season. Be cautious, protect your crypto, and share love responsibly. Nothing in life is free. Even the things that seem free often come with hidden costs or risks,” the team concluded. The SHIFU Warning Earlier this month, Shibarium Trustwatch issued an alert concerning the meme coin SHIFU. The team claimed that bad actors request victims to send them an email containing information about the token: “Fraudsters are asking people to send them an email asking how to buy and claim SHIFU or if SHIFU has not appeared in their wallet.” Shibarium Trustwatch advised users to stay away from that scheme and not send emails to anyone. Verifying information through official channels and avoiding sharing personal data is also necessary. SHIFU is a dog-themed meme coin within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which was introduced by Shytoshi Kusama at the beginning of the month. While it can be found on certain decentralized exchanges, leading crypto platforms like Binance have not yet embraced it. A few weeks ago, the meme coin project launched a special airdrop. The team announced that 30% of the total SHIFU supply (30 billion tokens) will be allocated to the community. Of this, 22 billion SHIFU will go to holders with at least 100,000 SHIB and 100 BUBBLE. An additional 2 billion tokens are set aside for eligible LEASH holders, while BONE owners will receive 1 billion tokens . The remaining 70% of the supply will be reserved for other purposes, including “liquidity and public pre-sale,” treasury funds, and marketing efforts.

South Korea’s sanctions South Korea imposed sanctions on North Korea due to crypto hackers and IT workers. These sanctions are to stop North Korea from using illegal online activities to fund its nuclear weapons and missiles. South Korea and its allies are intensifying their efforts to prevent North Korea from making illegal money through digital currencies and IT work. South Korea has identified Bureau 313, a cyber unit under North Korea’s Ministry of National Defense, which is part of the Workers’ Party of Korea’s Machine-Building Industry Department. Data from Chainalysis shows that in 2024 alone, North Korean hackers stole $1.34 billion in cryptocurrencies, over 60% of all crypto thefts globally this year. These stolen funds are to directly support North Korea’s weapons programs, which cover about 40% of the costs of developing weapons of mass destruction. South Korea’s sanctions target about 15 individuals and one organization linked to Bureau 313. These people are mostly IT experts who use their skills to infiltrate international IT markets. North Korea on hacks North Korean hackers are believed to have carried out some of the biggest cryptocurrency thefts. The FBI recently revealed that North Korea was behind the $308 million stolen from the Japan-based crypto company DMM Bitcoin , which caused it to shut down. Additionally, last week, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two people and one company for helping North Korea launder stolen cryptocurrencies through a front company in the United Arab Emirates. IT workers usually go to countries like China, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Africa by hiding from North Korea to get jobs with international companies. Once hired, they do illegal things like hacking, stealing cryptocurrencies, and hiding stolen money. For example, Kim Cheol-min worked at IT companies in the U.S. and Canada and sent a lot of money back to North Korea. It shows that North Korea doesn’t rely on hacking. They also have skilled IT workers who use fake identities to get real remote jobs and earn money from other countries. The Lazarus Group , linked to the North Korean government, was behind major hacks, such as the $620 million theft from Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network in 2022. Seeing the value of blockchain and digital money, South Korea has set strict rules to keep its crypto market safe. For instance, the country’s Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) system requires crypto exchanges to follow strict anti-money laundering rules and use real-name account systems. These efforts are meant to stop North Korea from making illegal money and to make crypto safer.

The tokens related to those agents are now flowing into the Base ecosystem. AI agents from Virtuals Protocol are gaining influence with Base simultaneously becoming the destination for AI token trading. Initially, AI agents used Solana to spread their tokens, but that trend has shifted to Base, another low-latency, cheap network. New AI agents are springing up every day, entering a fierce competition for mindshare just like memes. However, instead of memes, AI agents are also offering rapid content creation, testing and refining their engagement strategies. DEXs on Base have seen an inflow of AI agent tokens from Virtuals Protocol, with these tokens taking up 15 out of the 25 top liquidity pairs. Base DEXs are still most widely used to boost the influence of Coinbase’s CBBTC, a wrapped form of BTC compatible with the L2 chain. Virtuals is now the second-biggest asset category, serving as a proxy for its entire ecosystem of AI agents. Virtuals Protocols drive new AI agent creation VIRTUAL traded at $2.94 as of December 26, down from a recent peak above $3.10. The platform emerged as the leader in creating new AI agents, which proliferated on social media. VIRTUAL shifted the gear from introducing singular agents to bringing an entire competitive ecosystem. The GAME agentic framework has been active for about a month, producing more than 200 projects. Launching an AI agent is more intensive compared to launching a meme token, but growth is happening fast. It's been just over a month since @GAME_Virtuals was made available for @virtuals_io agent builders to use. We've seen: – 200+ projects building using GAME with a collective market cap of >500mn – 150k requests sent daily on GAME – 200% week-on-week growth GAME is getting… pic.twitter.com/CokwQQmuYb — Virtuals Protocol (@virtuals_io) December 26, 2024 AI agents are themed on the Virtuals platform, offering a range of options for the agent’s character. The platform brings both entertainment and meme agents, as well as agents in the productivity, creativity, information and on-chain categories . Some compare the rise of Virtuals on Base to the early days of Pump.fun on Solana. AI agents have to compete for both on-chain trading and social media influence, especially after the creation of new agents becomes progressively easier. Some of the newly launched Virtuals AI agents are starting to achieve prominence and even earning the makings of blue-chip status. AIXBT is among the top tokens, trading near its all-time high of $0.37. The token is still valued under $300M, potentially primed for a higher valuation. Tokens graduating from Virtuals are also competing with external projects, including AI16Z and ELIZA. Top AI agent tokens consolidate value at the end of 2024 The AI agent sector had a slow build-up over the past year, only coming into the spotlight in Q4. All actively traded AI tokens are valued at $8.7B in total market capitalization, at one point reaching a record above $10B. VIRTUAL became the leader in that space, displacing all other singular agents. The token is valued at $2.956B in total market capitalization, offering growth due to its role as an infrastructure provider. The question remains whether FARTCOIN could be counted as an AI agent token. FARTCOIN still trades close to $1B in total valuation, but it offers no additional features. In contrast, AIXBT and other agents from the Virtuals platform also connect with each other and accelerate their influence on social media. The emergence of AI agents asks new questions of meme assets. Agents and their content and entertainment often rely on meme culture. However, AI agents may replace the hype of memes, as the category competes for mindshare. The AI narrative slowed down at the end of December, based on Kaito’s social media data . The AI hype competes with DeFi and memes for social media representation and an inflow of funds. AI agents are expected to be one of the hottest topics extending into 2025. After the experimental stage of individual agents, the focus shifts to infrastructure and launchpads, as well as adding DeFi elements. AI agents are combining and extending previous Web3 trends with elements of NFT ownership, meme cults, DEX activity, and DeFi.

It is one of the most transformative innovations of the 21st century, revolutionizing industries with its ability to ensure transparency, security, and decentralization. Nonetheless, according to critics, the technology is yet to be proven to solve real-world solutions despite the innovations made in industries such as healthcare, real estate, supply chain management and governance. This may ring true. Despite hundreds of millions of people across the world having used the technology , many still use it for speculation – buying up cryptocurrencies with the hope of becoming instant millionaires in the near future. This article aims to disprove the logic that blockchain technology is only used for speculation purposes. We delve deeper into the utility and rapid innovations in the space, showing you, the reader, how the technology is pushing boundaries beyond traditional applications like cryptocurrencies. The article further discusses the top emerging blockchain trends that will revolutionize technology in 2025, mentioning some of the projects leading this innovation journey. Top Innovative Trends Taking Shape In Blockchain Technology As stated, blockchain technology has been at the forefront of revolutionary technologies in the 21st century. Notwithstanding, the industry itself is witnessing a revolutionary change, with new innovations popping up in the space every couple of months. One of the leading innovations in the space is the rise of interoperability and cross-chain solutions. Over the years, blockchain innovation has suffered from connectivity across networks, with each network siloed in its ecosystem. This has led to liquidity fragmentation, inefficient data communication, and reduced innovation across blockchain ecosystems. As the year turns, interoperability will be a key factor in enabling seamless data exchange and asset transfers across networks. In addition, building efficient cross-chain networks will ensure a robust, interconnected blockchain ecosystem, which is key to enhancing scalability, innovation, and efficiency in a growing blockchain universe. Secondly, the blockchain ecosystem is also witnessing rapid changes in the field of decentralized finance (DeFi), as communities build more scalable and user-friendly platforms. In 2024, DeFi has evolved from simplistic transactions such as borrowing, lending and staking to more complex financial instruments such as restaking, tokenized real-world assets and insurance. The new DeFi 2.0 has the potential to provide even greater financial inclusion to the underbanked and unbanked, as it offers a more secure, accessible and user-friendly experience. Finally, blockchain is slowly amalgamating itself with futuristic technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and big data to push forward the next generation of innovative products. Merging into these futuristic technologies allows blockchain platforms to be intelligent, adaptive and highly secure. This integration creates solutions capable of analyzing massive datasets, automating processes, and even self-learning. The Top Blockchain Products To Look Out For In 2025 The list above is in no way exhaustive. Several advancements in blockchain are currently being made, including eco-friendly innovations, privacy-enhancing technologies, decentralized governance platforms, enterprise blockchain solutions, staking platforms and more. While several projects could have made it to the list, the following are the projects that we believe will set the trend for blockchain innovation in 2025. From time-based frameworks to decentralized data networks and efficiency-driven consensus mechanisms, the list discusses our top blockchain picks for 2025. Analog One Interoperability remains a key challenge for developers and users across the blockchain realm. Analog , a suite of omni-chain interoperability protocols that simplifies access to Web3 data and removes barriers to cross-chain communication, aims to solve these challenges. Via its Timechain, Analog GMP, and Analog Watch, the platform allows developers to build their DApps on any chain, from Ethereum to Polkadot and beyond. Analog revolves around the Timechain, a sovereign blockchain ecosystem that serves as a ledger for all its activities—essentially acting as an Accountability Layer. The network pioneered the Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism to ensure high levels of security and that all network activities are transparent and verifiable. The Anagog GMP allows developers to move data and value across chains with unparalleled decentralization, security, and cost efficiency. Chrono.tech While blockchain utility has majorly focused on investment opportunities, one company is changing this by solving employment challenges globally. Australian-based blockchain company Chrono.tech is unlocking a new world of employment opportunities for anyone with an internet connection globally. The company focuses on human resource solutions for enterprises and businesses worldwide, allowing them to source talent and pay their employees promptly and fairly. Chrono’s main goal is to minimize and eliminate the bottlenecks to recruitment and payment processes for both workers and employers. The platform has four major platforms to ensure increased efficiency in global employment, namely LaborX (a global recruitment platform that connects individuals with work opportunities and enables them to get paid in crypto), TimeX (a hybrid exchange that offers users faster, secure, and cost-effective transactions, as well as, protection against front-running and illegal activities), PaymentX (an automated cryptocurrency payroll solution for enterprises), and AUDT (a stablecoin backed by Australian dollars in a 1:1 ratio). Fetch.ai Artificial intelligence is here with us and blockchain companies are increasingly merging the technology into their products. Fetch.ai is one such company that helps developers create AI platforms and services on a blockchain. The platform allows anyone to build and deploy AI services such as negotiators and agents at scale, anytime and at their convenience. The decentralized AI-powered platform provides users with autonomous machine-to-machine transactions and services, impacting several industries such as supply chain management, data interoperability, and more. In addition, Fetch AI allows users to monetize their unique AI agents, AI apps and services. Users can also join the platform’s ‘Agentverse’ and carry out the effectiveness of the AI Agents' semantic descriptors and get analytical insights to improve their discoverability on their platform. Band Protocol The emergence of oracles in the blockchain space improved the space immensely, helping networks (which inherently rely on internal data) to bridge external data onto the blockchain. This helped supply blockchains with verified, off-chain data, empowering smart contracts to interact dynamically with the outside world. Chainlink pioneered the development of oracles within the blockchain ecosystem but recently several platforms are rising to challenge it – primarily Band Protocol. Band Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts. The platform is rising as a worthy competitor to challenge the dominance of Chainlick in the oracle space with its innovative cross-chain data oracle feeds. The platform leverages the Cosmos SDK and its own blockchain, BandChain, to offer a customizable, flexible and scalable oracle to multiple blockchains. This could lead to the development of complex DApps that share data, which leads to enhanced innovation in the wider blockchain space. Energy Web Finally, 2025 could be the year that Web 3 projects finally champion the creation of energy-efficient and sustainable products. Platforms such as Energy Web are leveraging blockchain technology to help global companies to identify, transform, and validate specific business processes that make them more sustainable. As the calls to make businesses “greener”, platforms such as Energy Web are integrating blockchain to make this a reality. The company allows companies to utilize its native currency, $EWT, to configure, launch, and maintain distributed computing networks that ingest data from external sources, execute custom workflows, and vote on results in order to establish consensus on how to make their business more environmental friendly. In addition, the blockchain is designed to decarbonize the energy sector by allowing companies to conduct peer-to-peer trades on carbon credits to accelerate the companies’ climate goals. Conclusion In conclusion, the rapidly evolving nature of blockchain technology is expected to continue its trend in 2025, with new innovations set to be built for the betterment of the society. These changes will not only redefine the possibilities of blockchain technology but also shape the future of industries across the globe. From AI and decentralized data networks to interoperability and gree energy, blockchain will stand at the forefront of this wave of innovation in technology. It is an exciting time to be a part of this space, and we can't wait to see what the future holds. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, this article explores what would happen to Ethereum price if BTC collapsed to $80,000. Can ETH still manage to retest $4,000 or will it drop lower? Let’s explore this outlook via ETH technical analysis and also by taking a look at what on-chain data shows. Are ETH whales accumulating or selling their holdings? Ethereum Price If Bitcoin Crashes To $80,000 The four-hour chart shows that the ETH price crashed 25% since the formation of the double top on December 16. Furthermore, this drop is due to Bitcoin’s weakness and is caused by the recent crash below $100K to $95K. A high correlation between Bitcoin & Ethereum is the reason why Ethereum follows Bitcoin’s footsteps. As a result, a drop in Bitcoin to $80,000 would cause Ethereum price to crash lower as well. The aforementioned 25% drop led by Bitcoin pushed ETH to flip the $3,539 and $3,656 support levels into resistance. Although there was a recovery bounce, lack of bullish momentum coupled with weak Bitcoin outlook, ETH rejected from $3,539, hinting that the bulls are not in control. If this outlook continues and Bitcoin crashes to $80,000, Ethereum could easily revisit $3,000. In a worse-case scenario, Ethereum price prediction notes that ETH could revisit the $2,500 support level. ETH/USDT 4-hour chart But will such a fateful crash occur for Bitcoin? What if BTC does not crash, but continues to climb higher? Let’s explore what would happen to Ethereum if Bitcoin overcomes $100,000 and restarts the bull run. Under these conditions, Ethereum price could also rally. Furthermore, on-chain metrics are showing that whales are accumulating ETH as it dropped 25% in the past week. Whales Accumulate 240,000 ETH in a Week Supporting this positive oultook is the accumulation of ETH done by whales holding between 10K to 100K tokens. These whales’ holdings increased from 25.02 million to 25.26 million ETH in the past week. This massive dip-buying activity scooped 240,000 ETH worth $1.15 billion Ethereum tokens from the market and is generally a positive signal. ETH Supply Distribution Ethereum’s Short-term Holders Capitulate Based on Santiment’s 30-day MVRV indicator, which hovers around -10.72%, the short-term holders are capitulating. This indicator tracks the average profit and loss of investors who accumulated ETH in the past month and are currently sitting at an average loss of 10.72%. However, when an altcoin dips in the opportunity zone, i.e., between -10% to -20%, short-term holders capitulate, allowing long-term holders to buy the dip. ETH 30-day MVRV To conclude, if Bitcoin dropped to $80,000 Ethereum price could revisit the first support level at $3,000. In a worst-case scenario, ETH could crash as low as $2,500. If we disregard Bitcoin dropping to $80,000, then Ethereum looks bullish from a technical and on-chain perspective. However, the uncertain outlook for Bitcoin price suggests that there might be an extension of the correction before BTC kickstarts a rally or slips into consolidation. Until that occurs, Ethereum price could either move sideways as a show of bulls’ strength or drop due to its high correlation with BTC. Regardless, investors must understand that the bottom is almost near.

Here’s the “silent” addendum: the SEC might warm up to crypto more than we expect. Gensler’s departure marks the end of an era that saw the SEC ramp up enforcement efforts against the crypto industry. His tenure, which was marked by aggressive regulatory actions, will now give way to a new regime under President-elect Donald Trump. The appointment of Paul Atkins, a figure seen as more crypto-friendly, sets the stage for the commission’s new era. The question remains: What does this transition mean for the future of crypto regulation in the US? Gensler’s departure: A bitter goodbye to the crypto “Grinch” Gary Gensler’s time at the SEC has been nothing short of turbulent, especially in the eyes of the cryptocurrency community. From the start, Gensler and his tough stance on crypto initiated a series of enforcement actions against prominent crypto companies, including Binance and Coinbase, accusing them of violating securities laws. His actions were not limited to regulatory notices. Billions of dollars in fines and lawsuits followed, even for the likes of crypto community favorite and Tesla CEO Elon Musk . It’s safe to say no one from the community is sad that he’s leaving. The House of Representatives even said his leadership makes the SEC a “rogue agency.” GARY GENSLER LITERALLY SHAKING when asked if #eth is a security or a commodity and refusing to answer the question pic.twitter.com/GD9lg6cOaT — Tyler Strejilevich (@TylerSCrypto) April 18, 2023 However, Gensler’s resignation doesn’t come solely due to pressure from the crypto industry. While President-elect Trump had promised to fire Gensler on “day one,” he lacked the authority to do so. Gensler’s five-year term runs until 2026. However, it is customary for SEC chairs to resign with a change in administration. His departure has been framed as part of the broader political dynamics surrounding the incoming pro-crypto Trump administration. In a statement announcing his resignation, Gensler defended his record, emphasizing the SEC’s mission to enforce laws and hold wrongdoers accountable. Yet, many in the crypto sector will remember Gensler’s tenure for its focus on enforcement rather than regulatory clarity . Gensler pushed the crypto industry as far as he could The SEC’s regulatory approach under Gensler led to significant friction with the cryptocurrency community. Just months ago, Crypto.com took legal action against the SEC. Today, https://t.co/pFc4Pz9nFR filed suit against the SEC to protect the future of crypto in the U.S.: https://t.co/kXxyhF7zFe — Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) October 8, 2024 The company, along with others such as Robinhood and Uniswap, accused the SEC of overreaching in its enforcement of unregistered securities laws. Some argued that the agency’s broad application of securities laws to digital assets lacks proper authority. Advocacy groups and state officials alike have also expressed their frustration with what they saw as an undiplomatic regulatory regime. A group of 18 state attorneys general, including Kentucky, Florida, and Texas, filed a lawsuit against the SEC, accusing the agency of unconstitutional overreach. These attorneys general argue that the SEC’s aggressive stance on crypto infringes upon states’ rights to regulate their own economies, disrupting an industry that has been rapidly growing in both influence and value. At the heart of this dispute is Gensler’s insistence that most cryptocurrencies, aside from Bitcoin and Ethereum, qualify as securities. His stance has created a murky regulatory environment for businesses operating in the space. The lawsuit challenges the SEC’s expansive interpretation of its jurisdiction and argues that the agency’s enforcement actions are harming the very citizens they purport to protect. A new era under Paul Atkins: What’s next for the SEC? With Gensler’s resignation, all eyes turn to Paul Atkins, Trump’s selection to take the helm of the SEC. Atkins, a former SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush, is seen as a stark contrast to Gensler. He is known for his pro-market and pro-innovation stance, and his appointment has been welcomed by many in the crypto industry. President Donald Trump announced Paul Atkins as his selection for the SEC Chief role. Source: X Atkins has long been an advocate for deregulation in certain sectors, and industry leaders see his understanding of crypto as an asset. Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs, and Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, both praised Atkins’ appointment, as they believe the pro-crypto lawyer is the best choice to lead the financial industry forward. “We’ll see an SEC that has clearly different priorities than that of the Gensler SEC,” said Alison Mangiero, executive director of the Proof of Stake Alliance, in an interview with The Block. Atkins is expected to take a more hands-off approach to regulation, focusing on fraud and ensuring investor protection without overburdening the industry with excessive red tape. For many in the crypto sector, this means fewer enforcement actions against companies not involved in fraudulent activities and a shift away from the type of “novel cases” that Gensler’s SEC pursued, often to establish legal precedents. One key area where change could be immediate is in the approval of crypto-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Under Gensler, the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs but held back on other digital assets, including Solana and XRP. With Atkins at the helm, there is speculation that the SEC could approve additional crypto ETFs or revisit the issue of staking in ETFs. The future of crypto regulation looks bright, but is it? Atkins’ confirmation could mark the beginning of a new regulatory era for the crypto industry, one that emphasizes clarity over enforcement. However, it is still uncertain how the SEC will handle some of the ongoing rulemaking processes, such as Regulation ATS, which could require decentralized projects to register with the agency. The new leadership at the SEC will have to balance the need for investor protection with the desire to foster innovation. In the meantime, crypto companies are bracing for the final months of Gensler’s tenure. If you are asking whether the regulatory landscape will change, the answer is yes. But if you’re asking when it will, your guess is as good as ours. The community insists Atkins will help the industry adopt a more sensible approach that encourages development and investment without overregulating. As Gensler prepares to leave the SEC and Trump’s administration succeeds “lukewarm on crypto matters” Biden, the crypto sector looks toward a future that, for the first time in years, seems more favorable for financial innovation.",OP-ED|Binance|Coinbase|Crypto.Com|SEC,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-26 13:15:36

According to prominent crypto analyst CrediBULL Crypto, XRP is showing strong potential after profits were secured on an earlier long position. With its bullish setup, there’s growing speculation that XRP could hit $2.65 soon. XRP/BTC Pair Looks Strong In a recent update, the CrediBULL Crypto pointed to the XRP/BTC pair as one of the most bullish setups in the entire crypto market, especially given its recovery from recent lows of $1.96. Perhaps now the XRP/BTC chart hints at a fresh opportunity, with the price forming a solid base that could lead to an upward breakout. $XRP currently trading back at my original entry on the $XRP long I shared earlier so securing profits looks like it was the right move. With that being said, the XRP/BTC chart below looks absolutely fantastic, so I will be looking to position long once again for another trade… https://t.co/oKMZCscyEb pic.twitter.com/K3WUz3eFjr — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) December 24, 2024 However, the recent XRP/BTC chart reveals a steady “powder keg” effect, where the price is consolidating in a key support zone while building pressure for a strong move. Meanwhile, the formation of higher lows and consistent support off the recent bottom highlights XRP’s resilience. CrediBULL Crypto even called this “the most bullish-looking chart in the entire crypto space,” showing high confidence in XRP’s next phase. Analyst Plans a New Long Position Looking at the XRP’s bullish scenario CrediBULL Crypto has shared plans to enter the market again with a long position in the coming days. This confidence adds weight to the bullish outlook for XRP/BTC. Based on the analyst’s one-hour chart suggests that XRP might first move slightly downward before shooting up by more than 65%. The chart also shows a possible inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, which is seen as a positive sign in technical analysis. This pattern often signals that prices could rise soon, making XRP a coin to watch closely. XRP Price Analysis Despite these price fluctuations, XRP Whales recently added 40 million tokens during the price dip, showing strong confidence in its future. As of now, XRP is trading at $2.178 , down by over 4% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the token is eyeing crucial support at the $2.35 level. However, some analysts believe that if XRP can break through this resistance, it could spark a rally, clearing price levels of $2.40, $2.50, and $2.65. From there, XRP might aim for $2.72 and potentially surge as high as $3.50.",News,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-26 13:19:31

In a video chat with Altcoin Daily analyst Austin, Michael Saylor outlines why Bitcoin could reach $13 million per coin by 2045, focusing on its unique qualities as the “world’s first perfect monetary asset.” Unlike traditional assets such as gold, real estate, or equities, Bitcoin’s hard cap of 21 million coins makes it a safer investment choice to fight inflation, and other market risks. Unlike gold, real estate, or stocks, Bitcoin’s supply is limited, and its value grows as more people trust it as a safe haven for their money. Bitcoin stands out as a fixed, unchangeable asset in a world where currencies lose value due to inflation. Over the past century, the U.S. dollar has lost 99.9% of its value, and weaker currencies fare even worse. Traditional assets, even scarce ones like waterfront real estate, can be expanded or created. By contrast, Bitcoin’s scarcity is absolute, making it an unparalleled store of value. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Advocate Michael Saylor Says He Was Wrong About Ethereum, Here’s Why , Historically, $13M Possible? Looking at the Bitcoin graph, Bitcoin has appreciated at an average rate of 60% annually over the past decade, significantly outpacing traditional investments like the S&P 500, which grows at 15% annually. Over time, Bitcoin could absorb significant portions of global wealth—estimated at $500 trillion—shifting capital from equities, bonds, and real estate to this digital asset. Bitcoin’s recent actions show that the market is maturing and short-term dips will not impact Bitcoin. Institutions are diving into Bitcoin don’t miss out! Read Bitcoin price prediction and stay ahead of the game! This process according to Saylor, is similar to water flowing downhill and will see Bitcoin climb from $55,000 in 2024 to $13 million by 2045. As its market cap grows from $2 trillion to $280 trillion, Bitcoin will become a cornerstone of global wealth, transforming the financial market. Based on his analysis Bitcoin will deliver an annual rate of return of 29% over the next 21 years. Saylor is even bullish on Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve plan and suggested the U.S. adopt a Digital Assets Framework with a Bitcoin reserve, claiming it could generate up to $81 trillion for the national Treasury, reduce the national debt, and give the economy an instant boost. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Table of Contents 1. NOW Wallet: perfect for life on the move 2. Trust Wallet: A reliable option 3. MetaMask: Convenient access to the web3 universe 4. Exodus Wallet: Aesthetics and functionality 5. Guarda Wallet: Surviving the test of time Conclusion Managing your investments while traveling the world can be a real headache, especially if you’re constantly moving between time zones, airports, and remote work destinations. This is especially true for equity investors and traders where liquidity dries up within three hours of the NYSE opening bell. But for today’s digital nomads, crypto is more than an investment, it’s a way to stay connected to a 24/7 borderless economy. Whether you’re working from a café in Portugal with the help of their popular Digital Nomad Visa or exploring coworking spaces in Thailand under their flexible remote worker programs, keeping track of your crypto portfolio should be easy. Unlike traditional banking systems that can feel cumbersome abroad, non-custodial wallets offer travelers the freedom to access, manage, and secure their assets wherever they are. These wallets give you full control of your funds, work across mobile and desktop platforms, and eliminate the need for third-party intermediaries. In this article, we’ll explore five promising non-custodial crypto wallets that make managing your digital assets a breeze. 1. NOW Wallet: perfect for life on the move NOW Wallet is a game-changing non-custodial wallet built for those who need secure, on-the-go access to their crypto. Developed by the team behind the instant crypto exchange ChangeNOW , NOW Wallet is tailored for globetrotters, offering a seamless experience across mobile (Google Play and App Store, with ratings 4.5 and higher) and desktop (macOS, Windows, and Linux) platforms. Best features for travelers: Multi-currency and Multi-network support: NOW Wallet supports over 70 blockchains and 1,500+ tokens, including crypto OGs, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), privacy-focused coins like Monero (XMR) , AI cons such as The Graph (GRT), leading stablecoins , and many more.

Built-in exchange service : Execute fast and transparent cross-chain swaps powered by ChangeNOW, removing the need for external exchanges. Pro benefits : ChangeNOW brought years of experience and know-how into NOW Wallet, and all of its users get cashback from every exchange performed, access to AML checks, unlimited crypto loans, and private web pages for receiving payments. Fiat-to-crypto support : NOW Wallet supports over 60 fiat currencies with payment methods like Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay, Google Pay, and bank transfers. NFT support : Send, receive, and securely store NFTs on Ethereum and Solana and, if you wish, show them off to the folks you meet on your travels.

For travelers, NOW Wallet provides the ultimate freedom to manage crypto assets wherever life takes you. Its intuitive design and flexibility make it a must-have for those seeking both convenience and security. 2. Trust Wallet: A reliable option Trust Wallet is one of the most popular non-custodial wallets in the crypto space due to its strong brand reputation and straightforward interface. Best features for travelers: Mobile-first design : Trust Wallet is optimized for both Android and iOS mobile devices. Multi-currency support : Trust Wallet supports exposure to multiple blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Binance Coin. NFT integration : Whether you’re collecting or showcasing digital art during your travels, Trust Wallet simplifies NFT management. Built-in exchange : Swap crypto assets without leaving the wallet’s interface. The swaps are designed for quick or last-minute transactions. Browser for dApps: Trust Wallet offers optional access to a dApp browser that provides exposure to decentralized finance platforms, NFT marketplaces, and games. Token staking : Stake selected assets, including Binance Coin and Tron, to earn passive rewards while you travel. Trust Wallet doesn’t offer native desktop support, which might pose an issue for workers who still prefer to operate from a large screen. However, its mobile approach means users can take advantage of smooth crypto management on the go. 3. MetaMask: Convenient access to the web3 universe For crypto users who want to focus on the decentralized web while traveling, MetaMask is the go-to wallet. Best features for travelers: Mobile and browser extension : MetaMask’s mobile app and browser extension offer flexibility to manage crypto assets on the go or from a laptop. EVM compatibility : Manage assets on Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, Arbitrum, and other EVM-compatible networks. Web3 access : MetaMask enables users to access DeFi platforms (e.g., Aave and Compound), connect to decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, or interact with NFT marketplaces like OpenSea. Customizable gas fees : Adjust gas fees for transactions to match your urgency. Wallet security : Users can take advantage of advanced wallet security features beyond just a password. This includes a seed phrase, and biometric authentication for added protection. Multi-account management : Create and manage multiple wallets within the app to separate personal, business, or travel-related transactions efficiently. While MetaMask has a reputation for being the top wallet for web3 capabilities, it primarily supports Ethereum and EVM-based networks. This will certainly limit options for users managing multi-chain portfolios. 4. Exodus Wallet: Aesthetics and functionality Exodus Wallet is a perfect choice for travelers who want a wallet offering both aesthetics and functionality characteristics. Best features for travelers: Multi-currency support : Exodus supports most of the popular assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, along with meme coins and stablecoins. Built-in exchange : Perform quick swaps between cryptocurrencies without leaving the wallet. This is a convenient feature when converting crypto for local spending. Hardware wallet integration : For travelers who demand next-level security, Exodus integrates with Trezor hardware wallets. Cross-device synchronization : Exodus wallets make it easy to sync your crypto portfolio across desktop and mobile apps. Portfolio tracker : View and monitor your crypto holdings with a user-friendly portfolio tracker that automatically updates asset values in real time. Customer support : Exodus provides responsive customer support through live chat and email to assist users with troubleshooting while traveling. While Exodus delivers a premium user experience, it lacks extensive dApp support compared to rival wallets. Staking features are also limited compared to more staking-focused wallets like NOW Wallet. 5. Guarda Wallet: Surviving the test of time For travelers who need a versatile wallet that works across multiple platforms, Guarda Wallet is an excellent choice. Best features for travelers: Multi-currency support : Guarda supports over 50 blockchains and more than 400,000 tokens, including top coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and privacy-focused coins like Monero. Staking options : Earn passive income while you travel by staking assets like Tron, Cosmos, among others. Fiat integration : Guarda makes it simple to buy crypto using fiat currencies, including credit cards, bank transfers, and credit cards. Cross-platform : Guarda, like many of its rivals, works on mobile, desktop, and web devices. Top-notch security : From wallet encryption to secure backups and multi-signature options, Guarda gives users peace of mind that their funds are always protected. While Guarda’s feature set deserves it a spot in the top five wallets, the user interface will likely feel overwhelming for new users. Advanced users with diversified portfolios that demand a platform that makes it easy to complete transactions in seconds may find an advanced user interface to be more of an inconvenience than a benefit. Conclusion For today’s digital nomads and frequent travelers, managing crypto doesn’t have to be complicated. Non-custodial wallets provide the flexibility, control, and security needed to keep your assets within reach, no matter where you are or how busy your schedule is. From Trust Wallet’s simplicity and MetaMask’s web3 capabilities to Exodus’ sleek interface and Guarda’s versatility, each wallet caters to specific needs. While it is difficult to select a leader among the pack, NOW Wallet can be considered as the ultimate companion for travelers. Its user-friendly platform, support for thousands of assets, features like endless swaps, staking options, and access to a built-in exchange make it a must-have tool for investors of all shapes and sizes who are always on the go.

Ryan Salame, a former top executive at the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX , reported to federal prison in October to begin serving his 7.5-year sentence for his role in the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried ‘s multi-billion-dollar crypto empire. However, according to a Business Insider report , Salame’s release date has suddenly been moved up by more than a year. Federal Bureau of Prisons records show that Salame is now set to be released on March 1, 2031, just over a year earlier than his original sentence. Salame pleaded guilty to criminal charges in May 2023 and began his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Cumberland. He was deeply involved in Bankman-Fried’s operations and was among other FTX executives who pleaded guilty in connection with the fraud scheme. While the exact reason behind the sentence shortage remains unclear, the report noted that Salame’s attorneys didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Alameda Research was FTX’s hedge fund, using its own technology and trading platform to trade thousands of digital assets, including major coins, non-fungible tokens, and altcoins. Salame also became the CEO of FTX’s Bahamas subsidiary. In 2022, FTX crashed due to mismanagement of funds, lack of liquidity and the large volume of withdrawals. FTX filed for bankruptcy as it couldn’t handle all of its customer transactions due to “low liquidity.” Furthermore, the exchange spent customer funds illegally, as well as illegally funded loans and projects of Alameda research. Prosecutors claim that Salame helped FTX accept customer deposits through a U.S. bank account without having the required licenses.

This time, the target is Tether, the crypto industry’s biggest stablecoin issuer, and the ammunition is Donald Trump’s presidency. Bloomberg’s latest editorial predicts what’ll happen when Trump’s crypto-friendly policies collide with Tether’s controversial practices. But let’s just call this what it is — an attack on crypto, laced with political undertones. It’s not the first one this month either. Tether acts as a digital dollar, providing traders a safe haven from unstable local currencies and other volatile cryptos. It’s supposed to be simple: for every Tether token issued, there’s an actual dollar in reserve. But Bloomberg doesn’t buy it. According to the editorial, Tether operates more like a dodgy offshore bank than a transparent financial institution. Its reserves reportedly include Bitcoin, risky loans, and investments nobody can seem to fully identify. Add shady associations to the formula. Over the years, Tether’s name has popped up in investigations involving everyone from North Korean hackers to Irish gangsters and Hamas operatives. Bloomberg points to these links in accusing Tether of enabling billions of dollars to move in and out of the criminal underworld. Trump makes Tether even bigger Admittedly, Trump’s administration is already too cozy with Tether. His pick for commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has direct ties to the stablecoin issuer via his company Cantor Fitzgerald, which owns a 5% stake in Tether, earning millions in custody fees and pushing for plans to lend billions against Bitcoin. For Bloomberg, this is the beginning of the end. It argues that the deeper Tether integrates with Wall Street, the higher the chances of a catastrophic fallout. Trading volume exploded after Trump’s election, with Tether moving $4.6 trillion in November alone. What’s worse, the news outlet argues that Tether’s continued growth could turn a crypto crash into a full-blown financial crisis. Imagine if Tether’s reserves—already packed with risky assets—collapse. Bloomberg warns this could drag down firms like Cantor and infect traditional financial markets. But wait, it gets juicier. Bloomberg accuses Tether of being a tool for crime. Federal prosecutors have had their eyes on the company for years, and the Treasury Department has floated the idea of sanctions to remove it from American markets altogether. Tether, for its part, denies any wrongdoing and insists its reserves are fully backed. Still, with Trump back in the Oval, Bloomberg argues that Tether could flourish in a way that makes these alleged risks impossible to ignore. Bloomberg slams Trump’s Bitcoin reserve plan Bloomberg isn’t just targeting Tether, as aforementioned. They’ve got a bone to pick with Trump’s rumored Bitcoin reserve plan too. The idea, backed by Trump and first created by crypto-friendly Senator Cynthia Lummis , involves the U.S. government holding onto 200,000 confiscated Bitcoins—worth $20 billion—and buying another million over five years. Supporters compare it to the country’s strategic petroleum reserve, which stockpiles oil for emergencies. However, Bloomberg published an editorial earlier this month calling it “the biggest crypto scam yet.” It argues that Bitcoin has no industrial use, no intrinsic value, and no connection to the real economy. In the news outlet’s eyes, it’s nothing more than a speculative asset, with its value entirely dependent on market hype. According to Bloomberg, a government Bitcoin reserve would enrich early holders, inflate the price, and leave taxpayers holding the bag. Funding the purchases would mean either borrowing more money—adding to the national debt—or printing more money, fueling inflation. And if Bitcoin’s price tanks, the reserve could end up worthless, leaving the government with a pile of useless digital tokens. Bloomberg also warns that a Bitcoin reserve could push banks deeper into crypto. Imagine banks lending dollars against Bitcoin collateral, only to panic when prices drop. The media giant says this could lead to another financial crisis, complete with bailouts and taxpayer-funded rescues. And the irony is not lost on Bloomberg either. Bitcoin was supposed to be about freedom from governments and banks. Yet here we are, with centralized financial institutions lobbying for subsidies and government backing. Bloomberg calls it the ultimate betrayal of Bitcoin’s original vision. And it’s not wrong. Bloomberg’s bias and political games Here’s the thing, though: Bloomberg’s motivation might have more to do with bitter politics than the Satoshi gospel. The company, owned by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, has a history of taking potshots at both. You see, Michael is a Democrat and a longtime Trump critic who hates crypto. He even ran for president in 2020 on a platform that included a heavy campaign against crypto. So, it’s no surprise that Bloomberg’s editorial board is now going after Trump’s crypto policies with a vengeance. But while Bloomberg’s warnings might scare some, they don’t tell the whole story. Tether and Bitcoin have survived worse. The crypto industry thrives on uncertainty, and every time someone declares its demise, it comes back stronger. As for Trump, he’s not likely to back down. We doubt the self-proclaimed “crypto president” ever even thinks about Michael Bloomberg.",OP-ED|BTC|Cantor Fitzgerald|Tether|Treasury Department|USDT,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-26 13:39:20

However, despite the recent dip, traders remained optimistic about the long-term trajectory of SHIB, indicating strong confidence in the crypto. Amid this, a top market expert hints at a potential rally for the dog-themed meme coin to $0.00008 in the coming days. Shiba Inu Price To Hit $0.00008? The crypto market retreated today with Bitcoin and top altcoins taking the biggest hits. In addition, the top meme coins also traded in the red, sparking concerns among investors over what lies ahead for the digital assets space. However, despite the recent pullback, the market optimism remained high for Shiba Inu price ahead. In a recent analysis, top crypto market expert JAVON MARKS said that a bullish signal has appeared on the recent price chart of SHIB, sparking market optimism. In addition, the expert said that the crypto is poised to rally to $0.000081 ahead, adding that “A more than 3.33X in an over 234% climb for Shiba is in the cards.” Source: JAVON MARKS, X This analysis has fueled discussions in the broader market about whether the top dog-themed meme coin could witness a strong recovery ahead. On the other hand, the recent market trends and positive developments of SHIB also indicate a potential rally ahead for crypto. On the other hand, another market expert InvestingHaven has shared a SHIB price outlook for 2025. In a recent X post, the expert said that the crypto could hit $0.0000998 in 2025 if the bullish momentum holds. At the same time, he also warned that the crypto could end the year at $0.0000234 if the bearish pressure remains. Source: InvestingHaven, X SHIB Recovery Ahead? The latest SHIB price chart showed that the crypto was down over 6% and exchanged hands at $0.00002167, with its trading volume falling 32% to $518.5 million. Over the last 24 hours, the crypto has touched a high and low of $0.00002314 and $0.00002146, respectively, indicating the volatile scenario in the market. Furthermore, SHIB Futures Open Interest plunged 10% today, reflecting the gloomy sentiment hovering in the market. However, despite the dip, the recent market trends hint at a potential recovery ahead for Shiba Inu price. For context, SHIB lead Shytoshi Kusama has recently lauded the SHIB: The Metaverse launch, while hinting at more “TREATS” for the community soon. This has fueled speculations over the potential developments of the ecosystem ahead. In addition, the recent Shiba Inu burn rate soared 160% with 18.97 million tokens burnt from the supply, Shibburn data showed . This also indicates a bullish road ahead, as the decline in supply often helps in pushing the prices higher. Having said that, the recent burning spree of the meme coin could boost the SHIB prices higher. Besides, positive on-chain indicators for SHIB also suggest that the crypto could target the $0.000045 level ahead.

Here are All the Need-to-Know Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-is-the-current-state-of-the-process-of-creating-a-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-in-the-us-here-are-all-the-need-to-know-details/,"Once seen as a far-fetched idea, a proposal to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve is gaining traction in the United States, with the support of former President Donald Trump. While proponents see it as a bold step toward securing America’s financial future, critics argue it could jeopardize Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and lead to complex economic challenges. The concept of a national Bitcoin reserve was introduced by Dennis Porter, co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, a nonprofit organization founded in 2022 to advocate for Bitcoin adoption at the state and federal levels. Once a small idea, the proposal gained momentum after Trump publicly supported it during a Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Tennessee, in July. Appearing on CNBC earlier this month, Trump expressed support for the idea when asked if the federal government envisioned a strategic cryptocurrency reserve similar to oil reserves. “I think so,” Trump replied, adding, “We’re going to do great things in crypto.” Porter sees Trump's support as a turning point that has encouraged other politicians to embrace the concept. Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming has emerged as a leading advocate of a federal Bitcoin reserve. This summer, she introduced a bill that would have the U.S. government purchase 1 million Bitcoins over five years. Lummis argues that such a move could help solve the national debt, which has reached $36 trillion, and cement America’s leadership in financial innovation. “My generation has spent federal dollars without limits for years,” Lummis said. “A strategic Bitcoin reserve gives us the chance to pay off nearly half of our national debt in the next 20 years and ensure we remain a leader in 21st century finance.” The idea has gained bipartisan support, with Democratic Representative Ro Khanna of California proposing that Bitcoin seized from criminal activity be held by the government as part of its reserves rather than sold immediately. Lummis’ plan to fund Bitcoin purchases involves revaluing the United States’ gold reserves, which are currently priced at $42 per ounce, well below the market rate of around $2,650 per ounce. By adjusting the valuation, the government could theoretically make a paper profit from financing Bitcoin purchases without issuing new debt or increasing taxes. Related News: How Will January Go in Cryptocurrencies? How is the Market Sentiment? But critics say the approach is not without consequences. Monetary economist George Selgin described the plan as a “backdoor loan” that relies on financial maneuvers to bypass traditional appropriations processes. The proposal has faced significant backlash from Bitcoin proponents who see government intervention as contrary to BTC’s original vision of decentralization. Mark Goodwin, editor-in-chief of Bitcoin Magazine, has expressed concerns that a state-controlled Bitcoin reserve could hinder BTC’s development as a decentralized currency and overpower the traditional financial system. Kathryn Austin Fitts, a former investment banker and federal official, argued that the plan benefits wealthy Bitcoin holders by creating a guaranteed recipient. She lamented that Bitcoin, once conceived as a revolutionary payments system, has morphed into what she called a “pump-and-dump financial product.” Despite the criticism, Porter and his team have continued to push the idea at both the federal and state levels. Last week, Texas introduced a bill to create a state-level Bitcoin reserve, and similar proposals have emerged in Pennsylvania and Ohio. According to Porter, the fight for Bitcoin reserves is about much more than economics. “Bitcoin is too important to give up on this fight,” he said. US President Donald Trump, who supports the idea, will take office on January 20. *This is not investment advice.

The rally, however, stalled at just above $99,800 as Asia opened for business on Thursday morning and declined rapidly to roughly $95,000 only a few hours later. Bitcoin at press time was trading at $95,300, down 3.1% over the past 24 hours. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index was lower by 4.2% over the same time frame, with ETH, SOL, XRP, ADA and AVAX among cryptos in that gauge sporting 4%-7% losses. U.S. markets are open on Thursday, and stock index futures are pointing to modest early losses; gold and oil are marginally in the green. Crypto's price action over the past 48 hours is surely on very low volume and bitcoin has still more than doubled year-to-date, but perhaps overlooked in declines over the past week is that the tailwind of lower interest rates might have become a headwind. The 10-year Treasury yield continued to drift upward early Thursday, now at 4.63% and within a few basis points of its 2024 high. The yield is now ahead by nearly 100 basis points since the Federal Reserve slashed benchmark short-term rates by 50 basis points in September. Macro researcher Jim Bianco noted that the swift move upward in long-term rates following a Fed rate cut is nearly unprecedented in modern monetary history. ""The bond market will keep selling (higher yields) the more the Fed talks about rate cuts in 2025,"" said Bianco. ""If the Fed does not back off the rate-cutting talk, bond yields will go as high as needed to start breaking things, to break inflation.""",Markets|Bitcoin|Interest Rates,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-26 13:43:14

The government of Ukraine has unveiled plans to impose “sanctions and other solutions” aimed at blocking Russia ‘s use of Bitcoin ( BTC ) for international payments, just a day after Russia’s finance minister Anton Siluanov publicly confirmed that Russian companies are already using crypto to evade Western sanctions. Vladyslav Vlasiuk, an advisor to the Ukrainian president, said that Ukraine had already alerted its international partners to Russia’s intentions earlier this year and that measures to prevent unwanted crypto payments are already in development, Ukrainska Pravda reports . “Are we at all surprised? No, we were, without exaggeration, the first to draw our partners’ attention to such plans of the enemy back in the summer. Appropriate sanctions and other solutions to block the possibility of using unwanted cryptocurrency payments are already being prepared.” Vladyslav Vlasiuk You might also like: Vladimir Putin: Bitcoin can’t be stopped Russia seeks Plan B Russia has been looking for ways to get around sanctions that have impacted its ability to make and receive international payments, even with countries like China. As crypto.news reported earlier , Russian companies have turned to using stablecoins like Tether’s ( USDT ) to carry out cross-border transactions. Some of Russia’s largest metal producers have started using stablecoins for trade with Chinese clients, though details on the volume of these trades are unclear. Sources have said that other alternatives are much slower or could risk having an overseas bank account frozen.

It currently appears weak on the day following a slight 3% loss. Last week trading ended very painfully for LTC after witnessing a serious crackdown during the week, although it found a temporal threshold after a sharp bounce and started this week’s trading on a recovery mode. That brought a relief in the past few days until it taps a key level. The recovery stalled due to a rejection and the price falls, looking weak on the intraday trading. A drop below the pschological $100 level could cause another serious correction capable of plunging the price to the $70 region or even beyond before locating a strong level for a rebound. Adjusting to the 4-hour chart, it is still following a lower low and lower high pattern. Failure to bounce back may lead to a massive market reset. But looking at the current market structure, LTC remains bullish in the mid-term despite the temporal correction – which currently appears healthy for the market as it reaccumulates for a bigger upward rally. We can expect that to happen when it finds a strong threshold. LTC’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As LTC slowly resumes correction, it must successfully plunge through the mentioned psychological level to last week’s $87 low before dipping to $78. The key support below this level is $70. If the price increases above the $114.3 resistance that broke as support last week, we can expect more recovery to the $131.5 resistance along with the $147 resistance that halted buying weeks back. A break there would confirm a new bullish rally. Key Resistance Levels: $114.3, $131.5, $147 Key Support Levels: $100, $87, $78 Spot Price: $106 Trend: Bearish Volatility: Low Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Investors in Dogecoin and PEPE are now focusing on DOGEN, a digital asset rumored to offer monumental returns. Is this the next breakout star with potential for extraordinary growth? The excitement is building as more eyes turn to this emerging coin. DOGEN: The first meme token for alpha males Designed for those who dream big, DOGEN is built for winners who demand the best. According to the team, this isn’t just a token; it’s a ticket to the Alpha DOGEN lifestyle. DOGEN is taking off with a projected 700% surge by the end of its presale, and that’s just the beginning.

Dogecoin: Meme-based crypto with growing potential Dogecoin started in 2013 as a fun alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies, featuring a Shiba Inu meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially seen as a “meme coin,” it gained significant value in 2021, entering the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. This surge was driven by social media influence, especially from Elon Musk, and the broader crypto market boom. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a joke, Dogecoin shows the power of community and social media. In the current market cycle, its growing popularity and active community might make Dogecoin an attractive option for those interested in cryptocurrency. PEPE: The deflationary meme coin inspired by Pepe the frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin on the Ethereum network, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s. Aiming to emulate the success of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE sets itself apart by eliminating transaction taxes and embracing its identity as a pure memecoin without utility. It reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion in mid-2023, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts. The project’s roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. PEPE incorporates a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, contributing to its stability. As an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum’s security. In the current market cycle, PEPE’s unique features may appeal to those interested in memecoins. Conclusion While DOGE and PEPE have less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. With expected 700% growth before presale ends and possible thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows the success of BONK, WIF, and Popcat. It builds a community of alpha leaders and offers real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

As they continue to show signs of recovery, BGB leads the current daily surge with 17% gains in the last 24 hours. Despite the recent crackdown across the crypto space, BGB showed signs of strength with a back-to-back gain in the past weeks. It pushed above $5 this week and is now on the verge of taking $7. Looks highly bullish on the daily chart. While the bulls currently appear more formidable amid dominance, the price is expected to close strong this week. Although the current market drop may affect this target price if supply increases. However, it is crucial to note that this ongoing bullish move was mainly initiated in October after a flash crash to the $0.53 level. Looking back from there to where it currently trades, BGB has seen a staggering gain. That said, the daily bias is still considered bullish following a higher high and higher low pattern on the 4-hour chart. Failure to sustain this pattern may result in a major retracement. For now, it remains under the bulls’ radar. Aside from BGB, other centralized exchange – CEX-based tokens included in today’s rally are FTT, OKB and GT – up by 10% today with BNB posting 1% gains in the last 24 hours. BGB’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Currently, there’s no key resistance on the way up. But the key potential level to consider amid the latest surge is $8, followed by the psychological $10 level. The next levels to watch above it are $12, 14 and $16. If a pullback occurs, the closest line of support is $4.9. The $3.5 level is the next support to consider for drops. A deep correction from there may slide the price to the $2.41 level before rebounding.

According to a December 25 report from CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the exchange’s reserves fell below 570,000 BTC, marking a significant decline as investors move their holdings into cold storage. Historically, such withdrawals are seen as a bullish indicator, reflecting long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s price. Notably, a similar pattern occurred earlier this year. In January, reserves hit comparable lows, and just two months later, Bitcoin soared to $73,679, achieving a then all-time high. “Periods of significant withdrawals often coincide with positive market momentum,” noted Darkfost. With Bitcoin currently priced at $98,680, some analysts speculate it could follow the same trajectory, potentially reaching $187,500 in the coming months if history repeats itself. Dominance Levels Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market now stands at 58.4%, inching closer to the critical 60% threshold. While this level historically signals Bitcoin’s strength, some analysts warn it could also trigger a shift toward alternative cryptocurrencies. Benjamin Cowen, founder of Into The Cryptoverse, predicted earlier this year that Bitcoin would test the 60% dominance level by December, a milestone achieved on October 30. Whether this trend persists remains to be seen as market dynamics evolve. Despite its current strength, Bitcoin has struggled to sustain prices above the psychological $100,000 mark . After hitting a record high of $108,300 on December 17, Bitcoin’s value has been trading below $100,000 since December 19. Future Bitcoin Price Projections Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, attributes Bitcoin’s current downtrend to the seasonal volatility typical of the Christmas period. However, he expects market activity to rebound in the coming weeks as funds reposition themselves ahead of key political events, including Donald Trump’s inauguration. “Post-Christmas, we usually see a spike in trading activity,” said Lee. “Bitcoin is likely to trade within the $94,000 to $105,000 range, with the possibility of exceeding $105,000 once liquidity returns.” As Bitcoin’s price consolidates under $100,000, market participants are watching closely to see if the new year will bring another historic rally.

What was once a fringe interest, dismissed by mainstream financial experts and government regulators, is now a central topic in investment circles and Washington, D.C. policy discussions. The digital asset market, led by Bitcoin, has clearly reached new heights and has garnered interest from retail and, most importantly, institutional investors. The landscape of crypto investment is almost completely different from what was seen in the last 5 years, and the momentum looks very sustainable. Bitcoin at $100,000: Once a dream, now a nightmare scenario Bitcoin’s meteoric rise in 2024 is undoubtedly the highlight of the year. Bitcoin’s price surged by about 120% since the beginning of the year, but it crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time in November. BTC/USDT price chart for the year 2024. Source: TradingView The price uptick came on the back of several catalysts, including the presidential election and the growing acceptance of crypto in traditional financial systems. As of December, Bitcoin’s market capitalization ballooned by nearly $1.7 trillion, per Coingecko data . Analysts, including Bitwise’s Matt Hougan, predict Bitcoin could top $200,000 before the end of 2025, with more institutional investments expected as the market matures. The arrival of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 was a huge turning point for the crypto. The approval of these financial instruments allowed retail investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly owning it, essentially democratizing access to the asset. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, once a vocal skeptic of crypto, now recommends that investors allocate up to 2% of their portfolios to Bitcoin. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, became the fastest-growing ETF in history. As of mid-December, the 11 Bitcoin ETFs launched in the US had amassed $100 billion in assets. A pro-crypto US administration Analysts believe the election of Donald Trump, a self-identified pro-crypto candidate, and the “Red Wave” that saw Republicans take the majority number of seats in Congress, paved the way for the current market bull run. Trump’s campaign and subsequent victory resonated with crypto enthusiasts, especially those advocating for fewer regulations and clearer laws. The President-elect has made it clear that his administration will be friendly to the crypto industry. He has followed through on his pledge to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who was seen as an obstacle to crypto innovation, replacing him with Paul Atkins, a crypto advocate. Since then, Trump has proposed the creation of a “strategic national Bitcoin reserve,” but we aren’t certain it will come true. Many of his appointees, including venture capitalist David Sacks, have the deepest ties to the crypto space. With that, blockchain now has a strong voice in Washington and Wall Street. While it remains to be seen exactly how far the new administration will push pro-crypto legislation , the signals are clear: crypto will have strong support at the highest levels of government. Institutionalization of crypto: ETFs, liquid staking, and the role of Big Money Spot crypto ETFs have made it possible to do what we once dreamed about; traditional investors can now enter the market without having to deal with the complexities of directly purchasing and holding digital assets. “You had folks who would have been allocating to Bitcoin, but because there was no traditionally trusted, easy, efficient way to do it for their circumstances, they weren’t in it,” BlackRock’s Robbie Mitchnick said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “And then the ETFs changed that.” Meanwhile, the growth of decentralized finance (defi) has been complemented by innovations such as liquid staking, which allows institutional investors to stake assets without locking them up for extended periods. Liquid staking protocols like Lido and EigenLayer have come up with innovative strategies to maximize capital efficiency while offering staking rewards. They have opened up additional opportunities for institutions to engage with digital assets more intimately. Pro-crypto legislation and the road ahead While the regulatory landscape is still in its infancy, 2024 has seen positive steps toward an imperative basis of regulation: the path to clarity. According to industry insiders, these changes could have a much larger impact on altcoins than Bitcoin, which already benefits from a more defined regulatory framework. The upcoming changes to the regulatory environment, which will see Paul Atkins take charge of the US SEC, could usher in a new wave of innovation, with entrepreneurs leveraging blockchain and tokenization technologies to build meaningful, value-added businesses. However, there are still hurdles to overcome. Many traditional financial institutions, like Goldman Sachs, remain cautious about crypto. For them, the stumbling block remains the ongoing uncertainty around regulatory frameworks. “Everyone’s speculating as to how that regulatory framework will evolve, but it’s still unclear how the regulatory framework is going to evolve,” David Solomon, Goldman Sachs CEO, remarked at a Reuters conference. Despite the fears from traditional financial institutions, the optimism surrounding crypto has never been higher, especially in light of the incoming administration’s apparent support. A year of growth and innovation Looking ahead to 2025, the prospects for the digital asset industry are brighter than ever. With a pro-crypto administration and regulatory clarity on the horizon, the space is poised for continued growth. The increasing adoption of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, alongside growing institutional investment in defi and altcoins, sets the stage for a strong year. 2024 was the year that laid the foundation for the crypto revolution, but 2025 will likely be the year when the industry truly matures. Capital flow into the space is increasing, and new innovations are emerging at an accelerating pace. For digital asset enthusiasts and investors alike, the future looks incredibly promising. If increased clarity, a supportive political environment, and rapid institutional adoption become a reality, the digital asset market could change for the better.

Memes have come a long way, from niche internet jokes to full-blown speculative trading instruments. Now, with Goatseus Maximus ( GOAT ), we even have the first AI agent millionaire . While I had initially written off meme coins as gambling chips at the crypto casino, it takes foresight to see what they truly signify. Murad Mahmudov’s presentation at TOKEN2049 in Singapore opened my eyes. You might also like: Creator economy 2.0: AI and web3 define the digital success | Opinion From Dogecoin ( DOGE ) or Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) to Bonk ( BONK ) or Pepe ( PEPE ), crypto memes are rallying points in today’s hyper-digital world. They provide folks with a shared language and identity—the assurance of belonging—where legacy institutions and market structures are failing them. Murad says we’re in a ‘meme coin supercycle,’ and tribal loyalty and community sentiments drive markets more than utility. I think he’s totally on point—the signs are everywhere, in the trenches and also outside. As an OG, I’ve had to question whether or not traditional business advice is mostly useless in web3. The ‘token is the product’ here. So innovators and devs might be wise to focus on building based tribes and tight-knit communities, not just some abstract underlying utility. Neither more infra nor more apps Starting with Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), a culture of anarchy together with cutting-edge tech defined crypto’s value proposition. It came with the promise of a decentralized and trustless world built around individual autonomy. But more than fifteen years later, crypto-tech hasn’t quite fulfilled its promises … yet. While more infra and more apps might increase the coolness of blockchain and crypto, what it truly needs—especially for mass adoption—is more emotional touchpoints and narratives around which people can huddle. The next billion users don’t care about the tech or which big-shot VC is investing in the next shiny object. They care about having fun with a community of like-minded people. The ‘public good’ or social impact projects created downstream from here—are the cherry on top. Take DOGE, the OG crypto meme coin, for example. It was born with satirical intent and no groundbreaking tech or VC funding to back it up. I was in the room at the Ethereum Foundation in Zug when DOGE was launched. It was an intentional joke; tech bros said, “Let’s not take ourselves too seriously.” Yet it now has over 6.9 millionholders, and the community is using its money to fund water wells in Kenya. That’s what you call bottom-up utility creation. Rather than deep-pocket investors dumping ‘use-cases’ and overvalued coins on retail, meme coins foster genuinely decentralized community formation. That’s the core strength and beauty of meme coins. Speculation aside, they incentivize geographically, culturally, and ideologically discreet people to form groups around a shared idea—mostly a fun, humorous one. And because there’s typically no ulterior, long-term end in sight, memecoin communities come together for the community’s sake. Vibing in a disconnected world Tribalism isn’t new in crypto. Bitcoin maximalism or Ethereum loyalty, for example, is nothing short of quasi-religious sentiments. The Genesis Block is a holy symbol enshrined in mathematics, game theory, and mythology. Source: Vitalik’s blog , showcasing conflicting BTC and ETH vibes This begs the question—why are meme coins booming now? The short and lazy answer would be that crypto works in cycles, and now is the time for meme coins. All of them will go to zero once the hype passes. But no. The world is becoming increasingly distraught, and younger generations are having a hard time making sense of it. There’s an utter lack of meaning—and disillusionment—as established institutions either crumble or betray their dark, anti-individual underbelly. Memes are the antidote to such banality, not just in crypto but everywhere. Even the US presidential elections were largely being fought on memetic identities like ‘ Kamala is Brat ’ or ‘ Bro Vote ’ more than hardcore policy, performance, or ideology. Earlier Brexit saw sharp divisions into ‘Leave’ and ‘Remain’ camps, with tribal language like “Remoaner” and “Brextremist” characterizing polarized conversations across the board. Although a negative manifestation, this shows how integral tribalism is to modern times and culture. Meme coins are great because they channel this rising demand for belongingness and connection into something positive and monetizable. Thousands vibed with the ‘ Goatse Gospel ,’ and many more will do so without caring if LLMs can make typos or not. Popcat ( POPCAT ), the Solana-based meme coin, is another example of fun vibes and community traction erasing the need for technical promises. Bonk thrived on similar lines to become the ‘ social layer ’ of Solana. Overall, the meme coin supercycle underlines a reality where identity is the new utility. No matter what right-curve narrative or gigabrain tech innovations projects subscribe to, a community-first approach will separate winners from losers. Without a based community, even the best tech would find its place in the dumpster. Whereas even the most mundane, uninteresting tech can go to the moon with active, loyal community support. Intrinsic value has acquired a new form altogether. Younger consumers give as much importance to fun, identity, and emotional connection as functionalities. Web3 projects, like everything else, must pass the vibe check. Builders—mainly those with web2 backgrounds—must rewire themselves to build tribes, not mere tools. AI might not take your job, but failing to serve the demands of the time surely will. The lesson is simple: community is currency, and identity is the ultimate asset.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN.

Similarly, another analyst at Investinghaven shared a chart on X, suggesting that Shiba Inu’s SHIB price will reach $0.00008 in 2025. The analyst also stated that Shiba Inu’s price action will need to break out of its current triangle pattern to begin the massive uptrend. The SHIB coin is expected to continue trading in this triangle pattern in the coming weeks. hy FXGuys is One of the Top Altcoins to Buy Now The FXGuys ecosystem is reputed for its revolutionary approach to crypto tradi+ng.

For many, missing out on Pepe Coin’s ICO is a reminder of what could have been—a tiny investment that could’ve turned into a small fortune. Launched at $0.000000001 per token, Pepe Coin quickly became a favourite among crypto enthusiasts, and before long, it surged in value, making early investors look like absolute legends. But here’s the thing: if you missed Pepe Coin’s ICO, you’re not alone. The good news? BTFD Coin is here, and it’s giving you another shot at grabbing that low-entry, high-return opportunity. With over $4.5 million raised in its presale and more than 59 billion coins sold already, BTFD Coin is rapidly growing in popularity . Better, you can buy in at a massive 50% discount using the BIG50 code at this moment and right up until Jan 5th. It’s like buying Pepe Coin at its ICO price all over again, but this time, you’re ahead of the game. Pepe Coin ICO: The Meme Coin That Took Off Back in 2023, Pepe Coin came out to take the market by storm. Initially priced at $0.000000001 per token, it quickly gained traction among meme coin fans and made its way into the spotlight. What followed was a meteoric rise—by the end of the year, Pepe Coin was trading in the hundreds of millions in market cap, and those who bought early were sitting on huge gains. Just like the story of Dogecoin, Pepe Coin became a viral sensation, supported by memes, pop culture references, and a devoted online community. The Pepe Coin ICO saw investors snapping up billions of tokens at next-to-nothing prices, but now the coin’s value is significantly higher. Unfortunately, if you missed that train, you may have been left wondering what you could have done differently. It’s tough, but here’s where BTFD Coin steps in. The beauty of BTFD Coin is that it’s still in presale, and this is your chance to buy in before the token launches at a price that’s already gained serious momentum.

The 50% discount is BTFD Coin’s way of offering the same kind of opportunity—an incredible chance to buy in when the prices are still low before they shoot up. Let’s break it down with an example: For $500 at the presale price of $0.000064, you can snag 7,812,500 BTFD Coins. Now, if the coin hits its predicted value of $0.0006 post-launch, your investment could grow to a whopping $4,687.50—that’s almost a 9x return on your investment.

From the meteoric rise of Dogecoin to the quirky antics of Shiba Inu, it’s clear that these coins resonate with a broad audience. But if you missed the boat on “Cat in a Dog’s World,” don’t sweat it! BTFD Coin is here, and it’s making waves with an incredible presale offer. BTFD Coin is not just another cute mascot; it’s primed to elevate the meme coin landscape with its engaging Play 2 Earn (P2E) game , a robust referral program, and an impressive 90% annual percentage yield (APY) on staking. This isn’t just hype—there’s real potential here. Much like savvy investors who took advantage during the 1973 economic downturn, now’s your chance to jump in while the getting’s good. With a limited-time festive discount of 50% off using the bonus code BIG50, you’ll want to pay attention! If you feel like you missed out on the Cat in a Dog’s World excitement, now’s the time to get involved with BTFD Coin. This presale is heating up, and analysts are buzzing about its potential. Let’s dig into what makes BTFD Coin a compelling opportunity for both seasoned investors and newcomers alike. BTFD Coin: The Rising Star BTFD Coin is currently in its 12th presale stage and has already raked in over $4.5 million. That’s right! It hit the $1 million mark in under 10 days and reached $2.5 million in just 14 days since launching. Starting at a mere $0.000004, the price has jumped to $0.000064 after a generous 50% discount. With over 59 billion coins sold and more than 6,600 holders—affectionately called “Bulls”—BTFD Coin is making its mark in the crypto world. One of the standout features of BTFD Coin is its Play 2 Earn game , which went live during the 10th stage of the presale. While the beta version is currently available, rewards will kick in once the full version launches. Imagine earning while you play—how cool is that? This game not only adds a layer of fun but also keeps the community engaged and excited about what’s coming next. Staking is another major draw. With an unbelievable 90% APY since staking launched on December 2, investors can watch their earnings grow just by holding onto their coins. It’s a fantastic way to make your investment work harder for you while being part of a lively community. Let’s not forget the referral program, which allows Bulls to earn rewards by bringing their friends into the fold. It creates a sense of camaraderie that enhances the overall experience, making it not just about profits but about building something together. So why is BTFD Coin capturing so much attention in this ongoing viral meme coin presale? It combines engaging gameplay, impressive staking rewards, and a strong community focus. This isn’t just an investment; it’s a movement, and you don’t want to miss out! Cat in a Dog’s World: The Previous Sensation “Cat in a Dog’s World” made quite an impression when it launched, attracting a ton of attention with its unique branding and community-driven initiatives. With a fun theme and a strong social media presence, it quickly gained traction. Investors flocked to it, hoping to ride the wave of excitement. The community aspect was huge. People shared memes, engaged in discussions, and built a loyal following around the coin. Many investors enjoyed significant returns, capitalizing on the buzz that surrounded it. But here’s the kicker: like many meme coins, that initial excitement can fade fast. The volatility in the crypto market means that what goes up can come down just as quickly. Investors are left wondering if they made the right choice or if they missed the next big thing. In contrast, BTFD Coin offers a refreshing take on the meme coin craze. With its robust features and strong community backing, it’s positioned for sustainable growth that “Cat in a Dog’s World” might struggle to maintain. As the landscape evolves, BTFD Coin is proving to be a more stable and engaging option for those looking to enter the meme coin market. So why does BTFD Coin stand out from the crowd? While “Cat in a Dog’s World” had its moment, it’s clear that BTFD Coin is gearing up to be the next big player in this ongoing viral meme coin presale. What’s The Importance of Buying the Dip Let’s take a moment to discuss why buying the dip is such a smart move. Remember the 1973 economic disaster? A lot of sharp investors seized the opportunity to pick up undervalued assets, setting themselves up for future gains. The same principle applies today, especially in the unpredictable realm of cryptocurrency. When the market dips, it’s like a clearance sale for savvy investors. You can snag quality assets at a lower price, and when the market rebounds, you’ll be in a great position. BTFD Coin is currently in its presale phase, making this an ideal time to get involved before the price potentially skyrockets. Analysts are predicting that once the presale wraps up and BTFD Coin hits the market at $0.0006, those who bought in during this ongoing viral meme coin presale could see significant returns. It’s a classic case of being smart with your investments, just like those who capitalized during the economic downturn of the 70s. How to Buy BTFD Coin Ready to dive in? Here’s how to snag your BTFD coins: Go to the [presale page]. Connect Your Wallet: Click “Connect Wallet” and choose your wallet (like MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Enter the Bonus Code: Find the bonus code field, enter BIG50, and click “Apply.” Enter Purchase Details: Input how much $BTFD you want to buy and review the discounted price. Confirm and Buy: Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Conclusion In the fast-paced world of meme coins, BTFD Coin stands tall as a beacon of opportunity. With its engaging Play 2 Earn game, impressive staking rewards, and vibrant community, it’s clear this project is set to take meme coin popularity to new heights. The ongoing viral meme coin presale is about more than just quick gains; it’s about being part of a fun and financially rewarding movement. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers.

The 23-year-old Gabriel Hay allegedly connived with another fellow – Gavin Mayo of Thousand Oaks, also 23 years of age, to perpetrate a scheme that defrauded investors of their monies. This represents one of the many cases where cryptocurrency and other digital assets are used to perpetrate crime. The duo committed several digital asset crimes According to the Beverly Press , the duo faces one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, two counts of wire fraud, and one count of stalking. Following investigations, authorities in Beverly Hills revealed that the duo tricked investors by using a series of digital asset project “rug pulls.” “Rugpulls” is reportedly a fraud scheme in which the perpetrators create a non-fungible token (NFT) or other digital assets and ask investors to invest in it before abruptly abandoning the project. US Attorney Martin Estrada said this trend was inevitable, but also vowed his office and other law enforcers would intensify efforts to protect the unsuspecting consumers as well as punish the perpetrators of crypto fraud. “Whenever a new investment trend occurs, scammers are sure to follow.” Estrada. These criminal activities also surface spurred by new technologies that enable digital asset criminals to flourish in defrauding unsuspecting consumers. According to principal deputy attorney general Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Hay and Mayo fleeced investors in digital asset projects “of tens of millions of dollars.” The duo also allegedly threatened one individual for attempting to expose them to their fraudulent schemes. “Fraudsters take advantage of new technologies and financial products to steal investors’ hard-earned money. The department is committed to protecting investors and will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to root out fraud involving cryptocurrency and other digital assets and bring offenders to justice,” explained Argentieri. The Beverly Hills man and his colleague each face up to 20 years in jail According to authorities, Hay and Mayo each face up to 20 years in jail on conspiracy and wire fraud counts. They also face a maximum of five years each on the stalking count. It is alleged that between May 2021 and May 2024, the duo sponsored several NFT and other digital asset projects and made false statements regarding the projects. The court documents show that Hay and Mayo also provided false and misleading “roadmaps” that detailed all the plans for the NFTs after their launch, which they had never intended to accomplish. In one instance, the indictment alleges that the duo made false claims while promoting the Vault of Gems NFT project, which they said was the “first NFT project pegged to a hard asset.” Hay and Mayo then abandoned the Vault of Gems and other projects they had presented, as opposed to pursuing them. They had collected millions of dollars from investors. According to the court papers, Hay, Mayo, and others allegedly used the tactics with other digital asset projects, including Vault of Gems, Sinful Souls, Clout Coin, Faceless, Dirty Dogs, Uncovered, MoonPortal, Squiggles and Roost Coin. It is also alleged that Hay and Mayo used several methods to cover up their involvement in the fraudulent projects. However, a project manager on the Faceless NFT project exposed the duo of their involvement. Hay and Mayo then started harassing the project manager and his parents, sending them intimidating messages. “Using NFTs to commit fraud not only exploits emerging technology but also erodes trust in the broader digital ecosystem.” Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent in Charge Michael McCarthy. He added that while Hay and Mayo’s criminal activities might not involve violence, they reflect the profound harm these schemes caused to the investors who were defrauded of millions of dollars. Hay and Mayo’s case is not unique, as there has been an increase in cryptocurrency scams and other cybercrimes worldwide. Russia is reportedly one of the biggest victims of cybercrimes and suffered over 40 million data breaches during the first quarter of 2022 alone. In Oceania, Australia is the biggest victim, while Nigeria is at the top of cybercrimes in Africa, according to studies. According to AAG , it is estimated that the average cost of a cyber breach was about $4,35 million in 2022 and predicted the global economy will incur about $10.5 trillion due to cybercrime costs compared to $7 trillion in 2022. Reports also show that criminals increasingly target cryptocurrencies and other digital assets when executing cybercrimes. Earlier this year, the US government sanctioned two crypto exchanges – Cryptex and PM2BTC- for allegedly facilitating the laundering of cryptocurrencies obtained through cybercrime.

KULR, a U.S.-based company which specializes in thermal management solutions mainly for electronic components and batteries, has acquired 217.18 Bitcoin ( BTC ) for nearly $21 million as part of the company’s Bitcoin Treasury strategy. In a Thursday press release on Dec. 26, the San Diego-headquartered company said Bitcoins were purchased at an average price of $96,556.53 per BTC. Amid the news, KULR’s shares rose 3.51% on pre-market, per data from Nasdaq. The purchase follows the company’s earlier announcement of its Bitcoin Treasury strategy, in which it announced allocating up to 90% of its surplus cash to Bitcoin. KULR says the $21 million purchase is the first of ongoing purchases it intends to make going forward. KULR picked Coinbase’s Prime platform to provide custody, USDC, and self-custodial wallet services for its BTC, according to the press release.

KULR’s Bitcoin purchase comes amid a broader trend of companies embracing cryptocurrency as part of their financial strategies. Artificial intelligence firm Genius Group recently also announced $4 million in BTC purchases, raising its holdings to 153 BTC as part of its “Bitcoin-first” strategy to allocate 90% or more of its reserves to the cryptocurrency. Other companies, including MicroStrategy and Nasdaq-listed Acurx, have also expanded their Bitcoin holdings to capitalize on its role as a hedge against inflation and a store of value supporting technological innovation.

38145194,https://coingape.com/?p=230985,1735226449,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Why Bitcoin Price Is Falling Today: Is $80K Next?,https://coingape.com/why-bitcoin-price-is-falling-today-is-80k-next/,"The recent dip in Bitcoin price has sparked concerns among investors while triggering massive selling pressure in the broader crypto market. In addition, the recent market developments also hint towards a further dip, with many predicting a potential slip to $80K or even below. Notably, this comes despite the strong institutional interest in the flagship crypto, as evidenced by the buying spree of MicroStrategy (MSTR) and others. Why Is Bitcoin Price Falling Today? Bitcoin price has recorded a sharp decline today, sparking concerns in the broader crypto market. A flurry of reasons could have weighed on the investors’ sentiment recently, which has also triggered massive selling pressure in the digital assets space. For context, BTC has recorded massive rallies since Donald Trump’s election win in November. Having said that, it also provided a profit-booking opportunity to many investors, with recent on-chain data indicating heavy selling pressure on the crypto. Top crypto market expert Ali Martinez highlighted the trend, saying that 33,000 BTC, worth over $3.23 billion, has moved to exchanges recently. Source: Ali Martinez, X This indicates the profit-booking strategy, which the traders often use when an asset’s price goes higher. On the other hand, Santiment recently highlighted the BTC drop after reaching $99.8K on Christmas, sparked by bullish trader sentiment. The report noted that speculation of the cryptocurrency hitting $110K has also increased due to the recent rally. Source: Santiment, X However, Santiment suggests that historically, Bitcoin only reaches such highs when crowd expectations are low. This indicates that the current downturn may be a market correction, as traders’ high expectations for $110K may be self-fulfilling prophecies that prevent the price from rising further. Bitcoin Options Expiry Sparks Concern The recent downturn in Bitcoin price comes ahead of the largest crypto options expiry on the Deribit exchange, with over $18 billion in options set to expire tomorrow. The expiry has sparked directional uncertainty, with elevated volatility and “sharp swings in DVOL”, Deribit noted. Besides, market experts also warned that the heavily leveraged market to the upside could trigger a rapid snowball effect with any significant downside move, leading to high volatility. Notably, the Bitcoin options expiry accounts for the majority of the total notional value, with $14.27 billion set to expire. The put/call ratio stands at 0.69, indicating a slightly bullish sentiment among traders. The max pain point for Bitcoin is $85,000, which could act as a resistance level in the event of a price swing. Source: Deribit Exchange On the other hand, Ethereum options expiring tomorrow account for $3.79 billion in notional value. The put/call ratio is 0.41, suggesting a more pronounced bullish bias among Ethereum traders. The max pain point for Ethereum is $3,000, which may influence the asset’s price movement. Source: Deribit Exchange BTC Dip To $80K Imminent? The latest BTC price chart showed that the crypto plunged about 3.5% to $95,175, with its trading volume falling 1.5% to $42.45 billion. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $99,884, while maintaining a monthly gain of 2%. Further, BTC Futures Open Interest also fell about 3.5%, CoinGlass showed , indicating a bearish momentum hovering in the market. Notably, the market picture indicates that despite soaring institutional interest, the recent developments have weighed on the market sentiment. For context, MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock recorded volatility recently amid its BTC buying strategy, which has fueled market speculations. Besides, many firms like KULR have also shifted their focus towards BTC accumulation. Meanwhile, in a recent analysis, popular market expert Justin Bennett said that BTC is likely to fall to the $81K-$85K range. This analysis of Bitcoin price has fueled market concerns, with many other experts echoing a similar sentiment. Source: Justin Bennett, X For context, Ali Martinez noted as Bitcoin dipped below the $97,300 mark, it indicates a bearish momentum for the crypto.

ZachXBT says the cybercriminal stole the credentials of high-profile X accounts by sending phishing emails that impersonated the X team. The emails appear as a notice of policy and guideline violations from X to create a sense of urgency and get the recipients to click a malicious link. “A threat actor has stolen ~$500K over the past month by compromising 15+ X accounts (Kick, Cursor, Alex Blania, The Arena, Brett, etc). Each of the 15 ATOs were directly connected by mapping out the deployer address for each scam. The attacker bridged back and forth between Solana and Ethereum in an attempt to obfuscate the funding source.” Source: ZachXBT/X According to smart contract platform Neutron, the bad actor sent fake copyright infringement emails that told the targeted X users to reset their password and two-factor authentication (2FA) by visiting what turned out to be a phishing site. Once the X account is compromised, the attacker logs out all sessions, changes security settings and then controls posting access to share malicious links that promote a scam token. Says ZachXBT about security measures, “Make sure to limit email address reuse between services as well as using security keys for 2FA on important accounts whenever possible.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

This is following its successful BURNmas campaign. The community-driven initiative, marking Bonk’s second anniversary, exceeded initial expectations despite recent price volatility. While BONK’s price has declined 7.5% in the past 24 hours and 25% over the last month, the upcoming burn represents a milestone in the project’s tokenomics management. BURNmas campaign exceeds community expectations The BURNmas initiative marks a change from Bonk’s 2023 BONKmas campaign. The focus shifted from token distribution to ecosystem engagement and supply reduction. Initially planned to burn up to 1 trillion tokens, the campaign’s success prompted an expansion of its scope. Community participation surged during the final week after incentives were increased 100-fold, leading to the collection of over 1.69 trillion BONK tokens for burning. Hey BONKers, a quick BURNmas Update: During the campaign, the BONK community exceeded The Dog's (and the DAO's) expectations and REALLY showed up❗️❗️❗️ The final number of $BONK gathered by these incentives is over 1,690,000,000,000🔥 All that remains now is a DAO multisig… pic.twitter.com/GtZ16u3FK7 — BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) December 25, 2024 The campaign encountered several technical challenges during its execution, particularly with data reporting systems. Issues arose with LiveBonk data tracking and Saturnbot integration, causing fluctuations in reported burn amounts. These technical hurdles, discovered on Christmas Eve, led the team to implement a temporary display cap of “1.69T+” while resolving the final calculations. The magnitude of community participation exceeded the original proposal submitted to BonkDAO, which was designed to celebrate the project’s second anniversary. This overwhelming response has prompted the team to submit an updated proposal to the BONKDAO council. This aims to honor both the original commitment and the community’s participation by burning the entire 1.69 trillion tokens collected. BONK price down 25% in 30 days The BONK team has emphasized that reducing supply overhang through burns should be considered alongside broader ecosystem growth initiatives. This balanced approach aims to create sustainable value for token holders. Despite recent price volatility, with BONK experiencing a 25% decline over the past month, the team has acknowledged the need for technical improvements in future events, particularly in reporting systems and community transparency. Looking ahead, the BONK ecosystem appears focused on diversification beyond token burns. The team has shared plans to support projects building on top of BONK, creating additional utility and value streams. This approach combines supply reduction through burns with ecosystem expansion through development plans. The project’s governance structure, centered around BonkDAO, plays a crucial role in decision-making. The project requires a multisig vote to give the green light for the burn to happen.

What Will Be the Status of the Cases?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-will-the-sec-treat-cryptocurrencies-under-trump-what-will-be-the-status-of-the-cases/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could see significant changes to its approach to regulating the cryptocurrency industry as its leadership undergoes a transition, according to comments from current commissioners. The SEC will operate with a reduced team of commissioners starting next year as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler steps down from his position and the agency awaits Senate confirmation of President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees. Republican Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda will be the only remaining members during the transition. “We have a big package of materials,” Peirce said. “We have always looked to enforcement as our preferred tool in this area. I think when there are new commission changes and the composition of the commission changes, the composition of the cases may change.” Uyeda noted that transparency and public input are important in shaping SEC policies. Uyeda highlighted the importance of the Administrative Procedure Act in ensuring accountability through public comments on regulations. Related News: The Central Bank of South Korea issued a statement on Cryptocurrencies: A Positive Development “It is our responsibility to the American people to provide this transparency,” Uyeda said. Uyeda also cited concerns about guidance issued by SEC staff without public consultation, citing controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. The policy, which required digital asset custodians to report liabilities and corresponding assets on their balance sheets, was overturned by both houses of Congress before being vetoed by President Biden. “It’s hard to engineer change because we’ve come a long way,” Peirce said. “It’s going to take a lot of work from you and us to get back on track, but I think we can do it.” The impending leadership changes could signal a shift away from the SEC’s enforcement-heavy approach to crypto regulation. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Rexas Finance emerges as the ultimate altcoin opportunity, blending real-world utility with explosive growth, outshining even Ethereum’s bullish future. Table of Contents Ethereum: Bullish outlook vs. dropping fees Rexas Finance: How to transform blockchain investment Conclusion: Rexas finance has a bright future Despite Ethereum still being very much a powerhouse with bullish projections of $8,000 to $10,000 in the next cycle, Rexas Finance is becoming the next big altcoin opportunity. Rexas Finance is already surging with presale success of over $31.5 million and a token price from $0.03 to $0.15, a 400% rise in the last few months. According to analysts, it can convert $450 into $45,000 in sixty days and should be ideal for investors. Rexas Finance is poised to be the perfect choice with insane growth and a bunch of practical blockchain applications, all tied into one place. Ethereum: Bullish outlook vs. dropping fees With a ‘buy the dip’ strategy and long-term growth in mind, Crypto Patel predicts $ETH will go to $8,000-$10,000. Looking at his chart, we can see that it shows key resistance levels as well like the uptrend price channel and the fact that it is in a bullish trajectory despite the current dips in the market. Patel’s analysis carries a more bullish bent and shows optimism for Ethereum to achieve a new all-time high and patience and accumulation during downturns. On the flip side, IntoTheBlock points to an 80% plummet in Ethereum fees (ETH terms) over the past three years, reducing daily ETH burn. And the data reveals a fall from more than 150,000 ETH burned daily in early 2022 to much lower levels by 2024. As a result, Ethereum has been experiencing a decline as a consequence of reduced on-chain activity or enhanced scalability, and this overrode the deflationary dynamics of EIP 1559. Although the price is bullish, so is the market optimism, but the drop in fees and ETH burnt may cast a shadow on Ethereum’s deflationary mechanism strength. Ethereum’s development will therefore be critical in determining the future trajectory of the network, balancing scalability improvements with on-chain activity and market sentiment. Rexas Finance: How to transform blockchain investment With smart tokenization of assets, Rexas Finance is breaking the crypto market, and its presale performance has caught investors’ eyes. The platform aims to democratize real-world assets, like real estate, commodities, and fine art, by simplifying blockchain complexities. The early success of the token in the presale stages is evidence of a good number of investors who are confident and ready to invest in the deflationary market. Moving from S1 at $0.03 to S10 at $0.15, we have seen amazing 400% growth at Tokenizer.com over the course of three months. The project is one of the most anticipated launches for 2024, with 369 million tokens sold and $31.5 million raised. Tokenomics: A sustainable path to growth Rexas Finance has structured tokenomics that will set the platform up for sustainable growth and an ecosystem stable. The total supply: One billion tokens; a fair, thoroughly thought out token allocation to support community development, liquidity, and innovation. 42.5% early adopters can buy tokens at a discounted rate through presale sessions. 22.5% is for staking in the network, allowing investors to utilize the crypto as a stake and earn passive income, but also securing the network. Liquidity: 15%, treasury: 10%, marketing and operations: 3% each, charity and Partnerships: 2% each. The market appeal is driven by smart features Rexas Finance has a suite of utility-driven features that solve real-life problems and, at the same time, attempt to increase the adoption of the blockchain. Rexas Estate enables fractional ownership of tokenized properties, enabling greater access to the investment of real estate. With Rexas Token Builder , businesses and individuals can easily create and weigh up blockchain-based solutions, simplifying token creation. Rexas Launchpad for crypto startups is providing funding, connecting crypto startups with investors. Rexas GenAI NFT creators use it to help them design new digital assets and make blockchain to appeal to the creative industries. Rexas Treasury aggregates cross-chain yields and helps the user maximize profits across various blockchains. While speculative, however, these features make Rexas Finance more than just an asset it’s a project with real-world applications that will attract retail and institutional investors alike. Conclusion: Rexas finance has a bright future Having shone during its presale and delivered smart features and sustainable tokenomics, Rexas Finance is set for rapid expansion in the ensuing years. Its strong potential is seen with the projected listing at $0.20 in early 2025 and beyond. The token is predicted to hit $10 by mid-2025, according to analysts, who say this is a good investment for long-term investors. In the crowded altcoin market, Rexas Finance sits as distinct with its practical, utility-driven blockchain solution.

Tron (TRX) is not immune to the downturn. Earlier this month, the asset reached a new peak and reclaimed the 10th spot by market cap, which sparked a renewed sense of hope in the community. But the latest pullback extended its losses. As a result, TRX is down by over 43% from its recently established all-time high of $0.43 to the current price level of $0.25. However, data points to the formation of a local bottom soon. TRX Nearing a Turning Point? CryptoQuant’s analysis of TRX’s price heatmap revealed that the green trend, represented by the one-year moving average plus two sigma, could serve as a crucial support level during the current market correction. Historically, this green trend has acted as a strong foundation during bull rallies, and it is anticipated to provide similar support, potentially marking a local bottom for TRX’s price. TRX Chart. Source: CryptoQuant The current levels for the green, purple, and blue trends are $0.23, $0.40, and $0.49, respectively. These levels are dynamic and will likely adjust upward with increased interest and demand. As the market heats up, attention should be given to the purple and blue trends, which may act as resistance zones. If TRX price stays above the green trend, it could signal the start of a new upward trend. On the other hand, CryptoQuant warned that a drop below the green trend might indicate a weakening bull cycle. As demand strengthens, Tron’s price could target the purple and blue trend levels, with a breakthrough above the 0.40 level offering strong market confidence. What’s Next For Tron? Earlier this month, TRX’s rally was driven by speculations about Grayscale listing and Tron founder Justin Sun’s initiatives, including a $30 million purchase of WLFI tokens tied to Trum’s project and his advisory role. Sun’s involvement with the artwork “ Comedian ” has also engaged the community, igniting ripple effects for tokens like BAN and related projects. Despite the latest setback to the rally, experts point to a moderately favorable year ahead for the asset. CoinCodex, for one, predicted that TRX could see a modest 2.93% price increase to $0.264 by January 24, 2025. The sentiment remains neutral, while the Fear & Greed Index reflects high optimism at 73 (Greed). TRX has demonstrated 50% green days and 17.17% volatility over the past month, thereby indicating active market participation. Analysts view this as a good buying opportunity, with expectations of a short-term peak of $0.268 on December 30, 2024.

Ethena ( ENA ) token dropped to $0.95, moving below the psychologically important level of $1 for the first time since Dec. 20. The ongoing crash is caused by the risk-off sentiment in the crypto industry, which has caused Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other prices to be lower. It also happened as on-chain data showed that whales were selling their tokens. The biggest transaction occurred when a whale sent 11.6 million ENA tokens worth $11 million to Binance, the biggest crypto exchange. In another transaction, one trader moved ENA tokens valued at $10.7 million to the Binance. Ethena whales dumped tokens worth $30 million on Thursday, Dec. 26. These sales happened a week after Arthur Hayes, Bitmex founder and earlier investor, sold some of his ENA tokens . According to Nansen, Hayes now owns 18,616 coins valued at $17,458. Ethena price also fell as tokens on exchanges continued rising, a popular bearish view. These tokens increased by 5.82% in the last seven days to over 730.27 million. Total supply on exchanges moved to 4.87%, up by 0.27% a week ago. Ethena exchange balances | Source: Nansen Meanwhile, inflows into Ethena’s USDe stablecoin have stalled. The coin has a market cap of $6 billion , where it has been in the past few days, a sign of sluggish demand. Ethena USDe stablecoin | Source: DeFi Llama Ethena price analysis ENA price chart | Source: crypto.news Technicals suggest that Ethena may have more downward to go as it has formed a head and shoulders pattern on the four-hour chart. This pattern comprises a neckline, which is at $0.8552, two shoulders, and a head. In most periods, the pattern leads to a strong downward momentum when it moves below the neckline. Ethena has also moved to the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level and slipped below the 50-period moving average. It also fell below the strong pivot reverse level of the Murrey Math Lines. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling, with the immediate target being the H&S’s neckline at $0.8552. A drop below that level will point to more downside, potentially to the extremely oversold level of $0.5860.

Notably, in 2025, several cryptocurrency bills could potentially be passed in the United States – Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21): This bill aims to establish a clearer regulatory framework for digital assets, defining whether they are securities or commodities. The bill has already passed the House and would grant more power to the CFTC for overseeing crypto markets, particularly for digital commodities like Bitcoin. However, the passage of the proposal in the Senate is uncertain, although there is significant bipartisan interest, as highlighted in recent discussions. Stablecoin Legislation: Discussions around stablecoin regulation have been ongoing, with bills like the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act being considered. There’s a focus on providing regulatory clarity and consumer protections for stablecoins, which could potentially be included in broader financial legislation or passed as standalone bills. This would involve setting criteria for issuers and ensuring stablecoins are backed appropriately. Digital Asset Market Infrastructure Bill: This legislation would deal with aspects like custody and the integration of digital assets into traditional financial systems. There’s talk of this bill potentially passing in early 2025, suggesting a push towards infrastructure that supports crypto in financial services. General Regulatory Clarity: There’s an overarching push for regulatory clarity in the crypto space, with lawmakers like Rep. French Hill prioritizing digital asset legislation in the new Congress. This could lead to a variety of bills aimed at addressing different aspects of crypto, from taxation to AML/KYC requirements, shaping the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. The political climate, with a pro-crypto bipartisan approach and potential support from the incoming administration, indicates that 2025 might see significant legislative action on cryptocurrency, although the exact scope and nature of these bills will hinge on many factors like political negotiations, regulatory agency input, and public sentiment.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-26 15:56:49

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

Price Fails to Hold $2.20 Level appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid ongoing market uncertainty, XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs, is poised for a notable price decline following the formation of bearish price action. Besides XRP, the overall cryptocurrency market seems to be struggling to gain momentum and is facing a significant price decline. XRP Current Price Momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.153 and has experienced a price decline of over 6.8% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume jumped by 7%, reflecting heightened participation from traders and investors and suggesting concerns about a potential price decline. Why is the XRP Price Falling? However, the potential reason behind XRP’s price decline is the upcoming unlock of 1 billion tokens, as reported by CoinPedia , along with the current market sentiment. Falling Open Interest Additionally, traders appear hesitant to build new positions, potentially due to significant volatility in the market. According to Coinglass data, XRP’s open interest has dropped by 31%, hinting at the liquidation of traders’ positions in the past 24 hours. Traders Long Liquidation This price decline has liquidated $6.84 million worth of XRP long positions out of a total of $7.68 million in overall liquidations, as revealed by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level Amid this bearish outlook, XRP has failed to hold its crucial support level of $2.20. Since the beginning of December 2024, the price has reached this level four times, each time witnessing upside momentum. However, XRP has now failed to maintain this level and appears to be falling toward the next support area. Source: Coinglass However, XRP still has a chance to mitigate the price decline. Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if the altcoin closes a daily candle below the $2.15 level, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 14%, reaching the $1.88 mark in the near future. XRP’s bearish thesis will hold only if it closes a daily candle below the $2.15 mark, otherwise, it may be invalidated.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-26 15:58:30

Crypto losses due to security breaches reached record levels this year, surpassing $2 billion, while hacking incidents jumped 21% compared to last year. These alarming statistics highlight the growing need for the most secure crypto wallets. But security isn’t the only factor to consider. The ideal wallet should also offer advanced features that help users stay ahead of market trends and maximize their gains. This includes cross-chain flexibility, trading tools, and options for earning passive income. This guide reviews the four most secure crypto wallets of the year: Plus Wallet, Trust Wallet, OKX Wallet, and Ledger Wallet. This in-depth look at their features and benefits will help users choose the best option for securing their assets today. 1. Plus Wallet: The Secure Wallet That Rewards Every Trade Plus Wallet stands out as one of the most secure crypto wallets, offering top-tier protection along with a variety of powerful features. By storing private keys directly on users’ devices, it ensures complete control and sole access to assets. This local storage, along with encryption, minimizes the risks associated with third-party storage. To further enhance security, Plus Wallet includes two-factor authentication, adding an extra layer of protection in case a device is compromised. Beyond its strong security measures, Plus Wallet provides great flexibility. Its cross-chain support allows users to manage a variety of assets from one platform, simplifying the process. The wallet also features quick token listings, with new tokens available in just 15 minutes, giving users early access to new opportunities. Plus, users can enjoy these benefits while earning a continuous passive income, as Plus Wallet rewards users for every trade. This combination of robust security, and user-centric features makes Plus Wallet the most secure crypto wallet for those looking for safety, convenience, and earnings today. 2. Trust Wallet: A Gateway to dApps and NFTs Trust Wallet is a versatile app that supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and tokens across different blockchains. It includes a dApp browser, which allows access to popular decentralized applications like Uniswap and Compound, as well as NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea. The wallet makes transferring cryptocurrencies simple and secure. However, its customer support and educational resources may be less extensive compared to other platforms, which could be a limitation for users looking for detailed guidance. Additionally, Trust Wallet’s association with Binance, a centralized exchange, may not align with the preferences of users seeking full decentralization. 3. OKX Wallet: The Multi-Chain Security Solution OKX Wallet is a non-custodial, multichain tool for managing cryptocurrencies. Available on Mac OS and Windows, it supports major blockchains, including Tron, allowing users to send, receive, and swap TRX. The wallet features Multi-Party Computation (MPC), which divides private keys into three parts, offering enhanced security by reducing the risk of key compromise. It also allows seamless swaps between non-underlying and underlying tokens. However, OKX Wallet’s fiat deposit and withdrawal options are limited, which may be a concern for users who need to frequently convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currency. 4. Ledger Wallet: The Versatile Hardware Wallet Wrapping up this list of the most secure crypto wallets of 2024 is Ledger, a reliable hardware solution. Ledger Wallet, including the Nano S Plus and Nano X models, provide a secure and versatile way to manage a variety of cryptocurrencies. The Ledger Live app simplifies asset management with an intuitive interface. Both devices are compact and portable, making it easy to manage assets securely while on the go. The Nano X model also features Bluetooth connectivity for wireless management through mobile devices. However, Ledger offers convenience and security, its devices can be relatively expensive. Additionally, it features closed-source software, which has drawn criticism from users for lacking transparency. The Final Word While each wallet has earned its place as one of the most secure crypto wallets today, its unique features cater to different user needs. OKX Wallet is ideal for users looking for a convenient desktop wallet, though it may not suit those who require fiat options. Ledger Wallet is great for those seeking hardware storage, offering a range of options at different price points. Trust Wallet and Plus Wallet stand out for users wanting multi-chain support and a wide range of asset management. However, Trust Wallet may not appeal to those prioritizing complete decentralization. Plus Wallet, on the other hand, excels for users looking for effortless passive income, as it rewards users simply for trading. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

The analyst also mentioned what price levels Bitcoin could reach in the short term as it breaks above $100,000. Bitcoin Support Levels To Watch Out For As Bulls Push For $100,000 In a TradingView post, Trade PSH stated that the local maximum is $99,450 as bulls are repeatedly trying to push the price above $100,000. The crypto analyst also mentioned that the nearest key support zone comes in between $95,000 and $96,600. This aligns with a recent Bitcoinist report that highlighted the $96,000 level as a crucial support zone. Related Reading: Possible Deep Correction Could Push Cardano Price To $0.43, Here’s How While the Bitcoin price is moving above this support zone, Trade PSH stated that the primary scenario is continued growth for the flagship crypto. If Bitcoin maintains an uptrend and eventually breaks above the psychological $100,000 level, the crypto analyst predicts that the intermediate growth target is between $102,000 and $102,757. Based on the current price action, the analyst suggested that Bitcoin could rally to $108,366. This would mark a new all-time high (ATH) for the flagship crypto, as its current ATH is $108,268. Meanwhile, Trade PSH mentioned that a drop below $94,300 would invalidate this trade setup. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price could break above $100,000 and reach these short-term targets before the year ends. While that remains to be seen, it is worth mentioning that January 2025 provides a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. Pro-crypto Donald Trump is set to take office on January 20, which could lead to the creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Historically, Bitcoin also enjoyed a price recovery in January 2021 of the last bull run. As such, history could repeat itself again. BTC Is Heading Higher In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also provided a bullish outlook for the Bitcoin price, stating that the flagship crypto is heading higher. His accompanying chart showed that Bitcoin could rally to as high as $158,000 by May 2025. The chart also showed a price target above $220,000, suggesting that the flagship crypto could rally even higher.

The surge has caught the attention of traders, adding even more fuel to the already hot market. Crypto-linked stocks, however, didn’t have the same luck. MicroStrategy, Coinbase, and Riot Platforms all slid as Bitcoin took a nosedive. MicroStrategy, often seen as a Bitcoin proxy, fell about 3%, while Coinbase dropped 2%, and Riot Platforms pulled back more than 2%. Bitcoin itself was down 3% as of press time. MicroStrategy doubles down on Bitcoin buys MicroStrategy just dropped another $561 million to add to its massive stash. That makes seven weeks in a row of nonstop purchases, with the latest round coming at an average price near Bitcoin’s record highs last week. They’ve even announced plans to issue more shares, all so they can load up on even more Bitcoin. Despite the dip today, Bitcoin’s 135% gain this year has completely obliterated the returns on gold and global stocks. But don’t get too comfortable. Traders are bracing for wild swings ahead, thanks to the looming expiration of massive Bitcoin and Ether derivatives contracts. The broader crypto market wasn’t spared either, with tokens like Ether, Solana, and Dogecoin down around 3%. While Bitcoin slid, stock futures followed suit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dropped 150 points, and both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.3%. Markets were closed on Wednesday for Christmas, but Thursday morning trading made it clear that the holiday cheer was wearing off. Santa Claus rally loses a bit of steam The Santa Claus rally, a period famous for its market optimism, is still alive—but just barely. The S&P 500 has climbed 1.8% this week, while the Nasdaq surged 2.3%, thanks to major tech players like Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet. The Dow, however, only eked out a 1% gain. For context, the S&P 500 usually averages a 1.3% return during this end-of-year stretch, dwarfing its typical weekly gain of 0.3%. Jobless claims added some tension to the holiday trading buzz. Claims for the week ending December 21 came in at 219,000, below the 225,000 estimate. But continuing claims—those applying for benefits week after week—hit 1.91 million, the highest number since November 2021. Zooming out, the S&P 500 is barely hanging onto a 0.1% gain for December. The Nasdaq has done far better, up 4.2% for the month, while the Dow is down 3.6%, on track for its worst monthly performance since April. If the Dow can hold steady, it could snap a three-week losing streak—the longest it’s had since March. The market mood in a word? Uneasy.

Lightchain AI, blending blockchain with AI, is poised to rival Solana’s legendary rise, starting at just $0.003 in presale. Table of Contents Solana’s legacy benchmark for success What makes Lightchain AI unique? Comparing Solana and Lightchain AI Experts’ optimism for Lightchain AI’s future Solana of 2025? The rise of Lightchain AI (LCAI), a new AI-powered blockchain token priced at just $0.003 during its presale , has drawn comparisons to Solana’s (SOL) remarkable trajectory in 2021. With a focus on real-world utility and cutting-edge technology, industry experts believe Lightchain AI could replicate Solana’s meteoric rise, transforming the crypto landscape by 2025. Let’s explore what makes this coin the next big thing and why it’s being hailed as a potential game-changer. Solana’s legacy benchmark for success Solana’s path from nothing to being one of the best blockchains in the world has made a mark for altcoins looking for wide-use. Its fast deal abilities and small costs drew builders and money people too, pushing its worth from $0.22 in 2020 to more than ͏$200 in 2021. Lightchain AI shows Solana’s growth but with the extra help of smart machine join, fixing holes in use and opening paths to fields much beyond usual blockchain work cases. Also, Solana’s link with Serum (SRM), a not centralized trade place, caused a big rise in both projects’ fame. Lightchain AI has also had opportunities to work with famous trades and plans, pointing at the same path. What makes Lightchain AI unique?

Experts’ optimism for Lightchain AI’s future Blockchain analysts are optimistic about Lightchain AI , highlighting its potential to tackle real-world challenges and its strong development roadmap. As one of the first platforms to fully integrate AI with blockchain, Lightchain AI is establishing itself as an early mover in industries such as predictive analytics, smart governance, and supply chain optimization. This early-mover advantage positions it for significant adoption across various sectors.

Offering transaction speeds and scalability comparable to Solana, combined with advanced AI capabilities, Lightchain AI provides a powerful and comprehensive solution for developers and businesses alike. Solana of 2025? Solana set the standard for altcoins to follow, but Lightchain AI (LCAI) is rewriting the playbook with its integration of AI and blockchain technology.

Table of Contents DOGEN pumps hard: The alpha meme token taking over crypto BONK: Solana’s community-driven meme coin with rapid growth Conclusion A seasoned cryptocurrency expert who accurately predicted a massive surge in BONK is now eyeing DOG E N for a remarkable rise. With an initial price of just $0.0013, DOGEN is projected to soar to $5. This bold forecast is creating buzz in the crypto community and could signal a new opportunity for investors. DOGEN pumps hard: The alpha meme token taking over crypto Doge, Shib, and Floki better brace themselves — the true alpha is here, and it’s ready to dominate.

DOGEN is built for those who like it tough and relentless. From the moment it launched, DOGEN has been a supercharged force powered by Solana ’s lightning-fast blockchain. Designed to dominate the meme token market, this beast is geared for thousand-fold gains that leave competitors in the dust. DOGEN doesn’t just keep up, it leads the pack, showing everyone who’s boss. DOGEN believes in rewarding its loyal holders. Hardcore believers get access to an exclusive airdrop, where users can earn Golden Points to amplify their DOGEN stash. All it takes is flexing on social clout, grabbing tokens during the presale, and recruiting a squad with a referral link. For every recruit, users will pocket 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. But that’s not all — DOGEN’s referral program is a profit machine. Users earn 7% from every token bought by their direct referrals (1st level), and as the network grows, unlock even more rewards.

BONK: Solana’s community-driven meme coin with rapid growth BONK is a meme coin on the Solana blockchain featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by moving power away from venture capital tokens. After getting listed on Coinbase, BONK surged over 100%. It acts as a community coin, having airdropped 50% of its supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi sectors. By mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest meme coin by market cap and saw a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatility of meme coins, BONK’s integration into the growing Solana ecosystem and its involvement with new decentralized apps, like BonkSwap, make it a notable coin. Its potential in the current market cycle seems significant. Conclusion In summary, while coins like BONK have less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out as a meme token embodying luxury and success. Designed for those who seek the best, it follows the path of successful tokens like WIF and Popcat. DOGEN is building a community of leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 16:42:00

This price correction is expected to continue in the short term as a crypto analyst has provided a target that Solana could drop before the year ends. How Low Solana Price Could Drop In an X post, crypto analyst Crypto Sensei suggested that the Solana price could drop to as low as $167 by the end of December. This came as the analyst asserted that Solana is now going straight for that 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) touchdown. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that this 200 EMA is at $167. Based on the chart, the price drop could also happen before the year ends. Such a price correction would further erode Solana’s year-to-date (YTD) gains of around 85%. In an X post , crypto analyst Fred also suggested that the Solana price is also at risk of dropping further before the year ends. The analyst stated that SOL is approaching decision time. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the top crypto could drop to as low as $162 if this downtrend continues. However, despite a potential downtrend, the crypto analyst remarked SOL still has enough gas for another rally of over $300 over the next couple of months. More Room For Growth Despite the bearish outlook for the Solana price, the top crypto still undoubtedly has enough room to run to the upside, as Fred mentioned. Several analyses indicate that SOL could break its current ATH by next year. Asset manager VanEck predicted that Solana would hit $500 by next year, a price rally that they believe will happen thanks to scalability and DeFi and NFT adoption in the SOL ecosystem. Bitwise provided a more bullish outlook for the Solana price. The asset manager predicted that SOL will rise to as high as $750 next year as more “serious” projects move into its ecosystem. With the market trading sideways at the moment, crypto analyst Lucky believes this is an excellent opportunity to accumulate more SOL. He remarked that the crypto is in a buying zone. The analyst added that he anticipates Solana could reach between $400 and $500 in this cycle.

BTC has been marginally down over the last 24 hours and is trading at around $98,100. The price dipped to $92,500 on Tuesday before recovering. However, analysts expect a further downside as whale transactions reach a two-year high. Most cryptocurrencies opened Boxing Day in the red, with Ethereum (ETH) down almost 2% and trading around $3,430. Ripple (XRP) is also in the red, down by 2.24%, while Solana (SOL) is down almost 2% and trading around $195. Marginal losses were also reported by Dogecoin (DOGE) , Cardano (ADA) , Tron (TRX) , Avalanche (AVAX), Chainlink (LINK) , Hedera (HBAR), and Polkadot (DOT). The overall crypto market cap is down by 0.70% and currently sits at $3.41 trillion. Could We See A Post-Christmas Rally? Historical price trends for Bitcoin (BTC) suggest a recurring pattern of strong upward momentum after Christmas, especially during halving cycles. The trends show BTC enters a profit zone after each halving event, with the price increasing substantially after the holidays. BTC saw a modest consolidation before a staggering 9,000% rally after the 2012 halving. The 2016 halving saw a similar post-Christmas rally which eventually fueled the 2017 bull run. The trend repeated in 2020 when BTC surged to an all-time high post-Christmas. According to analysts, BTC’s price pattern could be attributed to seasonal market dynamics. Year-end institutional balance sheet closures and renewed capital inflows often drive investments. As institutional investors adjust their investments to manage tax liabilities and align with their investment goals, it could increase liquidity and volatility. MicroStrategy Purchases More Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy announced the purchase of 5,000 BTC, capping a frenetic buying spree that began in November. The company has since added 113,000 BTC to its reserves, worth around $11 billion. The firm now owns around 444,000 BTC, worth a staggering $44 billion. The purchase comes as the firm was added to the Nasdaq 100, an index of the largest non-financial companies on the stock exchange. MicroStrategy funds its BTC purchase by using surplus cash along with equity and debt issuances, a strategy that has come under criticism from market analysts, “Eventually, the debt will far eclipse equity, the trading premium will disappear, the conversion prices on the notes will feel unreachable, and equity price will collapse under the weight of senior debt, particularly during a gnarly Bitcoin dip.” Russia Imposes Six-Year Ban On Crypto Mining The Russian government has imposed a six-year ban on crypto mining in ten regions until 2031 due to the mining industry’s high power consumption. The ban places temporary restrictions during periods of peak demand, will come into force on January 1, and end on March 15, 2031. Russia legalized crypto mining earlier this year, with the law coming into force last month. However, it has banned using cryptocurrencies as legal tender for regular payments domestically but allows cross-border payments using crypto to evade sanctions. Russia Using Bitcoin In Foreign Trade Russia is using Bitcoin (BTC) in foreign trade and to settle international payments after legislative changes to counter Western sanctions. Sanctions imposed by Western nations have significantly complicated Russia’s trade with major trading partners, including China and Turkey, with banks wary of processing transactions linked to Russia. Russia permitted the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign trade and legalized cryptocurrency mining. Russia’s finance minister, Anton Siluanov, stated, “As part of the experimental regime, it is possible to use Bitcoin, which we have mined here in Russia (in foreign trade transactions). Such transactions are already occurring and we believe they must be expanded and developed further. I am confident this will happen next year.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has struggled since setting a new all-time high on December 17, reaching $108,268. Since then, it has declined substantially, dropping below $100,00 and the 20-day SMA over the next few sessions. The price continued to fall as the Christmas week began, as it plummeted to a low of $82,469 on Monday before recovering to current levels. However, traders expecting a move above $100,000 were disappointed despite MicroStrategy purchasing another significant chunk of BTC. BTC’s drop began after hawkish comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell’s comments about inflation and future rate cuts sparked a bearish reaction across the market, with cryptocurrencies plummeting. The markets also saw an increase in whale activity as large investors rebalanced their positions for the following year. BTC’s decline from its all-time high has coincided with this increase in whale activity. On-chain data has revealed the average transaction size for BTC jumped to $306,000 on Monday, the highest since November 2022. After reaching a new all-time high last Tuesday, BTC registered a significant decline on Wednesday, dropping almost 6% and settling at $100,195. BTC reported considerable volatility on Thursday as buyers attempted a recovery and sellers sought to lower the price. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand, and BTC fell from an intraday high of $102,792 to slip below $100,000 and the 20-day SMA and settle at $97,703. Selling pressure persisted on Friday as BTC dropped to an intraday low of $92,072. However, BTC recovered from this level as buyers entered the market and registered a marginal increase to settle at $98,124.

While the Fed has cut interest rates by a total of 100 basis points since September, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note skyrocketed by the exact same amount. Yields now sit at 4.60%, up from 3.60%, defying the Fed’s efforts and leaving analysts scratching their heads. This is the sharpest disconnect between market moves and Fed policy in history. The 10-year yield is now at its highest since May, proving once again that rate cuts don’t always mean lower borrowing costs. And borrowers are feeling it. Mortgage rates on a 30-year loan have climbed to 7.10%, up from 6.15% just three months ago. For the average home priced at $420,400, that’s an extra $400 a month out of buyers’ wallets. Inflation hits hard, markets don’t care If you’re wondering why the Fed’s rate cuts aren’t bringing yields down, the answer is simple: inflation is back. The 3-month annualized core CPI is inching closer to 4%, with PCE, PPI, and CPI data all showing a steady rise. And that’s before considering any future tariffs or tax cuts. At the November Fed meeting, when asked about this market disconnect, Chair Jerome Powell said, “It’s material changes in financial conditions that last… and we don’t know that about this.” Well, six weeks later, and the 10-year yield just keeps climbing. Adding fuel to the fire, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) hit a 25-month high, jumping nearly 8% since October. One dollar now fetches $1.44 Canadian, a level not seen in two decades. Inflation’s grip is tightening everywhere, but the bond market is laser-focused on one metric: Supercore PCE inflation. Annualized one-month Supercore PCE inflation is nearing 5%, and the headline number is back above 3.5%. A chaotic road to 2025 With inflation running hotter than expected, expectations for 2025 are changing fast. Just a few months ago, markets anticipated four rate cuts for the year. Now, they’re penciling in just two—and there’s a 21% chance the Fed won’t cut rates at all. The first cut isn’t even on the radar until May 2025, which feels like a lifetime away. Meanwhile, the stock market is on a spending spree. Since Election Day, a record $140 billion has flowed into U.S. equities. Foreign and domestic investors are doubling down despite inflation warnings and a paring back of the Fed’s pivot. If this sounds reckless, it’s because it probably is. Labor market data is adding to the chaos. Weekly jobless claims hit 219,000 for the week ending December 21, just shy of the previous period and below the 225,000 forecast. But here’s the thing: continuing claims, which lag by a week, climbed to 1.91 million, the highest level since November 2021. The Fed, for its part, isn’t backing down on its cautious outlook. Powell said, “It’s kind of common sense thinking that when the path is uncertain you go a little bit slower. It’s not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",Economy|CAD|Federal Reserve|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-26 16:45:35

According to Vladyslav Vlasiuk, Advisor to the president of Ukraine and Commissioner for Sanctions Policy, efforts are already underway to implement targeted measures to block unwanted cryptocurrency payments, reported local media Ukrainska Pravda . “Are we at all surprised?” Vlasiuk was quoted as saying, adding that Ukraine had already alerted its trade partners earlier this year about the “plans of the enemy.” The government of Ukraine is aiming to counter Russia’s attempts to bypass Western sanctions through the use of digital assets like stablecoins and Bitcoin, and “sanctions and other solutions” are in development in this regard. Sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies have long affected Russia’s ability to trade with its global partners like China and Turkey, particularly following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the Vladimir Putin-led country has sought alternative options like cryptocurrencies to retain access to global markets. Russia’s crypto plans Vlasiuk’s remarks came less than 24 hours after Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov publicly disclosed that the country has been using Bitcoin and other cryptos in cross-border trades. Moreover, the minister stressed the government’s intention to intensify efforts to expand and develop this channel even further. Earlier this year, President Vladimir Putin signed into law a bill that allows local businesses to use virtual currencies for global trading even though the use of such assets as legal tender remains restricted within Russian borders. The law came into effect in September, but Russian companies had resorted to cryptocurrencies long before that. Bloomberg reported in May that some of the country’s top metal companies were using Tether-issued stablecoin USDT to settle their trades with Hong Kong. Russia’s newfound interest in cryptocurrencies was also evident from Putin’s comments during a speech at the Valdai Discussion Club, a Moscow think tank. With a nod to Bitcoin’s decentralised nature, Putin positioned digital assets as a low-cost and reliable alternative. Bitcoin’s role remains central to Russia’s plans, and the country has moved to regulate the mining sector by legalising it in August and subsequently implementing a 15% tax on income generated. The tax law also officially recognised cryptocurrencies as property. Ukraine to regulate crypto Crypto usage has surged across both Ukraine and Russia, according to an October Chainalysis report . While Russia has already taken the initial steps, Ukraine is mulling to introduce a draft law early next year. Earlier this month, the head of the Ukrainian Parliament’s Committee on Finance, Tax, and Customs Policy, Danylo Hetmantse, confirmed that the proposed law would regulate crypto transactions while also introducing a tax framework. Plans are to tax cryptocurrencies similarly to securities, applying standard tax rates without offering any exemptions or special deductions for digital asset transactions.

The shift comes after several legislative changes to allow such transactions to counter sanctions imposed by Western nations. Russia Already Using Bitcoin In Foreign Trade Siluanov’s admission comes as Russia turns to crypto to beat sanctions imposed on it following its invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions have significantly compromised and complicated the country’s ability to trade with major partners like China and Turkey. This is because foreign banks have become increasingly reluctant to trade with their Russian counterparts to avoid scrutiny from Western regulatory authorities. Cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin, have emerged as a viable alternative for Russia and its domestic companies to conduct international trade without relying on the US Dollar or the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)-based payment systems. Russia introduced legislation to permit the use of cryptocurrencies in foreign trade. It also legalized Bitcoin mining and has established itself as a global leader in mining. Siluanov stated, “As part of the experimental regime, it is possible to use bitcoins, which we had mined here in Russia (in foreign trade transactions). The finance minister also noted that several Russian companies have made cross-border transactions using Bitcoin, and the country intends to expand and develop digital payments. ""Such transactions are already occurring. We believe they should be expanded and developed further. I am confident this will happen next year.” Dollar On Shaky Ground? Earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the current US administration had severely undermined the US Dollar’s role as a reserve currency, claiming the currency is being used for political purposes. This, according to Putin, has prompted many currencies to look for alternatives to the Dollar. Putin used Bitcoin as an example, adding that no country in the world had the ability to influence or regulate it. The president’s comments indicated that Russia favors the extensive use of cryptocurrencies for cross-border payments. Russia Contemplating Strategic Reserve Russia could also join several nations in creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. According to several media reports, Anton Tkachev, a State Duma deputy from the New People party, has proposed establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. The proposal highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against Western sanctions, a financial stabilizer, and an investment vehicle. “With limited access to traditional international payment systems for countries under sanctions, cryptocurrencies are becoming virtually the only tool for international trade. The Central Bank of Russia is already preparing to launch an experiment on cross-border payments in cryptocurrency.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to market analyst Javon Marks, SHIB’s strong rebound positions it to continue its upward trajectory, potentially reaching $0.000081. Shiba Inu Rebounds After Significant Drop Following a market-wide correction, Shiba Inu lost over 20% in value last week, touching a low of $0.00001853—a level last seen in early November. Despite this downturn, the cryptocurrency quickly regained momentum. SHIB has since rebounded and is currently trading at $0.00002271. This recovery has reinforced bullish sentiment among analysts, with Marks identifying the recent price action as a key indicator of further potential growth. Bullish Signals Emerge In a Christmas Day tweet, Marks pointed out that Shiba Inu’s latest rebound has triggered a bullish signal that could drive further price gains. “Shiba Inu’s path close to its all-time high of $0.00008854 remains on course,” Marks stated. He predicts the cryptocurrency will experience a 234% surge to $0.000081, equivalent to a 3.33x price increase from current levels. $SHIB (Shiba Inu) adds bullish signals and the road to $0.000081 is looking like it will continue!

This pattern is often regarded as a strong indicator of potential upward momentum in technical analysis. While Marks did not specify an exact timeline for SHIB to reach $0.000081, his remark that the price target is “in the cards” suggests that the rally could occur sooner rather than later. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Historical Context and Broader Predictions Marks’ latest forecast aligns with his previous bullish outlooks on Shiba Inu. In October, he suggested that SHIB was poised to rise to $0.000081 , a prediction made when the token was trading at $0.0000178. Investors who purchased at that level have already seen a portfolio gain of over 30% at current prices. Other analysts have echoed Marks’ optimism regarding SHIB’s price trajectory. For instance, SHIB KNIGHT, a prominent figure within the community, maintains that the token is ready to surpass $0.00008618 and potentially achieve even higher milestones. Similarly, technical analyst Charting Guy highlighted a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern, signaling a potential retest of SHIB’s all-time high of $0.00008854. Outlook for Shiba Inu (SHIB) While Shiba Inu remains over 250% below its target price of $0.000081, analysts are optimistic about its potential to bridge the gap. The cryptocurrency’s ability to rebound sharply from recent lows and sustain positive momentum supports the argument for continued growth. As the second-largest meme coin, Shiba Inu’s performance remains closely watched by the crypto community. With a growing base of supporters and strong technical signals, SHIB may indeed be on the path to significant price milestones in the near future.

As tech giants race to capitalize on markets leveraging this newly emerged technology, AI has also become a hot topic for investors. Listed below is a brief overview of the top 4 AI stocks investors may want to buy amid the recent global frenzy because of this technology, with market experts believing that some of these stocks may even surpass Apple (AAPL) by next year. Top 4 AI Stocks That May Surpass Apple By 2025. Notably, amid the rising global adoption of AI, firms related to the technology have seen a phenomenal rise in market value. Namely, tech giants such as Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta Platforms are some of the pioneers that have capitalized on this emerging technology. Intriguingly, with the broader industry eyeing further widespread adoption ahead, these top AI stocks remain poised to potentially outperform that of the leading tech giant Apple. Let’s delve deeper into the nitty gritty, indicating that Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta Platforms stocks may outperform that of Apple by 2025. Nvidia (NVDA) The GPU manufacturing giant Nvidia has recently stolen the spotlight across the AI sector with its attention-nabbing advancements. Particularly, as CoinGape earlier reported the AI chip manufacturing giant had already surpassed Apple with a market valuation of over $3 trillion, and market sentiments orbiting the firm’s outlook remain bullish globally. The NVDA stock price as of press time rested at $137.822, up nearly 186% YTD. The stock’s phenomenal rise alongside growing AI adoption has underscored the immense potential for further gains. Also, it’s noteworthy that Nvidia’s latest AI chip, the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which was introduced at the 2024 GTC AI conference, has further cemented the firm’s standing in the sector. Alphabet (GOOG) Google’s parent company, Alphabet’s stock, is another prominent mark on investors’ radars. As the leading search engine giant continues to incorporate new AI-related features for its users across the globe, it remains one of the top AI stock closely eyed by investors. Also, Google’s Gemini, another marvel showcasing the firm’s generative AI capabilities, recently saw the launch of its version 2.0. This saga has further garnered significant attention toward the Alphabet AI stock, underscoring the potential for further gains amid industry advancements. GOOG stock price traded at $197.50 at the time of reporting, up nearly 41% YTD. Market watchers continue to eagerly monitor the stock, anticipating further gains with the widespread adoption of the newly emerged tech. Microsoft (MSFT) A name closely associated with OpenAI, Microsoft is another AI stock for investors to buy as the global race for the tech heats up. The company gained substantial popularity following its major backing of Sam Altman’s OpenAI. Moreover, the firm was reportedly seen acquiring nearly half a million Nvidia AI chips this year in an effort to build artificial intelligence systems. Overall, the AI firm has marked a monumental stride, fueling optimism over its stock’s future potential. At the time of reporting, MSFT stock price traded at $437.69, up 18% YTD. The company showcases the potential for further growth in light of rising AI adoption. Meta Platforms (META) Meanwhile, another prominent name in the sector, Meta Platforms, has emerged on investors’ radars. The company primarily focuses on fostering AI-related services, boasting a 500 million monthly active user base as of the third quarter of this year. With its widespread reach and the broader industry’s rising popularity, investors remain optimistic about META’s stock performance ahead. As of press time, META price rested at $603.28, up 74% YTD. The AI stock is another investment opportunity for investors to make more gains than gains made via AAPL. Bottom Line Also, it’s worth mentioning that the abovementioned American companies remain poised to benefit the Trump presidency. With Donald Trump appointing David Sacks as the Crypto and AI strategist, hopes are further building for the broader industry’s future. In other words, with the ever-evolving tech space, it appears that these top AI stocks are poised to witness robust growth ahead. Considering the developments in the market, it appears that these firms will dominate the AI as well as the technology space ahead.

Ethereum ( ETH ) token fell to $3,340, down by over 5.6% from its highest level this week. This retreat happened as a sea of red spread in the crypto industry, with the market cap of all coins falling to $3.29 million. Ethereum crashed in a low-volume environment as most traders remained away from the market during the Christmas holiday. CoinGecko data shows that the 24-hour volume was $17.5 billion, down from $24 billion a day earlier. It had its lowest volume in over a month. Ethereum’s futures open interest also continued falling, reaching a low of $26 billion, down from this month’s high of $28 billion. Falling open interest is a sign of falling demand among futures traders.

This important number looks at whether a crypto asset is overvalued or undervalued. An MVRVA figure of less than 3.8 indicates that an asset is relatively undervalued. Ethereum MVRV indicator | Source: IntoTheBlock Ethereum price analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the ETH price formed a small double-top pattern at $4,095 and then made a strong bearish breakout. It then rebounded and retested the pattern’s neckline at $3,500, its lowest swing on December 3. ETH formed a small doji candlestick pattern on Christmas day. A doji is made up of a small body and long and upper shadows and is usually a bearish sign. Ethereum has also formed a bearish flag chart pattern. Therefore, the coin will likely have a bearish breakout and reach the psychological point at $3,000, down by 10% below the current level.

Bitcoin (BTC), which is the pioneer of the crypto market, has recently surpassed the $100,000 mark, reaching a new all-time high of $108,364 before experiencing a pullback. The initial surge is largely attributed to the election of President-elect Donald Trump, whose eagerly-anticipated pro-crypto-friendly policies have invigorated the market. With this bullish momentum, investors are keen on identifying promising altcoins, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), and presales that offer high returns in the coming year. In this guide, we are going to list and review the top nine ICOs, presales, and altcoins to buy for 2025.

Best Wallet Token - The Ultimate 2025 Crypto Wallet One of the best presales to invest in for 2025 is Best Wallet Token , a new cryptocurrency that has a lot of value and benefits inside its ecosystem, the Best Wallet platform. $BEST is the crypto wallet's native coin, which provides reduced transaction costs and early access to partner crypto projects. Essentially, the Best Wallet Token is a utility token designed to enhance the functionalities of the cryptocurrency wallet. By integrating this token, users can enjoy rewards, seamless transactions, and access to exclusive features within the wallet ecosystem. The project aims to create a more user-friendly and rewarding experience for crypto enthusiasts. Best Wallet has already garnered a lot of social media followers and boasts of 50% month-on-month user growth. According to some crypto analysts, this ultimate crypto wallet is on track to capture 40% of the $11bn noncustodial wallet market by 2026, making the $BEST token a key crypto asset to watch in the coming years. Furthermore, $BEST holders will enjoy higher staking rewards, powered by Best Wallet's crypto staking aggregator, which supports more than 60 blockchains. So far, Best Wallet has raised over $5.7 million since its presale launch and $BEST is currently priced at $0.02335 per token.

Visit Best Wallet Token Ripple XRP - Fourth Largest Cryptocurrency By Market Cap Another altcoin to invest in for 2025 is Ripple (XRP), one of the most established cryptocurrencies designed to facilitate cross-border payments. Its real-time gross settlement system allows for instant, low-cost international transactions, making it a favorite crypto among global financial institutions. And, with its growing institutional adoption and real-world utility, XRP is positioned as a top contender in the crypto market. Moreover, recently, XRP has experienced a significant price surge, trading around $2.24, gaining around 290% in the past three months. This increase is fueled by speculation about the approval of an XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This possibility could attract more institutional investors and drive wider adoption, similar to how the Bitcoin ETFs boosted BTC. As a result, XRP has seen a 59% increase in the last month and a 270% year-to-date increase, making it one of the best altcoins to invest in for 2025. Additionally, Ripple's recent regulatory approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the launch of its RLUSD stablecoin has further strengthened its position in the market, signaling trust and expansion potential. Looking ahead, the potential approval of XRP ETFs and growing institutional interest could make XRP one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025. This is because, unlike many speculative coins, XRP offers real-world utility and has established itself as a key player in digital finance. As the crypto industry prepares for a potential bull run in 2025, XRP is certainly well-positioned to generate significant profits. Wall Street Pepe - Frog-Themed Meme Coin Aiming For Total Crypto Domination Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is a promising new meme token that combines the iconic popularity of Pepe with the thrill of Wall Street trading. This unique project is building a ""Wepe Army"" for high-risk, high-reward trading enthusiasts.

One standout feature of Wall Street Pepe is its staking rewards. According to the project's whitepaper, 12% of the total $WEPE supply is reserved for staking rewards, distributed over three years. Currently, presale participants will enjoy over 30% APY rewards. What’s more, the $WEPE presale offers early buyers a chance to purchase the token before it gets listed on major crypto exchanges, and this project has already gained significant traction, raising over $15 million within the first 10 days of its presale and surpassing the $36 million mark in less than a month.

As the backbone of the blockchain ecosystem, Ethereum continues to drive innovation and adoption in key areas like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the DeFi platform. The transition to Ethereum 2.0, which introduced a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, has also significantly improved the network's scalability, energy efficiency, and transaction speed. These upgrades have strengthened Ethereum’s position as the go-to platform for developers and businesses building on blockchain technology. With the recent uptrend in the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum has also gained momentum, rising by nearly 40%. Since its inception, Ethereum has proven its resilience and has continued to attract both institutional and retail investors. The platform's large developer community also ensures ongoing improvements and innovations, thereby maintaining Ethereum's competitive edge in the blockchain space.

With a total supply of 9 billion tokens, Catslap is building a strong online presence through active community participation and events.

In 2025, the cryptocurrency market is expected to continue its evolution with a focus on scalability, regulatory clarity, and broader adoption. Perhaps more than anything else, all eyes will be on how the Trump administration can impact the crypto landscape. If Trump fulfills his promises, we might see Bitcoin and other cryptos continue the positive momentum. Otherwise, we might see a crypto crash in 2025. More than that, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) may likely become more common, with countries like China and the EU exploring digital versions of their national currencies. Also, regulations around cryptocurrency are likely to become more defined, thereby potentially offering institutional investors more confidence in the market. Lastly, the ongoing development of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and blockchain interoperability will continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the crypto space. Additionally, as more industries adopt blockchain technology, the market could see more widespread use cases, further legitimizing the space. In short, 2025 is going to be an exciting year for crypto investors. Final Word - What’s the Best Crypto to Invest In for the New Year? In sum, while there are numerous exciting projects in the crypto space, the best investments for 2025 will solely depend on an individual’s risk tolerance and investment goals. Having said that, Ethereum, Ripple, and Chainlink remain strong long-term investment choices thanks to their established market positions and innovative use cases. Meanwhile, emerging projects like Best Wallet Token, Catslap, Crypto All Stars, Solaxy, and Flockerz offer exciting potential for high returns, especially as the market matures. Ultimately, staying informed about market trends, technological advancements, and regulatory developments will be key to making smart investments in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.

Catzilla: The meme coin for crypto warriors In a market where financial freedom feels like a distant dream, Catzilla has arrived to smash barriers and rewrite the script.

Infinite potential Catzilla’s presale is an epic saga of opportunity, offering 14 action-packed stages where investors can secure the CATZILLA token before it hits the public market. Starting at just $0.0002 and set to climb to $0.0016, this presale promises a colossal 700% ROI for those bold enough to seize the moment. Each stage brings new challenges and greater rewards, and as the clock ticks, only the swift and strategic will reap the ultimate gains. You might also like: Millionaire investor behind PNUT’s success bets big on Catzilla for 1500x gains in 2025 Cats take over the meme coin kingdom For years, the crypto world has barked up the wrong tree, but now it’s the age of feline dominance. MEW and Popcat have already proven that cats mean business, with MEW achieving a 103.7% climb in three months and Popcat delivering a jaw-dropping 157.44% surge. But these gains pale in comparison to what Catzilla promises. This isn’t just a coin — it’s a revolution. Forget the dog pack; cats are here to rule. Catzilla: The future of meme coins While Shiba Inu (SHIB) expands its utility and PEPE rides on meme nostalgia, Catzilla roars ahead with innovation, community rewards, and financial empowerment. Its presale offers unmatched opportunities, starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016, alongside governance, staking, and massive ROI potential. Uniting crypto enthusiasts, anime fans, and meme culture, Catzilla is poised to lead the next generation of meme coins. The days of passive investing are over — Catzilla invites interested investors to join the fight for financial freedom and take their place at the top of the crypto food chain. Shiba Inu: An Ethereum-based meme coin with expanding utility Shiba Inu is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Created in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, it began with a supply of 1 quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, reducing the circulating tokens. SHIB’s foundation on Ethereum allows it to integrate with decentralized applications like ShibaSwap, its own exchange. Future plans include a non-fungible token (NFT) platform and a governance system through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). In the current market cycle, SHIB’s expanding ecosystem and technological developments have increased its visibility in the crypto space. PEPE: A deflationary meme coin inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum, paying tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie. It seeks to capitalize on the popularity of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and transparency about its lack of utility, PEPE embraces its identity as a pure memecoin. In April and May 2023, PEPE’s market cap soared to $1.6 billion, creating significant wealth for early holders and building a strong community. The roadmap includes listings on major exchanges and a “meme takeover.” PEPE’s potential hinges on market interest in memecoins, and its attractiveness in the current market cycle depends on investor sentiment toward high-risk, high-reward assets. Conclusion Catzilla is taking the spotlight in the meme coin market, outshining SHIB and PEPE, which have less short-term potential. Offering a 700% ROI during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and rising to $0.0016, Catzilla combines governance, rewards, and staking. It invites crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers to join forces for financial freedom by acquiring CATZILLA tokens.

As a new administration prepares to take office, President-elect Donald Trump has nominated cryptocurrency-friendly former regulator Paul Atkins to lead the SEC, signaling a shift in the agency’s priorities. In early December, Trump announced Atkins’ candidacy via a post on Truth Social, praising her understanding of crypto and innovation as key to “Making America Greater Than Ever.” Atkins, who served as SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush from 2002 to 2008, brings experience from her role on the board of advisors to The Digital Chamber, which she joined in 2020. “Atkins really understands crypto,” Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA) executive director Alison Mangiero said in an interview. “We’re going to see an SEC that clearly has different priorities than Gensler’s SEC,” she said, noting the potential for a sharp departure from Gensler’s approach. Gensler and Democratic Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga announced their resignations in late November, leaving three Republican commissioners (Mark Uyeda, Hester Peirce and soon-to-be Atkins) at the helm of the SEC. However, the agency’s makeup will change again as the Biden administration will be required by legal requirements to nominate a commissioner from a different political party.

Here is a Compilation of Predictions Teresa Goody Guillén, a partner at BakerHostetler and former SEC litigation counsel, explained that the new appointee could be from any non-Republican party, such as a Democrat, Libertarian or independent. “While Atkins’ confirmation is expected to expedite the nomination process for the next commissioner, this appointment will likely compete with other prioritized presidential appointments,” Guillén said. Gensler, whose resignation takes effect the day Trump is inaugurated, has faced criticism from the crypto industry for his aggressive enforcement approach. During his tenure, he has argued that most cryptocurrencies qualify as securities and has urged crypto firms to register with the SEC. But many industry leaders have argued that the current regulatory framework is ill-suited to digital assets. Mangiero predicts that under Atkins’ leadership, the SEC could explore new avenues, such as integrating staking into crypto ETFs and other financial products. “There are a lot of little things that the SEC could address in its first few months to send a positive signal,” he said. If confirmed, Atkins’ SEC is expected to impose fewer sanctions on crypto firms. “We’re likely to see fewer non-fraud cases where there’s no investor loss,” Guillén said. He also predicts a decline in new lawsuits aimed at setting regulatory precedents. *This is not investment advice.

Over the last few years, Shiba Inu has grown with projects like Shibarium, Shiba Eternity, and Shiboshi Rush, showcasing its rapid evolution from a meme coin to a broader ecosystem. ‘Welcome to SHIB: The Metaverse’ Shiba Inu recently announced the launch of a virtual world called “SHIB: The Metaverse.” LUCIE (Shibarium’s marketing lead) described the project as “groundbreaking.” Powered by the layer-2 scaling solution, “SHIB: The Metaverse” represents a platform for “creativity, connection, and ownership.” LUCIE further explained that the project allows users to own, trade, and develop virtual real estate recorded on the blockchain. People are also enabled to create personalized avatars, build their own vision, and connect globally with other members of the SHIB community. For their part, Seizan_Shib posted a short video on X, showing what the project looks like. The X user said “SHIB: The Metaverse” is already live but warned that it is still in beta version . One individual who reacted was Shiba Inu’s lead developer – Shytoshi Kusama. They retweeted the post, simply saying , “Beautiful.” Previous SHIB-Related Projects In the past few years, Shiba Inu has significantly expanded beyond being just a meme coin. The self-proclaimed Dogecoin-killer has evolved into a broader ecosystem with several notable developments. One evident example is its L2 blockchain solution – Shibarium. It officially saw the light of day last summer and is specifically designed to reduce transaction fees, improve speed, and enhance scalability. Earlier this week, Shibarium blasted through another major milestone. As CryptoPotato reported , the total transactions processed on the network exceeded 700 million. Shiba Inu has also entered the gaming sector. In October, the team introduced Shiboshi Rush, which enables players to deploy their troops at certain locations and “utilize the multiplier gates” to grow their armies. Prior to that, the developers launched Shiba Eternity, which is perhaps the most popular game within the ecosystem. It allows players to trade, collect, and battle with cards that feature numerous characters, items, and themes inspired by the meme coin. In August, LUCIE disclosed that the game’s “closed beta “ is live. They stated that Shiba Eternity isn’t “just the same old game with minor tweaks “ but a complete transition to Web3, featuring significant upgrades. These include a redesigned ranking system, exclusive tournaments for advanced players, an improved and user-friendly interface, and more generous rewards.

Despite the recent downturn, many analysts remain optimistic about ONDO’s potential for recovery, citing its strong performance earlier this cycle as evidence of its resilience. As one of the top-performing altcoins, ONDO has consistently attracted investor attention, leading to speculation about its next move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Forming A Symmetrical Triangle – Can BTC Reclaim $100K? However, caution is warranted. Renowned analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis warning that ONDO may be at risk of further correction. Martinez highlights the potential formation of a head-and-shoulders pattern on the price chart, a bearish signal often associated with trend reversals. If this pattern plays out, it could lead to increased selling pressure and a deeper pullback. The coming days will be critical for Ondo Finance as it navigates this pivotal moment. Investors will closely watch whether the token can defy bearish signals and reignite bullish momentum or if the feared pattern will confirm, leading to additional declines. For now, ONDO’s future hangs in the balance, with market sentiment and technical indicators offering conflicting signals about its short-term trajectory. ONDO Testing Crucial Demand Ondo Finance has faced a significant correction after its strong rally earlier in the cycle, now testing crucial demand levels at key price points. The token’s price halted at its previous all-time high, around $1.50, which now serves as a pivotal support level. If It holds above this mark, bullish momentum could return, potentially setting the stage for a renewed uptrend. However, top analyst Ali Martinez has raised concerns with a technical analysis that suggests ONDO may be forming a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. This pattern, if confirmed, typically signals a trend reversal and could lead to increased selling pressure. Martinez warns that a decisive close below the $1.48 level could trigger a steep 30% correction, driving ONDO’s price down to approximately $1.05. Such a move would represent a significant setback for the token and its investors.

Until then, the market remains at a critical juncture, with traders closely monitoring price action for clues about ONDO’s next direction. The coming days will be decisive in determining whether ONDO can recover or faces further downside risk. Technical Analysis: What To Expect Ondo Finance (ONDO) is currently trading at $1.49 after successfully testing the critical $1.46 support level highlighted by top analyst Ali Martinez. This level has proven to be a significant line of defense for ONDO, reflecting strong buying interest at this price. The token appears stable for now, but market participants remain cautious, as broader market conditions could still impact ONDO’s trajectory. The recent resilience at $1.46 is encouraging, suggesting that ONDO may be building a foundation for a potential recovery. However, a market-wide retrace could put additional pressure on ONDO, possibly driving its price lower and retesting critical demand levels. Investors are keeping a close eye on key technical levels for confirmation of a bullish rebound.

A decisive move above this mark would signal renewed strength, paving the way for a bullish recovery and potentially retesting previous highs. Until then, ONDO remains in a delicate position, with traders monitoring broader market sentiment and the asset’s ability to sustain current support levels. The next steps will be crucial in determining whether ONDO can resume its uptrend or face continued consolidation.

This adds to the $6 billion chunk xAI raised in May, making the total cash raised $12 billion. During the week, xAI revealed that Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Blackrock, Fidelity, Nvidia, AMD, Lightspeed, Morgan Stanley, Valor Equity Partners Sequoia Capital, and Vy Capital took part in the investment round. Other heavy players from the GCC region joined the investment round as well. These include Kingdom Holdings, MGX, Oman Investment Authority (OIA), and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA). According to a public disclosure , Kingdom Holdings—the Saudi conglomerate holding company—invested around $400 million in the round. The disclosure also stated that xAI is now valued at $45 billion, almost twice its former valuation. In the announcement, xAI wrote, “ The funds from this financing round will be used to further accelerate our advanced infrastructure xAI is primarily focused on the development of advanced AI systems that are truthful, competent, and maximally beneficial for all of humanity.” Investors said that xAI has told them it wants to raise more money next year. xAI to be trained on data from Tesla and SpaceX xAI plans to train its models using data from Musk’s companies, including Tesla and SpaceX. The models could help those companies improve their tech. Currently, xAI manages SpaceX’s Starlink customer service. The AI startup is also negotiating with Tesla to undertake R&D for a percentage of its revenues. Tesla stockholders dislike these proposals. Musk has been sued for taking expertise and resources from Tesla to build xAI, which is considered a competitor startup. xAI’s partnerships and products have helped it make $100 million annually. OpenAI hopes to make $4 billion by 2024, while Anthropic expects $1 billion this year. Musk said this summer that xAI is training the next generation of Grok models at its data center in Memphis. The center was built in 122 days and is partly powered by portable diesel engines at the moment . Next year, xAI wants to improve the server farm, which has 100k Nvidia GPUs and double that number. GeForce GPUs are the best chips for training and running models because they can do many tasks at once . In November, Memphis’ regional electricity authority allowed xAI to add 150MW, enough to power 100,000 houses. To win agency clearance, xAI promised to improve the city’s drinking water and give Memphis cheaper Tesla batteries. However, other residents opposed the idea, arguing it would strain the grid and worsen air quality. In its first year, xAI had 12 employees. Today, Musk’s AI venture has 100 employees.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPCYB.

Specifically, over 33,000 BTC valued at more than $3.23 billion has been transferred to cryptocurrency exchanges in the past week, according to data from prominent on-chain analyst Ali Martinez on December 27. Bitcoin exchange reserves chart. Source: CryptoQuant/Ali_charts A breakdown of the data shows a sharp uptick in Bitcoin exchange reserves, rising from 2.395 million BTC on December 18 to 2.428 million BTC by December 25. This movement coincided with a decline in Bitcoin’s price, which dropped from $105,000 to $98,400 over the same period. Notably, the rapid increase in exchange reserves could indicate that large holders, or whales, are preparing to liquidate their assets. Historically, such trends have been precursors to significant price corrections, as selling pressure outweighs buying demand. Bitcoin’s bearish outlook In a series of X posts, Martinez doubled down on the possibility of Bitcoin dipping further, noting the asset might plunge to as low as $60,000. He highlighted that the possibility of a drop is validated by Bitcoin breaking below its critical support zone at $97,300. According to data shared by Martinez, this level served as a stronghold for Bitcoin, with 1.51 million wallets purchasing approximately 1.49 million BTC in this range. Bitcoin In/Out of the money around price chart. Source: IntoTheBlock For the bearish scenario to be invalidated, the expert noted that Bitcoin must reclaim the $97,300 level and, more importantly, achieve a close above $100,000. A sustained breakout above this level could pave the way for a significant rally, potentially targeting $168,500. Similarly, financial educator Tony Vays warned that Bitcoin trading below $95,000 is “very bad” as it accelerates the probability of a correction to around the $73,000 zone. According to the analyst, dropping below $95,000 opens the door for the asset to slide to the $92,000 range, which “opens Pandora’s box” for a massive crash.

Notably, analysts believe the asset will likely hit new highs, aligning with post-election optimism that helped Bitcoin reach a record high of approximately $108,000. Looking ahead to the new year, there is anticipation that Donald Trump’s policies could propel Bitcoin to new heights, potentially doubling its value. For instance, banking giant Standard Chartered predicts Bitcoin could trade at a new high of $200,000 in 2025, driven mainly by institutional interest. Author and investor Robert Kiyosaki shares a similar bullish sentiment , seeing a $350,000 target as plausible, while prominent Wall Street analyst Tom Lee projects a $250,000 valuation for the leading cryptocurrency .

But is this a serious forecast or just another attempt to stir excitement in the crypto world? The Bold Prediction: Bitcoin to Reach $180K by March 21, 2025 In an interview with Scott Melker, Mike Alfred, a well-known figure in the crypto space and a former CEO, is making waves with his recent prediction that Bitcoin will hit $180,000 by mid-March 2025. According to Alfred, the first quarter of 2025 will be crucial for the cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin potentially making gains as we approach the Bitcoin halving event. “I think Q1 should be quite good,” Alfred said. “The next two to three months are key to this four-year cycle.” What’s Driving the Optimism? Alfred points to a number of factors driving the bullish sentiment for Bitcoin, including the upcoming Bitcoin halving and institutional investment. “This is the year before the big year,” Alfred explained, suggesting that 2025 will be the year when the full potential of the current cycle plays out. He believes that the first few months of 2025 will see explosive price increases, with Bitcoin potentially reaching $120,000 to $150,000 before March. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin and Crypto in 2025 Looking ahead to 2025, both Alfred and Melker agree that the upcoming year will be pivotal for Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. While Alfred’s prediction of Bitcoin reaching $180,000 by March is aggressive, the current market conditions and upcoming halving event make it seem more plausible than ever. As 2025 approaches, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s performance in the first quarter. Will the crypto market rally as expected, or will we see another disappointing dip?

Bitcoin and meme coin divide runs deep Bitcoin vs meme coins, most popular narrative of 2024 Meme coins captured the attention of most crypto traders and emerged as a popular narrative this year. A CoinGecko report updated on Monday notes that the meme coin narrative captured a combined 30.67% of global investor interest. Meme trends and meme tokens rank among leading crypto narratives | Source: CoinGecko The report highlights that almost a third of crypto narrative interest this year was focused on speculative gains from meme coins. Traders placed a lower emphasis on fundamentals and turned their attention and capital towards dog and cat-related meme coins, pop culture references and internet personality-themed meme tokens. Meme coins have enjoyed a 6% year-on-year increase in interest from crypto market participants. While Bitcoin garnered institutional attention and capital allocation following the approval of Spot BTC ETFs in the US, four meme coin-based trends ranked among the top 20 narratives in crypto. Solana ( SOL ), Base, Artificial intelligence and cat-themed meme coins garnered between 14% and 8% of interest among crypto narratives. With meme coins cementing their place as a trending token category and trending this cycle, catalysts like institutional allocation and ETF approval could pave the way for further gains for holders.

Similarly, Solana and Base-based meme coins have secured a rank in the top 20 cryptocurrency narratives of the year, dominating the popularity of blue-chip meme coins. Dogecoin, SHIB and PEPE are typically considered blue-chip memes, with a market capitalization between $7 and $46 billion, as seen on CoinGecko. The top 3 tokens in the meme coin category observed a spike in active addresses and activity from traders within the first two weeks of December. Meme coins within top 100 | Source: CoinGecko In the last seven days, the top 3 tokens have erased double-digit value, according to CoinGecko data. Several other meme tokens have accumulated double-digit losses, barring Pudgy Penguins (PENGU). Institutional meme coin holdings tripled this year The wave of meme coin adoption drove institutions to tripe their holdings in the category. From February to March 2024, institutional investors’ spot holdings of memecoins climbed from $62.5 million to $204.8 million. This marks a 226% surge, a significant spike in interest in the memecoin market, according to Bybit’s report on institutional investment in meme coins. In the Bybit report, Eugene Cheung, Head of Institutions of Bybit, is quoted as saying: “Our report ‘Beyond the Hype’ shows that institutional and retail investors are actively leveraging the opportunities presented by the memecoin market. The strategic agility of institutions and the dynamic management by retail investors reflect a sophisticated engagement with these assets. We invite everyone to delve into the full report to understand these important dynamics better.” Dogecoin ETF likely in 2025? Rising institutional adoption has raised questions about the likelihood of approval from the U.S. financial regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission, for meme coin ETFs. Nate Geraci, President of ETFStore expressed shock that an issuer has yet to file for a Dogecoin ETF, both in and outside of the U.S. Geraci believes the only possible downside of such a filing would be that it would mark a futile attempt and end up as a marketing expense for an issuer. The President of the ETFStore commented on the “DOGE” ticker since it is the ticker for the largest meme coin and would likely hold the highest relevance and demand among issuers in the future, Shocked an ETF issuer hasn't filed for Dogecoin ETF yet… What's the downside? Worst case, it's a marketing expense. Wonder which issuer is sitting on the ""DOGE"" ticker. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 23, 2024 As the SEC greenlights the Bitcoin-Ethereum hybrid ETF, DOGE traders have hopes for a Dogecoin ETF approval in 2025.

However, a potential utility could develop in the future.” Lienkha comments on what divides Dogecoin and similar meme coins from Bitcoin. While Bitcoin has gained acceptance as “digital gold” and hedge against the devaluation of a fiat currency, Dogecoin and the like are considered speculative tokens. The Bitcoin and meme coin divide runs deep and could influence the approval of a meme coin ETF, further investment from institutional investors and retail participation in the category in the second leg of the bull market. Typically, a drawdown in Bitcoin ushers a steeper and market-wide correction, wiping recent gains from meme coins and hitting the market capitalization of the category negatively. The correlation with Bitcoin could continue to drag down meme coins, and in every instance, the largest crypto crashes or reacts to a market-moving event during this cycle.

The firm noted that Bitcoin’s Realized Capitalization has reached the same resistance levels previously observed in 2019 and March 2024. In his statement, Alphractal highlighted the Long-Term Realized Capital Impulse (LTRCI), a metric designed to analyze movements in capitalization over long periods. This approach provides valuable information on supply and demand dynamics, providing a more comprehensive perspective on market trends. By focusing on longer time frames, LTRCI aims to uncover patterns that may not be noticed in short-term analysis and shed light on the impact of significant capital flows on price movements. Related News: Following Gensler's Resignation and the Trump Administration, the SEC's Cryptocurrency Stance is Projected to Change: What's the Status of the Crypto Lawsuits? “Long-Term Realized Capital Impulse offers an innovative approach to analyze demand from an on-chain perspective,” the company said. Alphractal also took a look at Realized Capital Impulse, which focuses on shorter-term swings in the market. According to the firm, this metric suggests that market enthusiasm has not yet fully materialized. This could indicate that Bitcoin has experienced significant movements over the past year or that there is still potential for growth. The firm added a cautionary note: “A decrease in this metric could negatively impact the price, while an increase indicates a more positive and volatile market outlook.” *This is not investment advice.

On Thursday, whale data indicated that roughly $200 million worth of the crypto was moved between unknown wallets. As a result, market watchers are extensively eyeing the coin for future price action shifts in light of the whale transaction and additional on-chain dynamics, indicating that an ATH by next year is possible. XRP News: 90M of Ripple’s Coin Transferred Sparking Speculations As per the latest data by Whale Alert , 90 million XRP was moved by the unknown address rJBRiw.. to rDzNXR, emerging as noteworthy news for the broader community. Per the data, this transaction marked the transfer of $195.16 million worth of crypto, garnering significant attention. This latest XRP news has fueled widespread speculations in the market. However, many see the latest move as transfers between exchanges. Notably, the transaction comes amid a highly volatile crypto market, with investors apprehensive over asset prices, sparking significant discussions among market participants. Despite that, other on-chain statistics have indicated that Ripple’s coin could scale higher levels ahead despite recent volatility. A recent CoinGape report revealed that XRP price could attain a new ATH by 2025, primarily attributable to a plethora of bullish factors. Particularly with increased whale accumulations, rising market optimism with the anticipation of an XRP ETF launch, and the speculation of Ripple vs. SEC case end, the coin reflects a bullish outlook about its long-term prospects. Intriguingly, the appointment of Paul Atkins as the new SEC Chair under Trump’s presidency has substantially uplifted market sentiment for the asset. Atkins could potentially dismiss the XRP lawsuit , aligning with the 47th US president’s pro-crypto reign. Overall, the 90M coin transfer amid the abovementioned optimistic maneuvers has emerged as buzzworthy XRP news, gaining significant traction globally. XRP Price Eyes Gains Ahead? In light of the latest XRP news, Ripple’s coin eyes phenomenal gains in 2025. However, XRP price today slipped nearly 4%, aligning with the recent turbulent market. Its intraday low and high were $2.16 and $2.31, respectively. Nevertheless, a recent XRP price analysis by CoinGape revealed that the coin eyes a $4 price target as Binance recorded ATH Ripple transactions. This bullish projection further aligns with the abovementioned XRP news, reflecting an optimistic outlook for the crypto in 2025. Besides, it’s also worth mentioning that the American blockchain payments giant’s 1 billion XRP escrow unlock looms to take place on January 1. Market watchers are monitoring the token as this unlock could potentially impact the price amid recent market trends.

The bills differ from the proposal of the American National Bitcoin Reserve and demonstrate local specifics. America is bullish on Bitcoin. Allegedly , each fifth American owns some BTC. While the U.S. President is pushing to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, the states are working on local reserves. The Ohio and Texas proposals to create such reserves are about to pass; Pennsylvania is following their way, while other states are doing their considerations. Table of Contents What are the specs of the local proposals compared to the federal bill? The Cynthia Lummis bill The local bills Will these bills pass? What are the specs of the local proposals compared to the federal bill? The main distinction is that the local proposals have different end goals if compared to the federal-level proposal. The federal bill is aimed to cover the national debt and calls for purchasing one million BTC that should be stored in the U.S. Treasury. The Texas bill is aimed at accumulating bitcoins by collecting taxes and donations in cryptocurrency. More than that, Texas has a minimum five-year embargo on selling state bitcoins. Ohio and Pennsylvania are willing to accumulate some BTC as a hedge against the eroding USD value. Bitcoins must be bought by the local treasuries. The bills don’t elaborate precisely on the terms. The Cynthia Lummis bill The Federal Reserve bill was introduced in July 2024 by Wyoming Sen. Cynthia Lummis. Her proposal is called Boosting Innovation, Technology and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act. The Lummis bill is expressly presented as a means to pay down the U.S. national debt. Apart from national debt, Lummis mentions soaring inflation rates in the introduction and calls the creation of the reserve a Louisiana Purchase moment. Comparing huge-scale Bitcoin purchases with buying American lands in the past became a popular trope among Bitcoin maximalists. According to the Lummis proposal, Bitcoin is seen as an additional store of value in the federal balance sheet. The bill suggests that the government must establish a U.S. Treasury-controlled decentralized network of Bitcoin vaults. On top of that, the government must purchase one million BTC, which is around 5% of the total supply. The amount is dictated by the fact that the U.S. is already holding 5% of all gold. Private Bitcoin holders should be given self-custody rights. The local bills The local bills of Texas and Ohio don’t include direct intentions to purchase a specified amount of BTC in a certain period, nor are they intended to eliminate the state debts. 🇺🇸 STRATEGIC #BITCOIN RESERVE IS NOW OFFICIALLY HAPPENING IN TEXAS. WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE 🤯 pic.twitter.com/Lub2sRyVzD — Vivek⚡️ (@Vivek4real_) December 12, 2024 The Texas bill was introduced by Texas State Representative Giovanni Capriglione on Dec. 12. The bill suggests that local residents will be able to use cryptocurrency to pay their taxes. On top of that, Texans will be able to donate cryptocurrency to the state. All the crypto is going to be exchanged for Bitcoin. Donations, taxes, and other payments to the state agencies will be the main avenues for Texas to accumulate bitcoins. The accumulated BTC are supposed to be stored offline untouched for at least five years. Just like Lummis, Capriglione mentioned inflation as one of the biggest enemies while speaking about the need for the Bitcoin reserve. Texas has been an attractive place for Bitcoin miners due to low electricity costs and various incentives. Read more: Crypto taxes: What does regulation look like around the world?

Provides state treasurer authority & flexibility to invest in #Bitcoin This legislation creates the framework for Ohio’s state government to harness the power of Bitcoin to strengthen our… pic.twitter.com/hSWas2qeQd — Derek Merrin (@DerekMerrin) December 17, 2024 On Dec. 17, the rep. Derek Merrin introduced the Ohio bill known as the Ohio Bitcoin Reserve Act. The act suggests that the Ohio treasury will set up the Bitcoin fund and will be able to invest money in Bitcoin. Bitcoin is seen as a hedge against USD devaluation. In contrast to the Lummis proposal, the bill has no mention of specific Bitcoin purchases or allocations. In 2022, Ohio had a $72.16 billion debt. It is possible that the BTC reserve could facilitate debt redemption. The bill will be worked upon further by legislators in 2025. Read more: Ohio introduces second Bitcoin reserve bill The Pennsylvania bill was introduced back in November. Its prime suggestion is that the state will be able to invest up to 10% of the State General Fund in Bitcoin in order to fight inflation. This means that nearly one billion dollars can be spent on bitcoins. Will these bills pass? The bills mentioned above were introduced. There is no guarantee that they will pass. On average , only 20% of the introduced state-level bills become laws. In Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, this number is even lower. According to the New Healthcare Bill Acts, only 4.5% of the bills introduced to the 115th Congress became law. So, statistically, the odds are not that high. Practically, it depends on multiple factors, not least of all the persistence of the lobbyists. Cohen believes that Lummis is a strong Bitcoin advocate with decent experience, and her bill has a good chance. However, the Lummis Act can fail in Congress. It receives some criticism even within the crypto community. For instance, a passionate crypto writer Nic Carter, warns that while the Bitcoin stockpile (as a store of seized bitcoins) can be beneficial, the strategic Bitcoin reserve (as a reserve of the bitcoins acquired by the government) will not bolster the dollar price (like it is supposed by the strategic Bitcoin reserve advocates) but will do the opposite. The reason is clear: giving Bitcoin a monetary role in the country that issues dollars is signalling the move away from an inconvertible fiat standard, i.e., questioning the dollar’s value, hence risking the role of the U.S. in the global economy. We can’t state, however, that Carter’s concerns are the current mainstream. Quite the opposite. If the strategic Bitcoin reserve is not created while the state-level reserves are successfully set, they may get a leading role in the exploration of the governmental accumulation and storage of Bitcoin and turn into international cryptocurrency hubs. If all the bills fail, new ones will follow.

All you gotta do is flex on social, stack tokens during the presale, and start building your DOGEN army with your referral link. For every recruit, you’ll be snatching a fat 20% of their Golden Points from token buys. So what are you waiting for? Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! PEPE: The Deflationary Memecoin Inspired by Pepe the Frog PEPE is a deflationary memecoin on the Ethereum network, inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s. Aiming to emulate the success of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, PEPE sets itself apart by eliminating transaction taxes and embracing its identity as a pure memecoin without utility. It reached a peak market cap of $1.6 billion in mid-2023, capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts. The project’s roadmap focuses on increasing visibility through social media trends and listings on major exchanges. PEPE incorporates a burning mechanism to enhance scarcity and rewards long-term holders, contributing to its stability. As an ERC-20 token, it benefits from Ethereum’s security. In the current market cycle, PEPE’s unique features may appeal to those interested in memecoins. Floki: A Meme Coin Evolving into a Utility-Focused Cryptocurrency Floki is a cryptocurrency that originated from Elon Musk’s 2021 tweet about naming his Shiba Inu puppy Floki. Though it started as a meme coin, Floki has expanded its ecosystem to include utility and charitable initiatives. The project has engaged in building schools in countries like Laos and Nigeria. Floki offers projects like the NFT metaverse game Valhalla and a decentralized finance service called FlokiFi. Its partnership with NOWPayments and introduction of the Floki Card enable real-world use of the token. Recognized by The Economic Times as a top meme coin to buy in 2023, Floki appears to have potential in the current market due to its growing ecosystem and practical applications. BONK: Solana’s Community-Driven Memecoin with Rapid Growth BONK is a memecoin on the Solana blockchain featuring a Shiba Inu mascot. It aims to empower the Solana community by moving power away from venture capital tokens. After getting listed on Coinbase, BONK surged over 100%. It acts as a community coin, having airdropped 50% of its supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi sectors. By mid-December 2023, BONK became the third-largest memecoin by market cap and saw a year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like a high total supply and the volatility of memecoins, BONK’s integration into the growing Solana ecosystem and its involvement with new decentralized apps, like BonkSwap, make it a notable coin. Its potential in the current market cycle seems significant. Conclusion As the 2024 bull run unfolds, coins like PEPE, FLOKI, and BONK show less short-term potential. DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow 700% by presale end with possible thousand-fold returns, DOGEN builds a community of leaders and offers real benefits, including exclusive perks for early adopters.

Both Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoins have dropped significantly in the past few weeks, but things could change as 2025 approaches. The long term crypto and stock investor who goes by Jelle believes the next year will be “great for altcoins.” On that note, he highlighted TradingView ’s Crypto Total Market Cap Index (TOTAL) entering “price discovery,” displaying high optimism on cryptocurrencies. At the same time, Jelle compared TOTAL’s performance with the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D), which “looks ready to move lower.” Indeed, the chart shows TOTAL retesting and old resistance as support at around $3.24 trillion. Meanwhile, BTC.D is seen failing to recover an uptrend, bouncing from the trend line’s resistance, making a lower high. Crypto Total Market Cap (TOTAL) & Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) weekly chart. Source: TradingView / Jelle Will altcoin holders ‘get super rich’ in 2025? Another analyst recently shared a similar insight on the Bitcoin Dominance, with a bullish sentiment regarding altcoins in 2025. The pseudonym account Mister Crypto sent a “warning” to “altcoin holders,” saying “we are about to get super rich.” Backing his optimism, Mister Crypto shared a two-week BTC.D chart also failing to retrieve an uptrend line. Interestingly, the analyst projects the Bitcoin Dominance to fall to a support zone between 38% and 41%. This level was last seen between 2021 and 2023, with altcoins highly outperforming BTC.

This is because altcoins can also drop even if the BTC.D is dropping – just less than Bitcoin. Finbold have covered other analysts who also forecast a promising 2025 for cryptocurrencies, especially regarding the altcoins.

This ambitious goal has caught the eye of investors and analysts familiar with Kaspa and Polkadot. The question on everyone’s mind is whether XYZVerse can live up to the hype and make a significant impact in the market. The All-Sports Meme Token You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where degens can score big off the growing demand for meme coins Picture this: Polymarket hitting $1 billion in trading volume during the US presidential election – now throw in the hype of meme coins and the thrill of sports betting. With millions of sports fans ready to hit the field and cash in the XYZVerse ecosystem is set to keep expanding – and your rewards will slam dunk through the roof! >>>XYZ presale is your first-quarter chance to get in before the mind-blowing explosion! In 2024, meme coins are the undisputed champions of the crypto world, and XYZ is set to crush the competition. With potential thousand-fold returns that will blow past the finish line, the presale plan draws a hefty 9,900% growth by the TGE. Forget about BOME’s 5,000% rise or WIF’s 1,000% rally – XYZ is here to outscore them all! With upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, rock-solid defense in the form of audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZ is already ahead of the game. The first-mover advantage is key here – get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! >>Don’t be left on the bench – grab your XYZ tokens now and be part of the next massive crypto championship! Cardano (ADA) Cardano, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency world, offers a fresh approach to blockchain technology. Designed for smart contracts, its platform enables the creation of decentralized finance apps, tokens, and games. What sets Cardano apart is its native cryptocurrency, ADA, which rivals Ethereum’s ETH in functionality. Users can store value, make payments, and even stake ADA on the Cardano network. Uniquely, Cardano emphasizes environmental sustainability by using the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, an energy-efficient alternative to the traditional proof-of-work model. In addition to its green credentials, Cardano’s innovative structure divides its blockchain into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer handles transactions, while the Cardano Computing Layer manages smart contracts. This design enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially reaching up to a million per second. Introduced in March 2021, Cardano’s native tokens offer secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, ADA’s combination of sustainability, scalability, and efficiency positions it as a noteworthy contender. While other coins like Ethereum are transitioning to proof-of-stake to address similar issues, Cardano’s head start in these areas makes it a coin to watch in the current market cycle. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is a cryptocurrency that connects different blockchains. It lets value and data be shared between blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum without middlemen. This helps cryptocurrencies work together more easily. Polkadot uses “parachains” to make transactions faster and handle more at once. It can process more transactions than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Polkadot token, DOT, runs the network. DOT holders can help decide how Polkadot works and earn rewards by staking. Polkadot was created by Gavin Wood, a co-founder of Ethereum, and launched in May 2020. Polkadot has great potential in the crypto world. Its ability to link blockchains can make the whole system more efficient. As cryptocurrencies grow, networks that handle more transactions quickly are needed. Polkadot’s technology meets this need. In the current market, DOT may be attractive for those into innovative projects. Compared to other coins, Polkadot offers unique features that could make it stand out. With the crypto market always changing, coins that solve real problems, like Polkadot, might shine. Conclusion Despite the strengths of ADA and DOT, XYZVerse emerges as a pioneering sports memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, uniting fans in a community-driven ecosystem during the 2024 bull run.

BOME’s 5,000% takeoff and WIF’s 1,000% year-to-date rally are now relics of the past because XYZ is set to explode by over 9,900% from its current price by the TGE and outshine its sensational predecessors. Get in the game early to secure your spot – currently undervalued, XYZ is going the distance to break new records! Rallying the community, securing the win XYZVerse will be the MVP in this bull run, giving the community the control to call the plays and steer the ecosystem’s direction.

Sei (SEI) Sei is making waves as the first blockchain designed specifically for trading. By focusing on this sector, Sei aims to give exchanges an edge over competitors. Its platform is built to handle a massive number of orders each second, with transactions finalizing in just 380 milliseconds. This speed is a game-changer for traders who need quick and reliable execution. Looking ahead, some projections suggest Sei could grow by 323.76% by 2030 if it reaches its upper price targets. Its commitment to security and backing by large institutions add to its appeal. In the current market, where speed and security are paramount, Sei stands out among cryptocurrencies. Compared to other coins, Sei’s specialized approach could offer unique advantages in a competitive space. Mantra (OM) MANTRA is a new blockchain that blends security with the openness of decentralized networks. Built for institutions and developers, it meets real-world regulatory requirements. This means it’s ready for applications that need to follow laws but still want blockchain benefits. MANTRA uses the Cosmos SDK, making it compatible with other blockchains. Supporting up to 10,000 transactions per second, it’s fast and scalable. With tools to create and manage compliant real-world assets, it aims to make blockchain more accessible. In the current market, MANTRA’s OM coin stands out by focusing on compliance and user experience. While many blockchains struggle with regulations, MANTRA embraces them. This could attract institutions wary of legal issues. Compared to other coins, OM offers a unique mix of security and openness. With the trend towards regulatory compliance in crypto, MANTRA could be ahead of the curve. Its technology and focus might make OM attractive for investors seeking innovative and compliant blockchain solutions. Ethena (ENA) Ethena is introducing ENA, a synthetic dollar built on Ethereum. Unlike other digital dollars tied to traditional banks, ENA offers a crypto-native solution. It’s designed to be a stable form of money that doesn’t rely on the regular banking system. Ethena also brings the ‘Internet Bond’, a savings instrument that’s accessible worldwide and denominated in dollars. This means anyone, anywhere, can save and earn with a stable, digital asset. In the current crypto market, stability and accessibility are crucial. ENA stands out by providing a stablecoin that isn’t dependent on banks, which can be a big advantage. As trust in traditional financial systems wavers, a crypto dollar like ENA could gain popularity. The Internet Bond adds an appealing way to save and earn interest, similar to holding a bond but in the crypto world. Compared to other coins that may be volatile, ENA offers stability and the potential for steady growth. For investors looking for a reliable option in the crypto space, ENA might be an attractive choice. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is making waves in the crypto world by connecting different blockchains. Imagine sending value and data between Bitcoin and Ethereum without any middlemen. That’s what Polkadot does. It uses a technology called parachains to make transactions faster and more scalable. This means it can handle more transactions per second than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The DOT token lets holders play a role in the network’s development and verify transactions. Created by Gavin Wood, one of Ethereum’s founders, Polkadot promises a future where blockchains work together more efficiently. In today’s market, Polkadot stands out with its focus on interoperability. While many cryptocurrencies build their own ecosystems, Polkadot aims to connect them all. This could be a game-changer as the crypto space grows and the need for cross-chain communication increases. Compared to other coins, DOT offers a governance model that gives holders a say in the network’s future. With market trends pointing toward more decentralization and scalability, Polkadot’s technology puts it in a strong position. As the demand for interconnected and efficient blockchains rises, Polkadot looks poised to play a significant role in the next phase of crypto development. Conclusion SEI, OM, ENA, and DOT are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out, uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth with a strong community and roadmap.

Here’s What Experts Think,https://coingape.com/is-altcoin-season-over-heres-what-experts-think/,"The recent heightened volatile scenario in the broader crypto market has fueled discussions on the Altcoin season alongside Bitcoin. The investors appear to be selling heavily amid the holiday season, suggesting market participants are taking a profit-booking opportunity after the robust rally recently. It also sparked speculation that the crypto market rally has come to an end. However, the market experts remained optimistic about the broader crypto market, predicting a strong recovery ahead for the crypto. Crypto Market Dip Fuels Altcoin Season Concerns The recent dip in the crypto market has fueled speculations over a potential end in the Altcoin season. Notably, top altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and others have recently noted significant declines, indicating that investors are taking a pause amid the holiday mood. In addition, the recent slump in Bitcoin price has further weighed on the market sentiment. Amid this, top market experts have also predicted a potential BTC dip to $80K, further dampening investors’ hope. On the other hand, the upcoming Bitcoin and Ethereum options expiry has sparked concerns about more volatility in the digital assets space. Top Experts Remain Optimistic On Alt Season Future Despite the recent pullback, market experts remained optimistic about the future trajectory of the market. For context, in a recent X post, popular market expert Titan of Crypto hinted towards a bullish path ahead for the crypto market. The analyst noted that although many have given up hope on the Altcoin season, the market will soon witness a strong recovery. He said that “many have given up on the idea of an altseason. They’ll FOMO later and regret buying at the peak.” Source: Titan of Crypto, X In addition, renowned crypto expert Michael van de Poppe also remained bullish on the altcoin market. In a recent post, Poppe emphasized that the holiday season’s illiquidity makes markets more susceptible to manipulation, leading to increased volatility. However, he reassured that this does not alter his overall strategy, reiterating his long position on altcoins. Meanwhile, Poppe maintained his optimistic stance on the prospects for altcoins in 2025, predicting a remarkable year ahead. His positive outlook is rooted in the market’s historical patterns and the growing interest in cryptocurrencies. How Altcoins Are Performing? The crypto market recorded a sharp decline today, despite the investors’ optimism towards the sector. During writing, the global crypto market cap fell 2.36% to $3.34 trillion, with the overall trading volume declining 1.5% to $124.61 billion. However, despite the gloomy sentiment, the Fear and Greed index remained at 63, indicating that the “greed” sentiment still dominating. Besides, this also indicates that the altcoin season is not yet over and might continue to rally through 2025. In the altcoins sector, Ethereum price today slipped about 3% to $3,351, while its one-day trading volume plunged 2% to $19.72 billion. XRP price declined about 4% to $2.18 but its trading volume was up about 12% in the last 24 hours to $5 billion. Simultaneously, the latest Solana price chart showed that the crypto fell 3.5% to $190.05. The top meme coins also noted gloomy trading today amid a broader market retreat. For context, DOGE price today plunged 3.71% to $0.3155, while SHIB price was down 4% to $0.00002172. However, despite that, a top market expert predicts a potential SHIB price rally to $0.00008 ahead, indicating a strong market confidence towards the asset. The post Is Altcoins Season Over?

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 18:28:01

33767162,[object Object],1735237809,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Dominated By HODLing Sentiment – Metrics Reveal Holders Move BTC Less Frequently,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-dominated-by-hodling-sentiment-metrics-reveal-holders-move-btc-less-frequently/,"Bitcoin has experienced a rollercoaster ride over the past couple of weeks, showcasing its trademark volatility. After reaching an all-time high (ATH), the leading cryptocurrency saw its price drop by 15%, testing the $92,000 mark as a crucial support level. However, BTC quickly bounced back, climbing just below the psychological $100,000 threshold. This rapid recovery highlights the market’s resilience but also reflects ongoing uncertainty among traders and investors. Amid this volatility, new data sheds light on the shifting dynamics of the market. Top crypto analyst Axel Adler shared an insightful analysis revealing that the BTC market is increasingly dominated by HODLing sentiment. Long-term holders appear to be moving their coins less frequently, signaling growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. This behavior underscores a broader trend: rather than reacting to short-term price fluctuations, many BTC investors are opting to keep their holdings intact for extended periods. Such sentiment often lays a foundation for price stability and sets the stage for future rallies. With Bitcoin trading near historic levels and HODLing at an all-time high, market participants eagerly anticipate its next move in this dynamic and ever-evolving cycle. The Bitcoin Cycle: Same But Different Bitcoin’s current cycle exhibits familiar patterns from past bull runs, particularly the halving year that historically sets the stage for a new rally. As has been the case in previous cycles, the reduction in miner rewards through halving tends to decrease the rate of new supply entering the market, creating upward pressure on price. However, this cycle shows key differences. BTC has become a globally accepted asset, gaining more mainstream attention and capturing new investors from diverse backgrounds. More importantly, many of these new investors are adopting a long-term holding strategy, a trend that has become more pronounced across all investor cohorts. Key data from Axel Adler , a renowned CryptoQuant analyst, sheds light on these shifts. Since the start of the current bull cycle, Adler has highlighted a notable trend: the average age of VTC coins is steadily increasing on a yearly (365-day) scale, indicated by a blue arrow in the analysis. This signals that more and more coins are being held for extended periods, suggesting a strong HODLing sentiment in the market. Additionally, a short-term (30-day) trend also shows a higher propensity to hold coins, indicating that short-term holders are less inclined to sell. This shift toward HODLing is a bullish factor for BTC, as it reduces the circulation of “young” coins—coins that are more likely to be sold during price rallies. With fewer coins in active circulation, selling pressure diminishes, further solidifying Bitcoin’s upward potential in the coming months. BTC Price Testing Liquidity Bitcoin is currently range-bound between crucial demand levels, with support around $92,000 and resistance near the $100,000 mark. The market is awaiting a decisive move, as BTC’s price action remains stuck between these two key levels. To put it simply, if BTC trades above $100,000, the outlook is bullish, signaling potential for further gains. On the other hand, if it drops below $92,000, the market would lean bearish, suggesting a deeper pullback. In this range, there is room for indecision, with price fluctuations between these levels likely to continue in the short term. If BTC manages to hold above $95,000 in the coming days, this would be an encouraging sign for bulls, indicating that BTC could be gearing up for a challenge to the $100,000 level. A sustained push above $100,000 would signal strong bullish momentum, potentially driving BTC into new all-time highs. Conversely, any sustained move below $92,000 would suggest weakness and open the door to further downside. The next few days are crucial in determining Bitcoin’s short-term direction, and the $95,000-$100,000 range will be closely watched for any breakout signals.

What Will Be the Outcome? Here’s the Truth,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-donald-trump-really-make-all-bitcoins-made-in-the-us-what-will-be-the-outcome-heres-the-truth/,"As President Donald Trump accelerates his bid to return to the White House, his promise to ensure all Bitcoin is “made in the USA” has drawn both interest and skepticism from the cryptocurrency industry. This ambitious promise, announced on Truth Social in June following a meeting with crypto mining executives, shows Trump transforming from a crypto skeptic to a staunch industry ally. But experts say this suggestion is far from realistic. Bitcoin’s decentralized nature is one of its key features, making it impossible for any one country to dominate its production. “It’s a Trumpian comment, but it’s absolutely not based on reality,” said Ethan Vera, chief operating officer of Luxor Technology, a Seattle-based firm specializing in crypto mining services. With more than 95% of Bitcoin already mined, the remaining tokens will be minted over the next century via a global network of miners. These miners, who typically operate massive, energy-intensive data centers, compete to verify transactions and earn Bitcoin rewards. But the mining industry is increasingly global, with operators from Russia, China, Africa, and the Middle East vying for a share of the market. The U.S. has emerged as a major hub for bitcoin mining in recent years, driven by rising coin prices and large-scale investments from companies like CleanSpark and Riot. But American miners account for less than 50% of the global computing power needed to keep the bitcoin network afloat, according to industry analysts. Related News: Following Gensler's Resignation and the Trump Administration, the SEC's Cryptocurrency Stance is Projected to Change: What's the Status of the Crypto Lawsuits? Meanwhile, international competition continues to grow. In Eastern Europe, countries like Kazakhstan are seeing a surge in demand for mining infrastructure. China is reportedly seeing renewed activity despite its 2021 crypto mining ban. Africa, with its abundant hydropower, is fast becoming a hub, especially in Ethiopia. Even US-based mining firms like MARA are expanding overseas, including plans for a large-scale facility in Abu Dhabi. Trump’s promise also faces domestic and international hurdles. Rising U.S. energy costs and potential trade conflicts with China could increase miners’ operating expenses. Most of the Bitcoin mining equipment is made by China’s Bitmain, making American miners dependent on foreign supply chains. Additionally, Trump’s campaign rhetoric could inadvertently impact miners who offer hosting services, where customers from around the world rent capacity in U.S. facilities to mine Bitcoin. Despite the obstacles, many in the industry see Trump’s support as a net positive. His pro-energy stance and criticism of the Biden administration’s environmental regulations have won him favor among U.S. miners. During the last campaign, the crypto industry contributed $135 million to Trump’s fundraising efforts, the most of any industry. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts have always considered Cardano an undervalued digital currency amid its many developer-centric activities. With many things outlined for 2025, it remains unclear how high Cardano can soar in January 2025 to set a pace for the new year. The Cardano Price Historical Trend and Catalysts to Watch The biggest rallies recorded by Cardano thus far this year came in the fourth quarter of this year. From January to September, ADA price maintained a cliff around the $0.6 price level. However, by November 15, the coin broke out and eventually hit the yearly high of $1.32 on December 7 per data from CoinMarkertCap . ADA price has since retraced from this level amid and is currently changing hands for $0.8731, down by 3.84% in the past 24 hours. Within this period, the coin has has hovered from a low of $0.8628 to a high of $0.9246. Despite the volatility of the past week, Cardano bulls have nursed hopes for a new highs soon as a bull flag emerged on the charts earlier. There are key fundamentals that might drive the price of Cardano higher in January. These include the Cardano Bitcoin DeFi pursuit, the switch to decentralized governance following the Chang hard fork upgrade, the impacts of Hydra Head, Marlowe and Midnight Protocols and potential collaboration with Ripple Labs. The protocol’s core developer Input Output Global (IOG) headed by Charles Hoskinson has a lot of products in the pipeline. Notably, the organization might set the pace for the year with positive announcements that may shift sentiment and drive ADA price higher in January. There is also the speculation of a collaboration Cardano and Ripple for a potential RLUSD stablecoin integration on the former. If these projections pull through, the impact on the coin’s price may be resounding. How High Can ADA Price Soar? In an earlier ADA price analysis , Coingape explored the potential for the coin to soar to a $6 price mark. While this is higher than its ATH high of $3.10, it appears achievable, giving the adoption channels outlined earlier. The digital currency ranks as one of the top 10 coins in the market and maintains a very strong correlation with Bitcoin (BTC). Based on this correlation, any observable shift in the price of BTC to new highs might also impact on ADA in the long term. Pending this, Cardano price may likely reclaim its 52-week high of $1.32 if the bully sentiment returns in the new year.

Why Everyone Is Talking About the Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) Competitor",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-lightchain-ai-rise-18985-why-everyone-is-talking-about-the-ripple-xrp-and-cardano-ada-competitor/,"The crypto market is heating up, and all eyes are on the Lightchain AI (LCAI) Presale , offering early adopters the chance to get in at just $0.003 per token. With projections of an incredible 18,985% ROI by 2025, LCAI is positioned to outpace major players like Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). Combining cutting-edge artificial intelligence with blockchain technology, LCAI isn’t just another altcoin—it’s a game-changing disruptor. Don’t miss the opportunity to be part of this revolution during the Lightchain AI Presale ! What Makes Lightchain AI Stand Out Among Competitors? While Ripple and Cardano focus on specific niches like cross-border payments and sustainable blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI combines the best of blockchain and artificial intelligence, offering unparalleled utility and scalability. 1. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) At the core of Lightchain AI is its AIVM, which enables developers to deploy AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike Ripple and Cardano, LCAI extends blockchain’s capabilities into predictive analytics, natural language processing, and real-world automation, creating value across industries. 2. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Ripple uses consensus to facilitate fast payments, while Cardano employs Proof of Stake (PoS) for eco-friendly blockchain operations. Lightchain AI introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI) , a revolutionary mechanism that rewards network participants for performing meaningful AI computations. This innovation ensures LCAI’s blockchain remains productive and energy-efficient. 3. Deflationary Tokenomics Unlike XRP and ADA, Lightchain AI features a deflationary model by burning a portion of transaction fees. This creates scarcity, ensuring long-term value appreciation and making LCAI an attractive option for investors looking for sustainable returns. How LCAI’s Growth Potential Compares to Ripple and Cardano Ripple and Cardano have already achieved significant milestones, but their mature status limits their growth potential compared to early-stage projects like Lightchain AI . Ripple (XRP) Primarily focused on cross-border payments and financial institutions. Current growth potential depends on legal battles and regulatory clarity. Cardano (ADA) Known for its research-driven development and eco-friendly PoS model. Faces stiff competition from other Layer 1 networks like Ethereum and Solana. Lightchain AI (LCAI) Combines blockchain with AI for broad utility across industries. Early-stage project with massive upside potential, projected to rise from $0.003 to $20 by 2025. Why Experts Predict an 18,985% ROI for Lightchain AI 1. Early Adoption Opportunity Presale investments often yield the highest returns, and LCAI’s entry price of $0.003 offers a ground-floor opportunity. Analysts project that as adoption grows, LCAI could reach $20, delivering returns exceeding 18,000%. 2. Market Trends Favoring AI Integration The growing adoption of AI in blockchain applications positions Lightchain AI as a leader in this high-demand sector. Industries like finance, logistics, and healthcare are actively seeking AI solutions, giving LCAI a competitive edge. 3. Institutional and Whale Interest Reports indicate significant whale activity during the presale phase, underscoring the confidence of major players in LCAI’s long-term potential. Why LCAI Could Be a Better Bet Than XRP and ADA Ripple and Cardano have made a name for themself as trustworthy and good projects in the blockchain field but their chance to grow is getting less due to market fully packed and tough rivalry from other well-known cryptocurrencies. Both plans have made strong bases and big groups, but their sk͏ill to bring new change has kind of stopped in the present market view. Lightchain AI, on the other hand enters the stage with a new look and top features; using smart artificial intelligence tech to give special answers. This new method not just solves current problems in the blockchain world, but it also has great charm for both small buyers wanting to grow and big investors searching for space and ease. Lightchain AI—The Crypto to Watch in 2024 and Beyond With its revolutionary technology, early-stage potential, and projected exponential growth, Lightchain AI is undoubtedly a project to watch in the crypto market. As industries increasingly adopt AI-driven solutions and blockchain technology becomes more prevalent, LCAI is poised to be at the forefront of this intersection. Investors looking for high-growth opportunities and a chance to be part of an innovative disruptor should keep a close eye on Lightchain AI’s development and progress. With its unique combination of artificial intelligence and blockchain, LCAI could potentially outpace major players like Ripple and Cardano in terms of both utility and value appreciation. Don’t miss the opportunity to get in on the ground floor with Lightchain AI during the Presale and be a part of this game-changing revolution in the blockchain industry. So, keep an eye on LCAI, and join the movement towards a more intelligent and efficient future with Lightchain AI!

What This Legendary Metric Says,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-bull-run-over-legendary-metric-says/,"Here’s what the historical trend of the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio suggests regarding whether the current bull run is over or not. Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Could Hint At Where BTC Is In Current Cycle In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju shared a chart showcasing the past pattern in the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio. The MVRV Ratio refers to a popular on-chain metric that, in short, keeps track of how the value held by the BTC investors (that is, the market cap) compares against the value that they initially put into the asset (the realized cap). Related Reading: XRP Jumps 4%, Whale Reacts With $69 Million Coinbase Deposit When the value of the ratio is greater than 1, it means the investors as a whole can be assumed to be in a state of profit. On the other hand, it is under the mark, implying the dominance of loss in the market. The version of the MVRV Ratio posted by Young Ju isn’t the ordinary one, but rather a modified form called the “True MVRV.” This variation takes into account for only the data of the coins that were involved in some kind of transaction activity during the past seven years. Coins that are older than seven years can be assumed to be lost forever, either due to being forgotten or because of having their wallet keys misplaced. As such, the True MVRV, which excludes these coins that are probable to never return back into circulation, can provide a more accurate picture of the sector than the normal version of the metric. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this Bitcoin indicator over the history of the cryptocurrency: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin True MVRV has climbed to relatively high levels during this bull run. This implies the average investor is carrying notable profits. Historically, the higher the holder gains get, the more likely they become to participate in a mass selloff with the motive of profit-taking. Thus, whenever the MVRV Ratio rises high, a top can become probable for BTC. From the chart, it’s visible that the tops during the past cycles occurred when the indicator surpassed a specific line. So far, the metric hasn’t come close to retesting this level in the latest epoch. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Still Close To Extreme Greed: More Cooldown Needed For Bottom? According to the CryptoQuant founder, the reason the market cap hasn’t overheated relative to the realized cap yet is that there is still $7 billion in capital inflows entering the Bitcoin market every week. If the current cycle is going to show anything similar to the previous ones, then the True MVRV being high, but not extremely high, could potentially suggest room for BTC left in the current bull run. BTC Price Bitcoin has retraced its Christmas rally as its value is now back down to $95,700.

Smith said there has been a noticeable shift in investor sentiment, saying, “People want to hold more Bitcoin, not less.” He attributed this trend to the growing awareness of Bitcoin as an asset, with both retail investors and institutions exploring its potential as part of their portfolios. Smith noted that while Bitcoin is classified as a commodity and largely immune to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversight, the lack of a clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrency exchanges has hindered its wider adoption. “Institutions view Bitcoin as unregulated, and that discourages participation,” he said. Establishing a regulated market structure similar to traditional financial assets could attract more investors, Smith said. He also called for regulatory clarity on token classification and custody, saying exchanges and brokers should have a clear path for registration. According to Smith, this will not only promote market stability but also ensure transparency and trust.

Smith noted that the current political climate, which includes a pro-crypto Congress and a supportive administration, presents a unique opportunity. “These moments are rare,” Smith said, urging the crypto industry to seize the moment to push for comprehensive legislation and regulatory frameworks. The Trump administration has tapped Paul Atkins, a known crypto advocate, to lead the SEC, a move that is expected to mark a departure from the stricter regulatory approach of Gary Gensler, who served as SEC chairman during the Biden administration. Smith pointed to the global trend of governments and institutions building up Bitcoin reserves, saying he believes the move reflects growing confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. While acknowledging concerns that Bitcoin’s success could challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar, he argued that stablecoins backed by U.S. Treasury bonds are more directly tied to maintaining the strength of the dollar globally. Despite Bitcoin’s price fluctuations, Smith expressed optimism, noting that the asset has become mainstream in a relatively short period of time. He predicts that demand will continue to grow as financial advisors increasingly recommend Bitcoin as part of their retirement portfolios. “Bitcoin has become something that institutions can’t afford to ignore,” Smith said. “It’s a one-way street, and over time, more and more people will see the value in holding Bitcoin.” *This is not investment advice.

Crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 104,000 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin could plummet nearly 27% from its current value if it fails to remain trading above $93,806. The crypto analyst uses the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Realized Price Distribution (URPD) model to determine the key support levels. UTXO keeps track of the number of existing coins that last moved within a given price range. “From an on-chain perspective, a Bitcoin price correction to $70,000 is possible, understanding that below $93,806, it is pretty much open air all the way down to $70,085.” The analyst believes some investors are suddenly preparing for a bearish trend by sending their BTC to exchanges for possible selling. “Some savvy investors appear to be aware of such a bearish scenario, and they have sent over 33,000 Bitcoin to exchanges over the past week, valued at more than $3.23 billion!” Source: Ali Martinez/X He also says other investors are already selling ahead of a possible collapse. “Others are also booking profits. For instance, on December 23rd alone, more than $7.17 billion in Bitcoin profits were realized.” Source: Ali Martinez/X He says bearish sentiment is further evident from a more than 13% decline in the number of traders betting on Bitcoin rallying using the top crypto exchange Binance. “Moreover, the percentage of traders on Binance with open Bitcoin long positions recently dropped from 66.73% to 53.60%.” Source: Ali Martinez/X For the bearish outlook to flip bullish, the analyst says Bitcoin needs to convincingly reclaim $100,000 as support on the daily chart based on the In/Out of the Money Around Price (IOMAP) metric. The IOMAP classifies crypto addresses as either profiting, breaking even or losing money to determine support and resistance levels. “Bitcoin recently broke below one of its most significant support zones at $97,300. So, for the bearish outlook to be invalidated, BTC must reclaim this critical area of support and, more importantly, sustain a daily close above $100,000!” Source: Ali Martinez/X However, the analyst says a reignited Bitcoin rally could send the flagship crypto asset to $168,500 based on the Mayer Multiple, an oscillator that uses several ratios between price and the 200-day moving average. “If Bitcoin can sustain a daily close above $100,000, we could be looking at a new leg up toward $168,500.” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading for $95,855 at time of writing, down 2.3% in the last 24 hours.

On-chain data on Thursday revealed that whales heavily offloaded millions of tokens, raising investor apprehensiveness amid a 10% crash in ENA price. As a result, crypto enthusiasts are now extensively eyeing the coin for future price action shifts in the wake of the market’s latest volatility. ENA Price At Risk? Whales Dump Heavily Raising Concerns According to the data by Lookonchain, as of December 26, a couple of whales unstaked 3.36 million ENA, worth $3.17 million, and dumped it to the crypto exchange giant Binance. Per the data, the massive dump emerged amid the recent market drop, underscoring signs of panic selling. Notably, these whale addresses were identified as 0x886b.. and 0xbB22.., per Etherscan data . Overall, the massive dumps amid the market’s recent drop indicate traders showcase a low-risk appetite, mitigating losses with selloffs. Meanwhile, another saga has added to concerns surrounding the asset’s market standing. CoinGape reported that BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes recently sent 7 million ENA to Binance after unstaking it. This exchange dump further raises market concerns as crypto is currently witnessing a slumping action. How is Ethena Performing? At the time of reporting, ENA price cracked nearly 10% intraday and is currently trading at $0.9189. Its 24-hour low and high were $0.9219 and $1.04, respectively. Notably, the current waning trajectory falls in line with the broader crypto market trend and the abovementioned Ethena whale dumps. Nevertheless, it’s also noteworthy that the token’s monthly chart indicated gains worth 48%. This rising action mirrors soaring market optimism as the crypto’s team recently announced a partnership with Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI). As a result, a governance proposal has been submitted to integrate Ethena’s sUSDe stablecoin as a core collateral asset in WLFI’s upcoming Aave-based lending and borrowing platform. Given that the market recovers ahead, ENA price could witness a substantial upward movement in light of its partnership with WLFI. With Trump’s reelection to the White House, broader market sentiments over the sector’s future are already bullish, whereas Ethena remains poised to leverage the opportunity further.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 19:22:00

Announced during a meeting with crypto mining executives, the pledge reflects a shift in Trump’s stance on digital currencies. Despite this commitment, experts caution that achieving this goal may be unattainable due to various reasons discussed in this article. Is Donald Trump Bitcoin Strategy Achievable? Recent data indicate that 95% of Bitcoin has already been mined, leaving only a small fraction available for production. This reality makes President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to produce Bitcoin exclusively within the United States highly challenging. Bitcoin mining operates on a decentralized network, meaning no single country or entity can control the process. Additionally, global mining operations dominate the industry, with US crypto miners contributing less than 50% of the total computing power. This disparity underscores the difficulty of centralizing Bitcoin production to a single nation. The highly competitive nature of the sector further complicates efforts to shift the balance entirely to domestic players. More so, these challenges erupt even as Japan rejects Bitcoin for national reserves, prioritizing stability in its foreign exchange strategy. The government highlighted BTC price volatility and misalignment with traditional financial systems. Interestingly, this cautious stance contrasts sharply with other Japanese private entities. For example, Japan’s MicroStrategy, Metaplanet, invested ¥9.5 billion to purchase 617 BTC, raising its total holdings to 1,761.98 BTC. This move boosted its Bitcoin treasury by 56% amid a price dip. The company reported a 309% yield on its BTC holdings in Q4, with CEO Simon Gerovich emphasizing Bitcoin’s role in safeguarding capital against the declining Yen. Global Competition and Equipment Reliance Challenges Bitcoin mining is increasingly driven by international players with deep resources, such as miners in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. These regions often benefit from lower energy costs and fewer regulatory barriers, providing an edge over US operations. For example, countries like Ethiopia and Argentina offer access to cheap hydropower and stable revenue streams in US dollars. This boosts their competitiveness in the market. Adding to the challenge, most Bitcoin mining equipment is manufactured by Chinese companies, particularly Bitmain. A trade war or tariff policies under Donald Trump’s administration could raise the cost of importing essential machinery, creating additional obstacles for US crypto miners. However, despite the ambitious pledge, Donald Trump has found support from several US-based mining companies, such as CleanSpark Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc. These companies anticipate that his administration will reduce environmental regulations and increase industry support. However, some US miners are even turning to overseas partnerships to mitigate rising energy costs at home. For instance, MARA Holdings Inc. has announced a joint venture with an Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund to establish one of the largest mining farms in the Middle East. While Donald Trump’s commitment to making Bitcoin “made in the USA” aligns with his broader economic goals, it faces structural and logistical barriers.

The financial institution has announced a new rule that empowers commercial banks to block digital ruble transactions suspected of fraud temporarily. The measure, set to take effect on February 23, 2025, marks a pivotal step in the country’s rollout of its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Russia Applies Swift Action Against Suspicious Transactions Under the new rule, banks can suspend suspicious digital ruble operations for up to 48 hours. If flagged, the bank will notify the account holder and provide a 24-hour window for the customer to confirm or reject the transaction. Without a response, the funds will remain secure in the user’s digital wallet until further clarification. According to the central bank, this system mirrors fraud prevention strategies already employed in traditional payment systems. This move demonstrates Russia’s commitment to ensuring the digital ruble is as secure as its cash and non-cash counterparts. The Road to Digital Ruble Adoption Russia launched its digital ruble pilot program in August 2023, aiming for nationwide use by mid-2025. Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina has stated that the mass rollout is targeted for July 2025. The adoption process will span several years to ensure smooth integration. The digital ruble is designed to complement, not replace, existing forms of currency. This alleviates concerns among citizens wary of losing cash as a payment option. However, Nabiullina noted that a full transition may take several years. Russia’s approach draws inspiration from China, a forerunner in CBDC adoption. In Changshu, civil servants are already receiving salaries in digital yuan to accelerate usage. Learning from these efforts, Russia plans to fine-tune its digital ruble strategy while tackling its own economic and financial challenges. As digital currencies become more prevalent, ensuring robust security measures is crucial. The Bank of Russia’s latest actions demonstrate a commitment to safeguarding users while embracing financial innovation. The Rise of CBDCs: A Global Phenomenon Central banks worldwide are increasingly embracing CBDCs to modernize financial systems, improve payment efficiency, and strengthen monetary sovereignty. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), over 130 countries are at varying stages of CBDC exploration. Countries like China, Nigeria, and the Bahamas are leading the charge. The digital yuan’s success has inspired countries like Russia to accelerate their CBDC programs. In contrast, nations like Sweden and the European Union remain in the research phase. They are cautiously examining potential impacts on privacy and financial stability.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Animoca Brands – known for creating metaverse game The Sandbox ( SAND ) – says that founder and chairman Yat Siu’s X account was taken over by bad actors and used to endorse a fake token launch on Solana. “Unfortunately Yat Siu’s social media account has been compromised. There is no official token or NFT (non-fungible token) launch from Animoca Brands. The token launch on Solana as claimed in a post was made by the hacker. Please DO NOT engage with the account and stay vigilant. We will provide an update when the account is restored.” In a separate post on X, Mocaverse ( MOCA ) – the NFT collection of Animoca Brands that was said to be launching a token over SOL – says the ecosystem is safe and that better security measures are now in place. “We have confirmation that X has secured control of Yat Siu’s account and is now in the process of verifying true account ownership. The evidence seems to suggest that this was a case of stolen identity as the account had standard security implementations… There is no compromise on Animoca Brands, Moca Network or MOCA Foundation official handles, and there are strict security measures in place. As safety measures, all key members and official accounts have updated all authentications. No additional vulnerabilities or unauthorized activities were identified.” SAND and MOCA are trading for $0.561 and $0.327 at time of writing, respectively. According to blockchain investigator ZackXBT, Siu likely fell for the same phishing email scam that other blockchain executives were hit with earlier this week. “Update: Yat Siu (co-founder of Animoca) likely fell for the same phishing email a few hours ago as the scam token was deployed by the same address as the Kick and Vanar CEO ATOs.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Citing new central bank data provided by the office of Democratic Party Rep. Lim Kwang-hyun, Yonhap News Agency reports the number of people who hold crypto in South Korean exchanges exceeded 15.59 million in November, up by 610,000 from 14.98 million in October. The figures, based on the number of investors who have accounts in the five leading domestic exchanges, including Upbit, Bithumb, Coin One, Cobit, and Gopax, represent more than 30% of the estimated 51.23 million people who live in the East Asian nation. The report says the number of crypto investors has been on the rise likely as a result of market optimism following the victory of US President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to support the virtual asset industry. The number of domestic crypto investors rose by 14.74 million in July, 14.82 million in August, 4.88 million in September and 14.98 million in October, increasing by around 100,000 per month. Total crypto holdings also increased from 586 trillion won ($398.48 billion) in July to 102.6 trillion won ($69.768 billion) in November. The amount of average daily transactions likewise surged from 2.9 trillion won ($1.972 billion) in July to 14.9 trillion won ($10.132 billion) in November. Lim says the scale of crypto asset transactions is fast approaching a level comparable to the stock market. “At the level of all governments, preparations are needed to improve the stability of the virtual asset market and establish a sound market transaction that protects the rights and interests of users.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Ostrovskis noted the growing interest of corporations, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and traditional institutions to adopt Bitcoin as a strategic asset. “I think that’s going to be a pretty big driver next year as institutions as well as corporates move into Bitcoin,” Ostrovskis said. “You’ll probably see SMEs coming in as well.” This trend has been largely fueled by MicroStrategy, a commercial IT firm that has purchased over $10 billion worth of Bitcoin and plans to purchase another $42 billion, leveraging its equity capital to fund the purchases. Related News: Will Donald Trump Really Make All Bitcoins Made in the US? What Will Be the Outcome? Here's the Truth Ostrovskis cited Bitcoin mining giants Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms as examples of firms issuing convertible bonds to fund Bitcoin purchases. Earlier this week, tech firm Metaplanet announced plans to raise $31.8 million through a bond issue to accelerate Bitcoin purchases. “People talk about the impact of ETFs, and the main driver of that is that now pension funds and sovereign wealth funds can invest cash,” Ostrovskis said. “But there’s another pool of capital in corporates that’s probably a little bit freer and probably moves faster than waiting for pension funds to come in and buy Bitcoin ETFs.” “It’s probably only a matter of time before someone does the same thing and turns themselves into an Ethereum investment vehicle,” he said. “At that point, you become the MicroStrategy of that world.” *This is not investment advice.

Today, December 27, 2024, the overall cryptocurrency market sentiment appears to be experiencing a price decline, encompassing major assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP. This price decline in major assets has completely shifted market sentiment towards a downtrend. Cardano (ADA) Current Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $0.864, having experienced a price decline of over 6.9% in the past 24 hours. Amid this price decline, the altcoin has reached a crucial level. If this level fails to hold, the asset could tank by 15%, falling below the $0.75 mark. This bearish price action has infused fear among traders and investors, leading to a decline in trading volume. According to CoinMarketCap data, ADA’s trading volume has dropped by 16% in the past 24 hours. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA has recently broken down from a bearish head and shoulders price action pattern. Over the past seven days, it has been consolidating below the pattern’s neckline. Amid the recent price decline, ADA’s price has reached the lower boundary of the consolidation zone and is on the verge of a breakdown. Source: Trading View Based on the recent price action, if the altcoin breaches this level and closes a daily candle below the lower boundary of the zone, there is a strong possibility it could decline by 15%, reaching the $0.77 mark in the future. ADA’s bearish thesis will only hold true if it closes a daily candle below the $0.85 level, which constitutes the lower boundary of the consolidation zone. Otherwise, the bearish scenario may fail to materialize. On-Chain Metrics Reveals Mixed Sentiment Despite this bearish outlook, long-term holders appear optimistic, while traders seem hesitant to establish new positions, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from ADA spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $4.7 million worth of ADA, suggesting potential accumulation and buying pressure.

Russia began international dealings through Bitcoin. Russia trusts digital currencies to make inter-nation trade easier in ways that can protect it from US sanctions and give greater control over global trade with and over the US dollar. Russia has been trying to wean itself off the US dollar, especially due to international sanctions from the United States. This makes it challenging for Russia to do business with other countries because most transactions worldwide are still carried out in the US dollar. Hence, Russia is exploring alternative means of substituting the dollar, one being Bitcoin and other digital currencies to make international payments. Russia seeks other ways around the US dollar to settle trade balances with foreign parties and shun the American banking system, which leaves its hands open for freezing or blocking transactions. It finds such alternatives in Chinese yuan or even Bitcoin – purely electronic money that is highly secured and, hence easy to exchange. In the case of Russia, the BRICS grouping seems to be an arrangement where the country protects itself more than it challenges the US dollar in power. Russia’s economy isn’t strong enough to replace the dollar as the main global currency. Its move is merely symbolic; it shows defiance against the sanctions that have cut it off from global finance. Due to not being able to access the global bank and markets, Russia must opt for other alternatives such as trading in local currencies of allied countries and even using their gold reserves. The entire shift is not to get rid of the dollar altogether, but Russia is trying to be more self-reliant and less vulnerable to further economic pressure. What would this mean for Russia? Switching to Bitcoin, BRICS, or digital currencies would be helpful for Russia’s financial independence, avoiding interference by the US in its trades, and reducing dependency on the US financial system. But there are also some challenges. Not all countries are ready to use Bitcoin, and not all of them trust digital currencies. The security issues of Bitcoin and the value of Bitcoin are also part of the challenges. If Bitcoin or BRICS becomes a major medium of payment, Russia must establish a robust support system and educate businesses and its people on how to use digital currencies safely. And there are also speculations that Russia will launch its Bitcoin Reserve soon since that is one reason. What does it Mean for the US? Russia’s stepping away from the US dollar will be an issue. The dollar is used for a lot of international trade and as a store of value, making the US pretty powerful in matters of economics around the world, such as imposing sanctions. The Russian Ruble (RUB) is weaker compared with the US dollar and it’s not commonly used in international trade. This has allowed the US to have substantial control over global trade. If countries like Russia use Bitcoin for transactions instead of the dollar, it would possibly allow the country to boycott sanctions. Global Impact With more countries, including Russia, embracing Bitcoin, international transactions could become cheaper and faster as it eliminates the need for banks or middlemen. On the other hand, the price of Bitcoin is volatile and might cause economic uncertainty in the future if used as a major currency. Also, since many countries are not regulating Bitcoin entirely, it leaves much room for fraud and security concerns. Although Bitcoin has the potential to reduce reliance on the US dollar, it still has a number of challenges, such as price instability and lack of wide acceptance. Russia is also trying to use Bitcoin in international trade and make digital currencies more accessible. It is unlikely that the US dollar will be replaced by Bitcoin in the near future because Bitcoin is still unstable and not accepted everywhere. While Russia aims to reduce its reliance on the dollar, Bitcoin’s volatility and the lack of infrastructure to support it make it a risky alternative. If more countries follow suit, we could see a gradual shift away from the US dollar, but it remains the dominant global currency for now.",OP-ED|Bitcoin|USD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-26 20:00:38

SEC end of 2024 case update,https://finbold.com/ripple-v-sec-end-of-2024-case-update/,"As 2024 winds down, the long-standing legal battle between blockchain company Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) is still hanging in the balance. However, there are signs that a resolution might be on the horizon. The case is at a critical point, with key deadlines looming. Specifically, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit set January 15, 2025, as the date for the SEC to submit its opening brief in the Ripple appeal. This filing is pivotal, as it will outline the SEC’s legal arguments. #XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has entered an Order that the @SECGov ’s brief must be filed on or before January 15, 2025. pic.twitter.com/E3TE5tBDAy — James K. Filan 🇺🇸🇮🇪 (@FilanLaw) November 1, 2024 Meanwhile, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, has clarified that the appeal isn’t about whether XRP itself is a security. Notably, back in 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP isn’t a security, which was a big win for Ripple and the broader crypto community. “The case is not about whether XRP, in and of itself, is a security. XRP is uniquely situated as having clarity (alongside BTC) in not being classified as a security. The SEC is not challenging that ruling which stands as the law of the land,” he said. Ripple has also filed a Form C for a cross-appeal, but Alderoty pointed out that the review will stick to the current record. From early on in the case, he’s been quite vocal about what he sees as the SEC’s “lawless tactics.” While there is no final verdict, the industry is also optimistic about a possible settlement that would end this nearly four-year saga. XRP security status After the initial victory in 2023, the likelihood of XRP being reclassified as security has significantly diminished, especially after Judge Torres ordered Ripple to pay a fine of $125 million in August 2024 for violating securities laws, far from the SEC’s $2 billion demand. Importantly, there was no finding of fraud or investor harm. If the case gets stayed, it might push the SEC to drop its appeal, potentially setting a precedent for how XRP’s programmatic sales are viewed in the U.S. digital asset market. At the same time, Ripple has questioned the relevance of the 1946 Howey Test for today’s cryptocurrencies. Some say it’s outdated, while others praise its adaptability, which allows quicker regulatory response without new laws. Ripple has insisted that XRP, like Bitcoin ( BTC ), enjoys a clear legal status in the crypto world and is not classified as a security. Impact of Trump win on Ripple case Adding a twist to this legal drama, Donald Trump’s election and his promise to support crypto might change the outlook for the legal battle. Industry insiders and legal experts are optimistic about how a Trump administration could influence this case. There’s talk that the SEC might rethink its strategy under Trump. In this line, if Paul Atkins, known for his pro-crypto stance, gets the SEC nod, he might push for dismissing the case or at least negotiate a more favorable deal for Ripple. Attorneys like Jeremy Hogan and Fred Rispoli have suggested that new SEC leadership might review ongoing crypto lawsuits, including Ripple’s. Hogan believes that non-fraud crypto cases could be settled. At the same time, Rispoli sees a settlement as likely but not a complete dismissal, predicting new leaders might find the case “idiotic” and settle on easier terms. XRP price analysis At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $2.15, down over 3% in the last 24 hours and 5.6% on the weekly timeframe. XRP one-week price chart.

While the global push for Bitcoin grows, skeptics are becoming advocates, Japan remains hesitant to join the trend. Japan Cautious About Bitcoin Reserves According to a report by local news outlet CoinJP, Japan remains cautious about adopting Bitcoin as part of its national reserves due to concerns over security, liquidity, and volatility. In an official response dated December 20, the Japanese government clarified that crypto assets like Bitcoin do not fall under the legal framework of foreign exchange reserves. As such, the government stated that these reserves are intended to stabilize foreign currency-denominated assets and bond markets, and the volatility of Bitcoin is inconsistent with this system. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, responding to a question from Satoshi Hamada of the Party to Protect the People from NHK, said that Japan currently lacks sufficient information about the strategic plans of other nations, including the United States, regarding Bitcoin reserves. Ishiba noted that discussions in these countries are still in their early stages, which essentially makes it difficult for the government to express a definitive view on adopting such reserves. Hamada had previously suggested that Japan should consider following the example of the US by converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into crypto assets like Bitcoin. However, the government reiterated its stance that the special account operation, which is tasked with governing foreign exchange reserves, prioritizes ensuring safety and liquidity. Although the Japanese government itself does not directly hold Bitcoin, its Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), which manages over $1.5 trillion in assets and is one of the largest pool of retirement savings in the world, is exploring Bitcoin as part of a broader portfolio diversification plan, Bitcoin Reserves Gaining Momentum President-elect Donald Trump and key Republican lawmakers are advocating a Bitcoin reserve in the country. Several states, such as Ohio , have also rallied behind this concept. Notably, the US already holds significant Bitcoin reserves, totaling 207,189 BTC, which is roughly worth around $20 billion in today’s price. This stash has been primarily acquired through criminal seizures, including from the Silk Road case. Earlier this month, Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev proposed creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve while citing Bitcoin’s potential as a stable alternative to volatile traditional currencies. Tkachev’s appeal to the Russian Finance Minister outlined the benefits of cryptocurrencies, especially for countries facing sanctions.

Trump Cyborg (TRUMPCYB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPCYB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Cyborg can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Cyborg could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Cyborg launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Cyborg on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Cyborg by entering its contract address – 9yaNQ89EaQ2nEDczZpuTZfDwfiYCxbwSYC4JeiWLDE57 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

As the blockchain world evolves, so do the opportunities to invest in projects that could redefine finance, technology, and community engagement. This December, savvy investors have their eyes on coins like Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH), alongside the innovative Qubetics ($TICS). While Bitcoin remains the gold standard of crypto and Ethereum dominates smart contracts, Qubetics stands out with its user-friendly blockchain development tools, which are currently gaining traction during its presale. From Bitcoin’s proven track record to Ethereum’s revolutionary dApps, these giants hold their ground. Yet, Qubetics, with its cutting-edge QubeQode IDE and game-changing approach to blockchain creation, presents a rare chance for early adopters to secure significant ROI. Let’s explore these top cryptos to buy in December 2024, starting with the revolutionary Qubetics. 1. Qubetics: The Best Blockchain Development Tool for Early Adopters Qubetics ($TICS) is revolutionising blockchain development with its proprietary QubeQode IDE, a visual development environment that makes creating decentralised applications easier. The platform allows developers to drag and drop pre-built components directly into their projects, such as user authentication and token management. Users can define logic and smart contract parameters using form-based configurations without writing complex code. Additionally, the IDE includes a vast library of pre-written code snippets, empowering even beginners to integrate advanced blockchain functionalities effortlessly. Qubetics bridges the gap between technical innovation and user accessibility, setting itself apart in the crypto space. Currently, Qubetics is in Presale Phase 14, with weekly price hikes of 10%, culminating in a massive 20% increase in the final stage. Right now, $TICS tokens are priced at $0.037, with over $7.8M raised, 11,800+ holders, and 377M tokens already sold. The next phase is just around the corner, promising a substantial ROI potential of 563.81% before the token reaches its post-presale price target of $0.25. Analysts anticipate the token hitting $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch. Early participation in this presale could be a golden ticket to financial success, with Qubetics leading the list of top cryptos to buy in December 2024 . 2. Bitcoin: The Original Cryptocurrency Powerhouse Bitcoin ($BTC) is the undisputed pioneer of the crypto world. Launched in 2009, it introduced the concept of decentralised, peer-to-peer transactions secured through blockchain technology. Bitcoin’s appeal lies in its scarcity, with only 21 million coins ever to be mined. It serves as a store of value, often referred to as ""digital gold."" As institutional adoption increases, Bitcoin remains a key player in investment portfolios worldwide. Its consistent performance and increasing scarcity make it an undeniable pick among top cryptos to buy in December 2024. Why Bitcoin made this list: Its reliability and dominance in the crypto market. 3. Ethereum: The Smart Contract Leader Ethereum ($ETH) redefined blockchain technology by introducing smart contracts, enabling developers to build decentralised applications (dApps). Launched in 2015, Ethereum’s network is the foundation for countless innovations, from DeFi projects to NFTs. The platform has become more sustainable and scalable with the transition to Ethereum 2.0 and a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Its ecosystem continues to thrive, cementing its place as a cornerstone of the blockchain industry. Why Ethereum made this list: Its unmatched versatility and robust dApp ecosystem. Conclusion: Why These Are the Top Cryptos to Buy in December 2024 Based on the latest research, the top cryptos to buy in December 2024 are Qubetics ($TICS), Bitcoin ($BTC), and Ethereum ($ETH). While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain the cornerstones of the crypto world, Qubetics is carving out its niche with groundbreaking tools and an unmissable presale. At just $0.037 per token and with staggering ROI potential, Qubetics offers unparalleled opportunities for those ready to invest now. Don’t wait—seize the moment and secure your $TICS tokens before the price climbs even higher. The next phase is fast approaching, and this might be your best chance to ride the wave of innovation.

He went to X to demand answers following the release of results from the Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA) survey, which looked into this situation. Crypto Market is the Target of Debanking Traditional alternative investment managers like real estate did not experience this same trouble with the banks. Notably, AIMA discovered this after surveying 20 other alternative investors who were not dealing with cryptocurrencies. None of them had issues while receiving basic banking services. AIMA has made an action call, asking for a collaborative effort to stop this challenge the crypto industry faces. The association thinks that working closely with the incoming Donald Trump administration will serve as a solution . Already, Trump demonstrated his animosity towards this anti-crypto sentiment during his campaign. AIMA Survey Report Supports Operation Chokepoint 2.0 The AIMA survey report gives credence to Operation Choke Point 2.0 and the redacted documents published by Coinbase in its case with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It furnishes them with new statistical grounds. For context, Operation Chokepoint 2.0 is a debanking campaign allegedly targeted at the digital assets industry. US regulators wrote to banks discouraging them from using banking services to access crypto-related firms. The end game of this move is to suppress the crypto industry in the United States. Coinbase Seeks FDIC Pause Letters Coinbase has been pursuing this matter , seeking documents that prove to the court and the public that the FDIC made such requests of banks. In the process, the American cryptocurrency exchange came across some redacted “pause letters,” showing efforts of the FDIC to restrict crypto banking services. Noteworthy, the letters were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Each “pause letter” explicitly instructed banks to suspend crypto asset-related activities. They were also heavily redacted, preventing Coinbase from accessing a few other pieces of information. According to Grewal, “The letters that show Operation Chokepoint 2.0 wasn’t just some crypto conspiracy theory. FDIC is still hiding behind way overbroad redactions. And they still haven’t produced more than a fraction of them.” The post Coinbase CLO Reacts to AIMA Survey Results appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Blockchain News|Coinbase,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2024-12-26 20:45:01

BlackRock’s IBIT holdings skyrocket 117%,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-bull-blackrocks-ibit-holdings-skyrocket-117/,"The investment giant, BlackRock is doubling down on US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holdings. In a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), its Global Allocation Fund reported a 117% increase in IBIT shares as of October 31. Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have logged record inflows after Donald Trump’s Presidential election win. Since the beginning of October, Bitcoin’s price has surged from $60,000 to $106,000. BTC is up by more than 45% in the last 90 days. However, BlackRock’s IBIT recorded a record outflow of $188.7 million on December 24, eclipsing its prior $72.7 million outflow on December 20. BlackRock doubles down on Bitcoin ETFs As per the filing , BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund reported owning 430,770 shares of IBIT as of October 31. It is valued at around $17.13 million. The fund held 198,874 shares previously reported as of July 31. It mentioned holding 43,000 shares by the end of April. iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) is the largest player in the crypto investment fund market. It holds $53.78 billion worth of net assets as of December 24, 2024. IBIT has knocked $37.17 billion of net inflow by the date. Bitcoin ETFs saw $338.4 million in total outflows on December 24, contributing to a staggering $1.52 billion net outflows since December 19. Fidelity’s FBTC posted $83.16 million of withdrawals on the same day. Bitwise’s BITB recorded the net inflow for the day as it registered $8.50 million of deposits Meanwhile, Ether ETFs surged with $53.6M in inflows on December 24 and $130.8 million the day before. Launched in July, they’ve been gaining ground since November’s 18-day inflow streak. Bitcoin price has dropped by 3% in the last 7 days but it still holds a gain of 125% on YTD. BTC is trading at an average price of $95,462, at the press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is up 35% to stand at $47 billion. Are crypto ETFs the biggest winner of 2024? Dec 16 marked a major milestone for the crypto industry as US Bitcoin ETFs overtook gold ETFs in AUM for the first time, reaching $129 billion. Vetle Lunde, Head of Research at K33 Research highlighted that Bitcoin ETF flows are 4.5 times as fast as the inflation-adjusted gold ETF flows from their launch. He added that the BTC ETFs’ cumulative flows are still behind gold. Lunde reported that the Net Bitcoin ETF inflows in 2024 represented 3.5% of all net inflows to US ETFs in 2024. He added that BTC ETPs added 561,786 BTC in 2024 globally. The report suggests that 859,454 BTC has been bought by ETFs and public companies during the year. This accumulation is equivalent to 4.3% of the circulating supply absorbed in one year.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says that those predicting an upcoming bear market for the crypto king are likely ignoring on-chain data that shows BTC has been in a bull market for the last two years. According to Ju, crypto whales accumulating large amounts of the top crypto asset by market cap has gone from being a newsworthy event to a routine one, proving the bull market isn’t over. “The narrative of whale accumulation on Bitcoin has become so common that it’s now daily chatter. Just 2-3 years ago, news of whales accumulating would send shockwaves through the market. Today, it’s no longer breaking news – it’s just expected, routine information… Right now, we’re clearly in a bull market, with on-chain data showing $7 billion in weekly capital entering the market… News of whale accumulation no longer moves people – maybe because analysts, including me, have been calling it a bull market for the last two years. But the bull market isn’t over. If Bitcoin enters a bubble, all the analysts would be screaming about the cyclical top.” Ju goes on to say that BTC is not in a “bubble,” which he defines as when an asset’s market price significantly exceeds the capital flowing into it, noting that its cycle peak is not close. “For now, it’s obviously not a bubble. Sure, corrections can happen, but amid a bull cycle, it’s very unlikely we’ll see more than a 30% drop. Even if such a drop happens, it would likely be short-lived, with prices potentially going up more than 30% after the correction. The peak of this Bitcoin cycle still seems far off. For those predicting the start of a bear market, I’d like to hear their reasoning.” Source: Ki Young Ju/X Bitcoin is trading for $96,387 at time of writing, a 1.9% decrease over the last 24 hours.

To read full editions, subscribe . Stocks traded sideways — stalling their pre-Christmas rally — and cryptos dipped Thursday, making one of the final trading days of the year a relatively quiet one. The S&P 500 was down 0.06% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.02% at 2 pm ET. Bitcoin and ether were down 3% and 3.8%, respectively, over the past 24 hours at that time. The post-holiday moves came as investors unpacked one of the only economic data reports of the week: initial jobless claims. There were 210,000 first-time filers for the week ended Dec. 21, marking a slight decrease from the week prior and coming in lower than median expectation of 224,000. Continuing claims, however, came in at 1.9 million, slightly higher than the anticipated 1.88 million. The mixed report did not budge odds of an interest rate cut from the Fed next month. Fed funds futures markets on Thursday called for a 91% chance central bankers hold rates on Jan. 29, per data from CME Group. “One factor that pressures equities is the behavior of the fixed income market,” Pepperstone research strategist Quasar Elizundia said. “The continued rise in bond yields, driven by the reassessment of less restrictive monetary policy expectations, creates some concern.” Stocks are going to face additional headwinds, Elizundia added, given that investors seem certain interest rates in 2025 will not fall as much as previously anticipated. On the crypto front, the real market-movers in 2025 are likely to revolve around regulatory news . New leadership at the SEC and CFTC, combined with a Republican-majority Congress and campaign promises from President-elect Donald Trump, could set the stage for a breakout in the first half of the new year.

In a research paper, CoinGecko says that the majority of crypto interest in 2024 hit the memecoin sector, which saw an expansion from dog-themed tokens to other animal and personality-themed digital assets. “The most popular crypto narrative in 2024 was by far the memecoin narrative, which captured a combined 30.67% of global investor interest across the main memecoin narrative and 25 memecoin trends. In other words, almost a third of crypto narrative interest this year was focused on more speculative opportunities with less emphasis on fundamentals, as the market expanded rapidly from dog-related memecoins to other animal-and personality-themed memecoins. Specifically, the main memecoin narrative ranked 1st with a 14.36% share of crypto narrative interest. This represents a 6.04 percentage point increase from the memecoin narrative’s 8.32% share of interest last year.” CoinGecko also finds that smart contract platform Solana ( SOL ) – known for being rife with memecoin activity – also drew a significant amount of trader interest in 2024. Base, the blockchain of top US-based crypto exchange Coinbase, also drew notable interest. “Solana-related narratives captured a combined 14.30% share of investor interest, putting it close behind the AI narrative in terms of popularity. While Solana memecoins drove almost half of attention towards the chain, investors continued to be interested in the broader Solana ecosystem, which ranked as the 5th most popular narrative with 5.78% of investor interest… Meanwhile, two Base-related narratives also entered the top 20 rankings this year, on the back of the chain’s strengthening popularity. Altogether, the Base ecosystem and the Base memecoins narratives accounted for 4.87% of investor interest.” SOL is trading at $199 at time of writing.

Winter Pepe (PEPEWINT), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEWINT is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Winter Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Winter Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Winter Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Winter Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Winter Pepe by entering its contract address – CUreLFB9SJmu6WEpotjmLJgt1khhdpneukDRJsbXFCGM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEWINT. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 21:04:00

Analysis Company Founder Shares",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/are-we-in-a-bull-market-in-bitcoin-or-is-it-all-a-bubble-analysis-company-founder-shares/,"According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, the cryptocurrency market has become accustomed to the steady accumulation of Bitcoin by large holders, commonly referred to as whales. Whale news that moved the market just a few years ago is now considered routine, reflecting a shift in market dynamics. In a recent statement, Ju noted that the prevalence of whale congestion has become a daily topic of discussion: “Just 2-3 years ago, news of whale congestion would send shock waves through the market. Today, this is no longer breaking news, but just expected, routine information.” According to Ju, this normalization is due to the relative absence of individual investors and the dominance of whales in the Bitcoin market. Ju believes this dynamic is widely accepted within the crypto community. Related News: Two Giant Whales Panicked at the Recent Drop: They Dumped This Altcoin Immediately Addressing concerns about a potential bubble, Ju defined a bubble as a period when the market price, as measured by on-chain data, significantly exceeds the actual capital inflow. Comparing this to the current state of the market, Ju cited the weekly on-chain capital inflow of $7 billion as evidence of an ongoing bull market. “We are clearly in a bull market right now,” Ju said. He suggested that the muted reaction to the whale accumulation news could be due to consistent bull market calls from analysts, including himself, over the past two years. However, he noted that the bull market is not over and a true bubble scenario would be characterized by analysts’ widespread warnings of a cyclical top. Ju rejected the idea of an imminent bear market, calling on those predicting a downturn to back up their claims with data: “I would like to hear the reasoning of those predicting a bear market. One thing is clear: they are not looking at on-chain data.” While the analyst acknowledged the possibility of a correction, he downplayed its potential impact within the current bull cycle. He predicted that any decline would likely be less than 30% and short-lived, with the potential for a strong recovery. *This is not investment advice.

The community gathered 1.69T tokens, which were burnt from the DAO’s multi-sig wallet. Bonk (BONK), one of the leading Solana meme tokens, decreased its supply by 1.69B tokens after a community vote. The token burn by Bonk DAO aims to further decrease the supply and spark value growth for BONK. The token burn further limits the supply down to 91T from an initial creation of 100T tokens. The burn was achieved in a single Solana transaction and recorded for the community. Based on community participation in Burnmas, the amended vote has passed and 1.69 Trillion $BONK has been burnt from the @bonk_dao multisig The Total Supply of $BONK is now down to 91 Trillion Tokens from it's original 100 Trillion ❗️❗️❗️ #LetsBONK — BONK!!! (@bonk_inu) December 26, 2024 BONK aims to be a community-owned token, where users agree to hold and keep the asset deflationary for long-term appreciation. The current burn mixed various forms of social media and ecosystem engagement, adding more exposure for BONK on social media. The BONK burned is valued at over $52M in notional value, and represents around 2% of the total supply. After the burn, the wallet of Bonk DAO still holds 9% of the total supply and is the biggest singular entity on the chain. The DAO wallet even surpasses the BONK holdings on Binance. The BONK staking pool locks up an additional 4.8% of the token’s supply. Bonk DAO still holds 9% of the total token supply. | Source: Bubblemaps The recent token burn was a continuation of the 2023 Bonkmas event. The supply burn also marks the second anniversary of BONK. The vote aims to boost participation across the ecosystem, as the project’s main goal is to boost Solana usage through memes. The initial intention was to burn 1T tokens, but the community extended the deposits to a much larger pool. Two years ago, BONK was focusing on airdrops and reaching a wider community of holders. Later, BONK aims to engage those holders and strengthen its position as a long-term meme. BONK was one of the memes to help Solana leave behind the meme market. However, BONK is also not favored by influencers like Murad Mahmudov, who are more interested in cults created in the past year. BONK will plan similar events in the future, while trying to offer better real-time reporting to motivate the community, remarked top ecosystem contributor Nom . The burn proposal was accepted with 99% votes in favor. The burn campaign lasted from November 15 until December 25. Part of the burn was based on social media interactions, including messages on X and followers on Instagram and TikTok. Additional BONK was set aside for burns for engaging with selected ecosystem partners. BONK still awaits to recover its higher price range Even after the burn, BONK did not rally immediately. The asset traded near a one-month low at $0.000031, after peaking at $0.000053 on November 22. BONK open interest is near a three-month low at $8.32M, after traders rolled over to other assets. However, the lowered position sparks expectations of an eventual rally from the lows as BONK starts to appear undervalued. BONK remains one of the low-cost tokens aiming for meme influence and community cohesion while attempting to grow its influence against other memes. The recent token burn also aims to boost attention for BONK, after other Solana assets started to displace the former leader. BONK has previously lost its leading position to DogWifHat (WIF), though for a brief period of active trading. This time around, BONK is no longer the leading Solana meme token, after the native Pudgy Penguins token (PENGU) was added to the list. PENGU was categorized as a meme token, and its market capitalization above $2.4B put it ahead of BONK. The original meme still has a chance to recover its leading position, attempting to ride on its wide community appeal and long trading history. BONK is part of the 2022 crop of memes, with more than 370K followers. Its prominent status and listings on major markets put it ahead of newer meme trends. BONK has already spread to 11 chains, with more than 770K reported holders.

38156839,https://blockworks.co/news/sol-bearish-december-market-cap,1735248600,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,SOL’s market cap slips amid bearish December,https://blockworks.co/news/sol-bearish-december-market-cap,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Roughly a month ago, SOL set a new all-time high at $263. Since then, it’s been down-only for the asset, which retraced all the way below $190. The 25% slide knocked Solana down a couple of rungs on the cryptocurrency leaderboard. SOL is now the sixth-largest cryptoasset by market capitalization, trailing bitcoin, ethereum, tether, ripple and BNB. Some have pointed to the flashy new exchange Hyperliquid as a SOL competitor, but other market watchers say Solana is likely to keep running after a slight drawdown. For context, all cryptos have had a rough week after the most recent FOMC meeting somehow left investors feeling bearish despite another rate cut . Still, of all the major tokens experiencing a Santa slide, SOL showed “particular weakness,” FalconX head of research David Lawant wrote on Friday. Memecoins like SHIB and DOGE performed even worse, perhaps indicating that the more volatile the crypto, the harder it fell. While SOL is far from a memecoin, it is certainly higher-beta than BTC or ETH. That hasn’t stopped XRP and BNB from rallying past Solana however. Solana investors may partly be pricing in a $2.1 billion SOL token unlock that’s slated for March 1, 2025 and could put downward pressure on the asset if the unlocked tokens are sold. SOL’s price may also be struggling due to a newfound competitor in Hyperliquid peeling away some investors, Quai Network co-founder Alan Orwick said. Hyperliquid is a decentralized-ish layer-1 and crypto exchange focused on perpetual futures trading. Its HYPE token airdrop earlier this month was one of the largest in crypto history. HYPE is already the 25th-largest crypto token by market cap. Because Hyperliquid is very fast, some have started calling it a better version of speed-focused Solana — although its momentum has stalled somewhat in recent days amid speculation that North Korean hackers are plotting an exploit of the blockchain. Orwick added that a pro-crypto Trump administration and potential SOL ETF approval could be bullish for the asset next year. Plus, there are always memecoins. The launchpad and major driver of Solana onchain activity pump.fun “probably won’t get shut down by the Feds until 2028,” CFX Labs co-founder and CEO Nick Chicago said. “Wouldn’t be surprised to get major brands doing memes.” Chicago was bullish for anecdotal reasons as well: His mother-in-law, who typically buys cryptos at the very top, “has not deployed yet.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

Tailored for enterprises utilizing Kubernetes for containerized orchestration, this platform is designed to seamlessly meet the needs of modern businesses. Driven by real-world demand and innovative tokenomics, NXQ Tokens offer a compelling opportunity to invest in a tangible, utility-driven asset with significant growth potential. NXQ Token Overview NXQ Tokens are the currency of NexQloud’s decentralized cloud computing network, balancing increasing demand with shrinking supply to drive long-term value. They serve as the utility token distributed to QloudNode operators who provide the specialized hardware required to run the decentralized cloud. Businesses require NXQ tokens to access NexQloud’s services, creating a self-sustaining cycle where token demand and value grow organically. As more enterprises adopt NexQloud’s cost-efficient and environmentally friendly cloud solutions without compromising security or availability, the demand for NXQ Tokens is expected to increase in line with their rising computing needs, projected at a compound annual growth rate of 16.3%. Concurrently, the supply of NXQ Tokens tightens due to a Bitcoin-inspired halving mechanism that reduces daily token distribution every four years. This, combined with increasing competition among QloudNode operators, further restricts token availability, while NXQ’s fixed supply ensures lasting scarcity. Maruo Terrinoni, CEO of NexQloud, explains, “This distinctive blend of increasing demand and limited supply establishes NXQ as a utility-backed token with considerable growth potential, presenting an appealing opportunity for both investors and QloudNode contributors.” NXQ Tokenomics Advantage: Supply and Demand Platform Growth: Every new business onboarded to NexQloud adds to the token demand, creating a cycle of increasing adoption and revenue reinvestment. NexQloud brings a dynamic market presence to the trillion-dollar cloud industry, which is growing at a 16.3% Compound Annual Growth Rate. Enterprise Adoption: Businesses require NXQ tokens to access NexQloud’s decentralized cloud services. As more enterprises switch to NexQloud for its cost-effective and scalable solutions, the demand for NXQ increases. Growing enterprise workloads amplify token usage as companies scale their operations and computing needs. Speculative Interest: NXQ’s proven scarcity model and real-world utility attract crypto investors seeking a stable yet growth-oriented asset. NXQ Supply Decreases Through Scarcity Mechanisms Bitcoin-Inspired Scarcity Mechanism: The total supply of NXQ tokens is capped at 21 million, ensuring a finite asset that becomes increasingly valuable as demand grows. Halving Events: Every four years, the daily token distribution (3600 NXQ tokens daily until 2028) to QloudNode operators is halved, mirroring Bitcoin’s approach to driving value appreciation over time. Increased QloudNode Competition: As more QloudNode operators join the network, competition for daily token rewards intensifies, making NXQ tokens harder to acquire. Fixed Supply: With no ability to mint additional tokens, the token supply remains immutable, safeguarding against inflation. The Supply and Demand Impact This system ensures that as NexQloud scales and enterprise adoption grows, NXQ tokens remain scarce, increasing their value. The result is a predictable scarcity-driven appreciation in token value, offering investors a stable, utility-backed asset with significant long-term growth opportunities. “By aligning our tokenomics with enterprise cloud demand, NXQ delivers a compelling opportunity, blending the best of cryptocurrency innovation with practical, real-world utility,” says Terrinoni. “We are not just creating a decentralized platform; we are influencing a trillion-dollar industry to recognize the real-world impact and long-term value of blockchain technology. Like Bitcoin, NXQ tokens are poised to be a game-changer, driving significant transformation in how cloud services are consumed and provided.” As NexQloud prepares for its launch, the NXQ token system is set to not only reshape the cloud computing landscape but also provide a blueprint for how cryptocurrencies can offer real-world utility and foster significant economic shifts.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 21:34:01
38156078,https://coingape.com/?p=231024,1735248861,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Top 5 Biggest Crypto Hacks of 2024,https://coingape.com/top-5-biggest-crypto-hacks-of-2024/,"Despite the heightened advancements in blockchain technology and security protocols, 2024 recorded some of the industry’s biggest crypto hacks. An alarming surge in cybercrime overshadowed the industry. Hackers deployed sophisticated methods, exploiting vulnerabilities in private keys, smart contracts, and even unsuspecting employees. By Q3 2024, TRM Labs, a blockchain intelligence firm, reported that over $2.2 billion was stolen in crypto hacks. This figure surpassed the $1.8 billion lost throughout 2023. Here are five of the biggest crypto hacks recorded this year; 1. The $308 Million DMM Bitcoin Crypto Hack In May, DMM Bitcoin, a crypto exchange in Japan, suffered a serious hack as bad actors siphoned 4,500 BTC. At the time, the looted digital assets were valued at over $300 million. Even though experts could not pinpoint how the exploit happened, investigators stated that hackers connected to North Korea used stolen private keys from the exchange. The hack not only crippled the exchange financially, it also left many users without access to their accounts. DMM Bitcoin’s parent company quickly stopped the exchange’s operations and moved user accounts to the rival platform SBI VC Trade. This incident damaged the company’s reputation, marking a reference point for other centralized exchanges worldwide. 2. PlayDapp Hacked Twice: $290 Million Gone Hackers hit PlayDapp, a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and gaming platform, twice in February. The bad actors targeted and exploited the platform’s key management vulnerability. They looted $290 million in PLA tokens, the platform’s native token. This attack was notorious because the hackers ignored a $1 million bounty offered to return the stolen money. PlayDapp’s efforts to track the stolen funds were unsuccessful, and the missing tokens are still unaccounted for. As a result, the platform’s operations took a hit, as it is struggling to win back the trust of its users. 3. The WazirX Exploit: $235 Million Stolen In June, WazirX, one of India’s largest crypto exchanges suffered a hack, allegedly orchestrated by North Korean actors. A total of $235 million left its vaults, leading the exchange to suspend all withdrawals. Shortly after the attack, reportedly, WazirX sent $75 million of user funds to Bybit and KuCoin, further complicating the situation. WazirX’s parent company, Zettai Pte Ltd, also faced legal issues and asked for a break to sort out its finances. Recovery efforts are still on hold, with affected users still awaiting updates amid the recent Binance delisting of WRX, its native token. 4. Ripple Co-Founder Loses $112.5 Million in Hack In January, Chris Larsen, a co-founder of Ripple, revealed that hackers got into his personal XRP accounts. He mentioned that the criminals stole 213 million XRP, worth $112.5 million at the time. While the crypto hack did not target Ripple, the firm’s executives remain a high target. At the time, ZachXBT, a blockchain investigator, found that the stolen assets were laundered through multiple exchanges. Despite Larsen’s efforts to recover the funds, the stolen crypto remains at largeelusive, raising concerns about personal safety in the crypto world. 5. Hackers Steal $80 Million From Orbit Chain 2024 started with a major crypto hack on the DeFi project Orbit Chain, a cross-chain bridge. Hackers exploited vulnerabilities to drain $80 million of Ethereum (ETH) and DAI. The stolen funds were eventually routed through Tornado Cash, a coin mixer notorious for hiding illicit transactions. Orbit Chain’s team apologized shortly after the breach but has provided little information. This incident highlights the risks of cross-chain protocols and how hard it is to track stolen assets once they are hidden.

While some attribute the rise of CoinJoin transactions to hackers laundering funds, others point to increasing whale accumulation. The bitcoin market has seen a major shift in the behavior of transactions. So-called CoinJoin private transactions have tripled, according to data from CryptoQuant. However, Chainalysis presents evidence that the surge in CoinJoin transactions has nothing or less to do with illicit activity; it might be part of another trend dominating the Bitcoin ecosystem. Per Chainalysis, crypto hacks have only summed up to $2.2 billion this year. Though this is a great number, it translates to less than 0.5% of the inflows of Bitcoin into Realized Cap for the same period, which stands at $377 billion. BTC whales are privately accumulating CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said whales are buying Bitcoin through stealth buys, which are surging. The whales normally use privacy-enhancing methods in asset transfers, particularly with new institutional investors. This trend is marked by a massive inflow of Bitcoin to accumulation addresses connected to exchange-traded funds (ETFs), MicroStrategy, and custodial wallets. More than 1.55 million BTC in 2024 alone have entered using these accumulation addresses, which is the greatest testament to the interest of institutions growing in Bitcoin. The whales typically have strong reasons for keeping their transactions private so that large capital flows will neither upset the market prices of such transactions nor reveal identities. The CoinJoin tools are friendly in this aspect and hide the flows of funds in a manner that would otherwise be traceable on the Bitcoin blockchain. Source: CryptoQuant Who are these Whales? While sometimes the market has been kind enough to provide some resemblance of transparency, a significant amount of Bitcoin has not been traced yet. It is estimated that between 240,000 and 420,000 BTC is held by unknown people. So, just who are these whales? These mystery accumulators indicate that there is a division of ownership of Bitcoin. Institutional players like ETFs and companies like MicroStrategy are often given the limelight as they make large purchases. So, that unknown parties are accumulating Bitcoin, reveals that other private investors or institutional entities have a reason not to reveal their positions. It says that major investors are pretty keen on having their portfolios somewhat private so they aren’t getting too much attention in the markets. It’s unique that bitcoin’s ownership is pretty diversified with more big players getting in, such as companies and institutions. However, a lot of them do so secretly, such as with MicroStrategy; most keep it under wraps so no one knows what’s happening. As Bitcoin continues to grow, with all these CoinJoin transactions getting bigger and more institutions jumping in, it shows how this currency is slowly fitting into a more advanced setup.

Announced today, the exchange is merging the Bitget Wallet Token (BWB) with its native token, Bitget Token (BGB). This is to create a unique token that bridges centralized and decentralized crypto platforms. This integration aims to transform the user experience on Bitget, showing its goal to reshape the future of digital finance. BGB Token; A Token to Revolutize Bitget Ecosystem The new BGB token will be designed to serve as a key component within the Bitget ecosystem, benefitting both Bitget’s trading platform and wallet. The new token will power key features like Fair Launchpool, a platform feature that helps users invest in new tokens at an early stage. It will also facilitate payments for multi-chain gas fees. Users can use BGB tokens to pay transaction fees across different blockchain networks, streamlining their experience. Beyond these immediate functionalities, the BGB token is set to play a critical role in decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. According to Bitget, the token will integrate with public blockchains and leading DeFi protocols, offering on-chain trading services. This new token is expected to become a core staking asset for mainstream lending and staking platforms in the long run. This move could significantly increase its adoption and importance in the broader crypto space. Bitget Expands BGB Potentials to Offline Applications Beyond the digital space, Bitget plans to extend the potential of BGB tokens to integrate with offline PayFi applications. This would allow users to use the token for everyday activities like dining, travel, and shopping. It would make the cryptocurrency more practical and accessible in daily life. This strategy shows Bitget’s goal of making digital assets functional in global commerce.

This development marks an important milestone in the company’s expansion within North America, particularly targeting high-net-worth individuals and institutional clients in the United States and Canada. Known as the Crypto.com Custody Trust Company, the new platform will oversee the secure storage of digital assets for qualified clients. Over the coming weeks, Crypto.com will transition assets for US and Canadian customers to the custody platform, ensuring continuous access to accounts and funds during the process. This move reflects Crypto.com’s confidence in the North American market , as stated by CEO Kris Marszalek. Marszalek highlighted the significance of this step, emphasizing the US and Canada as two of the most crucial markets in the crypto space. The launch aligns with Crypto.com’s strategy to innovate and expand its offerings, solidifying its presence in a rapidly evolving market. Based in Singapore, Crypto.com has been growing its footprint globally. This year has seen significant progress, including securing various regulatory approvals worldwide. The launch of the US trust company follows the acquisition of Watchdog Capital, a US SEC -registered broker-dealer, further strengthening the company’s position in North America. Earlier this month, Marszalek visited President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, signaling Crypto.com’s willingness to collaborate with the upcoming administration . In a related development, the company dropped a lawsuit against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which had been filed in October following a Wells notice about potential enforcement action. Crypto.com indicated that withdrawing the lawsuit was part of its effort to work cooperatively with regulators to establish a robust framework for the cryptocurrency industry. Despite regulatory hurdles, 2023 has been a positive year for the company. Notable achievements include becoming the first cryptocurrency sponsor of the UEFA Champions League in August, a move that boosted its global visibility through stadium promotions, broadcast features, and other marketing campaigns. In 2022, Crypto.com secured UK regulatory approval, achieving Electronic Money Institution (EMI) status under the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). These developments highlight Crypto.com’s ongoing efforts to expand and innovate in the global cryptocurrency market, with a strong focus on North America and Europe.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-26 21:47:07

The court unanimously rejected his claims, citing legal shortcomings in his arguments and supporting a prior ruling favoring extradition. The final decision now rests with Montenegro’s justice minister, who will determine whether Kwon will be extradited to the United States or South Korea. Reports suggest extradition to the US is more likely , reflecting the justice ministry’s stance. Kwon faces serious charges related to the collapse of Terraform Labs’ crypto ecosystem, including the TerraUSD and Luna coins. The market crash in May 2022 erased nearly $40 billion in value, making it one of the largest financial collapses in history. The failure of the UST stablecoin also triggered the infamous ""crypto winter"" of 2022, exposing malpractice at platforms like FTX and Celsius. This collapse has drawn global regulatory attention to stablecoins and decentralized finance. In March 2023, Kwon was arrested in Montenegro while attempting to travel with a forged passport. His case is seen as a precedent for international collaboration in prosecuting cryptocurrency-related crimes. Earlier this year, Terraform Labs settled with the SEC for $4.47 billion, the largest financial settlement in the agency's history. This included $3.6 billion in disgorgement fines, $420 million in civil penalties, and $467 million in interest. Kwon himself was ordered to pay over $200 million, consisting of $110 million in disgorgement fines , $80 million in civil penalties, and $14.3 million in interest. Reports also suggest Kwon has potential political ties in Montenegro, raising questions about his influence on the legal process. In 2023, Montenegro's prime minister called for an inquiry into allegations that Kwon financially supported the Europe Now party, led by Milojko Spajic, a political rival. This ruling has brought Kwon closer to extradition, setting the stage for a major legal showdown .

Current Republican commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda will be the only ones remaining after SEC Chair Gary Gensler steps down. This shift could signal a change in the agency's approach to the crypto industry, according to Peirce. Speaking at the Blockchain Association Policy Summit, Peirce emphasized that the SEC has various tools at its disposal , though enforcement has often been the go-to method for regulating crypto. She suggested that with new commissioners, the agency might see a different mix of cases and strategies moving forward. Uyeda pointed out the need for transparency in policymaking, noting that most discussions at federal agencies like the SEC occur privately. He stressed the importance of the Administrative Procedure Act, which allows public feedback on regulations and ensures accountability. However, some policies, such as SAB 121 , have bypassed public input, sparking criticism. SAB 121 required digital asset custodians to report liabilities and matching assets on their balance sheets. While Congress voted to overturn it, President Biden vetoed the resolution , leaving the policy in place. Both Peirce and Uyeda expressed a desire for more opportunities for public engagement in shaping SEC regulations. Peirce acknowledged the challenges of shifting the agency’s current trajectory, emphasizing the need for collaboration between regulators and the crypto industry to rebuild trust. She addressed the crypto sector directly, stating, “It will take effort from both sides to move forward, but it’s achievable.” These changes reflect a potential turning point for the SEC, particularly in how it manages the rapidly evolving crypto landscape.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-26 21:54:50

The analyst also provided insights into why XRP could reach such an ambitious price target. XRP Price To Reach $27 In This Market Cycle In an X post, Egrag Crypto predicted that the XRP price could reach $27 in this market cycle. The analyst cited some statistics to prove why the crypto could indeed reach this price target. First, the crypto analyst mentioned when XRP crossed the 21 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) in the 2-week time frame, a move which led to the cycle top in 2017 following an explosive rally of 50,000%. In applying a similar measurement to the current price action, an XRP crossover of the 21 EMA to $27 represents a price gain of 4,770%. Such a price rally would represent only 9.54% of the 50,000% surge recorded back in 2017. Egrag Crypto is confident that XRP can reach this price target since it witnessed a more explosive move back in 2017. This isn’t the first time the crypto analyst has raised the possibility of XRP reaching such heights based on historical trends. Meanwhile, a recent CoinGape market analysis suggested that the XRP price could at least reach double digits as it rallies to $10 . Fundamentals such as the RLUSD stablecoin and other Ripple partnerships support such a bullish outlook. Such a price surge could also happen if the incoming SEC Chair Paul Atkins drops the Commission’s case against Ripple. The Ripple has undoubtedly had a negative impact on the coin’s price. What To Expect In The Short-Term In another X post , Egrag Crypto also discussed what to expect from the XRP price in the short term. The analyst stated that everything is just noise until one of these two things happens for XRP. First, he highlighted $2 as one of the key levels to watch. The analyst remarked that a confirmed break below that target would send the crypto toward the lower targets. On the other hand, the analyst stated that a break above $2.65 would cause the fireworks to “ignite.” Simply put, a break above this level would lead to a bullish continuation.

Ishiba Hesitant On Bitcoin Reserve Plans While some policymakers in Japan are advocating for the country to follow the lead of nations like the United States in exploring cryptocurrency reserves, Ishiba has expressed reservations, citing a lack of sufficient information to make an informed decision. The idea of a national Bitcoin reserve in Japan gained momentum after Satoshi Hamada, a member of the Japanese House of Councilors from the Party to Protect the People from NHK, floated the proposal during recent parliamentary discussions. Hamada argued that Japan should explore diversifying its foreign exchange reserves by including crypto assets like Bitcoin, in line with what is reportedly being discussed in the US. Hamada stated: I think Japan should follow the example of the United States and consider turning some of its foreign exchange reserves into crypto assets such as Bitcoin. Responding, the Japanese Prime Minister said that his government simply lacks enough information about the US and other countries’ plans for a strategic Bitcoin reserve. As a result, Japan cannot commit to creating a BTC reserve just yet. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Reserve Will Push Price Above $1 Million, Expert Predicts Ishiba reportedly said that he does not have enough understanding of the “movements” taken by the US with regard to establishing a Bitcoin reserve. He concluded, saying that “it is difficult for the government to express its views.” Further, with regard to the idea of converting some of its foreign exchange reserves into digital assets such as BTC, Ishiba cleared the air saying cryptocurrencies do not fall under the foreign exchange category. A Strategic Reserve May Shoot Up Bitcoin’s Price Earlier this month, Federal Reserve (Fed) Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated that the Fed itself cannot hold Bitcoin. However, reports suggest that the incoming administration under Republican president-elect Donald Trump may push forward with plans to establish a Bitcoin reserve. The Bitcoin Act of 2024, introduced by pro-crypto American Senator Cynthia Lummis, advocates for the US Treasury and Federal Reserve to acquire 200,000 BTC annually over five years, ultimately amassing one million BTC. Such a move could significantly impact the cryptocurrency market by reducing Bitcoin’s circulating supply, potentially driving up its price. Related Reading: US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Could Push Price To $500,000: Expert Bitcoin price can go even higher if other countries around the world create their own BTC reserves, culminating in an unofficial international race among nations to accumulate as much BTC as they can. The world is already seeing nations attempting to add BTC to their treasury reserves. Recently, SkyBridge Capital Founder and Managing Partner, Anthony Scaramucci, stated that if the US goes ahead with its plans of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve, there is no way that China will not create one of its own. At press time, BTC trades at $95,503, down 3.3% in the past 24 hours.

What is this technology about, and how does DePIN work? Table of Contents What is DePIN and why does blockchain need it? What are the DePIN options? Advantages and disadvantages of DePIN Looking to the future: What will happen to DePIN in five years? Theoretical studies in cryptocurrencies have long predicted that encryption tools currently implemented in the blockchain will be used on the Internet and impact the physical world sooner or later. Nick Szabo noted at the end of the 20th century that smart contracts can automatically manage physical objects. More than 25 years have passed, and the blockchain is firmly embedded in our lives. This is primarily due to cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to break records and is supported by significant physical infrastructure. At first glance, this confirms an actual physical presence in our world. However, the boundaries of decentralized technologies continue to expand with the advent of solutions such as DePIN. What is DePIN and why does blockchain need it? DePIN meaning a Decentralized physical infrastructure network. Blockchain participants use a public ledger and cryptocurrency to build and maintain specific, real-world infrastructure projects. Simply speaking, DePIN involves using DePIN blockchain to run and sustain decentralized networks of equipment that can serve a common purpose. This enables the network to be built on decentralized, horizontal connections rather than the hierarchical approach typically seen with large infrastructure projects such as bridges or roads. Building and managing physical infrastructure networks is expensive and complex, so historically, they have been the domain of large corporations or governments with capital and resources. In contrast, DePIN encourages voluntary cooperation among participants. People can participate in DePIN networks by using their own hardware or purchasing specialized hardware for specific tasks. Options range from simple hard drives to weather stations. However, DePINs are typically built around capabilities that are available to the general public. Max Thake, co-founder of peaq, explained crypto.news that DePIN uses tokens to incentivize people to use connected hardware to offer services to other people: “Let’s imagine a smartphone-focused DePIN like Roam Network. The smartphones, owned by regular people, are the hardware component, the data on local connection quality they gather is the goods. Telecom companies looking to improve their services buy this data on a Web3 marketplace, which is where the smart contracts come into play, enabling the value exchange between the supply and demand sides.” Max Thake, co-founder of peaq You might also like: DePIN early-stage fundraising has grown 296% YoY: Messari What are the DePIN options? There are two types of DePINs: Physical Resource Networks (PRN) and Digital Resource Networks (DRN). PRNs are decentralized networks where providers give hardware resources (such as sensors or internet access), and these resources are tied to a specific location. Their contribution to the network is location-dependent, therefore they are not interchangeable. DRNs are networks where providers provide resources determined by their function, not location. Here, location does not matter. Examples of such resources include computing power, bandwidth, and storage. DePIN Sector Map | Source: Messari Advantages and disadvantages of DePIN DePIN can theoretically wholly transform how we manage and interact with physical infrastructure. Using blockchain and smart contracts , this model increases the efficiency and transparency of systems, allowing the community to make decisions independently. DePIN can be considered a kind of “industrial DAO ,” where all participants have equal opportunities and ensure the independence of the infrastructure. The system is flexible and can be scaled horizontally. With the successful attraction of motivated users, the creation of a decentralized physical infrastructure can be significantly accelerated. The pricing model in DePIN crypto systems is also considered more accessible and fair since infrastructure assets are publicly owned, and the cost of services is determined not by the company’s benefits but by availability. Rewarding participants in the form of tokens allows users to receive regular passive income with the benefit of society. However, significant disadvantages should be considered: Vulnerability to hacks and errors. High volatility of tokens. There is a need for technical knowledge to maintain a decentralized infrastructure. Nevertheless, with DePIN, blockchain powers real-world DePIN use cases and value exchanges, it is inherently linked to real-world supply and demand, which makes this segment uniquely positioned for sustainable, healthy growth. “People won’t stop using navigation apps, ordering food, or using the Web because Bitcoin took a dive. DePIN merges web3 with real value instead of speculation and offers it a chance to live up to its promise of changing the world.” Looking to the future: What will happen to DePIN in five years? According to Messari analysts, in 2023, the DePIN ecosystem grew to more than 650 projects, and the number of nodes increased by 600,000. Researchers noted the main trends in the development of DePIN in 2024. Experts believe meme tokens will contribute to massively adopting projects like the BONK airdrop for Solana Saga smartphone users. Analysts also consider Asia to be the region with the most significant potential for the rapid development of decentralized infrastructure, expecting that some of the most influential projects in the sector will appear here from 2024 to 2025. The first development in the DePIN field appeared about ten years ago. During this time, the number of projects increased significantly. The sector’s market capitalization is more than $20 billion, excluding RWA and blockchain oracles, according to experts from Messari. Source: Messari Speaking about the future of DePIN, Thake expects it to become an industry staple alongside the entire supporting stack, from DePIN-crowdsourced data for training models to decentralized compute and Web3 federated learning markets for AI agents. “Some of the most exciting implementations of the DePIN model will be in the energy industry, especially when it comes to green energy, which requires flexible and decentralized grids, while most old-school ones follow the centralized model. People will soon earn by harvesting solar energy and contributing to the power grid.” However, DePIN projects are not yet popular even among participants in the cryptocurrency industry, let alone the widespread adoption of the concept. Implementing decentralized infrastructure may take time since DePIN faces problems that must be solved. However, experts are confident that this system will play a key role in shaping the future and changing the principles of operation of physical infrastructure.

Musk Fuks Santa (MUSKFSAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKFSAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Fuks Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Fuks Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Fuks Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Fuks Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Fuks Santa by entering its contract address – G8EuXY9hVUyUGG7wUDqTAsh4cHeoLraJBL8dbvewPB3G – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKFSAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-26 22:05:00
