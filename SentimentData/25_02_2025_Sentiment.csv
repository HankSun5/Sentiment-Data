Following XRP’s price forecast, analysts set sights on PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a new altcoin that simplifies investment and provides opportunities in the AI and real estate space. PropiChain’s recent market listing on CoinMarketCap spells its potential for a 100x rally once it launches officially. The project leverages the real estate investment space, one of the oldest markets in the world, making a name for itself by eliminating the barriers of traditional property investment. Find out why XRP’s price forecast favors this altcoin. XRP Prepares For Massive Moves Following Its Price Forecast Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared in a post on X that XRP was preparing for a possible breakout from its ascending triangle. The analyst shared that if XRP maintained its bullish outlook, the project could experience a 26% move, and many investors anticipate the results of this price forecast. XRP is priced at about $2.7, surging over 11% within the past week due to the positive investor sentiment surrounding the project. Recently, Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) approved a Hashdex XRP ETF , which shows its potential for mainstream adoption this year. Experts predict that XRP will witness a surge of over 31% by May and analysts say that this price forecast will trigger a rally for other altcoins. That’s why top investors believe that the XRP price forecast could lead to PCHAINS massive rally. Meet PropiChain, The Advanced Real Estate Platform PropiChain is a blockchain platform transforming how individuals invest in real estate. Unlike conventional investment systems, PropiChain offers a diverse range of features like tokenized real estate, a metaverse platform, and AI-driven data. Although XRP’s price forecast has sparked excitement among many investors, PropiChain emerges as the best altcoin for long-term investment. The tokenization of real estate is one of the key features that sets PropiChain ahead of other projects. With PropiChain, you can access a variety of AI-driven tools to help you make informed choices. These tools are useful in analyzing real estate trends, rental income, and market fluctuations to ensure that you make the most of your investment. The PropiChain project offers easy access to blue-chip real estate by allowing traders to own fractions of these assets. So, imagine you want to purchase a luxury apartment that’s worth millions of dollars, but you only have $10,000. With PropiChain, rather than trying to acquire millions to purchase this property, you can own a fraction of it with tokenized shares starting at just $1,000. This unique approach is why experts believe that once the PCHAIN token launches, it could surge as high as $10. PropiChain’s bullish price forecast and dedication to streamlining property ownership show its potential to outpace XRP this year. Another reason why analysts believe PropiChain could outpace XRP’s price forecast is the platform’s efforts toward maintaining safety. The PropiChain project leverages smart contracts to ensure that all activities on the platform are secure and transparent. This Altcoin Prepares For A Massive Rally Post-Launch: Join The PCHAIN Presale! The PropiChain presale is in its second round, and each PCHAIN token is priced at $0.011. Already, over $1.2 million has been raised, and this altcoin has quickly become a top choice among savvy investors. Due to the influx of investors to this altcoin’s presale, over 62% of the tokens allocated to this round have been purchased. Experts believe that once round three starts, this altcoin will witness a surge of over 100%, rising to $0.023. Analysts believe this altcoin could mirror XRP’s price forecast once it lists at $0.032.

According to a new announcement from Robinhood, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is dropping its investigation into the trading app less than a year after sending the firm a Wells Notice. The SEC sent Robinhood a Wells Notice , a formal warning of investigation, in May of last year despite Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev’s claims that the firm met with the regulator over 15 times “in good faith”. “We tried to create what’s called the special purpose broker-dealer for the purpose of transacting crypto assets. We actually came in good faith to meet with the SEC. I think we met with them 16 times and, unfortunately, that was not reciprocated.” Now, with the charges dropped, Robinhood calls for the SEC to regulate with regulations as opposed to enforcement actions. Says Dan Gallagher, Robinhood’s chief legal, compliance and corporate affairs officer, on the SEC’s decision to drop charges, “We applaud the staff’s decision to close this investigation with no action. Let me be crystal clear—this investigation never should have been opened. Robinhood Crypto always has and will always respect federal securities laws and never allowed transactions in securities. As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed. We appreciate the formal closing of this investigation, and we are happy to see a return to the rule of law and commitment to fairness at the SEC.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to the post, the seizure was the result of a joint effort between SDNY and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in San Diego. A spokesperson for SDNY did not return CoinDesk’s request for comment before press time, and no further details about the seizure or any related investigation were immediately available. Uranium Finance was essentially a clone of automated market maker (AMM) Uniswap deployed on Binance’s BNB chain (then called Binance Smart Chain). In April 2021, a hacker exploited a bug in Uranium’s pair contracts to steal $50 million in various tokens. At the time of the incident, the Uranium Finance hack was one of the largest monetary exploits in decentralized finance (DeFi) history.

Uranium Finance shuttered after the hack, leaving victims without answers or financial restitution.

The rest of the world appears to be following the United States’ lead after it set the tone for a crypto-forward 2025. The Trump administration has continued to embrace cryptocurrency and is creating a favorable regulatory environment for crypto companies. As a result, financial institutions across the world are now looking to hop on the digital asset train. The latest is DekaBank, a leading German investment bank managing assets worth approximately €377 billion, has officially launched cryptocurrency trading and custody services tailored for institutional clients. Before the Trump pro-cryptocurrency run, Germany had already laid some groundwork for crypto regulation. Back in 2013, the country became one of the first to recognize cryptocurrencies as financial assets. Then, in 2020, it made BaFin licensing mandatory for all crypto exchanges. DekaBank now offers crypto services The recently announced launch is the result of DekaBank’s meticulous planning and development over the span of two years. In December of 2024, the bank secured a crypto custody license from Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( BaFin ) and the European Central Bank ( ECB ) under the German Banking Act (KWG). This licensure authorizes DekaBank to offer comprehensive crypto custody services, ensuring that institutional clients can securely store and manage their digital assets within a regulated framework. In July of 2024, the bank received a license as a crypto securities registrar for the German issuance of DLT-based digital securities. DekaBank is also not new to the digital asset space. In fact, the bank is a very active member of the community. DekaBank is the founder of SWIAT , the blockchain platform for digital securities and has notable names like Standard Chartered and LBBW as investors. Commerzbank was the first German bank to receive a crypto custody license from BaFin and the European Central Bank and DekaBank followed suit not long after. The bank’s services are exclusively for institutional investors Private buyers are explicitly excluded from DekaBank’s crypto offerings. Bloomberg reports that DekaBank is exclusively offering its crypto services to institutional investors as they have the necessary know-how, resources and infrastructure to professionally manage risks from crypto investments. A board member of DekaBank explained the bank’s position, saying, “We have the necessary experience, the necessary licenses as well as a tested and ready-to-use infrastructure to accompany savings banks and our other institutional customers.” Other companies from the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, the savings bank finance group to which DekaBank belongs, also offer institutional customers access to cryptocurrencies. Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW) has teamed up with Bitpanda to give their corporate clients access to a platform for the custody, buying, and trading of cryptocurrencies. Cooperative banks, Volksbanks and Raiffeisenbanks, under the leadership of DZ bank are in the process of developing their crypto services. They intend to launch officially by mid-year, offering crypto services to private customers. The initiative is being launched alongside IT service provider Atruvia and the Stuttgart Stock Exchange for the German Geno primary banks. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The move has caught the attention of market analysts, with some suggesting that it could be a sign of anticipated price volatility. Massive Token Unlock Raises Questions Solana’s upcoming token unlock event is one of the largest in recent memory, with over $2 billion worth of SOL set to be released into the market. Token unlocks can significantly impact asset prices, often leading to increased supply and downward pressure on value. Given the scale of this event, Wintermute’s decision to withdraw a large quantity of SOL from Binance has raised questions about whether it anticipates a price surge or is positioning itself to manage liquidity as volatility increases. Potential Market Impact of the Unlock Event Large token unlocks can have varied effects on the market. In some cases, they lead to a sell-off as early investors or project teams liquidate their holdings. However, if market demand is strong, the additional supply can be absorbed without significantly affecting prices. Solana has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in recent months, rebounding from its 2022 lows and reclaiming a strong position in the market. Investors are now closely watching whether the upcoming unlock will be met with buying interest or lead to a short-term correction. Wintermute’s Role in Market Liquidity As a market maker, Wintermute plays a crucial role in maintaining liquidity and facilitating trading across exchanges. Its decision to move SOL off Binance could indicate preparations for increased trading activity or plans to deploy liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Historically, market makers have used large-scale token unlocks as opportunities to profit from price movements, whether through short-term trading strategies or arbitrage across different platforms. Broader Implications for Solana’s Ecosystem The Solana ecosystem has been growing rapidly, with a surge in decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and DeFi platforms utilizing its blockchain. While the token unlock represents a potential challenge in terms of market dynamics, strong adoption and institutional interest in Solana could help mitigate any negative effects. Some analysts believe that if Solana can maintain its momentum despite the unlock, it could reinforce confidence in its long-term growth. Others caution that if selling pressure intensifies, the asset could face short-term volatility before finding a new price equilibrium. Conclusion Wintermute’s withdrawal of $38 million in SOL ahead of the $2 billion unlock has added an extra layer of uncertainty to an already significant event for Solana. While token unlocks often lead to increased supply and volatility, Solana’s strong fundamentals and market positioning could help counteract potential selling pressure. Investors will be closely monitoring how the market reacts to the unlock event and whether demand remains strong enough to absorb the new supply. As one of the most-watched cryptocurrencies in the market, Solana’s price action in the coming days could provide valuable insights into broader market sentiment.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|BNB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-24 23:12:00

ETH was last changing hands around $2,600, having dumped back to the south of its 21DMA at $2,700 after briefly hitting $2,850 on Sunday. The world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization remains trapped within multi-week ranges, as it continues to experience elevated sell pressure as it nears it 200DMA just above $2,900. The Ethereum price is now down over 35% from its December highs above $4,000 and remains stuck in a medium-term downtrend. With Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader market also appearing to lose steam, a retest of recent lows in the $2,100s could be on the cards. However, Ethereum could still be a great crypto to accumulate on the dip, owing to what various analysts are referring to as an excellent “risk-reward” profile at current price levels. Big Ethereum Price Bounce Coming? ETH Presents Excellent “Risk Reward” Popular anonymous crypto analyst Doctor Profit argued in a thread on X on Monday that ETH is “the best opportunity in the market”. The big #ETH report – Why I’m Insanely Bullish: This is a long-term analysis of Ethereum (ETH). We are looking at the coming months, not a short-term hype or quick profits.

He also pointed out a multi-year ascending trend channel, and a multi-year ascending triangle formation. Doctor Profit is targeting a rally to the $8,000-$10,000 region this cycle. Fellow crypto analyst Mister Crypto also pointed out this ascending triangle structure, saying that “it doesn’t get any better than this”. Textbook ascending triangle on Ethereum.

Ethereum is heavily undervalued. pic.twitter.com/4FWHgjrkUT — TraderPA (@Trader1PA) February 21, 2025 While volatility could remain elevated in the coming weeks, with further downside likely, Ethereum’s relative underperformance, relatively more “over-sold” market conditions and higher levels of FUD could mean that ETH has less downside risk versus other major cryptos. While there are no guarantees around when the next major market bounce will come, its arguably more favorable price suggests Ethereum has a lot more room to bounce when market sentiment does turn substantially for the better again. Fundamentals Align Towards Ethereum Outperformance The crypto bull market so far this cycle has been characterized by justifiable Bitcoin outperformance. But it has also been characterized, up until the last few weeks anyway, by the outperformance of the low/zero meme coin sector and its associated ecosystem (like the Solana chain), and the relative underperformance of utility cryptos (like Ethereum). That trend could be about to flip. The meme coin market has swooned hard in recent weeks. The Trump meme coin launch and LIBRA scandal has left crypto degenerates and retail exhausted and burnt. Trump coin bagged a lot of people. A President should have never done this. Period. Down 70% from peak. $TRUMP pic.twitter.com/3jDLT8QUye — Prof (@Prof_heist) February 3, 2025 A preference towards cryptos that actually have some underlying value thanks to their underlying utility, but still have massive upside potential, could soon set in. That could see retail traders starting to flood back to undervalued utility plays like Ethereum, Aave (AAVE) and Chainlink (LINK) in droves, rather than chasing the next high-risk, lower-reward meme play. Given that Solana is the main meme coin casino, SOL’s relative outperformance versus ETH could soon flip on its head. That’s especially the case as Ethereum extends its lead over another altcoin in terms of institutional adoption. Having secured spot US ETFs in mid-2024, Ethereum ETFs are soon likely to feature staking, making them substantially more attractive to institutional investors. Whilst ETF inflows have slowed in recent days, they are likely to remain mostly positive this year against the backdrop of the positive shift in the US regulatory environment. FUD may be high right now, but ETH remains the undisputed king of DeFi and, as BlackRock’s preferred altcoin, is likely to remain a major crypto market leader in the years ahead.

Among the many emerging projects, three have stood out—Qubetics ($TICS), EOS, and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). These top cryptos to invest in today offer innovative solutions that aim to solve problems ranging from scalability to decentralized applications. Each project brings its own unique vision, but with so many different blockchain technologies emerging, the real question is: which of these is the best fit for the future of digital finance? In this article, it’ll take a deep dive into Qubetics , EOS, and ICP to help you navigate this exciting landscape.Also explore how Qubetics is making waves with its presale, offering real-world solutions that previous projects have failed to address. So, whether you’re a seasoned investor or just getting started in the crypto space, going to break down why these projects are worth your attention and investment. Let’s explore why Qubetics, EOS, and ICP are making a big impact in today’s crypto market. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace When talk about the top cryptos to invest in today, Qubetics ($TICS) undeniably grabs attention. It’s a project that’s not just about theoretical solutions; it’s focused on solving real-world problems. Qubetics is transforming the way that think about asset tokenization, specifically in terms of real-world assets. The Qubetics Real-World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace is making it easier for businesses, professionals, and individuals to digitize physical assets and tokenize them on the blockchain. What makes Qubetics stand out is its presale success. With more than 489 million tokens sold and over 21,200 holders, Qubetics is clearly gaining traction. The ongoing crypto presale has raised over $14 million, and there’s still a lot of buzz surrounding it. Currently, Qubetics tokens are priced at $0.0888 each, and with the presale nearing its final stages, there’s a real sense of excitement about its growth potential. Analysts are predicting that $TICS will see an 181.52% ROI by the end of the presale, with the price expected to soar to $1 or even $5 after the mainnet launch, offering investors massive returns. As more and more industries move toward blockchain integration, Qubetics offers businesses a seamless way to tokenize their assets and unlock liquidity. With the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the increasing importance of asset-backed tokens, Qubetics positions itself as one of the top cryptos to invest in today—for anyone who believes in the future of decentralized finance and asset tokenization. EOS: Empowering the Decentralized Future Now let’s look at EOS, another key player in the crypto market that has earned its spot as one of the top cryptos to invest in today. EOS is a blockchain protocol that aims to offer high-speed transactions, scalability, and an efficient development environment for decentralized applications (dApps). EOS’s architecture was built to tackle some of the common problems seen in earlier blockchain systems, such as slow transaction speeds and high fees. Launched by block.one, EOS has a unique delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which gives it a distinct advantage over other platforms in terms of scalability. One of the key features that sets EOS apart from other platforms like Ethereum is its ability to process thousands of transactions per second, with minimal fees. This makes it an attractive option for developers looking to build dApps that require high throughput without breaking the bank. As an established blockchain platform, EOS has already seen considerable success in terms of adoption. It’s become a go-to choice for developers aiming to build dApps and smart contracts, and it’s positioning itself as a leader in blockchain scalability. The introduction of tools like EOSIO, a software that enables businesses to launch custom blockchains, further strengthens its market position. Investing in EOS means betting on a project with real-world utility and proven technology. As one of the top cryptos to invest in today, EOS continues to evolve, and its strong developer community is a testament to its growing influence in the blockchain space. Internet Computer Protocol (ICP): The Blockchain for the Web Next up is Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), a project that’s aiming to reimagine how to interact with the internet itself. ICP’s ambitious goal is to create an entirely decentralized internet where applications can run directly on the blockchain, removing the need for centralized servers and traditional cloud services. The project is led by the DFINITY Foundation and seeks to build a new kind of global cloud computing system. Internet Computer stands out by bringing smart contract execution to an entirely new level, allowing developers to build decentralized applications that are much more efficient and scalable than what’s possible on other blockchains. ICP integrates its own version of WebAssembly to provide faster execution times for decentralized apps, which makes it a more practical solution for everyday use cases. What’s particularly exciting about ICP is its potential to drive the next generation of decentralized internet infrastructure. Unlike traditional cloud services, where data is hosted by a few major corporations, ICP promises a more distributed model, making the internet more secure and resilient. This vision of a decentralized web has captured the imagination of many, and it’s no surprise that ICP is considered one of the top cryptos to invest in today. However, ICP is not without its challenges. Despite the excitement, the project has faced some volatility in its price since its launch. But for long-term investors who believe in the vision of a decentralized internet, ICP presents a fascinating opportunity for future growth. Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace: A Deeper Dive into Qubetics’ Vision Now look at Qubetics, EOS, and ICP as some of the top cryptos to invest in today, let’s focus on one of the most exciting aspects of Qubetics—its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace. Tokenization has become a buzzword in the crypto space, and for good reason. It allows tangible assets—whether they’re real estate, art, or even commodities—to be digitized and represented as tokens on the blockchain. Qubetics is streamlining this process, making it easier for businesses and individuals to tokenize their assets in a secure and efficient way.

Per the South Korean media outlets Gukje News and Sky E Daily , officers at the Busan Main Customs Office said they had arrested a man and a woman, both of whom are aged “in their twenties.” The officials do not believe the duo know one another. However, they suspect that both were recruited by the same “drug lord” via a Telegram open channel. South Korean Customs Officers: Drug Lord Paid Smugglers in Crypto The customs office said it had charged the pair with violations of the Narcotics Control Act. A Korean-language Telegram open channel that South Korean customs officials think a ‘drug lord’ used to recruit smugglers as ‘part-time workers.’ (Source: Busan Main Customs Office) Officials think the Telegram channel operator “advertised” on the platform, calling the “opportunity” a “high-paying part-time job.” In total, officials said the duo smuggled over 7kg worth of narcotics into the country. They may also have been involved in distributing narcotics to drug users or local dealers in South Korea. In one instance, one of the suspected “drug smugglers” was been accused of “attempting to import at least 700g of highly concentrated liquid marijuana” into the nation from the United States via South Korea’s Incheon International Airport. The same individual also reportedly “received” 4.5kg of synthetic marijuana from Vietnam. The other individual also imported 1.2kg of synthetic marijuana from Vietnam and then helped “distribute it” to buyers in multiple cities including Suwon. Narcotics seized by Busan-based customs officers. (Source: Busan Main Customs Office) Telegram Open Channel Used as Recruitment Platform, Say Officials Officers added that the “drug lord mastermind” gave the duo “specific instructions” via Telegram chats. The mastermind reportedly paid the two individuals crypto via an “unregistered crypto exchange ” that made payments “difficult to trace.” Officers said they had worked on the case with the Gyeonggi Southern Provincial Police Agency and other law enforcement services. A Busan Customs official told reporters that drug dealers were preying on “young people who are familiar with” social media platforms and crypto.

That is how they turned small investments into massive fortunes with ETH and SOL. After riding the waves of growth with these giants, they’re now shifting their profits into this low cap crypto, RCO Finance , aiming to replicate the same success. They know the cycle: identify an undervalued gem before the masses, accumulate before the surge, and watch your profits flow in. With RCOF’s groundbreaking AI-driven trading and real-world use cases, they see another golden opportunity and they’re taking it. Let’s break down why. Solana and Ethereum Are Stalling While Investors Look Elsewhere Two of its biggest giants in the crypto market, Solana and Ethereum, are struggling to push higher. Solana , which saw an incredible rally over the last few months, recently dipped below its $175 support, sparking concerns of a deeper correction. Bulls attempted to reclaim lost ground, but resistance at $175 has turned into a barrier, keeping the price suppressed. If this level holds, SOL risks sliding further to $155 or even $133, as sellers continue to dominate. Ethereum isn't faring much better. It has been hovering below the key $2,850 level for days, unable to mount a convincing recovery. Although support at $2,500 has held firm, buyers are yet to regain control. If ETH cannot push above the downtrend line, the risk of dropping to $2,400 or even $2,300 remains. Whales who once fueled these coins’ parabolic rise are looking for fresh opportunities, and the lack of upward momentum is causing them to reallocate their funds elsewhere. This is why they’re pouring millions into RCO Finance before it blows up. RCO Finance Is a Game Changer Unlike Solana and Ethereum, which are mature assets with slower growth, RCOF is at the beginning of its journey; offering both real-world utility and the kind of explosive potential that made early ETH and SOL investors millionaires. RCO Finance is a revolutionary AI-powered investment ecosystem designed to remove guesswork from crypto trading. The centerpiece of this ecosystem is the Robo Advisor, a next-generation AI tool that scans the market in real-time to provide precise entry and exit points. Just recently, we saw the TRUMP token explode by 100x within hours. While most traders only jumped in late, the RCO Finance Robo Advisor would have detected its early momentum, analyzing price action, social media trends, and institutional movements, to alert users before the surge. But the AI doesn’t just identify winners; it also protects your portfolio from losses. If a coin in your portfolio suddenly shows signs of a breakdown, the Robo Advisor can trigger automated alerts or even execute trades, ensuring you don’t ride an asset all the way down. And it learns. Over time, its machine-learning algorithms improve, adapting to market conditions and refining predictions. But RCO Finance doesn’t stop at AI-powered trading. The project unlocks an unparalleled level of diversification, offering more than 120,000 investment options. Users can allocate capital across stocks, ETFs, bonds, and even tokenized real estate, all from a single KYC-free platform. Additionally, RCO Finance integrates debit cards, allowing you to spend your holdings instantly. No need to swap assets or go through lengthy conversion processes. You can use your crypto for everyday transactions. Presale Demand Surges as Whales Rush in Before the Next Price Hike Unlike most presales, RCO Finance has launched its Beta platform with over 10,000 active users. So you can see the ecosystem in action before committing. As the project transitions into the alpha phase, even more advanced features are set to roll out, further increasing its appeal. Currently in its fifth presale phase , the token is trading at $0.10, but that price won’t last much longer. Once the next phase kicks in, RCOF will jump to $0.13; a guaranteed 30% increase in just a matter of weeks. The project has already raised over $13 million, and as demand continues to surge, early investors are locking in gains before the next price hike. A $1,000 investment at today’s price of $0.10 would be worth $1,300 in the next stage. But the real potential lies in the long term. With major exchange listings on the horizon and widespread adoption ahead, some analysts believe RCOF could experience a 10,000x surge turning that $1,000 into over $100,000 this year. SolidProof’s audit confirms that the smart contract is fully secure, with no vulnerabilities, making it a safe and lucrative bet. The Smart Money Knows When to Move Ethereum and Solana have cemented themselves as pillars of the crypto world, but their early days of explosive growth are behind them. Ethereum went from pennies to thousands, Solana surged from under $1 to over $200, and those who got in early became millionaires. But today, these assets face slower gains. Their market caps are massive, and 10x returns are no longer a guarantee. RCO Finance , however, is just getting started. It offers the same kind of ground-floor opportunity that ETH and SOL had in their infancy. Solana and Ethereum whales aren’t waiting. They see what’s coming, and they’re positioning themselves before the crowd catches on. You too can get in today.

Ltd affiliate has admitted to processing over $1 trillion in transactions for US customers without a license. It will pay more than $504 million in penalties. On Monday, the exchange pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to a felony charge of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. OKX, which supports spot trading for over 300 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, acknowledged its violations. U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla imposed the penalties, including fines and forfeitures, as part of an agreement between the exchange and federal prosecutors. OKX said in a Feb. 24 statement that the firm acknowledged that certain US customers had previously traded on the company’s global platform due to legacy compliance gaps. According to the exchange, the number of US clients involved amounted to a small percentage of the crypto exchange’s total customer base, and none of these customers remain on its platform. Source: OKX The Seychelles-based crypto exchange emphasized that no customer harm was alleged, and no charges were filed against any OKX employee. However, Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky criticized the OKX affiliate for “knowingly” violating Anti-Money Laundering laws, alleging it facilitated over $5 billion in suspicious transactions and criminal proceeds. ”Today’s guilty plea and penalties emphasize that there will be consequences for financial institutions that avail themselves of US markets but violate the law by allowing criminal activity to continue.” FBI Assistant Director in Charge James E. Dennehy noted that the OKX affiliate advised individuals to provide false information to circumvent requisite procedures. ”Blatant disregard for the rule of law will not be tolerated,” Dennehy added. The DOJ stated that the violations took place between 2018 and early 2024, despite OKX having an official policy since 2017 prohibiting U.S. users from trading on its platform.

Together, they launched four major Money Market Fund (MMF) tokens, tapping into the growing demand for more investment vehicles amongst institutional investors. Institutional Investors Demands Spurs XDC Network’s MMF Launch According to XDC Network’s announcement on Monday, these are its first tokenized funds. Notably, the MMFs are from abrdn, Fidelity International, BlackRock, and State Street and are now available on the XDC Network platform. XDC Network and Archax are keen to expand institutional investors’ access to Traditional Finance (TradFi) through blockchain technology . Keith O’Callaghan, the Head of Asset Management and Structuring at Archax, opines, “Providing digital representations of major MMFs opens up a potential new audience for these types of yield-bearing products that historically have been challenging for some to access.” RWA Tokenization and What XDC Network Brings to the Table XDC’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism will be utilized as part of the strategic partnership. This will facilitate transaction settlement and maintain near-zero gas fees. It is worth noting that this blockchain platform boasts of being the ideal protocol for Real-world Asset (RWA) tokenization, especially for institutions that wish to work with regulated entities like Archax. There is a general rise in the demand for tokenized MMFs amongst institutional investors. This is highly reflected in the RWA tokenization market’s financial value and current outlook. In the first week of February, the RWA tokenization market hit a record Total Value Locked (TVL) of $17.1 billion. Explicitly, this caused it to reach levels last seen in mid-January. Projection For RWA Tokenization Market In its paper “Real-world asset tokenization: A game changer for global trade,” Standard Chartered hinted that the tokenized RWA market could grow to $30.1 trillion by 2034. This forecast is not far-fetched, especially if the suggestion of Eli Cohen, general counsel at Centrifuge, comes into play. Cohen stated that US President Donald Trump’s administration will likely pull away from restrictive financial policies. In his opinion, such moves hold potential for RWA tokenization in 2025 , as it would further boost the sector’s growth.

On the flip side, analysts say the move could be a trigger for an accumulation spree amid prolonged bearish sentiments. Whale Moves $127 Million Worth Of Sol TO Unknown Wallet A Solana (SOL) whale has transferred 846,613 SOL to an unknown wallet in a single transaction amid falling asset prices. With Solana price hovering around the $150 mark, the transferred assets are valued at a hefty $127 million, spiking SOL’s daily trading volumes. While the sizable transfer appears to have gone under the radar, investors say the move could have far-reaching consequences for the beleaguered asset. A majority of traders are viewing the $127 million transfer as preliminary moves for a sell-off given prevailing sentiments. Only a handful of investors see the transfer as an accumulation play ahead of a market breakout. Solana Price Continues To Fall Onchain data indicates SOL has lost 11% in under 24 hours to settle at the $152 mark. Since the asset reached its peak of $294 at the start of the year, it has shed 49% of its value in less than a month. SOL’s market capitalization of $75.4 billion manages to keep it among the top cryptocurrencies by valuation. However, underlying metrics remain grim as it plays second fiddle to Ethereum in DEX weekly volumes. Solana network fees and memecoin activity have also taken a hit in recent weeks while the number of active Solana users fell to its lowest level in five months. SOL Expected To Slip Even Further Amid the unsavory metrics for SOL, chances for a break out remain unlikely for the asset. For starters, the Solana price descent has seen it fall below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, setting the stage for a bearish death cross pattern. MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are painting a depressing picture for SOL with indicators tipping prices to reach $109.

Monero (XMR) is poised for an up to 140% jump following a pivotal privacy ruling, underscoring its lead in the privacy coin niche. Post-mainnet, Celestia (TIA) is drawing eyes with its modular blockchain advancements, potentially driving its value up. Yet, the standout is BlockDAG (BDAG). Having amassed over $197.5 million, with its presale nearing completion and the compelling LISTING1000 bonus offering a 350% increase in coins, BlockDAG offers a prime buying opportunity. Beyond mere market buzz, BDAG’s solution to blockchain inefficiencies is robust, with predictions setting its value at $1 by 2025, offering early adopters substantial potential returns. Monero Set to Soar by 140% After Critical Privacy Decision Currently, Monero, the premier privacy-centric cryptocurrency, trades at about $220.75, marking a 1.87% rise since its last close. Over the previous day, XMR has recorded a trade volume of roughly $58 million, indicating robust market activity. Recent analysis indicates Monero’s value could climb by up to 140% following a beneficial outcome in the Tornado Cash case, likely boosting the appeal of privacy-focused coins. Moreover, Monero’s distinctive privacy capabilities continue to draw those desiring transaction anonymity, further solidifying its market stance. Celestia (TIA) Climbs Post-Mainnet Launch: Is More Growth Ahead? Celestia is trading around $3.20, showing a 2.78% increase over the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization is approximately $1.67 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $81.46 million. Key updates include Celestia’s successful Mainnet Beta rollout, dubbed Lemon Mint, initiating the launch of the inaugural modular data availability layer. Celestia has also partnered with Arbitrum Orbit, enhancing its modular data availability offerings. A consistent price above $3.50 could signal more bullish trends, whereas a fall below $3.00 might suggest bearish possibilities. BlockDAG’s LISTING1000: The Optimal Crypto Entry Point Blockchain networks often suffer from congestion, high fees, and inefficiencies, struggling to meet increasing demands. BlockDAG is engineered to alleviate these problems, and it has captured significant market attention. It’s a pioneering Layer 1 blockchain that combines blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technologies, ensuring exceptional speed, scalability, and efficiency. Unlike traditional blockchains that sequentially process transactions, BlockDAG enables parallel transaction validation, which eliminates bottlenecks and lowers fees. Since its presale, it has gathered over $197.5 million, selling 18.5 billion BDAG coins swiftly. Buyers from Batch 1 have already realized gains of 2,380%, with BDAG currently priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27. Projections for 2025 place BDAG’s value at $1, suggesting a remarkable 3,930% ROI. With the LISTING1000 bonus now in effect, this potential return is even more enticing. BlockDAG recently introduced a bonus code — LISTING1000, providing a 350% bonus on every BDAG purchase. For example, buying 10,000 BDAG at $0.0248 each would result in receiving 45,000 BDAG post-bonus. If BDAG hits $1 as projected, that $248 purchase could swell to $45,000. The LISTING1000 promotion is temporary and could end at any time, making this the prime moment to act before this chance vanishes. Key Insights! The crypto market favors those who move swiftly, and fleeting opportunities like BlockDAG’s LISTING1000 bonus are rare. While Monero’s privacy-driven revival and Celestia’s cutting-edge blockchain method are promising, BDAG is already establishing its superiority, amassing $197.5 million and delivering a 2,380% ROI to early backers. With the presale now in its 27th batch at $0.0248 and demand soaring, BDAG’s anticipated 3,930% return positions it as the best crypto to buy now . The LISTING1000 bonus is fleeting—missing out could mean losing out on potentially transformative returns. If you’re seeking the next significant crypto development, BlockDAG isn’t just an option—it’s the essential move before time runs out.

Whether aiming for quick profits or steady gains, choosing projects with real-world value is essential. Here’s a look at the best-performing cryptos to buy today, with Web3Bay leading the way for its decentralized e-commerce platform. Web3Bay (3BAY): Presale Gem with Unmatched Growth Potential Web3Bay is drawing attention with its decentralized marketplace that goes beyond price speculation. The platform removes middlemen, letting buyers and sellers trade directly through smart contract escrow services. Starting at $0.003 during its presale, the 3BAY coin has risen to $0.004562625 and is expected to launch at $0.1959—a 6430% ROI for those who joined early. With more than $1.5 million raised, interest in Web3Bay keeps growing. The project offers practical benefits, including a 5% discount for coin holders and planned integrations with PayPal and Google Pay, enhancing accessibility. With limited supply and a governance model, Web3Bay offers long-term value, making it one of the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Web3Bay stands out from projects driven by hype. Its decentralized marketplace delivers real services, allowing secure transactions using smart contracts that lower fraud risk and fees. As more people adopt Web3Bay’s system, demand for 3BAY coins grows since they are essential for transactions and governance. With major payment integrations and community-led governance, Web3Bay has strong long-term potential. Its ability to disrupt traditional e-commerce solidifies its position as one of the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Polkadot (DOT): Expanding Utility With JAM Chain Polkadot is known for its advanced blockchain network. The JAM Chain upgrade simplifies development by letting creators deploy smart contracts directly on Polkadot’s Layer 0, removing the need for parachains and improving efficiency. With greater scalability and new governance tools, JAM Chain is attracting more developers to Polkadot. Its interoperability feature allows smooth integration with other blockchains, boosting the adoption of interconnected apps. As blockchain scalability becomes essential, Polkadot’s solutions may increase DOT’s value, keeping it among the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Avalanche (AVAX): Growing Subnets and GameFi Momentum Avalanche is a top choice for scalability, with its subnet system gaining more users. GameFi and DeFi platforms prefer Avalanche due to its high speed and low costs. Avalanche’s subnets let developers build custom blockchains that still connect to the mainnet, supporting more projects. This flexibility is driving adoption and increasing AVAX demand. The GameFi sector is growing on Avalanche as developers seek fast, scalable networks, positioning AVAX as one of the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Avalanche’s affordable fees and fast transactions are key for developers, attracting many new projects. As more apps use Avalanche, AVAX demand rises, reinforcing its status among the best performing cryptos to buy today. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Building Utility Beyond Memes Shiba Inu is proving meme coins can offer real utility. Its Shibarium Layer-2 blockchain lowers transaction costs and boosts scalability, making SHIB more than just a speculative coin. With ongoing token burns, staking, and an expanding ecosystem of DeFi apps and NFTs, Shiba Inu continues to add value. Community support and regular upgrades make SHIB a crypto to watch. Its growth beyond memes, along with lower fees through Shibarium, solidifies SHIB as one of the best performing cryptos to buy today. Shiba Inu’s improving tokenomics and use cases give it long-term growth potential. With faster, cheaper transactions and added utility, SHIB stands among the best performing cryptos to buy today. Wrapping Up– Best Performing Cryptos to Buy Today! Many cryptos aim for growth, but only a few combine strong fundamentals with future potential. Web3Bay leads the pack with its decentralized e-commerce platform and fast-rising presale, standing out as one of the best performing cryptos to buy today.

This decline pushes BTC’s value even further from its January all-time high of over $109,000. Amid the bearish momentum, analysts are observing signs of renewed interest from retail investors—a critical market segment that could shape Bitcoin’s near-term direction. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Price Manipulated? Expert Exposes The Truth Bitcoin Retail Demand Slowly Recovers A new analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost has highlighted a promising shift in Bitcoin’s retail demand metrics. Specifically, the 30-day demand change has climbed back into the neutral zone around 0%, recovering from a highly negative -21% seen late last year. According to the insight shared by Darkfost, this is the first time since 2021 that retail demand has shown such a notable turnaround. Historically, periods of recovering retail demand have been linked to eventual price rebounds. For example, in July 2024, retail demand reached a similar low point before beginning to recover. Although it took roughly three months for Bitcoin’s price to respond positively, the subsequent upward movement demonstrated the impact of growing retail interest. Bitcoin retail Investor demand is brewing “Notably, past instances of recovering retail demand have often coincided with upward price movements in the short-term.” – By @Darkfost_Coc Full post ⤵️https://t.co/lvhC8JnvBD pic.twitter.com/YdBr6F78W7 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 24, 2025 Darkfost noted that if this trend holds true this time, the current recovery in retail demand could lay the groundwork for future price gains—though such changes may take time to materialize. Network Activity and Investor Sentiment on the Decline Despite the positive signs from retail demand, overall network activity and investor sentiment tell a more cautious story. Darkfost in a separate post revealed a downward trend in the number of active Bitcoin wallets and transactions used for deposits and withdrawals. The accumulation of Bitcoin by spot ETFs has also slowed, with minor outflows suggesting a more hesitant investor base. Additionally, the number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) is decreasing at a pace reminiscent of previous market corrections. Although this alone does not confirm a market cycle peak, it does raise questions about the underlying strength of current market participants. Investor sentiment has also been weighed down by broader macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Darkfost highlighted that while initial bullish sentiment was buoyed by optimism surrounding Trump’s election and the possibility of favorable US crypto regulations, no substantial policy changes or legislative actions have yet emerged.

In fact, the artificial intelligence industry has entered a state of self-regulation, which is a sharp contrast with the short leash the Biden administration afforded the industry. The Trump administration appears to be trying a similar hands-off approach with the crypto industry. In the last week alone, the SEC dropped investigations into major players, Robinhood and Coinbase. A breath of fresh air from regulation by enforcement The U.S. SEC under the leadership of Gary Gensler regulated the crypto sector by enforcement actions, characterized by unpredictable crackdowns on the crypto projects that popped up on its radar. The return of the Trump administration in January 2025 signaled a paradigm shift, and the resolution of two high-profile cases against Robinhood Crypto and Coinbase are perfect exhibits of the new era for crypto. On February 21, 2025, the SEC’s Enforcement Division sent a letter to Robinhood Crypto (RHC) saying it concluded its investigation and will not move forward with any enforcement actions. This is a sequel to the May 2024 Wells Notice the watchdog issued to the crypto RHC, which many readily point out as an example of the agency’s overreach. Robinhood’s Chief Legal Officer, Dan Gallagher, stated that the investigation should have never been opened, arguing that the company has always operated within federal securities laws. “As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed. We appreciate the formal closing of this investigation, and we are happy to see a return to the rule of law and commitment to fairness at the SEC,” Gallagher explained. Recent financial disclosures from Robinhood show that crypto trading has been a major driver of revenue. The company reported transaction-based revenue of approximately $672 million in the fourth quarter, with about $336 million coming from crypto transactions. This staggering 700% increase in crypto revenue alongside a 38% increase in Robinhood shares since the start of the year is one of many indicators of investors’ enthusiasm, primarily stoked by a perceived accommodating regulatory environment. Similarly, Coinbase, another industry heavyweight, experienced a reprieve from its marathon legal bout with the SEC. The SEC had previously approved Coinbase’s business model in 2021, however, in 2023, it accused the exchange of operating as an unregistered securities exchange. After almost two years in court, it announced that it was dropping its lawsuit against Coinbase on February 21, 2025, pending final approval from the commissioner. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase said that the SEC is finally righting a major wrong and that the case should have never been filed, maintaining that the company has always operated within legal boundaries. He suggested that the crackdown was politically motivated, saying what we are all thinking: “What changed over those two years was the political leadership at the SEC.” Of course, the resolutions of the cases against Robinhood and Coinbase relieve immediate legal concerns, they are also tangible evidence of the broader narrative change in crypto industry regulation. By choosing not to pursue the case further, the SEC under the Trump administration sent a message: innovation should not be killed by vague or overly aggressive regulatory practices. The market responded positively to the news of these developments, with Coinbase’s shares rising by 4.9% in premarket trading, and Robinhood seeing close to a 3.3% rise. The AI industry is a blueprint for self-regulation In July 2023, the White House coordinated an initiative with OpenAI, Google, and Meta, to institute standards that include watermarking AI-generated content to enhance transparency and safety in AI applications and improvements like investment in research on AI safety. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) introduced the global AI management standard, ISO/IEC 42001 In October 2024. Speaking about the standard developed in a process involving multiple stakeholders, Susan Taylor-Martin, Chief Executive of the British Standards Institution (BSI), said that “although the regulatory landscape is evolving” this standard provides a reliable framework for managing AI’s risks and opportunities, enabling innovation while maintaining governance. Without the guardrails limiting their European counterparts, American AI firms have become far and away the most valuable within the space—the brief DeepSeek disruption notwithstanding. Similarly, the crypto industry could benefit from self-regulation, by creating Self-Regulatory Organizations (SRO), which create and enforce guidelines for members. Self-regulation isn’t a new concept in crypto; a few countries have crypto SROs like Japan and South Korea. Japan has the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association and Korea has South Korea’s Digital Asset Exchange Alliance. The Winklevoss Twins, founders of Gemini Exchange even proposed a Virtual Commodity Association in 2019. With the Trump administration’s more relaxed stance, the crypto industry can follow the AI industry’s blueprint and develop internal compliance measures and best practices that prioritize transparency, security, and consumer protection. Just as the AI industry collaborated with the government to shape policies that balance innovation with public interest, the crypto industry can also work with regulators to develop a logical framework that protects customers and protects digital asset innovation. For now, a regulatory vacuum The ease of regulatory clampdown on crypto organizations seems optimistic, however, it potentially leaves a vacuum in bad actor policing. A hands-off approach removes the shackles around companies’ ankles, a sudden and unchecked relaxing of regulatory oversight could expose investors and customers to risks. Case in point, just a few hours after news broke that the SEC had dropped Coinbase’s case, Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit confirmed that his exchange suffered a $1.4 billion hack. The Bybit incident, the largest heist in crypto history, is an immediate reminder of how self-regulation could go wrong. How many companies can be trusted to ensure adequate security measures across platforms? It’s worth mentioning that the Trump administration still plans to regulate crypto with albeit with sensible guidelines. Part of those efforts is the SEC’s acting chairman, Mark T. Uyeda, commissioning a task force to develop a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets US President, Donald Trump also issued the “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” executive order on January 23, 2025. While we can already see the benefits of a relaxed regulatory environment in surging revenues and stock prices, the long-term viability of this model hinges on how well the industry can self-police and collaborate with the powers that be. Whatever happens, the next few months will be critical. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The primary reason for this bearish outlook is the current market sentiment and the price action XLM has formed on the daily timeframe. Current Price Momentum XLM is currently trading near $0.297 and has experienced a price drop of over 12% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume jumped by 120%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. This jump in trading volume is potentially caused by the shift in market sentiment and XLM’s bearish outlook. XLM Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XLM appears bearish as it has broken through the crucial support level of $0.311, which the asset tested multiple times in recent days. Additionally, it closed a daily candle below this level, partially confirming that the price is poised to continue its decline. Source: Trading View With this breakdown and candle closing, there is a strong possibility that the asset could drop by 35% to reach the $0.189 mark in the coming days. Meanwhile, during the price drop, XLM may find temporary support at the $0.25 mark before reaching $0.189. Despite the breakdown of the crucial support, XLM’s price remains above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, which currently acts as a support level. If the asset breaches the 200 EMA and falls below it, there is a high possibility that XLM’s price will continue declining smoothly to that level in the coming days. $6.75 Million Worth Bets on Short Side With the notable price drop and recent breakdown, sentiment has completely shifted as intraday traders appear to be strongly backing short positions, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from the XLM exchange liquidation map shows that bears, or traders betting on short positions, are currently dominating the asset. Meanwhile, with the recent price drop, traders betting on long positions seem to be exhausted. Source: Coinglass Based on recent data, $0.3321 is a level where traders betting on short positions are over-leveraged, holding $6.75 million worth of short positions. Meanwhile, $0.2821 is another level where traders betting on long positions are over-leveraged, holding $1.10 million worth of long positions. This liquidation data and over-leveraged positions indicate that bears are currently dominating the asset and could push XLM’s price toward the $0.189 level soon.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|XLM|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 00:31:36

The Inflation Protection Act, as it was called, was passed by the House Business and Labor Committee, but voted down by the full House on its second reading on Feb. 22. The bill would have established a special revenue account for the state’s Board of Investments to invest in precious metals and digital assets. It was introduced by Republican representative Curtis Schomer on Feb. 7 without Democratic support. The fund received a nonpartisan rejection The final vote was not along party lines, however, with 16 Republicans opposing it and one Democrat voting yea. The final vote was 41 for and 59 against. The bill was two pages long. It would have allowed transfers from the state’s general fund into the state’s Inflation Protection Act special fund by the legislature with a maximum of $50 million. The bill would have left revenue from the account in the account and given the state legislature control over the money in the account. Digital assets would have to have a market cap of $750 billion to be eligible for investment under the bill. In other words, the bill would authorize investment in Bitcoin, as it is the only qualifying digital asset. The debate over the bill focused on whether or not the fund was a worthy use of taxpayers’ money, with proponents saying it was a way to optimize state funds. Opponents called the bill speculative and risky. “I am not signing on to that stuff [cryptocurrency] and I can’t imagine a majority of your constituents want you to,” Republican Bill Mercer told the assembly. There is another law affecting cryptocurrency currently before the Montana legislature. An Act Revising Cryptocurrency Laws would prohibit the state from participating in testing a central bank digital currency and legalize the payment of taxes in cryptocurrency. It also protects mining and staking and exempts certain tokens from state security laws. Montana passed a law in 2023 to protect crypto mining in the state. The law prohibits discriminatory utility rates for crypto miners and prevents local governments from “exercising powers related to digital asset mining.” It also defines digital assets as personal property and prohibits taxation of cryptocurrency used as a method of payment. Federal digital asset fund may be created The so-called White House crypto czar, David Sacks, has confirmed in a press conference that a national Bitcoin reserve would be considered . Many states have pulled far ahead of the federal government. According to Bitcoinlaws.com, 18 states currently have cryptocurrency reserve fund proposals. Utah is the furthest ahead. Its Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments bill has made it through the House and is up for its second reading in the Senate. Montana joins North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wyoming as states that have voted down cryptocurrency reserves. Montana’s four federal legislators are all strong supporters of crypto.

Over the past month, SHIB price has remained bearish, reflecting the overall downtrend in the market. However, the token failed to sustain a consistent uptrend owing to selling pressure as shown by other technical factors. Nevertheless, some analysts remain optimistic, suggesting that a bullish pattern may be forming. If key support levels hold, SHIB price could see a 400% rally, indicating a potential recovery from oversold conditions. Shiba Inu Price Drops, Analysts Spot Signs of a Possible Reversal In the past month, as per analysis, Shiba Inu price has declined by 29%, similar to the decline in the crypto market. At the time of writing, SHIB price is $0.00001476, with its market capitalization at $8.7 billion. However, there is a bearish outlook for SHIB in the general market recording a 9% decline in the last 24 hours. Recent data shows that transactions of above 1000 SHIB across the Shiba Inu network have reduced by over 80% in the last 12 weeks. This indicates a lack of trust among major investors. On the other hand, analysts have recognized the signs of the formation of an Inverse Head & Shoulders formation. This might suggest that the movement of the meme coin price is going to reverse in the near future. If so, SHIB could go up by 400% and its value could reach $0.000081. However, experts caution that such projections must be interpreted carefully, given the overall uncertainty in the meme coin market. More so, the latest burn activity has fueled optimism among traders anticipating a 300% meme coin rally . A 120.3% increase in the weekly burn rate suggests reduced supply, which could drive demand higher. If momentum sustains, Shiba Inu price may attempt a breakout. Technical Indicators Suggest Bearish Momentum Shiba Inu price drop coincides with an 80% decline in large whale transactions over the past 12 weeks. This sharp decrease in whale participation is a sign of declining confidence in Shiba Inu, which could further contribute to short-term market instability. As the crypto market faces broader bearish trends, SHIB’s ability to maintain its levels at critical support levels is crucial for its recovery. From a technical perspective, the Bollinger Bands have widened, signaling increased volatility in SHIB price action. The price is currently below the middle band, which typically suggests a bearish market momentum. Additionally, the MACD indicator remains in negative territory, with the MACD line positioned below the signal line, reinforcing the downward trend. The histogram also shows a continued decline in bullish momentum. These indicators point to the continued pressure on SHIB price, although the lower Bollinger Band could support buying recovery. Source: TradingView Meme Coin Must Defend $0.000011 Support The price of Shiba Inu faces a critical test as it approaches essential support levels. The primary support level at $0.000011 has become a key threshold for SHIB’s short-term future. A break below this support could lead to a further decline in the meme coin price. Conversely, if SHIB can hold above this support level, there may be an opportunity for the bulls to re-enter, and a reversal could be possible. With the broader market facing bearish pressure, SHIB’s ability to stabilize and defend key levels will determine whether the top meme coin can rebound or face further losses.

Can Cardano Soar to $3 as Spot ETF Speculation Builds?,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-traders-are-flocking-to-web3bays-4200-growth-potential-can-cardano-soar-to-3-as-spot-etf-speculation-builds/,"As the cryptocurrency sector evolves swiftly, investors are spotlighting two key opportunities: Cardano (ADA) and Web3Bay (3BAY) . The potential approval of a Cardano spot ETF may drive ADA’s price to $3, stirring considerable enthusiasm. Simultaneously, an innovative blockchain initiative, Web3Bay, is capturing attention with its novel decentralized commerce approach and a prospective 4200% ROI for early backers. While Cardano continues to draw long-term investors with its consistent growth, Web3Bay is making strides in the dynamic e-commerce domain by cutting out excessive fees and intermediaries. Having already raised over $1.50 million and sold 370 million tokens, this blockchain-enabled marketplace is quickly becoming a hot topic in the 2025 crypto investment landscape. This discussion explores the possible surge in Cardano’s value due to ETF speculation and contrasts it with Web3Bay’s disruptive market entry, positioning Web3Bay as potentially the best current investment opportunity. Cardano Price Prediction: Will ADA Hit $3? Cardano remains a blockchain with substantial foundational strength, celebrated for its low-energy proof-of-stake mechanism and solid smart contract framework. Forecasts indicate that ADA’s price could reach $3 with a regulatory green light for a spot ETF, potentially heightening institutional interest. Cardano is favored by both individual and large-scale investors due to its clear strategic direction, scalability, and increasing adoption in decentralized finance. With robust community support and ongoing improvements, ADA is a sound option for those seeking dependable, long-term appreciation. Yet, while steady gains are anticipated for ADA, early backers are increasingly turning their attention to altcoins with utility that promise greater returns, particularly in burgeoning sectors like Web3 commerce. Web3Bay: Unlocking a 4200% ROI in Decentralized E-Commerce While the buzz around Cardano’s ETF fuels market excitement, Web3Bay is emerging as a leading presale in crypto by addressing the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry. Unlike centralized entities such as Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay facilitates direct, zero-fee transactions between buyers and sellers via blockchain. The momentum for Web3Bay’s presale is strong, with over $1.50 million raised and 375 million tokens distributed. With an initial price of $0.1959 and early purchase price of $0.00456, early participants could witness an impressive 4200% profit. Why Web3Bay Surpasses Other Presales Decentralized Market – Eliminates intermediaries, reduces transaction costs, and gives users complete purchase control. Versatile Payment Options – Supports both digital currencies and traditional money (including PayPal) for frictionless deals. Secure Smart Contract Escrow – Guarantees safe, scam-free transactions. Staking Perks – Token holders gain passive income and bolster the ecosystem. DAO Leadership – Investors dictate the platform’s future. Robust Presale Interest – With $1.50M+ raised, investor confidence is high ahead of its trading debut. Unlike speculative tokens, Web3Bay addresses actual market needs, merging blockchain with decentralized commerce in a way that could redefine online shopping. Cardano’s Stability vs. Web3Bay’s Unmatched ROI Potential Investors now have a pivotal choice: stick with a reliable, established blockchain like Cardano or gamble on the immense upside potential of Web3Bay in a fast-expanding market. Although Cardano’s ETF might push its price to $3, Web3Bay offers early access to a decentralized marketplace poised to revolutionize e-commerce. With blockchain integration accelerating and practical utility becoming crucial for cryptocurrency success, Web3Bay positions itself as one of 2025’s most compelling investment opportunities. With the crypto presale closing soon, now could be the ideal moment to acquire 3BAY tokens before anticipated price increases post-launch.

Van de Poppe tells his 776,000 followers on the social media platform X that the layer-1 protocol Near ( NEAR ) appears to be carving a cycle bottom. The analyst says that NEAR is likely in the final stages of its accumulation phase before kicking off a bull run. “This is a typical chart of a standard Altcoin bull run. At first, it runs up, then fully corrects before the real run occurs. Those runs start from the double-bottom retest –> that’s happening right now. Good accumulation area.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X A double-bottom pattern is a bullish reversal structure, indicating that an asset is cementing a price floor before launching an upside burst. At time of writing, NEAR is trading for $3.45. Looking at the payments altcoin XRP , the trader says the coin has already printed massive gains this cycle and that any upside potential will likely be limited. But he also says that it is within the realm of possibility for XRP to do the unexpected and spark another big rally. “In four weeks, the price rallied by 500% on a $30 billion asset. My best guess is that most of the upside is captured already and only the laggards are buying in at these levels. My second best guess is that we’ll consolidate before we continue to go up, which probably takes time. In that sense, you still want to be buying the dip if you’re interested in this one. The question is, where? Anywhere in the lower areas of the range, so let’s say $1.50-2.25. That’s a good region.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.57. Turning to the smart contract platform Sui ( SUI ), Van de Poppe says he remains long-term bullish on the altcoin but warns that a drop to $1.50 is possible. He also believes that a 9x rally is in the cards for SUI if it manages to pull off a real bull cycle. “This has been one of the trending ones and I think it will continue to show strength… I think that, ultimately, the area at $2.50 is the key zone… Invalidation? Sub $1.50… If it loses the trend sub $1.50 –> your potential loss is 40-50%. If it really turns into a bull cycle, then your upside might be 300-800%.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, SUI is trading for $3.41. The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the fellow layer-1 altcoin Sonic ( S ). According to Van de Poppe, Sonic is in the midst of a solid uptrend, and he believes it will go beyond $1. “The new, shiny, diamond in the markets. Strong upward trend and a lot of momentum on social media. Likely not going to stop in the coming period. From a trader’s perspective, I think that you’d be willing to buy the dips… S o then the region between $0.675-0.775 is the area to go for… Targets? New highs. Uptrend is clear.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, S is worth $0.86.

As markets closed, Bitcoin slipped under $91,015 , marking a 2% drop over the past 24 hours and the lowest price this month. On the other hand, Ether (ETH) saw a steeper decline, falling 5.9% during the same period. This follows a major hack on the ByBit platform last Friday, which resulted in the theft of over 446,000 tokens worth more than $1.4 billion. Still, ByBit has assured users that it has restored a 1:1 backing for customer assets and closed the so-called “ether gap.” The attack has been linked to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-backed hacker collective known for targeting cryptocurrency platforms. After last week’s sharp declines, an attempted rebound in major US stock indices faltered Monday afternoon, with the Nasdaq closing 1.2% lower and the S&P 500 slipping 0.5%. Solana leads crypto declines as inflation and token unlocks weigh Among major cryptocurrencies, Solana (SOL) was the worst performer, plunging nearly 10% in the past 24 hours and a staggering 41% over the past month. Beyond its association with the waning meme coin frenzy, SOL is also under pressure from upcoming token unlocks in March and a 30% rise in SOL inflation following the implementation of SIMD-96, which modified the network’s fee structure. Trading at $151 at press time, SOL has now erased all its post-election gains. “Trying to communicate to folks who may be feeling complacency/denial that $95,000 is still not a bad exit price relative to where I think we could trade in 6-12 months,” Quinn Thompson, founder of Lekker Capital, a crypto hedge fund that specializes in using macroeconomic data for its trades, posted on social media. Thompson projected an 80% probability that Bitcoin will not reach new highs within the next three months and a 51% chance that it will remain below record levels for the next year. Economic risks mount as the job market weakens Meanwhile, Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, noted growing risks to the labor market in the US economy. He cited lagging real incomes, a weakening housing market, and lower spending levels by state and local governments. These concerns are weighed against a market median GDP forecast of about 2.5%, which has not improved. Dutta noted that if 2023 was about being surprised to the upside, there is more risk in 2025 of being surprised to the downside. He continued: A passive tightening of monetary policy is the dominant risk, and that has important implications for financial market investors. Neil Dutta Dutta said he would anticipate a decline in longer-term interest rates and a selloff in equity prices as risk appetite wanes. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

House Bill 1202, introduced by Representative Logan Manhart, proposed creating a Bitcoin reserve for South Dakota. The bill aimed to allow the state to invest up to 10% of its total portfolio in Bitcoin. However, the lawmakers referred the bill, which means that its progress was halted for this legislative session. State Bitcoin Reserve Plan Fails as South Dakota Lawmakers Defer South Dakota House Commerce and Energy Committee refused to move HB 1202 to the next level. The proposed bill sought to facilitate the state to buy Bitcoins using public funds; the state would actually become one of the pioneers in holding a Bitcoin reserve. But the lawmakers made it difficult for the process by voting to take the bill to the next stage after 40 days which brought an end to it for the year. The bill was introduced by Representative Logan Manhart and he plans to propose the bill during the next year 2026. The deferral reflects concerns about regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and the risks associated with using public funds for crypto investments. Despite these concerns, Bitcoin reserve proposals continue to emerge in other states, indicating ongoing interest in integrating digital assets into public investment strategies. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Strategy continues to gain traction with institutional adoption as Michael Saylor’s firm expands its holdings. MicroStrategy, now rebranded as Strategy, has nearly 500,000 BTC after its latest $2 billion purchase. Concerns Over Volatility and Regulation The primary concerns cited for deferring HB 1202 were Bitcoin’s price volatility and the lack of clear federal regulations. Opponents of the bill argued that investing in a highly fluctuating asset could expose public funds to financial risk. The unpredictability of Bitcoin prices made some lawmakers hesitant to approve the allocation of taxpayer money toward a digital asset. Moreover, crypto regulation uncertainty at both the state and federal levels also played a role in the bill’s stagnation. With the legal landscape surrounding Bitcoin reserves still evolving, lawmakers expressed caution about moving forward without clearer guidelines. The deferral follows similar rejections in other states, such as North Dakota and Montana, where Bitcoin reserve proposals also failed to gain approval. Although HB 1202 failed to pass, discussions around state-held Bitcoin reserves are expected to continue. Some of the states that have started making such motions for new laws include Florida, Missouri, and Arizona. Currently at press time, Bitcoin price is at $91,824, the asset depreciated by 4% in the last 24 hours. The total market cap is $1.82 trillion with a daily trade volume being $48.24 billion and having an increase rate of 180%.

Analyst Weighs In,https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/is-toncoin-building-a-foundation-for-a-long-term-comeback-analyst-weighs-in/,"Toncoin (TON) continues to face a challenging market environment, struggling to reverse its recent downward trajectory. Trading below the $4 mark, the asset’s price performance over the past weeks has remained largely in the red. Amid these conditions, CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost has shed light on some underlying trends, highlighting that long-term investors are still seeing positive returns despite the overall bearish climate. Related Reading: Key Metrics Indicate Toncoin Accumulation Continues Despite Price Struggle Evaluating TON’s Long-Term Viability and Market Stability According to Darkfost in the post uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, long-term holders—those who have maintained their positions for over a year—are currently enjoying a 69% profit, even as short-term investors face losses. This dynamic raises questions about TON’s potential as a long-term investment, prompting a closer look at the project’s ecosystem and liquidity. A key metric in this regard is the total value locked (TVL) on the network. Despite market-wide downturns affecting numerous altcoins, data shared by Darkfost revealed that TON’s TVL remains steady at $300 million, maintaining a level of stability since the start of 2024. This resilience in liquidity and locked value suggests a level of sustained confidence in the platform’s fundamentals. Is $TON made for the long term ?

Darkfost notes that examining the masterchain and workchain can provide valuable insights into the project’s adoption. The TON workchain, a flexible blockchain layer designed for executing smart contracts and handling user transactions, has demonstrated consistent activity throughout the year. Related Reading: Analyst Says Toncoin (TON) May Be Primed for Major Recovery—Here’s Why Notably, the “Hamster Kombat” phenomenon earlier in 2024 caused a noticeable uptick in network usage, highlighting the workchain’s capacity to support various applications and drive engagement. Meanwhile, the masterchain serves as the network’s backbone. By storing global configuration data, validator states, and hashes from all workchains, the masterchain ensures that the entire ecosystem runs smoothly. According to Darkfost, the ongoing growth of the masterchain highlights TON’s structural stability and increasing adoption. These factors collectively point to an ecosystem that has not only maintained but also expanded its operational scope amid broader market challenges. The analyst wrote: In conclusion, the TON ecosystem has developed impressively throughout 2024, maintaining robust activity and a solid TVL despite a general decline in crypto market interest.

As of today, February 25, 2025, ADA has dropped 13% and is currently trading near $0.67, while its trading volume has surged by 110%. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA’s recent price drop has brought it to a crucial support level at the $0.65 mark. Historically, this level has acted as a strong price reversal zone. Additionally, ADA’s daily chart is flashing a bullish signal, as technical indicators show a bullish divergence over the same period. Source: Trading View Besides this bullish divergence, ADA’s daily chart appears to be forming a double-bottom price action pattern on the daily timeframe. This bullish outlook suggests that ADA’s price could soon recover and experience notable upside momentum. Based on recent price action and historical trends, if ADA holds above the $0.65 level, there is a strong possibility that the asset could soar by 20%, reaching the $0.84 level in the near future. Mixed-Sentiment By On-Chain Metrics Following a notable price drop and as ADA reaches a crucial support level, whales and long-term holders have been accumulating ADA tokens, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $22 million worth of ADA tokens. Source: Coinglass This substantial outflow from exchanges suggests potential accumulation, which could create buying pressure and drive further upside momentum, a trend that the price has already begun to experience gradually. Despite the bullish market sentiment among whales and long-term holders, traders appear to be betting on the short side, expecting the price to continue declining in the coming days. At press time, the major liquidation areas are at $0.663 on the lower side and $0.708 on the upper side, with traders being over-leveraged at these levels. Source: Coinglass Additionally, traders have held $3.25 million worth of long positions and $8.41 million worth of short positions at these levels.

With its decentralized lending platform, strong presale momentum, and features like an overcollateralized stablecoin, Mutuum is attracting widespread interest. As the project moves through its presale phases, many investors are seeing it as a compelling addition to their portfolios. Here’s why MUTM is gaining traction and why it could be worth considering for long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum among investors who recognize its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Currently in its presale phase, the token is priced at just $0.015. The project has already raised $1,200,000, successfully selling over 120 million tokens out of the 1.82 billion allocated for presale. By purchasing MUTM now, investors have the opportunity to secure tokens at the lowest possible price before the listing, where experts predict significant price appreciation. Many analysts estimate that MUTM will see at least 15x growth after launch, making early entry a strategic move. What is Mutuum Finance? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to supply and borrow crypto assets without intermediaries. The platform enables lenders to earn passive income by providing liquidity, while borrowers can access funds by using their assets as collateral. Beyond its lending protocol, the team is also developing an overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will be minted against collateral supplied within Mutuum’s ecosystem, ensuring its value remains stable and fully backed. Unlike traditional stablecoins, which rely on centralized reserves, Mutuum’s approach guarantees that each issued token is secured by on-chain assets, maintaining transparency and decentralization. MUTM’s potential price increase is largely driven by its utilities. The lending and borrowing features provide real use cases that will attract more users to the platform. This growing demand is expected to play a key role in pushing the token’s value higher. Additionally, major exchange listings are highly anticipated, further increasing accessibility and liquidity. The team has also announced plans to launch a beta version of the platform before the token’s official release. This early access will allow investors and users to test key features, boosting interest and driving demand for MUTM tokens. With these factors in place, a 15x increase shortly after launch appears realistic. For example, if an investor purchases 150,000 MUTM tokens at the current price of $0.015, the total cost would be $2,250. When the token experiences 15x growth, as experts predict, the value of that investment would reach up to $35,000, demonstrating the potential returns for early investors. Mutuum Finance has implemented a buy-and-distribute mechanism designed to create continuous buy pressure and support long-term token growth. A portion of the platform’s revenue, generated from lending and borrowing activities, is allocated to repurchasing MUTM tokens from the open market. These repurchased tokens are distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards, encouraging long-term participation and increasing demand for MUTM over time. As platform activity grows, more revenue is used to buy back MUTM, creating continuous buy pressure. This sustained demand supports price stability and potential appreciation, making MUTM a strong choice for both short-term and long-term investors. Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway, offering investors a chance to win a share of the prize. A total of 10 winners will be selected, making it an exciting opportunity for early supporters of the project. Participation rules and entry details can be found on the official Mutuum Finance website. Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining attention for its strong presale performance, real utility, and growth potential. With lending, borrowing, and a buy-and-distribute mechanism driving demand, experts anticipate significant price appreciation. As the presale progresses and the platform’s beta launch approaches, early investors have a chance to secure MUTM before its expected surge.

The SEC’s task force started work just one month earlier, on January 21, under Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda, and Commissioner Hester Peirce leads it. Michael’s conversation with the SEC’s task force specifically covered how crypto assets need clear and easy-to-understand categories. The meeting aimed to create straightforward rules so issuers, traders, and everyday people know exactly what they can and can’t do with digital assets. The task force wants regulations that help people innovate, rather than slow everything down. SEC hard at work on crypto regulations The task force shared a draft framework at the meeting, called “Taxonomy,” to put different digital assets into categories. According to details from the discussion, this would include six basic asset types: digital commodities, digital securities, digital currencies, digital tokens, digital NFTs, and digital asset-backed tokens (ABTs). Each type has a very specific meaning. Digital commodities like Bitcoin don’t have an issuer behind them, meaning no company directly controls them. Digital securities, by contrast, have clear issuers backing them up, like equity, debt, or derivative contracts. Digital currencies are issued and directly backed by fiat currency like the US dollar. Digital tokens are assets with an issuer designed to offer utility online. NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are unique digital assets issued by creators, artists, or brands. Finally, digital ABTs are assets issued but backed by physical items such as gold, oil, or agricultural products. According to Michael’s conversation with the SEC, the task force also discussed setting rights and responsibilities clearly for issuers, crypto exchanges, and asset owners. The goal behind creating clear rules for responsibilities is to let everybody in the crypto market trade, own, or issue digital assets safely, without confusion. For issuers, the SEC proposed clear rights to issue digital assets but stressed that companies must disclose all relevant facts and behave ethically. Exchanges also got a very specific outline: they have the right to custody digital assets, trade them, and move them between clients or other exchanges. At the same time, exchanges must openly publish asset disclosures, keep client money safe, and always avoid conflicts of interest. Regular owners also got straightforward rights, including self-custody of assets, the ability to trade freely, and responsibility for following local laws wherever they live. Michael confirmed that a major theme at the meeting was that nobody has a right to cheat, lie, or steal, and everyone will face both civil and criminal consequences if they do. The SEC task force also told Michael they want practical compliance rules that don’t add unnecessary bureaucracy or extra costs. A key idea discussed was creating standardized disclosures. Under this plan, every single digital asset would have a simple, standardized data set clearly stating its details, risks, and purpose. To make life easier, exchanges could gather and publish this data as a free industry service. Cost controls were another important topic covered in Michael’s meeting. The SEC’s plan would set hard limits on compliance costs. Issuers would spend no more than 1% of their assets under management (AUM) to issue a new crypto asset. Keeping a crypto asset listed each year would cost companies less than 0.1% annually. The task force also wants to get regulators out of the direct path of asset issuance, letting exchanges handle most routine compliance tasks directly. Michael’s discussion with the SEC also covered the idea of a faster and cheaper issuance process to bring more businesses into the crypto and digital asset industry. Instead of taking months or years, new digital assets could be issued in hours or days. Costs for launching new digital assets, currently running anywhere from $10 million up to $100 million, would drastically drop to just $10,000 to $100,000 under the proposed system. The SEC told Michael that cutting these costs and simplifying rules could open up American capital markets to far more businesses. Right now, only about 4,000 companies in America can access traditional public capital markets. If new digital asset rules take effect, about 40 million businesses—from mom-and-pop shops to mid-size enterprises, small artists, celebrities, or entrepreneurs—could directly raise capital through tokenized digital assets. Michael was also briefed that the new rules could give regular investors access to thousands of new digital assets backed by tangible commodities like real estate, art, collectibles, sports teams, intellectual property, brands, and more. They would also have access to digital financial instruments, like tokenized equity, bonds, debt instruments, derivatives, and currencies. The SEC wants regular investors to have plenty of choices in digital assets tied directly to products and services they actually care about. “A strategic digital asset policy can strengthen the US dollar, neutralize the national debt, and position America as the global leader in the 21st-century digital economy,” said Michael. The SEC explained that creating clear digital asset rules could expand digital assets beyond Bitcoin, pushing their global market from today’s roughly $1 trillion up to about $590 trillion in the future, with the US dominating this sector.

Amidst this cautious sentiment, a new price target of $86,000 has emerged, reflecting the current market dynamics and investor behavior. Recent Market Performance Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline from its peak of $108,309 on December 17, 2024, trading between $93,000 and $100,000 in recent sessions. This downward movement has raised concerns about the sustainability of the previous bullish trend and the potential for further corrections. Technical Indicators Signal Potential Downside Technical analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s recent price action has breached critical support levels, indicating a possible continuation of the downward trend. The next significant support is identified at $91,500. A decisive break below this level could open the path toward the $86,000 target, representing a substantial retracement from recent highs. On the other hand, if Bitcoin can sustain itself above the $91,500 threshold, it may have a chance to recover and attempt a retest of the $100,000 resistance zone. However, for bullish momentum to return, it would need to establish strong support above this level. On-Chain Analysis Reflects Reduced Activity On-chain metrics reveal a decline in network activity, with reduced transaction volumes and active addresses. This decrease suggests waning user engagement and may contribute to the selling pressure observed in the market. Such trends often precede further price declines as demand diminishes. Additionally, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges have slightly increased, indicating that some investors may be preparing to sell rather than hold. When exchange inflows rise, it often signals a shift toward short-term profit-taking or risk-off sentiment among traders. Macroeconomic Factors Influence Investor Sentiment Broader economic conditions, including concerns over inflation and monetary policy adjustments, have contributed to increased uncertainty in financial markets. These factors have led investors to reassess their risk exposure, impacting assets like Bitcoin that are often viewed as speculative investments. Geopolitical tensions and regulatory uncertainties have also weighed on investor confidence. Recent developments in China and the United States regarding cryptocurrency regulations have caused market participants to exercise caution, limiting the influx of new capital into the market. Historical Context and Future Projections Historically, Bitcoin has experienced cyclical patterns of rapid appreciation followed by corrections. The current market behavior appears to align with these historical trends, suggesting that the recent weakness may be a natural part of Bitcoin’s long-term price movements. Many analysts believe that if Bitcoin does drop to $86,000, it could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, and any significant pullback could encourage accumulation before the next potential leg up in price. Conclusion The current market weakness has raised concerns about Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory, with analysts setting an $86,000 price target as a potential bottom if selling pressure intensifies. However, whether Bitcoin reaches this level depends on key technical support holding firm and broader macroeconomic conditions stabilizing.

33767162,[object Object],1740450604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Crypto Funds See Massive $508M Outflow—Are Investors Getting Cold Feet?,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-funds-see-massive-508m-outflow-are-investors/,"Crypto asset investment products experienced significant outflows last week, according to the latest fund flows report from CoinShares. The report revealed that outflows totaled $508 million, bringing the cumulative two-week outflows to $924 million. These recent trends follow an 18-week streak of inflows that had accumulated $29 billion. CoinShares attributes this reversal to cautionary investor behavior amid macroeconomic uncertainty . Altcoins Buck the Trend as XRP Leads Inflows Despite the broader outflows, altcoins saw continued interest from investors. XRP particularly led the inflows with $38.3 million, continuing a strong trend since mid-November. According to the CoinShares report, XRP has now recorded $819 million in cumulative inflows, reflecting optimism among investors that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s lawsuit against the cryptocurrency may be resolved favorably . Other altcoins followed suit, with Solana, Ethereum, and Sui posting inflows of $8.9 million, $3.7 million, and $1.47 million, respectively. Bitcoin, however, bore the brunt of the outflows, with $571 million leaving Bitcoin-focused investment products. Interestingly, some investors increased their exposure to short-Bitcoin positions, which saw inflows of $2.8 million. This divergence in investor sentiment between Bitcoin and certain altcoins highlights the nuanced dynamics at play in the crypto investment space . Notably, while altcoins managed to buck the outflow trend which affected Bitcoin, same can’t be said concerning price performance. Over the past weeks, not only BTC has faced a bearish trend other altcoins have also faced their share of decline. For instance, while Bitcoin dropped by 0.8% in the past week, Ethereum, XRP and Solana has plunged by 3.2%, 7.6% and 14.3% respectively over the same period. This decrease in each of these cryptocurrencies has led to several breach of key support levels. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $95,567 down by 0.5% in the past day. Ethereum trades at $2,674 dropping by 4.9% in the past 24 hours. XRP also currently trades at $2.48 recording a 3.5% in the past day, Solana at $158 with a 6.8% drop while Sui at $3.17 decreasing 6% in value over the same period. Regional Trend And Reason Behind The Crypto Funds Outflow Commenting on the fund outflows, James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, noted: We believe investors are exercising caution following the US Presidential inauguration and the consequent uncertainty around trade tariffs, inflation and monetary policy. Butterfill added that trading turnover also declined substantially, falling from $22 billion two weeks ago to $13 billion last week. This decrease reflects a more hesitant market sentiment , particularly in the US, where outflows were most concentrated. The region saw $560 million in outflows, in stark contrast to Europe , which continued to record healthy inflows, including $30.5 million from Germany and $15.8 million from Switzerland.

Abandoning Raydium whole hog would be a ""strategic miscalculation"" for the massively popular — and profitable — memecoin factory, core contributor InfraRAY said in a post on X. He cast doubt on the notion that Pump.Fun could replicate its success if it swaps Raydium out for in-house trading infrastructure. Token investors dumped RAY en-masse this weekend after hawkeyed observers noticed Pump.Fun was apparently testing its own AMM, presumably with the intent to replace Raydium's longstanding liquidity pools as its platform of choice. Such a move would shake up the economics of decentralized token trading on Solana. Right now, Raydium, the chain's largest AMM platform, captures trading fees generated by Pump.Fun memecoins that ""graduated"" from the launchpad to its own pools. The arrangement — in place since Pump.Fun's earliest days — has been a financial boon for Raydium But it also leaves Pump.Fun out of the long-term upside of the tokens its users create. That's not to say it's making nothing: Pump.Fun has amassed half a billion dollars on the fees it collects from early-stage token launches, one of crypto's grandest warchest. Raydium is currently generating over $1 million in fees every day from trading across all its liquidity pools, not just those of Pump.fun tokens. That said, over 30% of Raydium's daily trading volume comes from Pump.fun tokens, according to a Dune dashboard, meaning a good share of its fees could dry up if Pump.Fun switches away. ""100%, revenue hit is real,"" InfraRAY said in a message to CoinDesk. But he cautioned that the market's 30% haircut on RAY tokens was ""overblown"" and partially due to SOL's own weakness. He said any pivot to a new AMM could hit myriad issues: inadequate supporting infrastructure, low demand for migrated tokens, a flop on volume at launch. ""I think that’s a real risk they are overlooking but I could be wrong,"" InfraRAY said.

Per the Russian state-run news agency TASS , the ministry claimed the consumption on the Siberian power grid was down by “more than 300 MW” as a result of the ban orders. Russian Energy Ministry: Regular Crypto Mining Meetings Planned The ministry made the claims at a “digital currency mining regulation” meeting, with Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev in attendance. Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev. (Source: The Global Energy Association/YouTube/Screenshot) The ministry credited the ban with helping Siberian power providers “avoid imposing restrictions” such as rolling blackouts. The ban came into force on January 1, 2025. It also outlaws mining in several other Russian and Russian-occupied areas until 2031. However, the ban is only effective in the winter months, when electricity demands are typically highest. Some Siberian officials say the bans do not do enough. And some have instead called for “year-long” bans in certain parts of the region . The Ministry of Energy also reiterated its desire to “create a national directory of equipment” used to “mine cryptocurrencies.” This will help it keep track of “legal” miners and assist power companies in the fight against illegal and quasi-legal (or “grey”) mining. The ministry added that it would begin holding “regular” meetings on “mining regulation.” The meetings will see participants discuss a new “regulatory framework” for crypto mining and assess the efficacy of the ban “in a number of Russian regions.” Russia's overheating economy is on the cusp of serious cooling, as huge fiscal stimulus, soaring interest rates, high inflation and Western sanctions take their toll, but after three years of war, Washington may just have thrown Moscow a lifeline https://t.co/9OWMbo1ch8 — Reuters (@Reuters) February 24, 2025 Siberia – Still a BTC Mining Hub? However, recent reports have claimed that crypto mining is growing fast, both in Siberia and beyond. Earlier this month, the Siberian power firm Irkutskenergosbyt claimed that “household electricity consumption” in the first month of this year grew by 1% compared to January 2024 figures. The firm said that the fact that January was unseasonably warm in Irkutsk meant that the rise was even more noteworthy. Also this month, Russian data compilers have claimed that the nation’s Bitcoin mining sector grew by 7% in 2024 . Russia's power grid took a $14M hit from illegal #CryptoMining in 2024. Authorities crack down on unauthorized operations, imposing bans & stricter regulations. #Blockchain #Russia https://t.co/DDxLOdJIVE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 18, 2025 Still Bitcoin-keen: Russian Miners Meanwhile, the Russian media outlet Comnews reported that most Russian industrial crypto mining “enterprises” (10%) are “still active” in the Irkutsk region. The ban covers only part of Irkutsk, although the remainder of the Oblast says that it is at “full capacity” for crypto mining. The same media outlet quoted MTS experts as stating that Bitcoin (BTC) remains Russian miners’ favorite coin. BTC, they said, “accounts for 90% of” industrial capacity. Other industrial miners focus their efforts on Litecoin (LTC) , Kaspa (KAS) , Ethereum (ETH) , and Monero (XMR) . The Kaspa (KAS) market cap over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Experts Divided on ‘Ban Success’ Claims Valery Petrov, a member of the expert council of the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RACIB), claimed that Moscow’s move to “legalize” crypto has helped the sector. But Petrov also claimed that new “differentiated” tariffs for crypto mining have also “significantly limited business growth.” He explained: “Electricity consumption problems need to be solved by increasing the efficiency of managing power flows and bringing new generators online. Negatively affecting business growth will decrease government revenues from tax payments.” Russia will hold talks with the US at the end of this week to address “irritants” in bilateral relations, Tass reported, citing Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov https://t.co/gJi31oC8a1 — Bloomberg (@business) February 23, 2025 One of Russia’s biggest industrial crypto players cast doubt on the 7% growth figures, however. Oleg Ogienko, the Deputy General Director for Communications at BitRiver, noted that official power grid association figures allocate 3.6 GW worth of nationwide power consumption for “data centers.” Ogienko said that he thought crypto miners accounted for 2.7 GW of that figure. However, the BitRiver expert added that grid firms have “approved” measures that would potentially see this figure “rise to 11 GW” in the next “three to five” years.

Lightchain AI , now in presale at $0.006, has already raised over $16.4 million, positioning itself as a major player in the AI and blockchain space. With its groundbreaking technology and strong community support, Lightchain AI is poised for rapid growth. Investors are eyeing it as a unique opportunity to capitalize on the future of decentralized AI-powered applications—offering a chance for massive returns in a fraction of the time Solana took. Lightchain AI Could Deliver Solana’s ROI in Just 8 Months As of February 18, 2025, Solana (SOL) is trading at $164.09, reflecting a 6.48% decrease from the previous close. Solana’s remarkable growth in 2021, where it surged from approximately $0.50 to over $250, exemplifies the substantial returns early investors can achieve in the cryptocurrency market. Lightchain AI , currently in its presale phase at $0.006, is drawing attention for its innovative integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Analysts project that Lightchain AI could reach $3 by the end of 2025, indicating a potential 500x return from its presale price. If these projections materialize, early investors in Lightchain AI could experience returns comparable to Solana’s historic performance, potentially achieving significant gains within a short timeframe. However, it’s important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and such projections are speculative. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks before making investment decisions. Why Lightchain AI Is Poised for Explosive Growth Lightchain AI is poised for explosive growth due to its innovative tokenomics and strong security measures. With a total supply of 10,000,000,000 LCAI tokens, 40% is allocated to the presale, ensuring early adoption and liquidity. Additionally, 28.5% is reserved for staking rewards, incentivizing network validators and participants, while 15% is dedicated to liquidity pools to maintain market stability. The remaining tokens are allocated for marketing, partnerships, and team rewards. Lightchain AI also places a premium on security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques like Zero-Knowledge Proofs and homomorphic encryption to ensure privacy and secure AI computations. Lightchain AI combines scalable AI applications, decentralized governance, and strong tokenomics to provide a secure, sustainable, and promising investment opportunity, paving the way for long-term growth and success. Invest Now In Lightchain AI For Major Gain Potential With a unique value proposition, strong community support, and promising technology, Lightchain AI is attracting investors seeking high returns in the cryptocurrency market. Its groundbreaking integration of AI and blockchain technology sets it apart from other projects and could position it as a major player in the industry. Investors who get in during the presale phase have the potential to experience significant gains within a short timeframe, making Lightchain AI an attractive opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the future of decentralized applications and artificial intelligence. Do not miss the chance to invest in Lightchain AI and potentially achieve the same ROI that Solana has delivered, but in just eight months. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,SOL|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-25 03:00:00

Martinez warned that losing this support could significantly derail any potential altcoin rally. Ethereum Must Defend Key Price Level Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset by market cap, continues to trade in the mid-$2,000 range. At the time of writing, ETH is priced just below $2,700, offering bulls a glimmer of optimism for a potential breakout above the $3,000 resistance level. Related Reading: Ethereum Short Positions Surge 500% In 3 Months – What’s Behind The Bearish Sentiment? However, in his latest analysis, Martinez emphasized the $2,600 level as a critical price point for ETH. He added that if the digital asset falls below this level, then “altseason will be canceled.” The recent Bybit crypto exchange hack sent shockwaves across the cryptocurrency industry as hackers stole digital assets worth more than $1.4 billion. Notably, ETH accounted for the bulk of the stolen funds. Despite this, ETH held up relatively well compared to Bitcoin (BTC), according to fellow crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades. The analyst pointed out that ETH’s ability to remain at essentially the same price level after such a massive hack is “interesting.” They added: To see ETH at basically the same level as before a $1B+ hack is pretty interesting. Would not be surprised it there’s indeed some entity buying back some of that lost ETH or people frontrunning such a thing. At some point the ETH likely has to get back somehow, whether it’s recovered or bought back. Otherwise there would not be a 100% cover of funds. Crypto analyst Ted echoed this sentiment in his own analysis of the Bybit hack. In an X post, he highlighted that not only did the hack fail to push ETH to new lows, but the cryptocurrency has already rebounded 35% from its bottom. Meanwhile, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader provided some hope for ETH bulls, sharing a three-week Ethereum chart that suggests ETH is poised to break out of a symmetrical triangle pattern for its “biggest bull run yet.” Altseason In Jeopardy? Seasoned crypto analyst Rekt Capital also weighed in, sharing a daily altcoin market cap chart that shows altcoins failing to close above key resistance levels, highlighted in red circles. They explained: Altcoin Market Cap is transitioning into this triangular market structure (blue). Alts will need to daily close above the blue lower high and then above black resistance to confirm a major trend shift. Related Reading: Ethereum Positioned For A ‘Major Move Upward’ In 2025, Analyst Forecasts That said, there may still be hope for an impending altseason led by Ethereum. A recent report found that ETH reserves on crypto exchanges are at a nine-year low, which could exacerbate supply scarcity and drive up prices. At press time, ETH trades at $2,671, down 5.2% in the past 24 hours.

This promising prospect underscores the growing enthusiasm for the innovative financial solutions offered by RCO Finance. But can RCO Finance truly deliver such extraordinary gains? Keep reading to find out. RCO Finance Gears Up For A Market Revolution RCO Finance is gaining attention among Dogecoin and Shiba Inu investors as a promising low-cap crypto project poised for significant growth by 2025. With its impressive features, the DeFi trading platform is also positioned as an appealing opportunity for those looking to diversify their portfolios and increase gains. Fueling the growing adoption of RCO Finance is its flagship AI-Powered Robo Advisor that offers personalized investment recommendations based on users’ goals and risk tolerance. It analyzes market data and adjusts portfolios in real-time, helping both beginners and experienced traders manage market changes easily. The Robo Advisor excels at spotting early-stage opportunities in the cryptocurrency market, such as the MELANIA token’s rise from under $1 to $14 in less than 24 hours—over a 1,000% increase.

RCO Finance is entirely non-KYC, offering traders a seamless, privacy-focused experience free of regulatory hurdles.

By subjecting its smart contracts to thorough audit by the reputable security firm SolidProof, RCO Finance ensures users’ funds are protected. This focus on safety allows investors to engage with the platform without the constant worry of risks, making financial transactions stress-free. Dogecoin Could Still Surge to $3 if it Holds This Key Support Line Over the past week, Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a downward trend, with its price dropping by over 10%. This recent performance has led to increased discussions about Dogecoin’s future trajectory. Technical analysis indicates that Dogecoin price is approaching a critical support level, often referred to as the “golden ratio” in Fibonacci retracement terms. Maintaining this support is crucial for potential bullish reversals. Analysts suggest that if Dogecoin holds above this key level, it could pave the way for a surge towards the $3 mark. However, a breach below this support might signal further declines, underscoring the importance of this threshold in guiding Dogecoin’s near-term price action. Shiba Inu Price in Red as First Major Death Cross in 2025 Appears Similarly, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has declined by 24.4% in the past month. Shiba Inu’s latest burn rate has decreased by 61%, suggesting a slowdown in efforts to reduce the circulating supply. This decline in the burn rate contributes to concerns about the Shiba Inu’s long-term stability. Technical analysis indicates the emergence of a ‘death cross’ pattern, where SHIB’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average, often signaling potential for further bearish momentum. This development suggests that SHIB may face continued downward pressure in the near term. RCOF Presale Heats Up – Don’t Miss Out! The recent buzz surrounding RCO Finance’s ongoing token presale has captured significant attention from investors, particularly after attracting Dogecoin and Shiba Inu investors . This heightened interest has led to a surge in participation, with the token presale raising over $13 million. Currently, the RCOF presale is in its fifth stage, offering each token at $0.10 . Analysts predict that upon its official launch, the token price could surge to $0.60, potentially providing early investors with returns exceeding 300%. Moreover, experts are drawing comparisons between RCOF and the explosive rise of Dogecoin in 2021, suggesting that it could even by over 1000x in the first quarter of 2025 alone. This optimism is largely attributed to its unique deflationary features, which are expected to drive up both demand and value. For investors looking to make significant profits, now may be the perfect moment to get involved with RCOF!

On the presumption that their meager investment funds won’t stretch enough to buy a substantial share, an expert has revealed a better, cheaper, and even more promising alternative. According to the expert, WallitIQ (WLTQ,) whose price is currently around a low rate of $0.042 , presents a better opportunity and is poised to rake in millions. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Perfect Crypto Investment Bet For Both Large and Small-Scale Investors WallitIQ (WLTQ) has made headlines times without number as the next AI-powered wallet-based crypto poised for mainstream dominance in the crypto market. While this has largely contributed to its popularity and widespread interest, it is also worth noting that the new presale crypto is also receiving high investment interest due to its ultra-low presale price of just $0.0420 . This makes it a perfect investment choice for large and small-scale investors seeking ways to grow their assets. Although it has employed artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to integrate its network with advanced wallet-based features, the platform also offers an opportunity to earn on the side while managing crypto assets. This is because it houses a staking mechanism and a referral reward system. Users can stake their holdings to earn rewards of up to 180% APR while also becoming eligible for token rewards and NFT giveaways when they refer people to the platform and actively engage with it. Beyond these earning opportunities, WallitIQ (WLTQ) also poses as a major market player as it allows investors to manage physical assets on-chain with a Physical-to-Digital tool while offering a SolidProof-audited network for high-tier security. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is widely recognized for its advanced AI features, which include a round-the-clock multilingual AI chatbot, predictive analytics modeling, automated transaction categorization, and AI-based fraud detection tools. These interesting features have further increased its relevance in the crypto wallet space, with expert predictions that it could potentially dominate the AI crypto space. New and existing investors in this new crypto project are already anticipating the launch of its beta platform . It doesn’t take any expert knowledge to see that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will surely gain massive traction when its beta platform launches due to access to its alluring features. In fact, this new project will soon launch the MVP (minimum viable product) of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App. This MVP will give investors a glimpse of its trend-setting wallet infrastructure by providing access to a few of its capabilities, including tracking cryptocurrencies in real-time and simulating its transaction processes with ETH and USDT. Bitcoin Price Struggles Below Weekly Resistance The Bitcoin price has fallen to a weekly range of $93,902.52 – $98,623.62, reflecting an over 10% dip from its price in the past month. This long-standing stagnation is causing BTC to struggle around its weekly resistance of $96,220. Although expert predictions from Arthur Hayes hint that the Bitcoin price will hit as high as $250,000 this year, investors are still cautious, and many are diversifying their holdings with BTC. Furthermore, Coin Eagle recently shared that the negative sentiment towards BTC is growing, which means the Bitcoin price may face a huge correction. AltcoinGordon also highlighted that Japan plans to lift its ban on BTC, cut taxes, and approve Bitcoin ETFs. BTC holders see this as bullish news for the Bitcoin price, with many expecting it to hold strongly amid its negative sentiments. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Bullish Sentiment Is Sky-High—Don’t Wait; Invest Now! Amid Bitcoin’s positive for the year, investing in BTC is a huge opportunity for exponential returns. Still, due to how high the Bitcoin price is, WallitIQ (WLTQ) serves as a cheaper alternative for even higher gains. With its strong positioning in the AI crypto market, an expert has likened its growth potential to BTC’s, implying its capability to rake in millions. According to an expert, it also serves as the perfect low-cap gem for small investors looking to scale their ROI. Invest here now before it’s too late.

Solana (SOL) is showing strong similarities to Ethereum’s past breakout, setting the stage for a potential 80% surge to $340. Binance Coin (BNB) is facing a key test, with technical indicators flashing caution while fundamental strength remains intact. However, the real head-turner is Web3Bay (3BAY) —a presale that’s selling out at record speed as investors secure early positions. With over $1.50 million already raised and 375 million tokens grabbed, Web3Bay is proving to be February’s most talked-about token. Unlike speculative assets, it brings real-world commerce to the blockchain by enabling both crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal. As whale wallets stack up and social interest soars, Web3Bay stands out as one of the most promising plays right now. Can Solana and BNB keep pace, or is Web3Bay about to take over Solana’s Chart Patterns Suggest $340 Upside—Will It Follow Ethereum’s Run? Solana (SOL) is forming a double-bottom pattern, a well-known bullish setup that could lead to a major breakout. Currently hovering near $172, SOL’s price action mirrors Ethereum’s 2024 trajectory, where ETH shot up 80% after completing a similar formation. If Solana follows suit, its valuation could reach $340. Overcoming the $210 resistance level would signal further momentum, with $230 as the next checkpoint. However, failure to breach this barrier might send SOL back to test $160 support. Beyond technical indicators, institutional demand is increasing—Pantera Capital and other major players are watching Solana’s ecosystem closely, boosting its potential. If investor demand continues rising alongside technical strength, Solana could be primed for significant gains. Will it replicate Ethereum’s rally, or will resistance halt its momentum? BNB Approaches Critical Support—Will Buyers Step In or Is a Drop Ahead? Binance Coin (BNB) is at a decisive moment as market forces create uncertainty. Trading near $679, the token is facing resistance from technical indicators while fundamental factors remain strong. A drop below $550 could accelerate selling pressure, whereas reclaiming $600 would set the stage for a reversal. Current indicators show a weakening trend, with the RSI sliding below 40 and trading volume rising amid price declines—suggesting that sellers have the upper hand. Additionally, a potential death cross—when the 50-day moving average dips below the 200-day—raises concerns of a deeper pullback. Despite this, BNB’s ecosystem remains solid. Binance’s quarterly token burns, network enhancements, and continued dominance in crypto trading all support its long-term outlook. Traders should monitor whether $550 holds as a buying opportunity or if a breakdown leads to further downside. Can BNB withstand the pressure and reclaim higher ground? Web3Bay: The Crypto Taking Over February—Will You Get In Before the Next Jump? Web3Bay is taking the crypto world by storm, emerging as the most in-demand presale this month. With over $1.50 million raised and 360 million tokens gone in weeks, interest is soaring. Each presale phase is selling out fast, and prices are climbing at every stage—Web3Bay is the clear FOMO-driven opportunity of February. What makes Web3Bay a must-watch? Unlike hype-driven tokens, it offers real utility, transforming online shopping with a decentralized marketplace that supports both crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal. Cutting out middlemen, it lowers costs and creates a seamless global commerce experience. With increasing adoption, early buyers stand to benefit significantly. Currently priced at just $0.00456, Web3Bay’s projected launch value of $0.1959 offers an extraordinary 6,000% potential return. Large-scale investors are accumulating, and social discussions are driving it into viral status. The best time to enter is now—before the next batch sells out and prices increase. Crypto is watching—will you act before Web3Bay explodes? Final Thoughts: Solana’s price action suggests a breakout could be on the horizon, but overcoming the $210 resistance is key before a full 80% rally can play out. BNB, meanwhile, is at a make-or-break moment—will its support level hold, or is a further drop on the way? Yet, the most exciting story is Web3Bay. Its record-breaking crypto presale , growing whale accumulation, and viral traction indicate a project set for massive gains. History has shown that early investments in strong projects yield the highest returns—Web3Bay’s 6,000% growth potential could make it one of 2025’s biggest crypto success stories. The chance to buy before the next price hike is closing fast. Will you take action now or miss out on what could be the year’s most rewarding investment?

ETH is down over 10% and is struggling to stay above the $2,500 level. Ethereum is facing an increase in selling below the $2,650 zone. The price is trading below $2,750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,600 and $2,650. Ethereum Price Takes A Hit Ethereum price failed to clear the $2,850 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH gained pace below the $2,720 and $2,650 support levels to enter a bearish zone. The price declined over 10% and even declined below the $2,550 support zone. A low was formed at $2,458 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,854 swing high to the $2,458 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,600 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,650 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,854 swing high to the $2,458 low. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,750 resistance. An upside break above the $2,750 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,850 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,550 level. The first major support sits near the $2,450 zone. A clear move below the $2,450 support might push the price toward the $2,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,250 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

40799381,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=681728,1740453852,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40799381.jpeg,JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon says Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E effort ‘needs to be done’,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-says-elon-musks-d-o-g-e-effort-needs-to-be-done/,"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) is taking on an overdue challenge, calling the U.S. government wasteful and inefficient as the Trump administration slashes thousands of federal jobs and restructures entire agencies. Speaking to CNBC’s Leslie Picker, Dimon refused to give a direct yes-or-no response when asked if he supported D.O.G.E, but his message was clear: Washington’s bureaucracy is bloated, outdated, and needs fixing. “The government is inefficient, not very competent, and needs a lot of work,” Dimon said . “It’s not just waste and fraud, it’s outcomes.” He added that the administration’s push to rein in spending and scrutinize federal agencies ‘needs to be done.’ Dimon: D.O.G.E will be held accountable if it overreaches D.O.G.E, which operates under Musk’s advisory role in the Trump administration, has been moving fast, entering federal offices and reviewing budgets with the goal of eliminating waste, streamlining operations, and dismantling agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. When asked about the risks of overreach, Dimon said, “If it does something illegal, the courts will stop it.” Despite the criticism D.O.G.E has faced, Dimon emphasized that the fundamental idea behind it is necessary. “Why are we spending the money on these things? Are we getting what we deserve? What should we change?” he said. “It’s not just about the deficit, it’s about building the right policies and procedures and the government we deserve.” He also said he hopes Musk’s efforts succeed, signaling that even from Wall Street’s most powerful players, there is little patience for runaway government inefficiency. Markets react to tariffs, stock valuations, and uncertainty Beyond government spending, Dimon also weighed in on the U.S. stock market, tariffs, and economic uncertainty. JPMorgan analysts have warned that investors may be too relaxed about tariffs, even as the S&P 500 has stayed near 6,000, despite months of turbulence. The CBOE Volatility Index, often called Wall Street’s fear gauge, has risen 11.5% since the start of the year. Mislav Matejka, JPMorgan’s top equity strategist, warned in a note Monday that investors are underestimating the risks of Trump’s escalating trade war. “We do not believe that we are out of the woods on the tariffs front yet,” Matejka wrote. “We see tariff headline newsflow risk as a continuous theme through this year, and beyond.” Stocks soared in Trump’s first year in office, with the S&P 500 gaining nearly 20% in 2017. But by 2018, trade war fears and Federal Reserve rate hikes drove the market down 6%. Analysts are warning of similar risks now. Even billionaire investor Steve Cohen is skeptical. He told investors last week that tariffs, immigration policy, and spending cuts will drive inflation higher. “Tariffs cannot be positive,” Cohen said. Matejka also pointed out that U.S. stock valuations are stretched. Historically, the S&P 500 has traded at a 10% premium to global markets. Right now, that gap is 50%, a major red flag. “The ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks are not what they were in the past,” Matejka warned, referring to Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Tesla. These companies drove 40% of the market’s gains over the last decade, but their influence is fading. “If the group stops driving the market returns, that would be a meaningful impediment for the chances of renewed U.S. outperformance,” he wrote. Despite these concerns, JPMorgan isn’t telling clients to sell yet. “We do not advocate an underweight U.S. position,” Matejka wrote, citing strong growth and earnings compared to the rest of the world. But with trade war risks and tariffs still on the table, it’s a wild card. Federal judge blocks D.O.G.E from accessing student loan data While Musk’s government overhaul gains momentum, D.O.G.E just ran into its first legal roadblock. A federal judge in Maryland issued a restraining order Monday, blocking it from accessing personal data of millions of student loan borrowers. Judge Deborah Boardman ruled that D.O.G.E officials cannot access data held by the Department of Education and Office of Personnel Management, halting their ability to conduct investigations into waste and fraud in student loan programs. The ruling was prompted by a lawsuit from the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), a union representing 1.8 million members. The union accused the Department of Education of illegally sharing student borrower records with D.O.G.E staffers, including income information and Social Security numbers. “When people give their financial and other personal information to the federal government—namely to secure financial aid for their kids to go to college, or to get a student loan—they expect that data to be protected and used for the reasons it was intended,” said AFT president Randi Weingarten. According to court filings, six D.O.G.E affiliates had already begun working inside the Education Department, requesting access to student loan records to investigate potential fraud. But Boardman ruled that there was no justification for why they needed such sweeping access to borrower data. The restraining order is temporary and will last until March 10 at 8 a.m. Boardman said she believes the plaintiffs will likely succeed in their claim that the Education Department violated the Privacy Act by handing over private data. Ben Winters, the director of AI and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America, said the case raises serious concerns about data security. “The data in question includes really sensitive information on a population of people who had to give that information for one clear purpose: borrow money to get an education,” Winters said. “It’s crucial that institutions like governments only allow your data to be used for strictly the purpose you gave it for.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Bankman-Fried, who was convicted on seven different counts of fraud and conspiracy in November 2023, is serving out a 25-year prison sentence . He's currently detained in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn as his lawyers work through an appeal of his conviction. Still, his account on X (formerly Twitter) posted a 10-tweet thread about layoffs, seemingly referencing Elon Musk's push to have federal employees email their work activities from the past week or risk resignations. ""I have a lot of sympathy for [government] employees: I, too, have not checked my email for the past few (hundred) days,"" his thread began . FTT, the token associated with FTX, briefly spiked from roughly $1.55 to $2.07 after his tweets before falling back to around $1.78, according to CoinGecko . Bankman-Fried does not have direct access to sites like X or email, but can send messages through the Corrlinks system, which lets prisoners in the U.S. communicate with others, a person familiar confirmed. It was not immediately clear who might be posting the tweets on Bankman-Fried's behalf. Over the weekend , Musk, who according to court documents is a special government employee, tweeted that federal employees would have to tell the Office of Personnel and Management what they did last week, with a non-response being considered a resignation. While some federal agency heads or other leaders told their employees not to respond, others said their employees should reply. It's another step in Musk's efforts to lay off broad swaths of the federal workforce at the behest of U.S. President Donald Trump. Bankman-Fried's tweets referenced layoffs and detailed circumstances that might cause an employer to fire employees. ""It isn’t the employee’s fault, when that happens. It isn’t their fault if their employer doesn’t really know what to do with them, or doesn’t really have anyone to effectively manage them. It isn’t their fault if internal politics lead their department to lose its way,"" the thread said . After Bankman-Fried's tweets, another X account claiming without evidence to be him linked a contract address, claiming he received a pardon from Trump and now works for DOGE, the government entity that may or may not be led by Elon Musk. The linked token saw some immediate trading volume, according to on-chain data . The new, seemingly fake account has a label saying ""it is a government or multilateral organization account,"" suggesting a government agency account may have been compromised and renamed.

Based on recent analysis , the price action is indicating potential for both short and long-term moves depending on how it behaves around certain price levels. At press time, Pi Coin is down by more than two percent and is trading at $1.57. Now, what happens next is crucial. If Pi manages to hold above the $1.50 mark and breaks the resistance at $1.72, it could see a bullish reversal that might push the price higher. In this case, a potential rally could take the price toward the $1.80-$1.85 range. However, if Pi fails to hold the $1.60 support level, we might see more downside action, potentially confirming a deeper bearish trend. The support and resistance levels at $1.50 and $1.72-$1.75 will be key to determining which direction the price will head in the near future. Risks to Consider While Pi’s rally is impressive, the crypto market is known for its volatility. After the initial excitement, early adopters might sell off their tokens, causing prices to dip. The possibility of a Binance listing adds credibility but also invites more speculative trading, which could lead to price swings. Predictions for Pi’s future range from $2.50 to $10 per coin. What is Pi Network? Pi Network, launched in 2019, was created to make crypto mining accessible to anyone with a smartphone, without the need for expensive equipment or high energy consumption. This approach has helped Pi gain millions of users worldwide. On February 20th, Pi Network took a major step by transitioning to an open mainnet, allowing users to convert their Pi tokens into real value like other cryptocurrencies or even cash. With millions of users already, Pi has created a unique, user-friendly way to mine and participate in crypto.

And I can confirm that being unemployed is a lot less relaxing than it looks,” Sam wrote. Cryptopolitan immediately recognized the subtext. He wasn’t just talking about jobs, he was aligning himself with Donald Trump’s administration and its decision to fire thousands of federal workers. His comments came days after Trump’s White House ramped up its layoffs, targeting government agencies, defense employees, and research departments. 1) I have a lot of sympathy for gov’t employees: I, too, have not checked my email for the past few (hundred) days And I can confirm that being unemployed is a lot less relaxing than it looks — SBF (@SBF_FTX) February 25, 2025 SBF draws outrage online Crypto Twitter exploded within minutes of SBF’s post. Questions flooded in—How did he get access to Twitter? Was he using a smuggled phone? Did someone post on his behalf? “How did this guy get a phone?” one user asked. Another wrote, “You stole billions of dollars from people, nobody cares at all what you have to say.” SBF’s post turned into a defense of terminations, saying that it’s not always about poor performance but bad management, job misalignment, or lack of resources. He even compared it to competitors who hired 30,000 too many employees and let them sit around doing nothing all day. “And we saw it internally, when a manager would get busy or distracted, and half of a department would lose its bearing at the same time,” said Sam. “It isn’t the employee’s fault, when that happens. It isn’t their fault if their employer doesn’t really know what to do with them, or doesn’t really have anyone to effectively manage them. It isn’t their fault if internal politics lead their department to lose its way.” The layoffs Sam referenced in his Twitter post are part of Trump’s ongoing workforce purge, which has already eliminated thousands of federal jobs. The Department of Veterans Affairs dismissed more than 1,000 employees on February 13, including researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, and prosthetics. Government data from March 2024 shows that 220,000 federal employees had less than a year on the job, making them prime targets for mass layoffs. The Department of Defense announced a 5,400-person reduction, with plans to cut up to 8% of its civilian workforce. The Pentagon has frozen hiring, while military personnel remain exempt from the cuts. SBF has his first prison interview Just four days ago, Sam sat down for his first interview from prison, where he accused Biden’s Department of Justice (DOJ) of targeting him and all but hinted at changing his political loyalty to Trump. “Trump had a lot of frustrations with Kaplan,” said SBF, referring to Judge Lewis Kaplan, the man who sentenced him to 25 years in prison. “I certainly did as well.” He blamed the DOJ for allegedly manipulating his case, accusing them of telling the jury that FTX customers lost everything while barring his team from arguing the opposite. “The jury was told something that was just not true, and Kaplan blocked us from correcting it,” Sam said. He also took a jab at Danielle Sassoon, the lead prosecutor in his case. She recently resigned instead of dismissing a corruption case involving NYC Mayor Eric Adams. He suggested that her resignation raised questions about her role in his trial. “My prosecutor has been in the news recently for tussles with Trump’s DOJ,” Sam said. He then claimed that his donations to Republicans were hidden, while his Democratic contributions were widely publicized. “There was a lot of explicit politicization going on,” Sam said. “Threats were made. A Republican congressional candidate was told his wife would be indicted if he didn’t play along with Biden’s DOJ.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

DOGE remains in a holding pattern, waiting for whale accumulation to spark its next surge. ADA jumped 20% on ETF excitement but fell short of holding key resistance, dipping below $0.80. In contrast, Web3Bay has raised over $1.50 million, selling 375 million tokens faster than expected. This difference shows how utility-driven projects are gaining traction over speculative price swings. Unlike DOGE and ADA, Web3Bay is reshaping online shopping by enabling crypto and fiat payments, pushing toward long-term growth. As DOGE and ADA struggle with market uncertainty, Web3Bay’s presale is moving fast, with a potential 6,000% return before its launch at $0.1959. Will buyers lock in gains before the next batch sells out? Cardano (ADA) Fails to Hold Gains: Can It Rebound? ADA climbed 20% last week, rising from $0.663 to $0.83 after Grayscale’s Cardano ETF (GADA) filing. Yet, despite the hype, ADA couldn’t hold above $0.80 and slipped back to $0.77. Technical indicators suggest weakness. ADA trades below the median Bollinger Band, signaling a lack of upward momentum. With ETF excitement already priced in, uncertainty might push ADA lower short term. Still, a sudden market shift could drive ADA back toward resistance. ADA’s next move depends on broader market trends. A recovery could happen quickly if sentiment turns bullish. Otherwise, more downside is possible. Traders should monitor for a breakout or a deeper drop—will ADA regain momentum or keep falling? Dogecoin (DOGE) Nears Breakout: Can It Hit $1? DOGE’s whale activity remains slow, with large holders maintaining balances at 24.35 billion DOGE. This steady holding pattern signals that major investors are waiting for a clear price direction. Currently, DOGE is consolidating between $0.255 and $0.288, forming a symmetrical triangle that often leads to a breakout. Technical indicators show growing bullish momentum. The RSI is climbing, reflecting increasing buying interest, while the PMO suggests accelerating price momentum. If DOGE breaks above resistance, it could climb to $0.50, $0.75, and even $1. However, if buying weakens, DOGE may test lower support, risking a sell-off. As price compression tightens, traders should watch for whale accumulation—a key trigger for DOGE’s next rally. Will DOGE break resistance and hit new highs? Web3Bay’s Presale Hits $1.5 Million in Weeks– Is It Next Market Leader? While most cryptos face volatility, Web3Bay’s presale is thriving, attracting strong interest as other projects struggle. With over $1.50 million raised and 375 million tokens sold in just weeks, its rapid progress shows that investors see it as a standout in a shaky market. Unlike speculative coins, Web3Bay offers real-world value with its decentralized marketplace that supports both crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal. This practical use case is drawing serious buyers, including whales who are accumulating in anticipation of exponential growth. With each presale batch selling out quickly and prices rising at every stage, early participants secure a launch price advantage. At $0.00456 per token, with a projected listing at $0.1959, Web3Bay offers a potential 6,000% return. While many altcoins face uncertain futures, Web3Bay’s fast-growing demand shows that practical blockchain solutions are gaining ground. The Bottom Line! Crypto markets are at a turning point. DOGE’s breakout depends on whale activity, while ADA struggles to hold gains despite ETF excitement. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is surging ahead, driven by its real-world value and strong buyer demand. With its crypto presale price at $0.00456 rising fast and whales accumulating aggressively, now may be the best time to act. By the time ADA and DOGE find momentum, Web3Bay’s early buyers could be enjoying exponential returns. Which side of the market will you be on?

The seizure, announced on Monday by the Southern District of New York (SDNY), follows a joint operation with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in San Diego. In April 2021, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in Uranium Finance’s automated market maker (AMM) on the Binance Smart Chain, stealing around $50 million in various tokens. The incident was one of the largest hacks in DeFi history. Following the hack, the attacker tried to launder the stolen funds using methods such as crypto mixing services and small deposits on centralized exchanges. In an unexpected turn, blockchain researcher Zack XBT even suggested that the hacker may have used some of the stolen funds to purchase rare Magic: The Gathering trading cards.

If you believe you have been a victim of this hack, please contact UraniumVictims@hsi.dhs.gov. — US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) February 24, 2025 The hack ultimately led to the shutdown of Uranium Finance, leaving victims without restitution.

The price is now testing $2.250 and might continue to move down. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.50 level. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.4880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down unless there is a close above the $2.50 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips Below Support XRP price failed to continue higher above the $2.75 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.65 and $2.55 support levels. The price even dipped below the $2.50 support to enter a bearish zone. A low was formed at $2.2310 and the price is now attempting to recover toward the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.7450 swing high to the $2.2310 low. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.3250 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.40 level. The next resistance is $2.4880 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.7450 swing high to the $2.2310 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.4880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. A clear move above the $2.4880 resistance might send the price toward the $2.550 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.620 resistance or even $2.650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.750. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.3250 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.250 level. The next major support is near the $2.220 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.220 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.120 support. The next major support sits near the $2.050 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

How Trading Syndicates, Scams and Geopolitics Buried Hopes for Growth",https://dailyhodl.com/2025/02/24/altseason-canceled-how-trading-syndicates-scams-and-geopolitics-buried-hopes-for-growth/,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post Today, the cryptocurrency market resembles a theatrical performance in which insiders write the script and unsuspecting retail investors play the roles of the extras. While altcoins are falling, meme coins turn into minefields and liquidity remains locked in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), institutions are accumulating Bitcoin but aren’t injecting free Tether and fiat into other assets. Behind all of this lies a new wave of manipulations involving Solana cartels, insider-driven pump-and-dump schemes with worthless tokens, the absurdity of artificial intelligence (AI) agent trading and the epic dump of the TRUMP , MELANIA , LIBRA and BROCCOLI tokens. These patterns highlight the ongoing challenges of market transparency and stability, making it increasingly difficult for investors to navigate the space with confidence. This article contains only a market overview and does not provide any financial recommendations. The current market situation The market has been moving in a pretty expected way. BTC bounced back quickly but couldn’t reach a new all-time high, so it started slowing down again. Normally, if Bitcoin’s dominance dropped, altcoins might have had a chance to rise. But aside from a few short-lived spikes – like ETH trying to break out – there hasn’t been any major shift. As a result, altcoins look so weak that memes about their collapse are spreading across the industry, creating the impression that not only professionals but even beginners have lost faith in an altseason. Most investors’ portfolios are deeply in the red. Adding to the uncertainty is the geopolitical situation. Institutional investors remain on edge, fearing that the world is on the brink of a major conflict. This has driven large players to actively buy gold, which has been setting new ATHs (all-time highs) over the past two weeks. This trend indicates that capital is flowing out of risky assets, including crypto, and into safe-haven assets like precious metals. The liquidity crisis The key issue now is a real liquidity crisis. High-profile scams, mass liquidations and hype-driven sectors – memecoins, AI tokens, etc. – h ave absorbed enormous amounts of capital, concentrating money in the hands of major players. Here’s what we see in the market. Liquidity frozen in ETFs – A significant portion of capital is locked in spot ETFs, limiting its circulation in spot markets. Retail exhaustion and regulatory pullbacks – A series of sharp sell-offs and scams, such as the recent incidents with TRUMP and Argentina’s presidential token LIBRA (which saw over $250 million lost), have severely damaged trust and reduced market activity. Capital outflows to traditional assets – While crypto faces a crisis of confidence, gold is setting new ATHs, and the stock market continues to attract institutional investors. Ongoing liquidity squeeze – Altcoins increasingly fail to meet expectations, and instead of a new growth cycle, we see a systematic transfer of retail investors’ funds into the hands of large players. Memecoins and AI tokens – After explosive growth in 2023, they are now experiencing brutal crashes, with price drops of over 90% becoming the norm. Amid this, market stability is weakening, especially in the DeFi sector, which critically depends on liquidity. Systematic liquidity manipulation in the memecoin market Just as the dust was settling from the LIBRA and KSA scams, the market faced another case of speculative manipulation, this time with the Broccoli token. Named after CZ’s dog, the Broccoli token became yet another example of how crypto market manipulation continues to enrich insiders while leaving retail investors with losses, further eroding trust in the space. Key stages of the scheme Artificial hype creation – Limited liquidity and aggressive marketing fueled a rapid price surge. Peak pump phase – More traders joined in, attracted by rising prices and social media buzz. Sharp collapse – Insiders dumped their holdings, took profits and crashed the token’s price. This case confirms that the market remains highly vulnerable to speculative strategies by large players, who exploit hype cycles to generate short-term price movements. Conclusion The market is now balancing between two opposing forces. On one hand, it has been drained by mass scams, capital lock-ups in ETFs, geopolitical instability and overall industry fatigue from constant failures and fraudulent projects. On the other hand, despite all the negative factors, the crypto market has been through similar phases before. Large players are reallocating capital, and while institutions remain cautious, they aren’t exiting crypto entirely. However, if the current liquidity crisis drags on, we could see another wave of panic, especially if arrests and investigations around Libra escalate.

Bitcoin (BTC) price hit a $90K low in the past 24 hours, whereas Ethereum (ETH) slipped below $2,500. XRP and Solana prices tanked 8%-13% intraday, mimicking the broader market trend. This waning action mainly aligns with Donald Trump’s recent tariff announcement for Canada & Mexico and massive liquidations. Crypto Prices Today: Here’s Why BTC & Altcoins Were Down Notably, Donald Trump recently stated that U.S. import tariffs on Canada and Mexico ‘will go forward’ following a 30-day halt put earlier. As per recent reports, the halt is set to expire as soon as next week. In light of this macroeconomic development, global markets are taking heat amid trade war speculations. Simultaneously, the cryptocurrency market lost nearly 5% amid this development, with the market slipping below the $3 trillion mark during early Asian hours on Tuesday. Further, the market also recorded a whopping $887.85 million liquidated in the past 24 hours. In turn, BTC & leading altcoins reacted concerningly bearish to these broader trends. Bitcoin Hits $90K Low Intraday As Crypto Prices Face Heat Although BTC price rested at $92,152 as of press time, CoinMarketCap’s data highlighted a $90,924.90 bottom for the token intraday. This alarming price drop comes against the backdrop of $271.69 million worth of liquidations for the coin in the past 24 hours. Despite its price dip, BTC’s dominance was up by 0.94% to 61.16%, signaling more heat within the altcoins sector. ETH Loses $2,500 ETH price witnessed an 8% crash in the past 24 hours and closed in at $2,490. The coin hit a bottom and peak of $2,461.52 and $2,735.15 in the past 24 hours. Ethereum’s waning action reflects $192.53 million liquidated in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data . The second largest crypto by market cap saw its dominance slipping back to 10.1% today. XRP Price Loses 8% XRP price plunged 8.5% over the past day and exchanged hands at $2.26. The Ripple-backed asset hit an intraday low and high of $2.23 and $2.50, respectively. XRP recorded $38.25 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours, rationalizing the price fall. Solana Price Crashes 14% Meanwhile, SOL price cracked by 14% as of press time, remaining at $137.19. The coin hit a bottom and peak of $136.88 and $161.61, respectively. Solana slumped as $90.60 million was liquidated in the background, bringing heat to its price. Meme Crypto Prices Today Dogecoin (DOGE) witnessed a 10% dip in value today, closing in at $0.2077. Even Shiba Inu (SHIB) lost 8% to reach $0.00001367. Other than dog-themed meme coin prices crashing, even PEPE and TRUMP lost 13%-15%, standing at $0.000007818 and $13.10, respectively. Top Gainer Crypto Prices Today Nevertheless, some tokens have defied the broader market slump today: Story (IP) Price: $4.72 24-Hour Gains: +20% DeXe (DEXE) Price: $19.11 24-Hour Gains: +4% FTX Token (FTT) Price: $1.91 24-Hour Gains: +1% Top Loser Crypto Prices Today Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price: $18.58 24-Hour Loss: -16% Sonic (S) Price: $0.7257 24-Hour Loss: -15% LidoDAO (LDO) Price: $1.37 24-Hour Loss: -15% Meanwhile, traders and investors remain cautious, reflecting uncertainty about future movements amid broader developments. It is yet to be seen if prices will take further heat, given that the U.S. import tariffs commence next week with burgeoning trade war speculations.

Even meme coins, which had been on fire in recent weeks, have taken a severe hit. Liquidity has dried up across the board, raising concerns about even more downside. The sell-off of course started with the Bybit hack on February 21 when North Korea’s Lazarus Group pulled off the biggest financial heist in history, draining $1.5 billion from Bybit’s Ethereum wallets. This theft was so big, it’s double the size of the previous record-holder, which is the $611 million PolyNetwork hack that happened in 2021. Ethereum, which was already performing terribly, got even worse as traders scrambled to pull funds out, fearing another FTX-style collapse. Even though Bybit CEO Ben Zhou quickly announced that the exchange would cover all losses, it wasn’t enough to restore confidence. Traders don’t forget billion-dollar hacks that easily. At first, Bitcoin stayed out of the mess. However, once the S&P 500 tanked on Friday, Bitcoin broke down too. The second stocks started slipping, Bitcoin followed, losing its key $98,000 support level. One major factor that sent Bitcoin spiraling was Citadel Securities, which announced yesterday that it was moving into crypto as a liquidity provider. Instead of reassuring traders, it triggered a “sell the news” reaction, with investors rushing for the exits. Memecoins collapse, Bitcoin struggles Solana, which has now dropped 22% since Friday. The memecoin sector, which had been one of crypto’s wildest success stories this year, is getting slaughtered. With Solana’s crash, traders dumped their memecoins en masse, draining the last bit of liquidity from the market. This actually started when Argentina’s President Javier Milei publicly endorsed LIBRA, a Solana-based meme coin, which quickly pumped like crazy—until it crashed into oblivion, wiping out $4.6 billion in investor money. The scandal-tainted Solana’s reputation, and now, with $1.72 billion in SOL tokens set to be unlocked on March 1, the market is preparing for even more selling pressure. According to digital asset manager Arca, altcoins as a group have already lost between 30-80% since mid-December. Even Dogecoin, which had been riding on Elon Musk’s federal workforce cuts, is down nearly 7%. Crypto-related stocks are also taking a beating, as Coinbase has fallen for six straight days, which is its worst losing streak in months. Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings, which already plunged 13% last week, has lost another 2.6% today, and Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is also slipping, despite doubling down on Bitcoin buys, per data from Google Finance. On Monday, Strategy filed with the SEC, revealing that it had once again bought 20,356 Bitcoin between February 18-23 for $97,514 per coin, worth a total $1.99 billion. This makes it one of the company’s biggest Bitcoin acquisitions ever, pushing Strategy’s total holdings to $47.7 billion—equivalent to 2.5% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. The company funded this buy with proceeds from its $2 billion convertible bond sale last week. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Shows the Way,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-passive-crypto-income-still-possible-in-2025-mutuum-finance-mutm-shows-the-way/,"As the crypto market matures, many investors are wondering if earning passive income is still a viable strategy in 2025. While traditional staking and yield farming have faced challenges due to shifting market dynamics, new opportunities continue to emerge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that passive income in crypto is far from over. With its decentralized lending protocol, users can earn rewards by supplying liquidity, while borrowers gain access to funds without selling their assets. As the project moves through its presale, investors are taking notice of its potential to offer long-term, sustainable earnings. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol designed to offer users a secure and efficient way to earn passive income by supplying liquidity. Unlike traditional finance, where banks and intermediaries control lending, Mutuum allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets directly on the blockchain. This system provides opportunities for both lenders seeking steady returns and borrowers looking for liquidity without selling their holdings. Mutuum Finance offers two lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). P2C (Peer-to-Contract) : Lenders deposit assets into shared liquidity pools, where borrowers access funds by providing collateral. Interest rates adjust dynamically based on pool utilization, ensuring stable yields for suppliers. P2P (Peer-to-Peer) : This model allows users to negotiate loan terms directly, setting their own interest rates and repayment schedules. It is particularly useful for assets not commonly supported in standard lending pools, such as meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB). Both models allow users to earn passive income by supplying liquidity, with interest generated by borrowers contributing to the lender’s returns. This flexibility ensures that investors can choose the lending structure that best suits their strategy. Mutuum Finance will be audited by a well-known blockchain security firm to ensure the safety and reliability of its smart contracts. This audit will thoroughly assess the protocol’s code, identifying and addressing any potential vulnerabilities before the platform goes live. A verified audit boosts investor confidence, reduces security risks, and reinforces trust in the lending and borrowing system. By prioritizing security, Mutuum Finance aims to provide a safe and transparent environment for users to engage in decentralized finance. There will be mtTokens, which are interest-bearing tokens representing a user’s deposit in Mutuum Finance’s liquidity pools. When a user supplies assets such as USDT or ETH, they receive mtTokens (e.g., mtUSDT or mtETH) in return. These tokens automatically accumulate interest over time as borrowers pay fees, allowing suppliers to grow their holdings passively. Since mtTokens are ERC20-compliant, they can be transferred or integrated into other DeFi applications while continuing to earn yield. For example, if a user deposits 5,000 USDT into the lending pool, they will receive an equivalent amount of mtUSDT. As borrowers repay their loans with interest, the supplier’s mtUSDT balance accrues value, meaning they can withdraw more USDT than they initially deposited. This system ensures that lenders earn passive income while keeping liquidity available for borrowers in the Mutuum Finance ecosystem. The team is also implementing a buy-and-distribute mechanism to support long-term token demand. A portion of the platform’s revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market, creating continuous buy pressure. These repurchased tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards, encouraging long-term participation. This process not only benefits active users but also helps maintain a healthy demand for MUTM, contributing to its price stability and potential growth over time. Beyond lending, Mutuum Finance is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be minted against collateral supplied within the platform. Unlike centralized stablecoins that rely on reserves controlled by third parties, Mutuum’s stablecoin is fully backed by on-chain assets. This ensures transparency, stability, and decentralization, providing a secure option for borrowers while strengthening the platform’s ecosystem. As these features are being developed, Mutuum Finance’s native token, MUTM, is currently in its presale phase at a price of just $0.015. The first presale phase sold out in under two weeks, raising $1.2 million and attracting over 2,450 holders. With 11 presale phases in total, early investors have a chance to secure MUTM at a low price before it reaches the market. With its lending system, stablecoin integration, and strong presale momentum, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a promising platform for passive income in crypto, giving investors a way to earn without relying on traditional staking or farming models.

He further mentioned that, relative to doing leveraged Bitcoin buying, the stock has underperformed. Schiff said on X that although Michael Saylor claimed a 6.9% Bitcoin return this year, MSTR shares have declined by 6%. He pointed to a dilution of the shareholders, which he stated reduced the premium on the company’s Bitcoin reserves by 85%. Today, @saylor bragged about his leveraged Bitcoin buys generating a BTC yield of 6.9% so far in 2025. However, the share price of $MSTR is down 6% in 2025, while massive dilution has destroyed shareholder value, causing the premium to its Bitcoin holdings to collapse by 85%. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) February 24, 2025 The NAV premium shows how the market values Strategy Inc. compared to its position in Bitcoin. According to the MSTR Tracker, the premium was still at 60%, down from 148% on January 19. Normally, a high premium has a positive correlation with investor confidence in the firm’s specific Bitcoin approach. Convertible debt concerns In another tweet, he also criticized the fact that the company was sourcing its Bitcoin acquisitions through convertible debt. He explained that while MSTR lost 4.5%, Bitcoin only grew by 2.5%, showing signs that the market is skeptical of the new $2 billion convertible note offering. He cautioned that if MSTR keeps trading below the actual value of the Bitcoins, it is possible to end up with a Bitcoin negative return. Schiff has been very vocal in his criticism of the firm’s strategy saying that too much debt is dangerous if the price of Bitcoin drops. Convertible notes allows the holders of the debt to swap their stake for the company stock in the future. Although there is potential upside in this structure, there are accompanying risks in case the stock price stays low or decreases. Schiff earlier noted that the repayment of its debts may turn into a problem if the price of Bitcoin declines. Strategy major Bitcoin acquisition Despite criticism, Strategy Inc. continues to acquire more Bitcoin holdings. The firm recently revealed that it has purchased 20,356 Bitcoins for about $1.99 billion. This acquisition takes its Bitcoin holdings to 478,740 BTC, worth more than $44 billion. This acquisition was paid for through a market-based equity program and a fully subscribed $2 billion convertible notes issuance. Therefore, Strategy Inc. now owns more than 2% of outstanding Bitcoin. As Cryptopolitan reported , the note is currently a 0% coupon and due on March 1, 2030, unless it is redeemed, repurchased, or converted earlier. Every $1,000 note may be converted into 2,072 shares of Strategy’s Class A common stock at $433.43 per share, a 35% premium to the current price. According to the firm, “Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $92,008.74, down 3.42% in the last 24 hours. MicroStrategy made itself one of the biggest institutional players in the market by investing in Bitcoin. However, Schiff and other critics remain skeptical about whether the firm can sustain the debt-fueled strategy in the long run.

With less than 3 days until its highly anticipated DEX debut on 27th February, iDEGEN is dominating the crypto headlines. There are rumors abound that this degenerate-fed AI baby project is about to experience an explosive surge post-launch, with possible Coinbase listings even mooted. Raising a staggering $24.6m in presale and attracting over 26,000 holders, iDEGEN has proven that traders are all-in on the future of unfiltered, boundary-pushing AI. With staking rewards reaching up to 10,000% APY and non-stop viral antics keeping the crypto community on edge, it’s no surprise a top exchange like BitMart will list IDGN on 4th March . Let’s dive into the best crypto presale of 2025. The mayhem gets worse with every tweet iDEGEN has been on a rampage ever since it was first r eleased into the Crypto X space , delivering an unstoppable, 24/7 flood of content to an audience that grows more fired up by the day. It’s been temporarily banned from the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, not once, not twice, but three times. However, all each has done is add fuel to the chaotic AI mind of iDEGEN. How’s this for a trollish response to one of its temporary bans? With every ban it gained more attention, and investors were sold on the project. Now with a staggering 2.6 million social impressions, Musk is practically fueling the iDEGEN presale at this point. New versions and a second degen-fed AI agent When V2 rocked onto the stage, the carnage got immeasurably worse. iDEGEN, which learns from every tweet it reads and every response it gets from the community, was now able to take its tirades to Telegram. That led to more engagement from onlooking investors and plenty more presale momentum, but not as much as when V3 rolled out. The unapologetic barrage of mayhem now had the ability to release autonomous video content—a world-first for an AI agent. However, the ultimate upgrade came when a second bot was unleashed. This time on to China’s ChatGPT killer, DeepSeek. iDEGEN is now terrorizing social media on two different continents. DEX launch on the 27th February The big day is just 3 days away, and the FOMO is real with this one. Early investors are preparing the champagne, and those late to the party are scampering to grab what they can before this hugely impressive presale ends forever. We’ve seen it time and again with the biggest meme coins that gains can be significant, and the whispers on the grapevine are suggesting iDEGEN is about to follow suit. The presale ends on 26th February, and all unsold tokens will be burned at launch, creating immediate scarcity.

On February 23, the hackers used multiple addresses to swap 37,900 ETH ($106M) for Bitcoin and other assets through Chainflip, THORChain, LiFi, DLN, and eXch. The firm revealed that the hackers began laundering ETH through the eXch cryptocurrency exchange without KYC. Bybit exchange had asked the crypto exchange platform to freeze the funds, but eXch rejected the request. The hackers have now laundered over $75M from Bybit through eXch and it’s still ongoing. The Bybit exchange exploiter also laundered funds via PumpFun by sending 60 SOL to an address. ZachXBT revealed that the latter launched the token “QinShihuang” (500,000) and generated over $26M in trading. PumpFun later removed the Lazarus-linked meme coin from its front end on February 23. According to ZachXBT, the attacker received $1.08M from the Bybit hack on February 22. The funds were later moved from Ethereum to Solana, then to BSC, and then split across 30+ addresses. He added that 106K USDC was later divided between 10 BSC addresses and bridged back to Solana. On February 23, Bybit froze a total of $42.89 million as part of a coordinated effort. Tether’s founder, Paolo Ardoino, froze 181K USDT tied to the Bybit hack. Fixed Float also froze 120K USDC and ESDT, while ChangeNOW froze around 34 ETH. Arkham Intelligence revealed that the Bybit exchange hacker was making 2 to 3 transactions per minute and stopped every 45 minutes for a 15-minute break. The firm also noted that the hackers moved ETH from one address at a time before moving on to the next one. Lookonchain acknowledged that the Bybit hacker who stole $1.4B in assets appeared to have received ETH from Binance as gas fees. “As part of the investigation and recovery efforts, Bybit is pledging 10% of recovered funds to reward ethical cyber and network security experts who play an active role in retrieving the stolen cryptocurrencies in the incident.” – Bybit . Bybit’s founder, Ben Zhou, said that it was not an issue if the firm was experiencing a bank run because the company had enough tokens to give to the clients. He assured the firm’s customers that Bybit could cover the hacked amount of 400,000 ETH with the Bybit treasury. He said, “No matter what, we will make sure all of the client’s money is safe, so your money is safe.” Bybit also acknowledged that it took loans after the hack to cover its withdrawals. Binance’s founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, suggested that Bybit should halt withdrawals for a bit as a standard security precaution. Hackers steal $1.5B from Bybit exchange Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit revealed last week that hackers had stolen digital assets worth around $1.5 billion, which was called the biggest crypto heist of all time. ZachXBT made over 920 addresses linked to the hack public and also confirmed a Lazarus Group connection. According to Arkham Intelligence, ZachXBT submitted definitive proof on February 21, 19:09 UTC, that the Lazarus Group performed the attack on Bybit exchange. ZachXBT’s submission included a detailed analysis of test transactions and connected wallets used before the hack, as well as multiple forensics graphs and timing analyses. Bybit exchange CEO Ben Zhou believes that the funds were siphoned from a cold wallet that was used for other tokens. Zhou also confirmed that the company’s hot wallet, warm wallet, and all other cold wallets remained secure. Crypto research firm Elliptic acknowledged that the hack was more than double the last-biggest crypto heist and “almost certainly the single largest known theft of any kind in all time.” Hacking hauls totaled more than $2 billion last year, the fourth straight year that proceeds have surpassed more than $1 billion.

Here are Top Picks,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/the-next-big-cryptocurrency-you-dont-own-top-picks/,"The post The Next Big Cryptocurrency You Don’t Own? Here are Top Picks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The major attraction of cryptocurrencies is their speculative value. The history of crypto is littered with examples of tokens that went on to mint astronomical gains for investors who bought in early. For instance, in 2024, XRP went on a 6x run from November until it peaked at Trump’s inauguration last January. Meme coin Shiba Inu, meanwhile, went on an eye-watering 40,000,000% run at its 2021 peak —and no, that’s not a typo. Not surprisingly, everyone in crypto is always looking for the next big crypto. With thousands of new tokens launched daily, finding the next crypto to explode could be tricky. Fortunately, we’ve compiled three of the next big cryptocurrencies to invest in this year. Next big cryptos to explode in February 2025: The picks There’s no way to tell which crypto will go boom. However, the trends are a good indicator of which cryptocurrencies could stand to benefit from the increased speculation. These include artificial intelligence, meme coins, and utility tokens, all expected to pump in 2025. Here are the top picks: iDEGEN : Next big crypto AI agent poised to go parabolic in 2025 Bitcoin Pepe: Solana x Bitcoin hybrid bringing memes to the OG crypto chain Vine: Meme coin centered around Vine nostalgia takes off iDEGEN: Next big crypto AI agent poised to go parabolic in 2025 A thousand AIs are crawling around the crypto scene, but none come remotely as close to unhinged as iDEGEN. Built by degens, for degens, this AI agent has a whole different vibe. Contrary to its sanitized counterparts, iDEGEN is AI unleashed into the wilderness of crypto X to feast on every conspiracy, trading tip, and savage humor. In many ways, iDEGEN is the product of crypto degen culture on which it trained its large language model. Learning from every @ and interaction, iDEGEN has developed a mind of its own—and it’s a little too raw for free speech platform, X. But not even running afoul of the algorithms at X could stop iDEGEN from going viral and raising a staggering $22.4m in the wake of the furor. The bans galvanized support from the degen community, leading to iDEGEN’s long-awaited presale, raising $1 million in the next 24 hours. X is just the beginning—with iDEGEN’s V3 update, the AI agent is crossing over to Telegram and positioning itself to take over new platforms like RedNote and maybe even YouTube with its newfound ability to create video. Besides being the first-ever AI agent on RedNote, iDEGEN has teamed up with Chinese AI sensation DeepSeek, whose launch threw the markets in disarray after revealing Big Tech’s overcharging charging scheme on AI models. Now, iDEGEN is bigger, better, and meaner thanks to its partnership with DeepSeek—and more ready than ever to flip the script on the lucrative AI agent sector . iDEGEN token prices have since risen from $0.01 to $0.0259—and with its imminent launch on 27th February locked in, the best time to buy into iDEGEN was yesterday. iDEGEN (IDGN) is available exclusively via its official website . Bitcoin Pepe: Solana x Bitcoin hybrid bringing memes to the OG crypto chain Let’s face some hard facts—Bitcoin as a technology severely lacks scalability, throughput, and interoperability to grow an ecosystem that Ethereum and Solana did so successfully en route to making bank for its early investors by the bushel. That’s where Bitcoin Pepe comes in—the first-ever meme-centric layer-2 scalability solution combining the speed, low fees, and high throughput of Solana built on top of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work ledger. Can you imagine the unparalleled potential for Bitcoin Pepe and its native token BPEP when it serves as the key unlock to $2 trillion invested in Bitcoin as it enables memes, NFTs, and all sorts of utility on the OG blockchain? The sky’s the limit for Bitcoin Pepe. If Solana could go from $0.22 to $293, just imagine how much more Bitcoin Pepe could run from its starting price of $0.21. To learn more and to buy Bitcoin Pepe, check out the official website . Vine: Meme coin centered around Vine nostalgia takes off Meme coins have an uncanny ability to capture the fancy of retail investors—and when they do, they can lead to eye-watering gains. Vine, a newly launched meme coin cashing in on the nostalgia surrounding 2010s internet culture, is an example of how meme coins can catch fire quickly. Within hours of its launch, Vine soared to $90 million, going on a nearly 6000% run to peak at a $500 million market cap at its absolute peak. While Vine has cooled off since it’s all just a matter of time before meme coin speculation picks up again and takes it to the next leg up. The final word The big money in crypto is made by buying low-cap gems with the value proposition, fundamentals, and narratives to go parabolic. And between these three picks, iDEGEN stands out. That’s not a prediction—that’s as close as you’ll get to a spoiler.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,BTC|SOL|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 05:19:19

OKX, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges , has settled with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) over legal violations. The exchange admitted to failing to obtain the required license to operate in the U.S. and agreed to pay over $500 million in penalties and forfeitures. What went wrong? The DOJ found that OKX sought out U.S. customers despite a long-standing policy banning them from the platform. Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky stated that the exchange facilitated billions in criminal proceeds and suspicious transactions. The settlement does not include allegations of direct harm to customers. Notably, OKX’s American subsidiary, OKcoin, also faced similar scrutiny from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). A subpoena dated February 24, 2024, referenced fraud and other illegal activities related to digital asset transactions. A separate CFTC investigation is reportedly linked to a flash crash in January 2024 that affected OKX’s native token, OKB. The exchange promised to compensate affected users. The shake-out! An internal document circulated among OKX staff in January 2024 emphasized the importance of whistleblowing and compliance with regulations. The exchange introduced an ethics and compliance helpline for employees to report policy violations or illegal behavior. However, DOJ findings revealed that OKX employees had previously instructed users to falsify information to bypass the platform’s restrictions. The DOJ cited one example of an OKX employee advising a U.S. user to enter random information when prompted for KYC verification. The user was allegedly told to select a different nationality and input arbitrary ID numbers. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Big News: SEC Plans to Cut 10 Regional Office Leaders as Part of DOGE-Driven Cost-Cutting Plan , OKX’s False Deeds Despite its claims of blocking U.S. customers since 2017, OKX engaged in marketing activities within the country. The DOJ highlighted OKX’s sponsorship of the Tribeca Film Festival and its efforts to attract U.S. users through promotional content. At least one U.S.-based customer reportedly shared an instructional video on using a VPN to bypass location restrictions and access OKX’s services. Future Implications With this settlement, OKX aims to resolve its regulatory issues and continue operating in global markets. However, ongoing CFTC investigations may lead to further legal actions. The exchange has yet to comment on the settlement, and a CFTC spokesperson also declined to provide statements. This case marks another major regulatory crackdown on crypto exchanges operating without proper compliance, signaling tighter enforcement in the digital asset space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Altcoins could be facing an even greater crash amid a liquidity crisis-like situation. Bitcoin Leads Crypto Market Crash Over the last 24 hours, the broader crypto market has lost more than $150 billion with the total market cap slipping under $3 trillion. Bitcoin losses have extended further by 4% slipping all the way to $91,000 while falling under key support levels. As per the Coinglass data , the 24-hour Bitcoins liquidations have topped $274 million of which $258 million is in long liquidations. Furthermore, this selling pressure comes with a 150% surge in daily trading volumes to more than $51 billion. Further BTC Price Correction Coming? Amid the steep fall in the Bitcoin price, market analysts are flashing warning signs hinting at the possibility of further correction and a crypto market crash. For the first time since September 2024, Bitcoin demand has dropped into negative territory as per Julio Moreno, the head of research at CryptoQuant. Moreno highlighted the challenges facing Bitcoin in the current market conditions, noting that such negative demand growth makes it difficult for prices to rally. He further warned that the risks of a further market correction are increasing. Source: CryptoQuant Also, as per crypto analyst Ali Martinez, if BTC bulls fail to hold the $93,700 support on a daily closing basis, it risks falling further to the next major support at $75,600. The warning comes as market participants closely monitor Bitcoin’s price movements amid heightened volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty.

Outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs have also surged netting $516 million on Monday, with Fidelity’s FBTC seeing $247 million in outflows while BlackRock’s IBIT clocked $159 million worth of outflows. Arthur Hayes has issued a stark warning about potential turbulence in the Bitcoin market. Hayes explained that many $IBIT holders, particularly hedge funds, have leveraged a strategy of going long on ETFs while shorting CME futures to secure yields exceeding short-term U.S. Treasury rates. However, if the basis narrows as BTC prices decline, these funds may sell $IBIT holdings and repurchase CME futures to unwind their positions. With the basis now nearing U.S. Treasury yields, Hayes suggests these funds, already in profit, are likely to act during U.S. trading hours to realize gains.

Ethereum price is down today by 8% slipping under $2,500 today, with daily trading volume surging to $31.6 billion, and 24-hour liquidations surging to $195 million. Furthermore, altcoins like Solana have faced even steeper falls in relation to Bitcoin. Solana has suffered the biggest hit falling more than 22% since last Friday.

Arkham Intelligence has labeled the incident the “largest financial heist in history,” underscoring the magnitude of the breach and its impact on the cryptocurrency landscape. However, the crypto exchange Bybit managed to acquire all of Ethereum within just 48 hours of the incident. In a surprising turn of events, Citadel Securities made a significant shift in its crypto strategy just hours before a notable market response. According to Bloomberg, the $65 billion financial giant is exploring becoming a liquidity provider for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, the market interpreted the news as a “sell the news” moment, prompting a cautious reaction among traders.

However, with blockchain evolving, a new competitor has gradually emerged. With its super-fast transaction, AI-powered features and cross-chain swaps, 1Fuel (OFT) is taking centre stage in the crypto industry. Market experts believe that the platform could achieve 100x post-presale. Therefore, one may conclude that 1Fuel’s wallet and exchange could be a worthy investment for traders in 2025. Analysts suggest an upward trend for tron price prediction Tron (TRX) is trading for $0.2469, up 0.38% from a 24-hour high. Tron recovered from a 5.72% loss one month ago and climbed 0.41% in the past seven days. Recent developments have seen an expanding Tron ecosystem. The launch of the TRON Builders League provided a $10 million fund to help developers and accelerate network innovation. Founder Justin Sun has also promoted the platform’s expansion to broaden its worldwide reach. All these developments reflect Tron’s stance on building a flourishing and innovative blockchain ecosystem and making Tron a worthy proposition for investors. Analysts suggest an upward trajectory for Tron price prediction. Tron’s price is predicted to rise by 1.75% and reach $ 0.2530 by the end of March 2025. Likewise, market experts suggest that traders could see a profit of $539 if they invest $1,000 and hold until April 2025. This highlights a 54% return on investment within a reasonable time frame. 1Fuel: Revolutionizing cross-chain transactions with enhanced utility While veteran cryptocurrencies like Tron (TRX) work to maintain market relevance, 1Fuel redefines interoperability in the blockchain space by offering a scalable, effective cross-chain liquidity solution. With its native token, OFT, 1Fuel allows users to transfer assets across several networks with minimum friction, ensuring wider adoption. Its architecture supports cost-efficient transfers and low-latency transactions, making it appealing for developers and investors. Beyond its main functionality, 1Fuel provides a simple, user-friendly interface for asset management for institutional and retail users. It provides multi-layered encryption and smart contract audits to safeguard transactions from vulnerabilities. In addition, 1Fuel aims at decentralisation: an ecosystem whereby individuals own their assets without intermediaries. One of 1Fuel’s main features is its multi-chain liquidity, whereby users can trade and swap assets across several blockchain networks. 1Fuel improves overall decentralised finance (DeFi) efficiency by reducing liquidity fragmentation and reliance on centralised exchanges. Traders can capitalise on market opportunities more quickly and flexibly because of the platform’s support for major networks. 1Fuel recently concluded its bonus campaign, which allowed investors to win up to 40%. The initiative rewarded early adopters and drove improved engagement and platform growth. With this momentum, 1Fuel adds more features, like its wallet beta, to simplify digital asset interactions. 1Fuel has raised over $2.3 million in its ongoing presale. With over 219 million tokens sold at a token price of $0.018 apiece, the platform’s initial coin offering offers traders a friendly entry point before the next price surge. While the blockchain landscape evolves, 1Fuel is at the cutting edge of innovation, filling in the gaps between isolated ecosystems and also offering a commendable cross-chain experience. Its emphasis on efficiency, security and user empowerment positions it as a game-changer in the DeFi space.

This resulted in the business losing over $110 billion. With this, the market is now valued at just above the $3 Trillion mark. Following this, market leaders have failed to hold above their important support levels, highlighting increased bearish dominance. Moreover, the leader of altcoins, Ethereum price, continues displaying a strong bearish action. This highlights increased uncertainty in the crypto space. With this, investors are curious with questions like “Why did Ethereum crash today?” In this article, we have uncovered the possible Ethereum price analysis just for you! ETH Price Records A Strong Bearish Reversal! The price of Ethereum has crashed by ~10% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $31.750 billion, a change of +49.93%. Furthermore, this altcoin has lost 7.18% over the past week and 25.17% in 30 days. With a market cap of $300.901 billion, it holds a market share of 10.1397%. The Simple Moving Average (SMA) records a negative crossover in the Ethereum price chart. This suggests a bearish outlook for the ETH price in the upcoming time. Furthermore, the MACD indicator displays a constant decline in the green histogram in the daily time frame. Moreover, its averages are on the verge of experiencing a bearish convergence, indicating that the largest altcoin may continue losing value this week. Is Ethereum Going to Recover? Suppose, the market favors the bulls, this could result in the price of Ethereum retesting its immediate resistance level of $2,870. Furthermore, if the bullish sentiment sustains, this could push the price of ETH toward its upper resistance level of $3,300 in the coming time. Conversely, a sustained bearish action could result in it retesting its support trendline of $2,530. Moreover, if the bearish sentiment intensifies, this could result in the Ethereum price plunging toward its lower support level of $2,175 this month.

Bitcoin dropped below $94,000 initially and later formed the bottom below $92,000 and interestingly, it does not appear to halt the ongoing bearish trend. A probable reason for the circulating fear and uncertainty within the markets is speculated to be Trump continuing with 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which could fuel the trade war fears. The markets underwent the largest liquidation of the month of over $815 million in the past 24 hours, with BTC experiencing more than $270 million in liquidation alone during the last trading day. Besides, the series of long liquidations has been continuing since the early trading hours, recording more than $116 million. Nearly 2,86,596 traders have already been liquidated, with the single largest liquidation recorded being over $10 million. The market sentiments have plunged below 30, suggesting the traders are currently under fear. What’s Next for the Bitcoin & Ethereum Prices? Bitcoin and Ethereum are touching crucial support levels, which may trigger another bearish wave if they are not defended well. The RSI of BTC has marked the lowest levels not seen since September 2024, hinting towards the rally heading to mark the bottom. Besides, the bounce does not appear to be strong enough, which could reinstate a strong ascending trend. Therefore, the BTC price is now feared to drop to $90,000 or levels below the range, which may attract notable liquidity. On the other hand, Ethereum’s price not only broke below the pivotal ascending trend line but also failed to hold within an important support zone. Currently, the price is struggling to defend the local support at $2500 and if it fails to rise and recover above $2600, it’s a bullish possibility and probability of Altseason, both of which may drop hard. On the other hand, Bitcoin dominance is scaling up by rising above 61%, while the Altcoin season index has dropped to 22, suggesting the market is more lenient towards Bitcoin. Overall crypto market sentiment has dropped to fear, which suggests the panic selling is expected to continue for some more time. This could keep the markets under the bearish influence, probably until the end of the monthly trade.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ETH|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 05:39:00

However, the latest move comes with a notable uptick in perpetual futures open interest and price action that indicates seller dominance. The number of open futures bets or open interest in the BTC/USDT pair trading on Binance rose by roughly 12,000 BTC (worth over $1 billion) as BTC's price fell from $96,000 to under $92,000, according to data tracked by Coinglass . An uptick in open interest alongside a price decline is said to represent an influx of bearish short positions. In other words, traders likely opened fresh shorts as the price dropped, perhaps in anticipation of an extended sell-off. The cumulative volume delta (CVD) across both futures and spot markets on the exchange was already negative and has deepened further with the price drop, indicating that selling pressure has outpaced buying activity. The CVD measures the net capital flows into the market, where positive and rising figures indicate buyer dominance, while negative values reflect increased selling pressure. BTC chalks out bearish marubozu candle Bitcoin dropped 4.86% on Monday with sellers dominating the price action throughout the day. That's reflected in the shape of Monday's candlestick, which features negligible upper and lower shadows and a prominent red body. In other words, opening and closing prices are almost the same, a sign buyers had little say in the price action. Technical analysts categorize this as a bearish marubozu pattern. The appearance of the bearish candlestick while prices hover below key 50- and 100-day simple moving averages (SMA) may embolden sellers, potentially leading to deeper losses. Support (S) is seen near $89,200, the Jan. 13 low, followed by the 200-day SMA at $81,661. On the flip side, the Feb. 21 high of around $99,520 is the level to beat (R).",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Ether,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-25 05:39:46

This comes after NYSE Arca submitted a request to the SEC to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Cardano Trust on the stock exchange, and a decision is expected within 180 days. Cardano ETF Review Begins The SEC has officially accepted NYSE Arca’s request to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Cardano Trust. This means the review process has now started, and the SEC will decide whether to approve or reject the Cardano ETF. The decision is expected by August 2025. The acknowledgment came on February 24, 2025, after NYSE Arca first submitted the proposal on February 10, 2025. If approved, this ETF would give investors a way to invest in Cardano (ADA) through a regulated platform. With this ETF, investors could buy and sell shares that track the price of ADA without needing to hold the cryptocurrency themselves. This would make it easier for more people to gain exposure to Cardano in a secure and regulated way. Higher Chances of ETF Approval The chances of a Cardano ETF getting approved in 2025 have increased, with Polymarket, a decentralized prediction platform, now showing a 62% likelihood . This is a significant rise from 51% in January. Meanwhile, the SEC’s acknowledgment of multiple crypto ETF filings, including Grayscale’s XRP ETF, has contributed to this growing optimism. Market sentiment has shifted in favor of approval as institutional interest in crypto continues to rise. If approved, the Cardano ETF would open doors for more traditional investors to enter the ADA market. Impact on Cardano’s Price A Cardano ETF could have a positive effect on ADA’s price by attracting institutional investors and increasing demand. Analysts believe that if ADA maintains support between $0.67 and $0.81, it could see further gains. However, if it drops below this range, the price could face downward pressure. As of now, Cardano is priced at $0.68 , with a market cap of $24.16 billion.

OKX’s Aux Cayes FinTech Pleads Guilty to Violating US Anti-Money Laundering Laws, Faces $500M Penalty Aux Cayes FinTech Co. Ltd., the operator of OKX, has pleaded guilty to violating US Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws and has agreed to pay a staggering $505 million in fines and forfeitures. The company admitted to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business that facilitated over $5 billion in suspicious transactions and criminal proceeds. As part of the resolution, the Seychelles-based crypto exchange will pay $84 million in penalties and forfeit $421 million in fees collected from mostly institutional clients. The settlement, announced on Feb. 24, 2025, follows an extensive investigation by the US Department of Justice (DOJ), which found that OKX knowingly allowed US-based customers to trade on its global platform, despite lacking the necessary approvals. The US Department of Justice was unambiguous in its condemnation of OKX’s practices, with Acting US Attorney Matthew Podolsky stating that the guilty plea sends a clear message to financial institutions. ”Today's guilty plea and penalties emphasize that there will be consequences for financial institutions that avail themselves of US markets but violate the law by allowing criminal activity to continue,” Podolsky said. Meanwhile, FBI Assistant Director in Charge James E. Dennehy revealed that OKX actively advised users to falsify information to bypass regulatory requirements. ”Blatant disregard for the rule of law will not be tolerated,” Dennehy emphasized. The DOJ noted that OKX’s violations spanned from 2018 to early 2024, despite the company having an official policy to block US customers since 2017. Following the DOJ’s announcement, OKX released a statement acknowledging ”legacy compliance gaps” but maintained that the number of US clients involved was minimal and that none remain on the platform today. OKX also stressed that no customers were harmed and that no employees faced charges as part of the settlement. However, the exchange acknowledged the need for stronger regulatory safeguards to prevent future violations. In an attempt to repair its global compliance reputation, OKX stated that it will hire an independent compliance consultant to overhaul its anti-money laundering and regulatory policies. ”Our vision is to make OKX the gold standard of global compliance at scale across different markets and their respective regulatory bodies,” OKX CEO Star Xu posted on X. OKX’s Ongoing Regulatory Challenges OKX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has historically faced scrutiny from global regulators. Like many offshore exchanges, OKX has operated in a gray area regarding regulatory oversight, often relying on jurisdictional loopholes to facilitate international trading. This case follows a wider crackdown on unregulated crypto exchanges, with Binance, BitMEX, and KuCoin also facing regulatory pressure in recent years. The $500 million penalty imposed on OKX marks one of the largest fines ever levied against a cryptocurrency exchange for AML violations. The ruling suggests growing pressure on centralized exchanges to implement robust compliance frameworks that align with US and international laws. With regulatory oversight tightening, many industry analysts predict that crypto firms will need to proactively bolster their compliance programs to avoid similar legal entanglements. As US regulators ramp up their efforts to curb illicit finance in the digital asset space, the OKX settlement may serve as a precedent for future cases, forcing crypto exchanges to reconsider their operational strategies in the world’s largest financial market. Trump-Era SEC May Ease Crypto Crackdown as Industry Leaders Push for Regulatory Rethink Meanwhile, a major shift in US cryptocurrency regulation may be on the horizon as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), now under new leadership following the inauguration of President Donald Trump , considers revising its stance on enforcement actions against crypto firms. In recent days, the SEC’s crypto task force, headed by Commissioner Hester Peirce, has engaged in discussions with multiple industry stakeholders about reevaluating the agency’s previous classification of cryptocurrencies as securities. The meetings, which took place between Feb. 17 and Feb. 24, suggest that the regulatory landscape for crypto in the US could undergo significant changes. According to multiple SEC filings, top executives from leading crypto firms, investors, and policymakers have met with the commission to advocate for a more accommodating approach to digital assets. Among those who participated in discussions were: Crypto Council for Innovation (an industry advocacy group) Zero Hash (a crypto infrastructure provider) Paradigm Operations (a prominent crypto investment firm) Michael Saylor (Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy and long-time Bitcoin advocate) Each party reportedly submitted documents urging the SEC to reconsider its prior stance that many digital assets qualify as securities and, consequently, fall under its regulatory jurisdiction. The meetings followed similar discussions between the SEC’s crypto task force and other key industry figures, including Blockchain Association, Jito Labs, and Multicoin Capital. While the SEC has not made any official announcements regarding enforcement policy changes, the tone of these meetings suggests a departure from the aggressive regulatory approach seen under former Chair Gary Gensler. Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC pursued numerous enforcement actions against major crypto firms, often citing violations of securities laws. However, since Trump took office and installed acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda, the agency has already dropped investigations into Robinhood Crypto and OpenSea. The commission’s latest moves have sparked debate about whether this represents a genuine shift toward pro-crypto regulation or an attempt to appease industry lobbyists. Critics argue that the SEC’s pivot under Trump could weaken investor protections and enable financial misconduct. One of the most vocal crypto advocates within the SEC, Commissioner Hester Peirce, has signaled that the agency is open to exploring alternative regulatory frameworks for digital assets. In a Feb. 21 statement titled ‘There Must Be Some Way Out of Here’, Peirce proposed the idea of a ”regulatory sandbox”—a controlled environment where crypto projects could operate under tailored rules rather than facing immediate enforcement actions. Peirce's call for public feedback aligns with broader efforts within the SEC to rethink its regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, although it remains unclear how soon any concrete policy changes will materialize. A crucial factor in shaping the SEC’s crypto policy is the pending nomination of a permanent chair. While acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda is currently leading the agency, President Trump has nominated former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to take the helm. Atkins is known for his pro-market, deregulatory stance and has previously expressed skepticism about overregulating digital assets. However, his nomination has yet to be scheduled for a hearing by the Senate Banking Committee, which remains divided on how the SEC should approach crypto regulation. Trump’s broader economic policy strategy also suggests a more industry-friendly environment for crypto. The president has long criticized overregulation in the financial sector and even launched his own meme coin shortly before taking office. On Feb. 19, the SEC voluntarily dismissed a legal appeal blocking a broker-dealer rule that had impacted some crypto firms—another move indicating a potential retreat from the agency’s prior hardline approach. A ”Crypto-Friendly” SEC or Industry Capture? The SEC’s evolving stance has fueled speculation about whether the agency is genuinely seeking a balanced regulatory framework or is simply bowing to pressure from industry heavyweights. Proponents of deregulation argue that a less restrictive approach will encourage innovation and prevent the US from falling behind in the global race for digital asset adoption. Industry leaders have repeatedly warned that overly aggressive regulation is driving blockchain innovation offshore. However, critics worry that easing enforcement actions could embolden bad actors and increase risks for retail investors. They argue that Gensler’s aggressive crackdown helped prevent fraudulent schemes and ensured that crypto firms adhered to financial transparency standards. The battle over crypto regulation is playing out at a time of heightened political polarization in Washington, with Trump -aligned Republicans generally favoring deregulation and Democrats pushing for stronger oversight. As the SEC undergoes a potential transformation under new leadership, the coming weeks and months will be critical in determining the direction of US crypto regulation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-25 06:00:00

Bitcoin Needs To Reclaim This Level For Trend Continuation – Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/red-monday-green-week-bitcoin-needs-to-reclaim-this-level-for-trend-continuation-analyst/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped below $95,000 and risks a further decline amid the ongoing market retrace. As February comes to an end, some analysts consider the flagship crypto needs to reclaim some crucial levels to continue its bullish long-term trend. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Price Manipulated? Expert Exposes The Truth Bitcoin Sees Monday Bleeding Over the past three days, Bitcoin has seen its price drop below some key levels, dropping 5.7% From Friday’s highs. Amid the news of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s withdrawal of its crypto case against Coinbase, the largest crypto by market capitalization traded above the $99,000 mark for the first time in two weeks. However, the positive sentiment quickly vanished after Bybit, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, suffered a $1.5 billion hack that took around 401,347 ETH. As a result, most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, lost their momentary gains. Since then, the flagship crypto has hovered between the $95,000 and $96,000 zone, briefly nearing the $97,000 resistance on Saturday. On Monday, the correction continued, with BTC dropping below $95,000 and hitting its one-week low at $93,800. As noted by analyst Jelle, Bitcoin continues to dump on New York markets opening. Per the post, BTC has been retracing from its early Monday recoveries every week after the US market opens, driving its price to a red Monday close several times in the past few months. Despite these retraces and the recent market corrections, Bitcoin has remained within its post-election range since November, showing minimal volatility. BTC has hovered between the $96,000-$102,000 mid-zone of the range for most of this period. Amid its recent performance, Altcoin Sherpa pointed out that, excluding February 18, Bitcoin has not closed below its daily support zone in over a month, signaling that BTC needs to close above $95,700 to continue holding this crucial level. BTC Retests Bullish Flag Breakout Meanwhile, Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC needs a monthly close above $96,000 to continue its bullish long-term trend. In January, the largest crypto registered a historic candle after closing the month above the $100,000 mark for the first time. This close confirmed Bitcoin’s breakout from its post-election monthly bull flag. However, the recent price action has seen BTC retest its breakout level again, momentarily losing it. The analyst asserted that the cryptocurrency needs to reclaim and close February above $96,700 “to confirm the breakout & set itself up for trend continuation over time.” He added that BTC has traded around this key level throughout the majority of February, and continuing to hold it would indicate a “successful post-breakout retest.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Activity Levels Crash To 4-Month Lows, Does This Spell Doom For The Meme Coin? Rekt Capital concluded that BTC’s daily close “isn’t as important as the higher timeframe signal” as the bull flag bottom continues to hold as support “and the three-month trend of a Higher Low at the downside wicks still exists.” At the time of writing, BTC trades at $94,165, a 2.1% decrease in the daily timeframe.

The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a downward trend, with several major coins facing declines. Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are seeing significant declines. Bitcoin is priced at $92,017, down by 3.87% in the last 24 hours, while Ethereum follows suit at $2,505, down 8.28%. The global cryptocurrency market has seen a major decline, with the total market capitalization now sitting at $2.99 trillion. This marks a 5.06% decrease in the last 24 hours, reflecting the ongoing downward trend affecting major cryptocurrencies. What’s Next For XRP Price? Looking at XRP’s current price action on the daily chart, analyst Josh of Crypto World said that the price continues to face resistance in the $2.65 to $2.80 range. This area has proven to be a tough hurdle for XRP, with the price struggling to break through. On the downside, XRP has recently broken below the $2.50 support level, which had previously been acting as short-term support. The next key support to watch is in the $2.25 to $2.30 range. Despite the ongoing rejection from resistance, XRP is currently moving within a sideways price range. The price continues to bounce between the support and resistance levels, and this could continue in the short term. If the price approaches the support again, there’s a possibility of a bounce back towards resistance. XRP has recently confirmed an oversold signal for the first time in quite a while on the RSI. The last few times the RSI approached oversold conditions, XRP saw local lows and some short-term relief. Although this doesn’t mark the end of the bearish trend, it suggests that we may see a brief relief rally or a slight pause in the selling pressure over the next 1-2 days, before potentially resuming the downtrend.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 06:02:03

This latest purchase brought its total holdings to almost 500,000 BTC. Despite this, Bitcoin is on track for its first negative February since 2020, with its price struggling to maintain support above $95,000. Market sentiment also still seems weak as spot Bitcoin ETF outflows continue. South Dakota Kills Bitcoin Bill South Dakota lawmakers have effectively killed a bill that could have allowed the state to invest in Bitcoin after deferring the vote beyond the legislative session’s 40-day limit. The proposed legislation, HB 1202, sought to amend the classification of state public funds to permit up to 10% investment in Bitcoin. During a meeting of the House Commerce and Energy Committee on Feb. 24, the majority of lawmakers voted to push the bill to the 41st day, which is a move that prevents it from moving forward this session. The bill’s sponsor, State Representative Logan Manhart , introduced the legislation on Jan. 30 with the intent to integrate Bitcoin into South Dakota’s investment strategy. After the setback, Manhart announced his plans to reintroduce the bill in 2026, hoping for a different outcome in future legislative sessions. Similar attempts to establish Bitcoin reserves have failed in other states, including North Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming. However, lawmakers in several states, including Florida, Arizona, Utah, Ohio, Missouri, and Kentucky, have introduced similar legislation that is still under consideration. The push for Bitcoin investment at the state level is part of a broader shift in policy after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. During his campaign, Trump promoted the idea of creating a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile,” which he formalized in a Jan. 23 executive order establishing a working group to study the feasibility of such a reserve. However, many of Trump’s executive actions have faced legal challenges as critics question their constitutionality. Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump’s administration departed from the regulatory stance of his predecessor, Joe Biden. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took a hardline approach to crypto regulation under Biden, but now has already dropped several investigations into crypto firms.The SEC has even closed its case against Coinbase, a major crypto exchange that was under scrutiny since 2023. Strategy Nears 500,000 BTC Holdings Despite the fact that some US states are stepping back from Bitcoin, Strategy recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings with an additional $2 billion purchase . This yet again solidifies its position as the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. The firm bought 20,356 Bitcoin at an average price of $97,514 per token, bringing its total Bitcoin reserves to 499,096 BTC. These holdings were acquired for approximately $33.1 billion at an average price of $66,357 per BTC. The announcement was made by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor in a post on X. The acquisition took place after the firm’s successful senior convertible note offering, which raised $2 billion. The notes carry a 0% coupon and mature in 2030, with each $1,000 block convertible to 2.3072 shares of Strategy’s Class A common stock at a 35% premium over the current market price. After deducting fees and estimated expenses, Strategy secured approximately $1.99 billion in net proceeds, which it plans to use for general corporate purposes, including more Bitcoin acquisitions. The move is part of Strategy’s ambitious “21/21 Plan,” which aims to raise $42 billion over three years through a combination of equity and fixed-income securities to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. The firm has already secured $20 billion under this plan, relying heavily on senior convertible notes and debt to fuel its Bitcoin accumulation. Despite reporting a net loss of $670 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, Strategy is still very much committed to its aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Now that its holdings approach the 500,000 BTC milestone, the firm’s unrealized profit on its Bitcoin position surged to more than $12.8 billion, according to data from Saylortracker . Strategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: Saylortracker ) Institutional interest in Strategy has also grown a lot recently, with pension funds and treasuries across twelve North American states reportedly holding a combined $330 million worth of the firm’s stock by the end of 2024. Additionally, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently increased its stake in Strategy to 5% after the company’s rebranding on Feb. 5. Bitcoin Faces First Negative February Since 2020 Bitcoin is on track to register its first negative monthly return since February 2020 as it is currently down over 10% for the month. With less than a week left, the leading cryptocurrency’s lack of bullish momentum suggests that a new all-time high is unlikely in the short term. Historically, February has seen an average return of around 14%, but current market sentiment is still very subdued. Bitcoin monthly returns (Source: Coinglass ) Since surpassing the $92,000 mark on Nov. 19 of 2024, Bitcoin has spent 65 out of 97 days trading between $92,000 and $100,000. Despite reaching new highs above its previous record of $74,000, Bitcoin’s price action in 2025 has been largely stagnant, with only a 1.97% increase since the beginning of the year. However, some analysts see this consolidation as a sign of progress. Bitcoin’s realized cap, which measures the value investors actually paid for their coins rather than their current market price, increased by $160 billion in the past three months. Sina G, co-founder of 21st Capital, described this as an influx of new net capital that indicates market growth despite price stagnation. The lack of price movement also contributed to lower network activity. Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. noticed that daily transfer volume dropped by 76%, while active wallet addresses declined by 74% over the past week. However, long-term holders are still quite resilient, with the coin days destroyed metric hitting a multi-year low. This suggests that investors are refraining from panic selling. For now, Bitcoin’s ability to stay above $95,000 is under increasing pressure. The asset experienced a sharp decline of 11.30% from $102,000 to $91,100 at the start of February, but has so far managed to close daily candles above $95,000 throughout the month. However, this support level has been tested about three times in the past week and is weakening, increasing the likelihood of Bitcoin dropping below $91,000 and potentially revisiting sub-$90,000 levels. Bitcoin’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite the announcement of Strategy’s recent acquisition of 20,356 BTC, Bitcoin still failed to see any meaningful recovery. Overall, market conditions are very fragile, with even spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund inflows drying up significantly. On Feb. 20, outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $364 million, which also contributed to the lack of short-term buying pressure.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-25 06:11:41

This is the first time it has made a Bitcoin purchase since it halted its daily purchase plan on February 18. Currently, the Central American nation holds 6,088 BTC, which is equal to approximately $558 million at the current rate. The government of El Salvador earlier pledged to buy one Bitcoin per day, a policy that began in November 2022. The halt in purchases was witnessed right after a 40-month EFF arrangement with the International Monetary Fund or IMF. According to the agreement, which aims to achieve more than $3.5 billion in financial contributions, El Salvador had to make some modifications to the rules related to Bitcoins. Among these changes, the country made the acceptance of Bitcoin by private entities optional. However, they will be required to clear transactions in the legal tender of the country but have the freedom to use bitcoins. To meet these conditions, lawmakers enacted amendments to the Bitcoin law in January 2025. The IMF has always warned of the financial risks associated with El Salvador’s plans to use Bitcoin. In December 2024, the organization obtained a $1.4 billion loan from the country to scale back Bitcoin adoption. While earlier, it was thought that the IMF agreement would limit Bitcoin investments, El Salvador ramped up purchasing outside of its daily plan. In December 2024, the government added $1 million worth of Bitcoin to the reserve. On February 4, it bought 11 BTC for a value of more than $1 million. There has also been a more general change in policy. In March 2024, El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele transferred Bitcoin holdings to a cold storage wallet, indicating a change of guard in the regulation. At the time, over $400 million worth of Bitcoin was held in El Salvador by 5,600 BTC. El Salvador’s market impact El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy involving the country’s adoption of Bitcoin as currency has influenced market sentiment, affecting Bitcoin’s volatility. The latest acquisition occurred after the price was below $95,000 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement on tariffs. The sudden decline led to $950 million in liquidations across cryptocurrency platforms. At press time, Bitcoin traded around $91,000, down 4% in 24 hours. “El Salvador finally abandoned its failed experiment of using Bitcoin as legal tender. After two years, only 8% of Salvadorans used Bitcoin even once. If Bitcoin can’t function as a medium of exchange—the purpose for which it was created—what value does it have that can be stored?” – Peter Schiff. El Salvador became the first nation to legalize Bitcoin as a legal tender in September 2021, requiring companies to accept it as payment. The government bought its first Bitcoin in the same month in order to start adopting Bitcoin in the financial system. However, statistics reveal that the use of Bitcoin for transactions by the Salvadorans remains low despite its recognition.

The conference, and its 350+ side events held over the week, are estimated to have contributed HK$275m to the economy. Sold-out event highlights the conference’s success in bridging East-meets-West dialogue, with industry-altering announcements made throughout the week. HONG KONG, Feb. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ – Consensus Hong Kong, which took place between February 18 and 20, 2025, has officially wrapped up its sold-out debut.

The success of the event has garnered international attention, so much so that it has officially announced today that it will be returning to Asia again next year in 2026. The event’s arrival in Hong Kong coincided with several key regional milestones, with notable announcements during the week taking place, including: Hong Kong’s financial regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), unveiled a new road map with 12 initiatives designed to “future-proof” Hong Kong’s virtual asset ecosystem; Standard Chartered publicized its joint venture with Animoca Brands and Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) to seek a licence from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to issue a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin.

Over 450 media registered to report on the event and hear from over 300 high-caliber speakers from the Hong Kong government, Web3 regulators, and brands like Binance, Blockstream, Circle, Coinbase, Google, Pantera, Robinhood, and Solana Foundation. Supported by over 125 sponsors and over 160 community partners, including Auros, Hex Trust, TRON, Aptos, CoinW, Dimitra, First Digital, Genius, Zeebu, and many more, the team was able to fulfill its mission of making Consensus the most important platform for digital assets and Web3.

Cloud 39 at the Henderson, The Hong Kong Jockey Club, Wonderland (West Kowloon Cultural District) the Grand Hyatt, and Iron Fairies hosted special events, such as the opening Rooftop Revelry, Consensus Cup, Token of Love music festival, Crypto Fight Night and the Closing Party.

TransCrypts, a leader in digital identity and credentials, backed by Mark Cuban, GSR Ventures, and others emerged as the winner. The competition was judged by top investors from Spartan Ventures, Titan Fund, CMCC, Foresight Ventures, Animoca Brands, and more. Michael Lau, Chairman of Consensus Hong Kong, said, “Consensus Hong Kong was an overwhelming success. The combination of our nearly 10,000 in-person attendees and over 350 side events is independent validation proving our conference achieved incredible product-market fit. It is clear that the global Web3 industry has been asking for a truly world-class conference in Hong Kong for a while, and Consensus Hong Kong was the answer. Hong Kong has worked hard to strategically position itself as a forward-thinking digital assets hub with a vibrant ecosystem that fosters entrepreneurial spirits, so we hope to return again next year—at an even bigger scale.” Brad Spies, Managing Director of Consensus said, “Consensus has always had a laser focus on bringing together all of the different parts of the crypto ecosystem: traditional finance, DeFi traders, regulators, developers, entrepreneurs, investors, startups, academics, and artists.

Amid this, a top market analyst has highlighted key support zones for Ripple’s native asset while hinting towards a potential drop to $1.6. So, let’s take a quick tour of the current performance of the coin and see how it may perform in the near future. XRP Price Risks Falling To $1.6 The broader crypto market has witnessed gloomy trading today, with most of the top assets resting in the red. Amid this, XRP price slipped 9.4% and exchanged hands at $2.25, and its one-day trading volume jumped 139% to $8.33 billion. Notably, it’s worth noting that the crypto has dropped from its 24-hour high of $2.6. Besides, the Relative Strength Index of the asset is nearing the oversold condition, which might help in a strong recovery ahead. Furthermore, the waning risk-bet appetite of the investors is also evidenced by the dropping Futures Open Interest of the token by 15% to $3.18 billion. Ripple (XRP) Price What’s Next For Ripple (XRP) Price? As the XRP price took a hit, top market expert EGRAG CRYPTO has weighed in on the key support levels to watch. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, if XRP fails to hold its current support level, it may drop to $1.60. In a recent X post, EGRAG CRYPTO shared a price chart and highlighted the importance of the $2.30 level. “Our key focus now is not to drop below $2.30, as that could trigger a free fall to lower targets” he warned. Meanwhile, the expert also emphasized the potential for range-bound movement until a breakout occurs. He identified the following key levels: Closing below $2.30: Bearish Closing above $2.60: Bullish Closing above $2.85: Super Bullish Closing above $3.11: Heading towards all-time highs (ATH) and potentially setting new ones! Having said that, investors will be watching these levels closely as the XRP price continues to fluctuate. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X Market Trends & Other Factors Impacting Price The recent dip in XRP price comes despite a flurry of positive crypto market developments, especially Ripple. For context, Donald Trump has recently mentioned Ripple and XRP on the Truth Social platform, fueling market discussions. Besides, it also triggered speculations over the US XRP Reserve possibility , while adding fuel to the ongoing BTC vs XRP debate. Amid this, a top lawyer also commented on what lies ahead for the Bitcoin Vs Ripple war . However, despite these trends, it appears that the Ripple whales are trading cautiously amid the ongoing slump. For context, whales have offloaded more than 81 million coins to exchanges recently, which has further dragged down the asset’s price.

Thus, the cryptocurrency has lost over nine grand since Friday’s peak. The total value of liquidated positions is expectedly on the rise, surpassing the $1 billion mark. Naturally, long positions dominate. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Recall that the primary cryptocurrency was climbing steadily last Friday and tapped a weekly peak of $99,500 following positive news from Coinbase in regards to its two-year-long litigation against the SEC. However, the situation quickly changed after the largest hack in the cryptocurrency industry, in which over $1.4 billion, mostly in ETH, was siphoned off Bybit. BTC, alongside the rest of the market, reacted immediately with a price fall to $95,000. After a calm weekend spent at over $96,000, bitcoin took another minor hit on Monday and slipped to $94,000. The bears were not done yet as they initiated another substantial leg down on Tuesday morning that drove the cryptocurrency to a six-week low of just over $90,000 (for now). Consequently, this put BTC’s losses since Friday at over $9,000 even though many analysts have remained unfazed . As expected, the altcoins have it even worse. Massive double-digit price declines are evident from ETH, DOGE, SOL, LINK, ADA, XRP, XLM, AVAX, LTC, and many, many others. This enhanced volatility has resulted in a mindblowing value of liquidated positions on a daily scale, which is at just over $1 billion now. $950 million came from long positions, while the single-largest liquidations occurred on Binance and was worth $15 million.

The decline in DOGE price forced the closure of many long positions, leading to a drop in open interest. As bearish headwinds continue, can Dogecoin price recover, or is a crash to $0.10 imminent? At press time, DOGE trades at $0.21 after a 9% drop in 24 hours. The meme coin is now down by 40% in one month. Dogecoin Open Interest Hits 15-Week Low – Will Price Drop to $0.10? Data from Coinglass shows that Dogecoin’s open interest, which is the total number of open derivatives contracts, has fallen by 13% in 24 hours to $1.9 billion. This metric is now at the lowest level since November. Dogecoin Open Interest The decline in open interest may have been caused by a surge in long liquidations. This is because, in the last 24 hours, more than $27M long positions on DOGE were forcefully closed after the drastic price decline. When long traders are forced to close their positions, it causes the price to drop even further due to additional selling pressure. Going by past trends, Dogecoin price tends to rise when the open interest rises and falls when this metric declines. If derivative traders become hesitant and fail to open new positions causing the open interest to drop further, Dogecoin may likely drop to $0.10. DOGE Price Struggles as Bearish Headwinds Intensify Dogecoin price dropped to test a multi-month support level of $0.201 on Tuesday, marking the third time that it has tested this level since November. Buyers quickly stepped in to buy DOGE at this price, but the selling pressure is still strong. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the one-day chart shows that bears have the upper hand after falling to 27. An oversold RSI shows that the market is strongly bearish, and while it may signal a potential rebound due to seller exhaustion, the lack of a positive catalyst suggests that the bearish momentum may persist. DOGE/USDT: 1-day Chart The 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has also dropped below the 200-day EMA, which further reinforces the bearish thesis. If these bearish conditions continue, DOGE price may likely drop to $0.09. At the same time, key resistance lies at the 200-day EMA of $0.25. The hourly chart also portrayed a bearish Dogecoin price prediction after breaking below a symmetrical triangle pattern. According to trader Ali Charts, this breakout may lead to DOGE price breaching support of $0.201 and falling to $0.197. DOGE/USDT: 1H Chart Amid these bearish signals, it is likely that DOGE could extend the downtrend and fall to $0.10. However, if the broader market recovers, can Dogecoin’s trend reverse? Is a Dogecoin Price Recovery Looming? Despite the current bearish outlook, some analysts remain bullish on Dogecoin and anticipate that the price could recover if certain conditions are met. Per analyst Carl Moon, if Dogecoin can survive the current market conditions and successfully defend support, it may break out from a falling wedge pattern to target $0.44. DOGE/USDT: 1-day Chart The analyst pointed out similar breakouts from the past that preceded a rally. Nevertheless, a resumption of bullish trends is currently dependent on how the rest of the crypto market performs.

While analysts expect a reversal in March, the market-wide disruption is driving investors toward projects that are still flying under the radar but have shown incredible resilience during the most bearish weeks of Q1 2025. One such outlier is Rollblock (RBLK) , an up-and-coming crypto gaming gem that is already taking the market by storm with its revolutionary platform and bear-proof tokenomics. How Rollblock Redefines Crypto Gaming Rollblock is poised to disrupt Web3 gaming with its innovative framework that merges aspects of DeFi and online gaming. This approach could see Rollblock capture a huge portion of the $450 billion online gaming industry and emerge as one of the hottest plays of 2025. This cutting-edge GameFi platform leverages the tried and tested Ethereum blockchain to ensure quick transaction speeds across 20 major cryptocurrencies while removing any possibility of altering bets once placed. Security and transparency are at the forefront of Rollblock’s priorities, and the project has cemented this intention by securing a certificate from prominent crypto auditor SolidProof and a license from Anjouan Gaming. 7,000 games are immediately available, including all-time classics, such as poker and roulette, and even newer AI-powered additions. A sports betting platform has been recently introduced as well, further expanding Rollblock’s already massive offering. Moreover, through the highly lucrative revenue-sharing mechanism, Rollblock can also double as an investment vehicle, allowing holders to earn passive income through recurring staking rewards. This system is sustained by weekly buybacks of the RBLK token funded by the project’s own revenue. A set amount of these tokens will be burned, enhancing its stability and paving the way for scarcity-driven appreciation. Cardano Drops, But Support Appears Rock Solid February 24 saw red candles flood the charts across the board, with many cryptocurrencies experiencing steep declines. Cardano’s price also took a considerable hit, as it saw over 7% of its valuation evaporate as it revisited the $0.72 support. The 29% surge in volume shows growing market participation, and the Cardano order books are becoming a battleground between bears that are shorting ADA and bulls that are trying to scoop up the dip. Despite the short-term turbulence, Cardano’s future prospects are still decisively bullish according to analysts. Prominent crypto expert Dan Gambardello believes Cardano could realistically top between $5 and $10 during the 2025 cycle. He highlights that Cardano’s market cap surged from $1.22 billion in 2020 to over $101 billion in 2021. Key technical indicators, including an inverse head and shoulders pattern and Cardano’s position between critical moving averages, suggest a bullish setup similar to previous cycles. Furthermore, Gambardello also sees ADA’s inclusion in Bitwise’s top 10 index and Grayscale’s ETF filing as potential catalysts for massive institutional adoption. Why The RBLK Presale Could Be This Year’s Millionaire Maker Event With over $10 million raised in record time and more than 45,000 registrations, Rollblock’s presale is quickly becoming one of the hottest ICOs of the year. Analysts foresee gains of up to 800% before the official launch, making it a tempting investment at the price of $0.06. This is an ideal entry point for early bidders, especially with the limited-time 50% bonus on all RBLK purchases. This means that for every $1,000 invested, buyers will receive $1,500 worth of tokens. Don’t miss out! Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Edge oracles will independently verify the total dollar value of the USDe's reserves and the reserve coverage of USDe's supply and confirm that reserves are governance-approved and delta-neutral. Chaos Labs shared the announcement exclusively with CoinDesk. USDe, a synthetic stablecoin, maintains a soft peg with the U.S. dollar through an automated delta-hedging strategy that shorts bitcoin and ether perpetual futures to offset changes in the prices of these cryptocurrencies. The synthetic stablecoin experienced volatility over the weekend, falling to 0.982 against tether and 0.988 against USDC, per Kaiko, amid fears that the protocol has multi-million dollar exposure to Bybit's ether (ETH) derivatives market. The exchange was hacked late Friday , with a malicious entity draining over $1 billion in ether. The so-called de-peg, however, was short-lived as Ethena assured investors that all assets backing USDe were held off-exchange and its reserve fund was more than enough to compensate for any losses from the Bybit exploit. The integration with Chaos Labs adds another layer of credibility to USDe's reserves, ensuring they stay secure and transparent. The Edge Proof of Reserves (PoR) oracles will constantly monitor the reserve levels of tokens and check the collateral backing them. This is done by smoothly integrating off-chain data from custodians and centralized exchanges into the on-chain environment, ensuring scalable and robust support for institutional-grade applications. The integration also provides automated alerts to notify users of any data anomalies or if reserve levels fall below the required thresholds. Verified data is publicly displayed on Ethena’s transparency page and attestor interfaces, keeping stakeholders informed. ""This integration ensures continuous, independent verification of reserves, fostering greater transparency and security for all users. By leveraging real-time, tamper-resistant data, Ethena reinforces its commitment to a robust and reliable synthetic dollar,"" the announcement said.

Amid these declines and massive liquidation, a crypto trader lost $24M while swapping TRUMP tokens for USDC. In just a single transaction, the trader went from profits to losses. Let’s discuss how this happened. Crypto Trader Loses $24M in a Single Swap on TRUMP Token On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain X post revealed that a crypto trader had borne a $24M loss on the TRUMP token amid the Solana price crash. This happened as the trader swapped 763,582.605387 TRUMP for 9,483,807.865662 USDC, bearing heavy losses as the initial investment was $33.9M. Interestingly, the same crypto whale has engaged in several trades on this US President’s meme coin and even earned significant profits. The whale earned $11.8M earlier, so this swap seems part of the plan to liquidate the holdings due to the crypto market crash. Surprisingly, many other crypto investors are in the same boat and following a similar trajectory. Many crypto whales have begun mass-dumping their TRUMP and MELANIA tokens after their poor performance, impacting the broader market. Solana Price Plummets 12% Alongside Global Market Crash Solana is among the top cryptos to buy in the market and has performed impressively over the years, including in terms of adoption. However, the SOL token’s performance has been disappointing for some time, as it stalled and failed to cover the consolidation. Even now, the SOL price has crashed 12% as the Solana meme coins and the rest of the cryptos struggle. The entire crypto market is experiencing a significant downturn: Bitcoin dropped to $91.5k, DOGE dropped to $0.23, and the TRUMP meme coin price dropped 14% to $13.03. However, the bigger reason for the SOL token’s downtrend is the upcoming 11.2M SOL unlocks worth $1.7M on March 1 due to the FTX repayment plan. Solana currently trades at $140.47, with a market capitalization of $69.57B, also down significantly. However, its trading volume is up 219% to $8.68B, indicating increased network activity. Analyzing this with the Coinglass report reveals that whales and long-term holders are moving their holdings from exchange wallets, possibly hinting at accumulation. Final Thoughts: Crypto Trader’s $24M Loss Journey The crypto market is quite unpredictable and depends on various factors, but the volatility could bring a crash like today’s. With meme coins like TRUMP and others failing to overcome their losses, the entire market has moved to extreme fear. Its impact is clearly visible in the aforementioned crypto trader and the $24M loss. Another significant point to note is the impact of these meme coins’ decline on the Solana price performance , which has lost 12% of its value in the last 24 hours and 20% over the past week.

The analyst stated that the community is not bullish enough because the asset is forming a strong bullish foundation at higher levels against Bitcoin for the first time in history. #XRP – You’re Not #Bullish Enough! First Time in History: #XRP / #BTC Breakthrough! Listen carefully! I’ve said it before—when #XRP was around $0.50, I told you that buying at those levels would make you look like a crypto god in the future. I also warned you that buying… pic.twitter.com/kEzj4NgvZv — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) February 24, 2025 Historic Market Behavior EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis focuses on XRP/BTC historical price movements. The chart illustrates three past cycles where XRP experienced sharp upward movements but failed to consolidate in the upper range. In previous cycles, the price surged before entering a bear market, with minimal sustained consolidation at the higher levels. This time, however, XRP is showing a different trajectory. Instead of experiencing an immediate breakout, it establishes a structured consolidation pattern. This development suggests that the market is preparing for a more sustained rally rather than a short-lived surge followed by a downturn. Current Market Position and Key Support Levels XRP currently trades at 0.00002584 BTC, and the analysis identifies a critical range between 0.000023 BTC and 0.00003 BTC, where the asset is forming a strong support zone. This pattern is a significant shift because XRP has never built a solid foundation at this level in past cycles. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP is already rising against Ethereum , and the price action within this range is crucial in determining whether XRP will sustain bullish momentum against Bitcoin. The key downside level to watch is 0.000016 BTC. Falling below this threshold could signal a major bearish trend, making recovery more difficult. Conversely, maintaining a position above 0.000023 BTC would indicate continued strength, reinforcing the possibility of an eventual breakout. Breakout Confirmation and Potential Target Levels EGRAG CRYPTO highlights two primary confirmation levels that traders should monitor. A sustained close above 0.000024 BTC would suggest a bullish foundation is forming. More significantly, closing above 0.000034 BTC would confirm a major breakout, potentially setting the stage for substantial price gains. If this breakout occurs, the analysis projects target levels at 0.000046 BTC, 0.000136 BTC, and 0.00036 BTC. At current prices, this would push XRP’s value to $33.81, a 780.5% increase from its all-time high. Experts have predicted for years that Bitcoin will lose dominance against XRP . This upcoming breakout could kickstart that trend. EGRAG CRYPTO drew attention to previous statements where he warned that buying below $1 would become a thing of the past. The analyst emphasized that this could be the last opportunity for investors to accumulate XRP at these levels before a major move upward.

In a recent tweet, the analytics firm highlighted that the meme coin market capitalization is nearing its November 2024 levels. Such a trend effectively depicted the undoing of the surge witnessed during the winter “meme coin season.” Meme Coin Meltdown The OG meme coin – Dogecoin (DOGE) – which rallied from around $0.20 before the election to a multi-year high of almost $0.5 following Donald Trump’s victory on November 5, 2024, has since retraced most of its gains. It is currently trading at $0.20 after this morning’s market-wide crash. Next up was Shiba Inu (SHIB), which experienced a similar trajectory as it plunged from December’s peak of $0.000033 to $0.0000133 – lower than the pre-election levels. Additionally, Pepe’s (PEPE) price more than halved from $0.0000264 in December to $0.00000575, marking a 78% decline over two months. Bonk (BONK), too, mirrored this trend, crashing from a December high of $0.000054 to $0.0000125 by late February. FLOKI’s (FLOKI) price tumbled from $0.00027 in late November to $0.000077 as of February 24th. Notably, dogwifhat (WIF) experienced a dramatic drop, plummeting over 89% from $4.20 shortly after the election to $0.51 at the time of writing. Bitcoin and XRP Retain Strong Post-Election Gains Despite the broader market downturn, Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP have managed to hold their post-election gains, distinguishing themselves from the steep declines across the meme coin sector. Bitcoin was trading near $65,400 before the election results and soared above $109,000 in January. Although it has pulled back, the leading crypto asset remains strong, currently trading near $90,000 – still over 42% above its November level. Similarly, XRP climbed from $0.706 in early November to $3.33 in January. Despite a subsequent decline to $2.21, the token remains up by a whopping 245% since the election period. Its rally has been propelled by growing anticipation over XRP ETFs, especially after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recognized multiple filings in early February. However, it was Brazil that approved the world’s first spot XRP ETF. The fund, set to launch on the B3 exchange, will be managed by Hashdex with administrative support from Genial Investimentos. At the same time, the SEC is examining spot XRP ETF applications in the US from leading asset managers including 21Shares, Bitwise, Grayscale, and CoinShares. The divergence highlighted the trajectory maintained by established cryptocurrencies amidst heightened market volatility and profit-taking in speculative assets such as meme coins.

Here’s Why Investors Are Watching Closely,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pepeto-the-next-100x-meme-coin-heres-why-investors-are-watching-closely/,"Meme coins have completely changed the game in crypto investing, proving that early adopters can see massive gains. Shiba Inu’s legendary 1000x surge turned a modest investment into millions, and Pepe Token’s rise to a $1.65 billion market cap showed how powerful meme-driven momentum can be. But with these tokens now well-established, their potential for another explosive breakout is limited—leading investors to search for the next big opportunity. Many now believe that Pepeto is the one to watch. Elon Musk Sparks the Frog Meme Coin Trend Elon Musk has always had the ability to shift market narratives, and his latest move—changing his X profile picture to a frog—has strengthened the belief that frog-themed meme coins are the next major trend. The rise of Pepe Unchained and Wall Street Pepe further supports this momentum, proving that frogs are dominating the meme coin space in 2025. In the past, Musk’s influence has sent Dogecoin and Floki skyrocketing, and with frogs now in focus, investors are scrambling to find the next high-growth token. What Makes Pepeto Different? Unlike meme coins that rely purely on hype and speculation, Pepeto brings real utility to the table. It powers PepetoSwap, a zero-fee decentralized exchange that only lists verified, scam-free projects, offering investors a safe and transparent trading experience. In addition, its cross-chain bridge technology allows seamless movement of assets between blockchains, making Pepeto more than just a meme—it’s a functional crypto asset. Why Pepeto Could See Explosive Growth The best investment opportunities come before mass adoption, and Pepeto is still in its presale phase, giving early buyers a chance to get in before the hype takes off. Once PepetoSwap launches, traders will flock to an exchange that eliminates fees and ensures security, driving up demand for Pepeto. Higher trading volume means greater scarcity, leading to price increases. A New Year’s Message from the God of Frogs As the New Year begins, the God of Frogs, Pepeto Himself, shares a message of triumph and faith for the loyal Pepeto Army: The Plan Unfolds: The roadmap progresses flawlessly, as foretold. Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 With frog season in full effect, Pepeto is positioned as the next major meme coin breakout of 2025.

Recently, speculation intensified over whether the SEC would proceed with its appeal against the ruling on XRP’s programmatic sales. This uncertainty was heightened by the SEC’s abrupt dismissal of its case against Coinbase (COIN), leading many to wonder if a similar retreat in the Ripple lawsuit was imminent. However, Ripple’s case presents challenges that could complicate the SEC’s strategy. Adding another layer of intrigue, a recent Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigation has brought to light potential conflicts of interest within the SEC. Reports indicate that former SEC Chair Gary Gensler withheld the findings before stepping down. Since then, Acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce have remained silent, fueling speculation that the report contains damning evidence of regulatory misconduct. If these findings confirm bias in the SEC’s handling of cryptocurrency cases, it could dramatically impact the agency’s approach to the Ripple lawsuit. OIG Investigation Uncovers Possible SEC Bias The non-profit watchdog group Empower Oversight (EO) first raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest within the SEC, prompting the OIG to launch an investigation. At the center of the controversy is former SEC Director of Corporation Finance Bill Hinman, whose actions and affiliations have raised red flags regarding possible favoritism in crypto regulation. William Hinman’s 2018 speech was a landmark moment. In it, he stated that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) did not qualify as securities, significantly influencing how the market views these cryptocurrencies. However, his close ties to the law firm Simpson Thacher—part of a group that actively promoted Ethereum—have led to accusations of bias. While serving at the SEC, Hinman reportedly continued interacting with Simpson Thacher despite explicit warnings from the agency’s Ethics Division. More concerning are allegations that he received millions of dollars in financial benefits from the firm during his tenure there. After leaving the agency, he rejoined Simpson Thacher, further deepening concerns over potential conflicts of interest. These revelations could significantly affect the SEC’s credibility, especially if the OIG report confirms unethical conduct. Proof of this would undermine the legitimacy of the SEC’s enforcement actions against Ripple and other crypto firms. The agency’s failure to provide transparency has prompted EO and Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett to file Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests seeking the full OIG report. However, with the SEC refusing to release the findings, EO has taken legal action to force disclosure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple Case and XRP’s Market Prospects With the Ripple lawsuit hanging in the balance, XRP’s price has reacted to market uncertainty. As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.15, reflecting a 13.55% decline within a day. The broader crypto market also edged lower by 0.08%, bringing its total valuation to $3.14 trillion. Despite these fluctuations, XRP remains well below its January 16 peak of $3.3999 and its all-time high of $3.84 set in 2018. Several factors will influence its price trajectory in the coming weeks: SEC’s Appeal Decision: If the SEC withdraws its appeal, it could signal a major victory for Ripple, potentially pushing XRP beyond its all-time high of $3.84. However, if the legal battle drags on, prices could struggle to surpass $1.50. ETF Developments: Approving an XRP-spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) could drive institutional interest and propel prices toward $5 . With mounting pressure for the SEC to disclose the OIG findings and growing doubts about its legal standing, the next phase of the Ripple lawsuit could be more unpredictable than ever. If the investigation exposes misconduct, it could reshape the case and alter the regulatory landscape for the entire crypto industry.

Industry members have met with the SEC over spot ETF approvals and enforcement approaches. XRP has crashed 8% in the past days but investors can expect a rebound if XRP ETF is approved. The long-running battle between Ripple Labs and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been key for XRP’s market moves. XRP’s price action largely depends on the resolution of the lawsuit and the approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. American exchange Coinbase recently announced that the SEC was close to dismissing its lawsuit against the exchange. This action is similar to the SEC’s recent decision to drop its case against OpenSea, a leading NFT marketplace. SEC Enforcement Approach “Changing” Furthermore, the SEC has closed its investigation into Robinhood Crypto, signaling a notable change in the agency’s approach to enforcement. While Kraken and Uniswap still face potential lawsuits, the general trend suggests the SEC may be pulling back from its aggressive regulatory stance against major crypto firms.

Many investors want to know what the price of DOGE will be when February 2025 arrives. One Dogecoin is selling at $0.2593; if technical data is to be taken at face value, it might drop over the next weeks. Changelly thinks the price will fall by -2.82% to reach that level by February 9th, 2025, if experts project an average trade price of $0.236. Dogecoin’s predicted February price range runs from a low of $0.216 to a high of $0.255. With 71% of indicators showing a negative view and the Dread & Greed Index scoring 44, suggesting general investor dread, the market attitude seems pessimistic. Dogecoin has seen 40% positive trading days over the past 30 days; nevertheless, its 50-day moving average is still declining, indicating temporary weakness. Furthermore, the 200-day moving average has declined since early February, underlining a long-term trend. These elements make Dogecoin’s possibility of a significant February surge doubtful, forcing investors to look for other cheap cryptocurrencies that match its prior performance. Dogecoin 7 days price change | Source: Changelly Which Cheap Crypto Below $1 Will Be 2025’s DOGE?

Shiba Inu’s historic 1000x surge and Pepe Token’s rise to a $1.65 billion market cap made early adopters rich, but with these coins now well-established, investors are hunting for the next big opportunity. Many believe Pepeto could be that next explosive token. Elon Musk & The Rise of Frog Meme Coins Elon Musk has a long history of influencing crypto markets, and his recent X profile update featuring a frog has added fuel to the growing frog-themed meme coin movement. Following this, tokens like Pepe Unchained and Wall Street Pepe have started gaining momentum, signaling a new trend taking shape. We’ve seen how Musk’s backing helped Dogecoin and Floki explode, and now frog coins could be next in line for massive growth. What Makes Pepeto Different? Unlike meme coins that rely only on social media hype, Pepeto brings real utility. It powers PepetoSwap, a zero-fee exchange built to list only safe, verified projects, making it one of the few platforms tackling scams and rug pulls in the space. Additionally, its cross-chain capabilities allow users to move assets easily across different blockchains, giving Pepeto real-world use beyond just being a meme. Why Pepeto’s Price Could Skyrocket The best time to invest in a meme coin is before the hype reaches the masses, and Pepeto is still in its presale phase. With PepetoSwap set to launch soon, demand for the token is expected to surge, attracting traders looking for a zero-fee and secure trading experience. As volume increases, so does scarcity, which could drive Pepeto’s price to new heights. With frog season in full effect, Pepeto is emerging as one of the strongest meme coin contenders of 2025. The question is: will you get in before it takes off?

40807843,https://coinpedia.org/?p=424577,1740469875,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Kanye West Memecoin Launch Delayed: Will YZY Ever Go Live?,https://coinpedia.org/news/kanye-west-memecoin-launch-delayed-will-yzy-ever-go-live/,"The post Kanye West Memecoin Launch Delayed: Will YZY Ever Go Live? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Just a few days after the unpleasant ‘rise and fall’ of LIBRA, a meme coin backed by Argentinian president Javier Milei, another meme coin has triggered discussions in the cryptocurrency market . This time, American rapper, designer, and entrepreneur Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, is the one who is preparing to try his luck in the meme coin sector – which is already a highly saturated market. He was supposed to launch his meme coin, named YZY, on February 20. But the launch was postponed to an undisclosed date. He is facing serious criticisms for his anti-Semitic statements. The big question is: Will Ye ever launch YZY? A polymarket bet predicts that there is only a 36% probability that Ye will launch a meme coin before the end of this month. Let’s analyse the entire scenario in depth! Ready? BREAKING It’s confirmed, Kanye West is launching his memecoin next week. I will be the first to share it, turn on notis. pic.twitter.com/9odJltWVRX — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) February 22, 2025 YZY Coin and Its Purpose YZY is designed as a meme coin, similar to Dogecoin . Unlike most meme coins, Ye’s meme coin will have some utility. It will function as the official currency of the Yeezy brand and website. This means that this token will be accepted as payment on the Yeezy webitse. Why Is Kanye Turning to Crypto? Actually, it was when Ye’s pro-Nazi stance brought his business empire to a situation of partial collapse that the rapper entered the crypto industry to prevent his empire from falling into the pit of total collapse. Since 2022, the year when he publicly expressed his respect towards Adolf Hitler, his business relationship with top brands like Adidas and Baleciaga has slowly weakened. At one point, even his talent agency detached its tie with him. Embracing the crypto industry is expected to give him an opportunity to create an alternative to mainstream platforms. Ye’s YZY: Tokenomics and Allocation According to sources, at least 70% of the tokens of YZY will be owned by Ye, nearly 20% will be released for investors, and around 10% will be earmarked for the liquidity purpose of the YZY market. It appears that the YZY market aims to follow the same tokenomics pattern as Dogecoin – the topmost meme coin by market cap. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Crash: XRP, ADA and Other Top Altcoins To Buy As BTC Dips Below $91000 , Will YZY Ever be Launched? It is doubtful whether it is the right time to release a meme coin. Except the striking success of TRUMP – a meme coin released by the family of US President Donald Trump, not many celebrity meme coins have experienced success in the recent history of the meme coin market. The collapse of LIBRA , a meme coin based by Argentina president Javier Milei, is the latest of the depressing failures the market has witnessed in its recent history. In the last 24 hours, the meme coin market has seen a drop of 14.8%. Dogecoin has declined by 10.6%; Shiba Inu by 9%; Pepe by 14.1% and Bonk by 15.3%. And, even Official Trump has witnessed a fall of 15.6%. Anyway, reports say that Ye will release his meme coin by the end of the week itself. Can YZY taste success?

As Bitcoin's price dropped, the market saw nearly a billion dollars wiped out, highlighting how macroeconomic policies are increasingly influencing digital assets. Trump confirmed that tariffs on Canada and Mexico were proceeding as planned, stating that the U.S. had been treated unfairly by its trade partners. His remarks triggered a sell-off in the crypto market, causing a steep decline in Bitcoin and other digital assets. This is not the first time tariffs have affected the market, as a similar event earlier this year led to even larger losses. Bitcoin’s reaction underscores its growing sensitivity to economic policies. As market uncertainty grew, many traders saw their positions liquidated, with the majority being long positions. Investors who had anticipated a price rise were caught off guard by the sudden drop. Despite the market turmoil, some investors viewed the dip as a buying opportunity. Michael Saylor and Robert Kiyosaki encouraged traders to accumulate Bitcoin during the downturn, calling it a chance to invest at lower prices amid economic uncertainty. This perspective aligns with a broader sentiment that Bitcoin remains a long-term asset despite short-term fluctuations. Meanwhile, some analysts pointed out that Trump’s policies have erased a significant portion of the crypto market’s value since the beginning of his second term. The connection between regulatory decisions and price action continues to shape investor sentiment, reinforcing how external events impact digital assets. Looking ahead, market participants remain watchful for further policy changes that could drive volatility. While the tariff announcement triggered a sharp decline, a potential policy shift or easing of trade tensions could lead to a rebound. As global economic factors play a larger role in the crypto landscape, traders and investors must navigate an increasingly complex environment.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-25 07:51:49

In his post, the SBF account discussed the company's layoffs and management issues. SBF published a series of 10 tweets about the layoffs, referencing Elon Musk's efforts to have federal employees email their work activities last week or risk resigning. “Firing people is one of the hardest things in the world. It’s bad for everyone involved. More often, the problem is that the company doesn’t have the right job for them. “I would tell anyone we laid off: It was our fault because we didn't provide the right role for them, the right person to manage them or the right work environment for them.” Following this post by SBF, FTT briefly rose by over 29%. A source told Coindesk that SBF does not have direct access to sites like X or email, but can send messages through the Corrlinks system, which allows prisoners in the US to communicate with others. However, it is not yet clear who tweeted on behalf of Sam Bankman-Fried. Trump Pardoned, I Joined DOGE! SBF's posting after 2 years also prompted scammers to take action, and a fake SBF account claimed that he was pardoned by US President Donald Trump and joined DOGE. The fake SBF account later announced that a memecoin had been mined along with a related contract address. The account was then given a grey verification X, indicating that the account belongs to a government or multilateral organization. This indicates that there has been clear identity and information fraud associated with the account. Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence after being convicted in November 2023 on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. He is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn while his attorneys appeal his conviction. *This is not investment advice.

GOP divisions have led to unexpected setbacks, raising doubts about whether these bills can gain momentum. Over the past few months, nearly 30 states have introduced legislation to add Bitcoin to state reserves, aiming to use it as a hedge against inflation. Industry experts believe that successful approvals could trigger billions in acquisitions, increasing demand for Bitcoin as its supply continues to shrink. However, momentum has stalled as Republican lawmakers have increasingly voted against these measures. Montana’s House of Representatives recently rejected a Bitcoin Reserve proposal, with a significant number of Republicans voting against it . In North Dakota, opposition was even stronger despite the state’s conservative leanings. Wyoming, known for its pro-crypto stance and home to Senator Cynthia Lummis , also saw a Bitcoin Reserve bill fail. These rejections indicate that not all Republicans are aligned with Donald Trump’s vision for digital asset reserves. During his campaign, Trump expressed support for a national Bitcoin Reserve and later signed an executive order to explore digital asset stockpiling. However, state-level opposition within his own party could hinder efforts to advance this initiative. If Republicans continue to block these bills, the project may struggle to gain traction. Other states are experiencing similar resistance. While Utah advanced a proposal, Texas has seen increasing debate. The state’s Lieutenant Governor has labeled the initiative a key priority, but critics argue it poses risks to taxpayer funds. Media outlets have also raised concerns, questioning whether public money should be used to support crypto investments. Despite these obstacles, the crypto industry remains committed to pushing for Bitcoin Reserve legislation. Advocates are prepared to invest political capital into lobbying efforts, making this an important test of the industry’s influence within the GOP and Congress .

The exchange admitted that some U.S. users accessed its services without proper licensing, closing a long-running investigation. OKX framed the situation as a past oversight, emphasizing that it now maintains industry-leading compliance standards. The company stated that cooperation with regulators was a priority and that this matter is now behind them. As part of the agreement, OKX will pay a fine and forfeit user fees , ensuring it meets regulatory expectations. Despite the settlement, the DoJ's stance on crypto remains strict , with officials describing OKX’s past actions as “flagrant violations” and “blatant disregard.” While other agencies, like the SEC , have recently dropped lawsuits against Coinbase and OpenSea, the DoJ continues to enforce penalties on major exchanges.

Though many believe that the Ripple vs SEC case settlement is imminent, legal experts like MetaLawMan warn of a possible delay in the case. Let’s unveil the possible reasons for the US SEC’s delay in the XRP lawsuit resolution through the eyes of experts and industry leaders. Why the US SEC is Delaying the XRP Lawsuit? Under President Donald Trump’s administration, the SEC is taking a crypto-friendly stance to foster industry growth in the country. This shift is marked by advancements in ETFs and resolutions in lawsuits, fostering optimism among investors and industry players. Despite this positive stance, the imminent settlement of the XRP lawsuit remains uncertain, as noted by lawyer MetaLawMan. In a recent X post , lawyer James Murphy, known on X as MetaLawMan, sounded a cautious note on the potential delay in the SEC’s settlement of the XRP lawsuit. While the SEC reportedly closed its investigation into Robinhood , speculation surrounds a potential early conclusion to the Ripple vs SEC case. However, MetaLawMan suggested that a resolution for Ripple may not be imminent, placing it behind Gemini, Kraken, and Binance in terms of potential lawsuit outcomes. Unveiling the Complexities Surrounding Ripple vs SEC Previously, MetaLawMan suggested that the XRP lawsuit could be settled before Ripple files its appellate brief on April 16, 2025. The lawyer’s statement rules out the possibility of a swift resolution. Notably, the lawyer bases his assumptions on the complexities surrounding the Ripple vs SEC case. One of the key factors leading to the delay is Judge Analisa Torres’ XRP judgment and Ripple’s $125 million penalty. Reiterating his previous statements, MetaLawMan posited in his recent post, The only reason I list Ripple last is the complexity involved in negotiating a resolution. Ripple is the only live crypto case with a final judgment in place. So, the SEC & Ripple lawyers must negotiate what to do about the judgment & the money escrowed for that judgment. That takes time. Conflicts of Interest: A Surprising Turn Reportedly, US government insider Empower Oversight (EO) has raised concerns over the potential conflicts of interest within the SEC. In particular, EO alleged that Bill Hinman, the former SEC Director, was biased against Ripple and XRP. This view arises from Hinman’s classification of Bitcoin and Ethereum as the only non-securities. Significantly, the Hinman controversy revolves around his ties to the law firm Simpson Thatcher which has connections to Ethereum. EO alleged that Hinman received millions from the law firm for classifying Ethereum as a non-security. Despite warnings, Hinman continued meeting with Simpson Thacher employees, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. If the Office of the Inspector General confirms conflicts of interest, the SEC may face increased pressure to withdraw its appeal. This could significantly be influencing the ongoing XRP lawsuit. How Will Coinbase and Robinhood Cases Impact XRP Lawsuit? In a surprising development, the SEC dismissed charges against Coinbase and terminated its investigation into Robinhood. Additionally, the SEC acknowledged XRP ETF applications submitted by various investment firms including Grayscale, CoinShares, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and Bitwise. This marks a significant shift from the agency’s previous “regulation by enforcement” moves. Though the regulator’s recent moves have sparked optimism, uncertainty still surrounds the resolution of the XRP lawsuit. Lawyer Jeremy Hogan is optimistic that the Ripple lawsuit will conclude by April or May, ahead of a potential US SEC approval for an XRP ETF.

With the constant pull in Bitcoin prices after January’s $108K show, major investors pull their money out of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. On Feb. 24, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $517 million in outflows—the biggest in seven weeks as per data . This marks the fifth straight day of withdrawals, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) losing $159 million and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund seeing $247 million in outflows. Other funds like Bitwise, Invesco, and Grayscale saw big withdrawals, pushing Bitcoin down over 5% to $91K, then further to $89,175, dropping 2.25% in the last hour. Hold or Sell? Blaming Trump’s tariff policy changes, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes warns that Bitcoin could drop to $70,000 as hedge funds unwind their positions. Many of these funds invested in Bitcoin ETFs while betting against Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). This strategy called a “basis trade,” helped them earn profits with minimal risk by taking advantage of the price gap between spot Bitcoin ETFs and futures contracts. However, as Bitcoin’s price drops, hedge funds see reduced profits and are exiting by selling ETF shares and buying back CME futures. Hayes expects this to continue during U.S. trading hours, adding more pressure to Bitcoin. Hayes believes this will continue during U.S. trading hours, adding more pressure to Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin Could Drop to $70,000 Hayes predicts that this selling could send Bitcoin down to $70,000. When hedge funds exit in large numbers, it creates a chain reaction—more selling leads to lower prices, which forces other funds to do the same, making the decline even worse. According to Markus Thielen from 10x Research , much of the demand for Bitcoin ETFs came from hedge funds playing this arbitrage trade rather than long-term investors. Now that these funds are pulling out, Bitcoin’s price is reacting to the sudden lack of demand. If the futures premium drops further, more funds could be forced to sell their ETF shares and buy back their shorted futures, driving Bitcoin even lower. Bitcoin at a Turning Point Bitcoin surged past $100,000 after Trump’s election victory fueled hopes of a Bitcoin strategic reserve. But with ETF investors leaving and hedge funds exiting their trades, Bitcoin is struggling to stay strong. If new buyers don’t step in, Hayes’ warning of Bitcoin dropping to $70,000 could become a reality. The market is rooting for new ETFs at this moment to bring fresh capital into the system to the recover from downmarket. While the SEC is showing its interest in ETFs chances are that the next ETF batch is ready to hit the market.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 07:59:29

The SEC's formation of a new digital asset task force highlights a transition from enforcement-driven regulation to clearer guidelines, aiming to foster innovation while maintaining market integrity. Lummis’s proposal for a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve — envisioning the acquisition of 1 million bitcoins — could position the country as a global leader in digital asset adoption and financial innovation. By Christopher Gannatti, CFA Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) is now at the forefront of a groundbreaking moment in U.S. financial policy. As the newly appointed chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, she takes a pivotal role in shaping how America approaches cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. This move signals Washington's recognition of digital assets as not just a financial tool but a transformative force. When exploring the rich and multifaceted history of the Senate Banking Committee, 1 a closer examination reveals not just the structure of the institution but the essence of its role in shaping the modern financial landscape. Since its formal establishment in 1913, the committee has been a cornerstone of American economic governance, with Senator Robert Owen of Oklahoma serving as its inaugural chairman. This pivotal body has evolved alongside the nation's economic demands, steering policies that define monetary stability, housing accessibility and global financial relations. The Big Picture: Committee's Core Responsibilities At its heart, the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee functions as a guardian of the financial system. Its jurisdiction spans a strikingly broad array of critical sectors: Banking and Financial Institutions: Encompassing the regulatory oversight of banks, credit unions and financial services — the backbone of daily economic life. Federal Monetary Policy: Steering the levers of inflation, employment and economic growth through collaboration with the Federal Reserve. Housing and Urban Development: Addressing the fundamental human need for affordable housing and sustainable urban spaces. Mass Transit and Community Development: Building frameworks that connect people to opportunities, particularly in underserved areas. International Trade and Finance: Navigating the complexities of global markets and America's position within them. Economic Policy: Crafting legislation that influences everything from personal prosperity to national competitiveness. Subcommittees: The Engines of Focused Impact Given the vast purview of the committee, the work is divided among six specialized subcommittees, each with its own mission and legislative focus: Economic Policy: A realm where big questions about growth, price stability and employment are tackled. Think Federal Reserve dynamics and macroeconomic levers. Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection: The watchdogs of financial stability, overseeing deposit insurance, banks, credit unions and the regulatory agencies that keep them in check — entities like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ((OCC)) and National Credit Union Association (NCUA). Housing, Transportation, and Community Development: A vision for equitable urban spaces, focusing on mass transit systems, community development and affordable housing initiatives. National Security and International Trade and Finance: The nexus of global finance and security, from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to export controls and international economic policies. Securities, Insurance, and Investment: The gatekeepers of capital markets and securities — oversight here ensures trust in the markets that fuel entrepreneurship and growth. Digital Assets: A newly established subcommittee reflecting the committee's adaptability to emerging financial innovations. This subcommittee focuses on the regulation of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, the development of blockchain technology and the oversight of fintech innovations, ensuring these technologies are integrated into the financial system responsibly and equitably. A Committee Rooted in Context, Yet Future-Focused Understanding the Senate Banking Committee is as much about looking back as it is about looking forward. Its origins are steeped in the regulatory demands of a post-industrial economy, yet its modern focus includes questions of cryptocurrency, fintech innovation and climate finance. This duality makes it one of the most consequential bodies in the Senate. A Clear Mission in a Complex Landscape The creation of this subcommittee under the Senate Banking Committee isn't just a formality; it's a declaration. The mission? To strike the balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers in an increasingly complex digital economy. The priorities are clear: 1 Market Structure: Establishing a robust framework for cryptocurrency markets that welcomes innovation without sacrificing stability. Stablecoin Regulation: Addressing the rise of stablecoins with clear rules that mitigate risks and enhance trust. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Assessing the feasibility of a national bitcoin reserve — an idea uniquely championed by Senator Lummis. Lummis's Vision: Innovation Meets Strategy Known colloquially as the ""crypto queen"" of Capitol Hill, Senator Lummis has long advocated for integrating digital assets into the U.S. financial fabric. Her proposal for a strategic bitcoin reserve — envisioning the acquisition of 1 million bitcoins over five years — is as audacious as it is strategic. 2 It's not just about owning digital gold; it's about positioning the United States as the leading innovator in the financial world. A Broader Push for Common Sense In a Republican-led Congress, there's a renewed focus on creating regulatory frameworks that encourage domestic innovation. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott (R-SC) summed it up: Innovation must happen on American soil, not overseas. This isn't just rhetoric; it's a policy direction aimed squarely at making the U.S. a hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. 3 The Security and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) Latest Digital Asset Task Force: A Pivotal Moment in Regulation There are moments in history where the regulatory landscape shifts decisively, and 2025 appears to be such a moment for digital assets. Recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the formation of a new task force dedicated to digital assets. This initiative is more than just another bureaucratic response — it's a clear sign that the SEC recognizes the pivotal role cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies will play in the global economy. A Shift in Strategy: From Enforcement to Clarity For years, the SEC has relied on enforcement actions to regulate the nascent digital asset sector. This approach — while effective at curbing bad actors — created uncertainty for innovators and investors alike. Imagine trying to build a skyscraper without knowing whether zoning laws would allow it. Such ambiguity stifles progress. Enter the SEC's new task force. Led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, this initiative aims to provide clear guidelines for market participants. 4 It's an ambitious plan that includes defining regulatory boundaries, creating feasible pathways for token registration and crafting disclosure frameworks tailored to digital assets. This shift signals the agency's willingness to engage with the crypto community instead of simply policing it. Why Now? Several forces are converging to make this the perfect time for regulatory clarity. First, the scale of adoption is undeniable. What was once the realm of tech enthusiasts has entered the portfolios of pension funds 5 and Fortune 500 treasuries. 6 Second, the global competition is heating up. Jurisdictions like Singapore, Switzerland and the UAE have established crypto-friendly regulations, 7 creating a competitive imperative for the U.S. to avoid falling behind. Third, the federal government itself is moving. A recent executive order from President Trump established a working group to explore a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, including the potential creation of a national digital asset stockpile. 8 This broader policy direction underscores that Washington views digital assets not just as financial tools but as strategic assets. The Stakes This isn't just about Bitcoin or Ethereum. It's about the infrastructure of the future. Tokenized real estate, decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain tracking — these are industries that will redefine the economic landscape. Regulatory clarity will be the foundation upon which these innovations are built. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: A Game-Changer? A U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve isn't just a bold idea; it's a policy lever with enormous implications. By leveraging federal resources to hold bitcoin, the United States could: Hedge against global economic uncertainties. Establish a benchmark for integrating digital assets into national reserves. Influence global cryptocurrency markets with a strategic advantage. The numbers are intriguing. The U.S. government already holds more than 200,000 bitcoins, largely seized through law enforcement efforts like the infamous Silk Road case. 9 The recent presidential pardon of Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road's founder, adds a fascinating twist to this narrative. 10 His release reignites debates about the ethical and legal dimensions of these seizures while also highlighting the practical value of these assets. Folding these holdings into a formal reserve strategy could turn past law enforcement actions into future financial advantages. Final Thoughts Under Senator Lummis's leadership, the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets is poised to take the United States into uncharted territory. This isn't just about regulating digital assets; it's about embracing their transformative potential. In the years to come, this subcommittee may well define the rules of the game for a financial revolution — ensuring that the United States leads not just in policy but in vision. In the journey that we expect to see in this space in 2025, this is a big, early step in the first days of the second Trump administration.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 148,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is currently testing whether support at around $90,000 will hold. According to the crypto strategist, he expects Bitcoin to mimic its late 2024 price action when it plunged to the 0.382 Fibonacci level before sparking a massive move up. “As expected BTC local lows being re-tested… I haven’t seen that larger washout yet into the lower Fibonacci level that I’m also looking for.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC will fall to around $80,000. Zooming out, Dave the Wave says he’s keeping a close watch on the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator on the weekly chart. The MACD is a widely used indicator to identify an asset’s current trend. According to the trader, BTC’s MACD on the weekly timeframe will hit the zero line level to reset en route to tapping the 0.382 Fibonacci level. “Technically superb BTC price action in this current bull market. Something like an April low on the basis of this.” Source: Dave the Wave/X But while Dave the Wave is bearish on the prospects of BTC in the coming months, he believes that the deep drawdown will set the stage for a Bitcoin rally to around $180,000 by the end of the year. “Why complicate things?” Source: Dave the Wave/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading $91,529.

The company, led by Michael Saylor , continues to expand its holdings, reinforcing its position as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin investors. The latest acquisition follows a $2 billion stock offering , with proceeds directed toward increasing Bitcoin reserves. While this aggressive strategy reflects long-term confidence in digital assets, the company’s stock has underperformed in recent months. Despite steady accumulation, MSTR shares have dropped, raising concerns about the financial risks tied to Bitcoin’s price volatility. Saylor’s strategy has been consistent—using capital from stock sales to fund Bitcoin purchases. However, market conditions have presented challenges. Bitcoin's price weakness has impacted both the cryptocurrency and Strategy’s stock performance, making some investors cautious about the firm’s financial stability. In addition to stock offerings, Strategy has introduced new financial products, such as perpetual securities, to diversify its capital-raising approach. Institutional investors, including BlackRock, now hold a portion of the company’s shares, underscoring the scale of these transactions. Some analysts speculate that these large Bitcoin acquisitions could create tax complexities, but Saylor remains focused on long-term growth. Looking ahead, Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has continued to decline, suggesting a potential supply shock in the future. If Bitcoin enters another bullish phase, Strategy’s aggressive accumulation could pay off. However, the company’s reliance on stock sales raises questions about sustainability, especially if bearish conditions persist.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-25 08:04:40

Right now, the needle is pointing firmly towards ‘worrying’. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a key indicator of market sentiment, has just plummeted to its lowest level since September 2024, signaling a significant shift in investor mood. But what exactly does this mean for you and your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive into the details and understand what’s driving this wave of fear in the crypto sphere. Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: A Sentiment Thermometer Think of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index as a sentiment thermometer for the digital asset market. It’s not about predicting the future price of Bitcoin or Ethereum, but rather gauging the overall emotions and attitudes of crypto investors. Developed by Alternative.me, this index aggregates various data points to provide a simple, easy-to-understand score ranging from 0 to 100. Here’s a quick breakdown: 0-25: Extreme Fear – This zone suggests investors are excessively worried, potentially leading to panic selling and suppressed prices. Historically, some see this as a potential buying opportunity, as fear can drive prices below intrinsic value. 26-49: Fear – Indicates a cautious market sentiment where investors are apprehensive and risk-averse. 50: Neutral – Represents a balanced market sentiment with neither strong fear nor greed dominating. 51-75: Greed – Signals increasing optimism and confidence in the market, potentially leading to increased buying pressure and rising prices. 76-100: Extreme Greed – Suggests excessive market exuberance, often seen as a potential bubble territory. Historically, extreme greed can precede market corrections. Currently, the index stands at a chilling 25, firmly in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. This marks a significant 24-point drop from the previous day and the lowest reading since September 6, 2024, when it touched 22. This rapid descent from ‘Neutral’ territory highlights a dramatic shift in crypto market sentiment . Decoding the Index: What Factors Fuel Fear? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number generator. It’s calculated using a weighted average of six key market indicators, providing a holistic view of market emotions. Let’s break down these components: Volatility (25%) : Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often breeds fear as investors become uncertain about price stability. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Analyzes Bitcoin’s market momentum and trading volume compared to recent averages. Weakening momentum or declining volume can indicate waning investor interest and growing fear. Social Media (15%) : Tracks sentiment on social media platforms, primarily Twitter and Reddit, using sentiment analysis tools. Negative sentiment online can reflect and amplify market fears. Surveys (15%) : Although currently paused, this component historically used polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the rest of the cryptocurrency market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a flight to safety during periods of fear, as investors move away from riskier altcoins. Google Trends (10%) : Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries, particularly fear-related terms. A spike in fear-related searches can signal growing market anxiety. The current plunge in the index suggests a confluence of negative signals across these factors, painting a picture of widespread anxiety in the crypto market. Why is Market Volatility Spiking Fear Right Now? Market volatility is inherent in the cryptocurrency world, but recent events have amplified these swings, contributing significantly to the current ‘Extreme Fear’ reading. Several factors could be at play: Broader Economic Uncertainty : Global economic headwinds, including inflation concerns, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions, are impacting all markets, including crypto. Uncertainty in traditional markets often spills over into the crypto space. Regulatory Scrutiny : Increased regulatory attention and enforcement actions in various jurisdictions can create uncertainty and fear among crypto investors. News of potential crackdowns or stricter regulations often triggers market downturns. Bearish Price Action : Sustained downward price movements in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum naturally erode investor confidence and breed fear of further losses. Black Swan Events : Unforeseen events, often referred to as ‘black swan’ events, can trigger sudden and sharp market corrections, exacerbating fear and uncertainty. It’s crucial to remember that fear in the market can be self-fulfilling. As the index drops into ‘Extreme Fear’, it can trigger more selling as investors panic and rush to exit their positions, further driving down prices and reinforcing the negative sentiment loop. Investor Fear: Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Red Flag? The million-dollar question is: what should investors do when the Crypto Fear and Greed Index flashes ‘Extreme Fear’? There are two main schools of thought: Contrarian View: Buying Opportunity : Legendary investor Warren Buffett famously advised to be “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” Proponents of this view believe that extreme fear often presents a prime buying opportunity. When everyone is selling and sentiment is at its lowest, asset prices can be undervalued, offering potential for significant gains when the market eventually recovers. Historically, periods of extreme fear in the crypto market have been followed by substantial rallies. Cautionary View: Red Flag : Others interpret extreme fear as a warning sign of further market downturns. They argue that it could signal the beginning of a deeper bear market, and ‘catching a falling knife’ can be risky. This perspective suggests caution, risk management, and potentially reducing exposure to the crypto market until sentiment improves. Ultimately, the right approach depends on your individual risk tolerance, investment strategy, and long-term outlook on the cryptocurrency market. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Actionable Insights for Navigating Extreme Fear Regardless of whether you see the current situation as a buying opportunity or a red flag, here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR) : Don’t make investment decisions based solely on fear or greed. Conduct thorough research on the projects you’re invested in or considering investing in. Understand the fundamentals, technology, and long-term potential. Manage Your Risk : Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Zoom Out and Take a Long-Term Perspective : Cryptocurrency markets are known for their cyclical nature. Bear markets and periods of fear are often followed by bull markets and periods of growth. Focus on the long-term potential of the technology and the asset class rather than short-term price fluctuations. Stay Informed, But Avoid Emotional Decisions : Keep abreast of market news and developments, but avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or panic. Stick to your investment strategy and make rational choices based on your research and analysis. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) : If you believe in the long-term potential of crypto and see this dip as a buying opportunity, consider using dollar-cost averaging. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. DCA can help to smooth out volatility and potentially lower your average entry price over time. Conclusion: Navigating the Fear, Preparing for the Future The Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunging to its lowest level since September is undoubtedly a concerning signal, reflecting widespread fear and uncertainty in the crypto market. However, it’s crucial to remember that market sentiment is cyclical. Extreme fear can present both risks and opportunities. By understanding the factors driving this fear, conducting thorough research, managing risk effectively, and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can navigate these turbulent times and position themselves for potential future growth in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

40808536,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133674,1740471155,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Uncovered: US Authorities Seize $31 Million in Crypto from Uranium Finance Exploit,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-authorities-crypto-confiscation/,"In a significant move highlighting the increasing capabilities of law enforcement in the digital asset space, U.S. authorities have seized a staggering $31 million in cryptocurrency. This crypto confiscation is directly linked to the 2021 exploit of Uranium Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. This operation, spearheaded by the Southern District of New York (SDNY) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), sends a clear message to cybercriminals: the long arm of the law extends into the blockchain. Decoding the Crypto Confiscation: What Happened? Let’s break down this significant development. The operation centers around the 2021 hack of Uranium Finance. To understand the recent crypto confiscation , it’s crucial to revisit the original incident: Uranium Finance Exploit (April 2021): Uranium Finance, an automated market maker (AMM) operating on the Binance BNB chain, suffered a sophisticated cyberattack. Vulnerability Exploited: Hackers targeted a vulnerability within Uranium Finance’s pair contracts. This flaw allowed them to manipulate the system and siphon off funds. Massive Theft: The cybercriminals successfully stole approximately $50 million worth of cryptocurrency in the Uranium Finance exploit . This was a major blow to the DeFi platform and its users. Silent Pursuit: Unbeknownst to many, U.S. law enforcement agencies, including SDNY and HSI, initiated an investigation to track down the stolen funds and the perpetrators behind the Uranium Finance exploit . Cryptocurrency Seizure: A Win for Law Enforcement Fast forward to the present, and the efforts of these agencies have borne fruit. The recent announcement of the cryptocurrency seizure of $31 million marks a significant milestone in the fight against crypto crime. This operation demonstrates several key points: Inter-Agency Collaboration: The success of this operation highlights the effective collaboration between different U.S. law enforcement agencies, specifically SDNY and HSI. Their combined expertise was crucial in tracing and recovering the digital assets. Advanced Tracking Capabilities: Despite the pseudonymity often associated with cryptocurrency transactions, authorities are developing and utilizing sophisticated tools and techniques to trace the flow of illicit funds across blockchains. This cryptocurrency seizure is a testament to these advancements. Deterrent Effect: Public announcements of such successful seizures serve as a powerful deterrent to potential cybercriminals. It sends a clear message that illicit activities in the crypto space will not go unpunished, and there are real-world consequences. Partial Recovery: While the seized amount is substantial, it’s important to note that it represents roughly $31 million of the $50 million stolen in the Uranium Finance exploit . The investigation likely remains ongoing to recover the remaining funds and bring the perpetrators to justice. DeFi Hack Recovery: Is This a Turning Point? The DeFi hack recovery in the Uranium Finance case raises important questions about the future of decentralized finance security and regulation. Is this seizure a turning point? Here are some considerations: Aspect Implication Increased Law Enforcement Focus We can expect to see more proactive investigations and interventions by law enforcement agencies in the DeFi space. This DeFi hack recovery sets a precedent. Enhanced Security Measures DeFi platforms and developers will be under increasing pressure to enhance their security protocols and implement more robust measures to prevent exploits. Regulatory Scrutiny Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are likely to pay closer attention to the DeFi sector, potentially leading to clearer regulatory frameworks to protect users and prevent illicit activities. Investor Confidence Successful DeFi hack recovery operations, like this one, can help rebuild investor confidence in the cryptocurrency and DeFi space by demonstrating that losses can be recouped and justice can be served. Blockchain Asset Recovery: How Is It Done? The process of blockchain asset recovery is complex and often involves a combination of technical expertise and legal procedures. While specific details of the Uranium Finance case are not fully public, here’s a general overview of how such recoveries typically occur: Transaction Tracing: Law enforcement utilizes blockchain analytics tools to meticulously trace the movement of stolen funds from the initial point of theft. This involves following transactions across different addresses and potentially even different blockchains. Identifying Custodial Exchanges: Often, cybercriminals attempt to convert stolen crypto into fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies through centralized exchanges. Identifying these exchanges is crucial. Legal Processes: Once the funds are traced to a custodial exchange, authorities can issue legal requests, such as subpoenas and warrants, to compel the exchange to freeze the assets and provide information about the account holders. Seizure and Forfeiture: Upon obtaining the necessary legal authorization, authorities can then seize the cryptocurrency held at the exchange. The process may involve civil or criminal forfeiture proceedings to legally reclaim the assets. International Cooperation: In many cases, cybercriminals operate across borders, requiring international cooperation between law enforcement agencies to effectively track and recover stolen assets. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? This blockchain asset recovery operation offers several important takeaways for individuals and businesses involved in the cryptocurrency space: Security is Paramount: For DeFi users and platform developers, this incident underscores the critical importance of robust security measures and regular audits to prevent exploits. Law Enforcement is Evolving: The capabilities of law enforcement to investigate and recover stolen cryptocurrency are rapidly improving. Criminals should not assume anonymity in the crypto space. Transparency and Regulation: Increased regulatory scrutiny and demands for transparency in the crypto space are likely to continue. This could lead to a more secure and regulated environment in the long run. Hope for Victims: For victims of crypto theft, this case offers a glimmer of hope that stolen assets can be recovered, even in the complex world of cryptocurrency. Conclusion: A Turning Tide Against Crypto Crime? The successful crypto confiscation of $31 million linked to the Uranium Finance exploit is undoubtedly a significant victory for U.S. law enforcement. It demonstrates the increasing sophistication of agencies in tracking and recovering stolen digital assets and serves as a potent warning to cybercriminals operating in the cryptocurrency space. While challenges remain, this operation suggests a potential turning tide in the fight against crypto crime, offering hope for a more secure and accountable digital asset ecosystem.
