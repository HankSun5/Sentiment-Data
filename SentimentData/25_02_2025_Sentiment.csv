Following XRP’s price forecast, analysts set sights on PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a new altcoin that simplifies investment and provides opportunities in the AI and real estate space. PropiChain’s recent market listing on CoinMarketCap spells its potential for a 100x rally once it launches officially. The project leverages the real estate investment space, one of the oldest markets in the world, making a name for itself by eliminating the barriers of traditional property investment. Find out why XRP’s price forecast favors this altcoin. XRP Prepares For Massive Moves Following Its Price Forecast Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared in a post on X that XRP was preparing for a possible breakout from its ascending triangle. The analyst shared that if XRP maintained its bullish outlook, the project could experience a 26% move, and many investors anticipate the results of this price forecast. XRP is priced at about $2.7, surging over 11% within the past week due to the positive investor sentiment surrounding the project. Recently, Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) approved a Hashdex XRP ETF , which shows its potential for mainstream adoption this year. Experts predict that XRP will witness a surge of over 31% by May and analysts say that this price forecast will trigger a rally for other altcoins. That’s why top investors believe that the XRP price forecast could lead to PCHAINS massive rally. Meet PropiChain, The Advanced Real Estate Platform PropiChain is a blockchain platform transforming how individuals invest in real estate. Unlike conventional investment systems, PropiChain offers a diverse range of features like tokenized real estate, a metaverse platform, and AI-driven data. Although XRP’s price forecast has sparked excitement among many investors, PropiChain emerges as the best altcoin for long-term investment. The tokenization of real estate is one of the key features that sets PropiChain ahead of other projects. With PropiChain, you can access a variety of AI-driven tools to help you make informed choices. These tools are useful in analyzing real estate trends, rental income, and market fluctuations to ensure that you make the most of your investment. The PropiChain project offers easy access to blue-chip real estate by allowing traders to own fractions of these assets. So, imagine you want to purchase a luxury apartment that’s worth millions of dollars, but you only have $10,000. With PropiChain, rather than trying to acquire millions to purchase this property, you can own a fraction of it with tokenized shares starting at just $1,000. This unique approach is why experts believe that once the PCHAIN token launches, it could surge as high as $10. PropiChain’s bullish price forecast and dedication to streamlining property ownership show its potential to outpace XRP this year. Another reason why analysts believe PropiChain could outpace XRP’s price forecast is the platform’s efforts toward maintaining safety. The PropiChain project leverages smart contracts to ensure that all activities on the platform are secure and transparent. This Altcoin Prepares For A Massive Rally Post-Launch: Join The PCHAIN Presale! The PropiChain presale is in its second round, and each PCHAIN token is priced at $0.011. Already, over $1.2 million has been raised, and this altcoin has quickly become a top choice among savvy investors. Due to the influx of investors to this altcoin’s presale, over 62% of the tokens allocated to this round have been purchased. Experts believe that once round three starts, this altcoin will witness a surge of over 100%, rising to $0.023. Analysts believe this altcoin could mirror XRP’s price forecast once it lists at $0.032.

According to a new announcement from Robinhood, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is dropping its investigation into the trading app less than a year after sending the firm a Wells Notice. The SEC sent Robinhood a Wells Notice , a formal warning of investigation, in May of last year despite Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev’s claims that the firm met with the regulator over 15 times “in good faith”. “We tried to create what’s called the special purpose broker-dealer for the purpose of transacting crypto assets. We actually came in good faith to meet with the SEC. I think we met with them 16 times and, unfortunately, that was not reciprocated.” Now, with the charges dropped, Robinhood calls for the SEC to regulate with regulations as opposed to enforcement actions. Says Dan Gallagher, Robinhood’s chief legal, compliance and corporate affairs officer, on the SEC’s decision to drop charges, “We applaud the staff’s decision to close this investigation with no action. Let me be crystal clear—this investigation never should have been opened. Robinhood Crypto always has and will always respect federal securities laws and never allowed transactions in securities. As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed. We appreciate the formal closing of this investigation, and we are happy to see a return to the rule of law and commitment to fairness at the SEC.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to the post, the seizure was the result of a joint effort between SDNY and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in San Diego. A spokesperson for SDNY did not return CoinDesk’s request for comment before press time, and no further details about the seizure or any related investigation were immediately available. Uranium Finance was essentially a clone of automated market maker (AMM) Uniswap deployed on Binance’s BNB chain (then called Binance Smart Chain). In April 2021, a hacker exploited a bug in Uranium’s pair contracts to steal $50 million in various tokens. At the time of the incident, the Uranium Finance hack was one of the largest monetary exploits in decentralized finance (DeFi) history.

Uranium Finance shuttered after the hack, leaving victims without answers or financial restitution.

The rest of the world appears to be following the United States’ lead after it set the tone for a crypto-forward 2025. The Trump administration has continued to embrace cryptocurrency and is creating a favorable regulatory environment for crypto companies. As a result, financial institutions across the world are now looking to hop on the digital asset train. The latest is DekaBank, a leading German investment bank managing assets worth approximately €377 billion, has officially launched cryptocurrency trading and custody services tailored for institutional clients. Before the Trump pro-cryptocurrency run, Germany had already laid some groundwork for crypto regulation. Back in 2013, the country became one of the first to recognize cryptocurrencies as financial assets. Then, in 2020, it made BaFin licensing mandatory for all crypto exchanges. DekaBank now offers crypto services The recently announced launch is the result of DekaBank’s meticulous planning and development over the span of two years. In December of 2024, the bank secured a crypto custody license from Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( BaFin ) and the European Central Bank ( ECB ) under the German Banking Act (KWG). This licensure authorizes DekaBank to offer comprehensive crypto custody services, ensuring that institutional clients can securely store and manage their digital assets within a regulated framework. In July of 2024, the bank received a license as a crypto securities registrar for the German issuance of DLT-based digital securities. DekaBank is also not new to the digital asset space. In fact, the bank is a very active member of the community. DekaBank is the founder of SWIAT , the blockchain platform for digital securities and has notable names like Standard Chartered and LBBW as investors. Commerzbank was the first German bank to receive a crypto custody license from BaFin and the European Central Bank and DekaBank followed suit not long after. The bank’s services are exclusively for institutional investors Private buyers are explicitly excluded from DekaBank’s crypto offerings. Bloomberg reports that DekaBank is exclusively offering its crypto services to institutional investors as they have the necessary know-how, resources and infrastructure to professionally manage risks from crypto investments. A board member of DekaBank explained the bank’s position, saying, “We have the necessary experience, the necessary licenses as well as a tested and ready-to-use infrastructure to accompany savings banks and our other institutional customers.” Other companies from the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, the savings bank finance group to which DekaBank belongs, also offer institutional customers access to cryptocurrencies. Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW) has teamed up with Bitpanda to give their corporate clients access to a platform for the custody, buying, and trading of cryptocurrencies. Cooperative banks, Volksbanks and Raiffeisenbanks, under the leadership of DZ bank are in the process of developing their crypto services. They intend to launch officially by mid-year, offering crypto services to private customers. The initiative is being launched alongside IT service provider Atruvia and the Stuttgart Stock Exchange for the German Geno primary banks. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The move has caught the attention of market analysts, with some suggesting that it could be a sign of anticipated price volatility. Massive Token Unlock Raises Questions Solana’s upcoming token unlock event is one of the largest in recent memory, with over $2 billion worth of SOL set to be released into the market. Token unlocks can significantly impact asset prices, often leading to increased supply and downward pressure on value. Given the scale of this event, Wintermute’s decision to withdraw a large quantity of SOL from Binance has raised questions about whether it anticipates a price surge or is positioning itself to manage liquidity as volatility increases. Potential Market Impact of the Unlock Event Large token unlocks can have varied effects on the market. In some cases, they lead to a sell-off as early investors or project teams liquidate their holdings. However, if market demand is strong, the additional supply can be absorbed without significantly affecting prices. Solana has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in recent months, rebounding from its 2022 lows and reclaiming a strong position in the market. Investors are now closely watching whether the upcoming unlock will be met with buying interest or lead to a short-term correction. Wintermute’s Role in Market Liquidity As a market maker, Wintermute plays a crucial role in maintaining liquidity and facilitating trading across exchanges. Its decision to move SOL off Binance could indicate preparations for increased trading activity or plans to deploy liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Historically, market makers have used large-scale token unlocks as opportunities to profit from price movements, whether through short-term trading strategies or arbitrage across different platforms. Broader Implications for Solana’s Ecosystem The Solana ecosystem has been growing rapidly, with a surge in decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and DeFi platforms utilizing its blockchain. While the token unlock represents a potential challenge in terms of market dynamics, strong adoption and institutional interest in Solana could help mitigate any negative effects. Some analysts believe that if Solana can maintain its momentum despite the unlock, it could reinforce confidence in its long-term growth. Others caution that if selling pressure intensifies, the asset could face short-term volatility before finding a new price equilibrium. Conclusion Wintermute’s withdrawal of $38 million in SOL ahead of the $2 billion unlock has added an extra layer of uncertainty to an already significant event for Solana. While token unlocks often lead to increased supply and volatility, Solana’s strong fundamentals and market positioning could help counteract potential selling pressure. Investors will be closely monitoring how the market reacts to the unlock event and whether demand remains strong enough to absorb the new supply. As one of the most-watched cryptocurrencies in the market, Solana’s price action in the coming days could provide valuable insights into broader market sentiment.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|BNB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-24 23:12:00

ETH was last changing hands around $2,600, having dumped back to the south of its 21DMA at $2,700 after briefly hitting $2,850 on Sunday. The world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization remains trapped within multi-week ranges, as it continues to experience elevated sell pressure as it nears it 200DMA just above $2,900. The Ethereum price is now down over 35% from its December highs above $4,000 and remains stuck in a medium-term downtrend. With Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader market also appearing to lose steam, a retest of recent lows in the $2,100s could be on the cards. However, Ethereum could still be a great crypto to accumulate on the dip, owing to what various analysts are referring to as an excellent “risk-reward” profile at current price levels. Big Ethereum Price Bounce Coming? ETH Presents Excellent “Risk Reward” Popular anonymous crypto analyst Doctor Profit argued in a thread on X on Monday that ETH is “the best opportunity in the market”. The big #ETH report – Why I’m Insanely Bullish: This is a long-term analysis of Ethereum (ETH). We are looking at the coming months, not a short-term hype or quick profits.

He also pointed out a multi-year ascending trend channel, and a multi-year ascending triangle formation. Doctor Profit is targeting a rally to the $8,000-$10,000 region this cycle. Fellow crypto analyst Mister Crypto also pointed out this ascending triangle structure, saying that “it doesn’t get any better than this”. Textbook ascending triangle on Ethereum.

Ethereum is heavily undervalued. pic.twitter.com/4FWHgjrkUT — TraderPA (@Trader1PA) February 21, 2025 While volatility could remain elevated in the coming weeks, with further downside likely, Ethereum’s relative underperformance, relatively more “over-sold” market conditions and higher levels of FUD could mean that ETH has less downside risk versus other major cryptos. While there are no guarantees around when the next major market bounce will come, its arguably more favorable price suggests Ethereum has a lot more room to bounce when market sentiment does turn substantially for the better again. Fundamentals Align Towards Ethereum Outperformance The crypto bull market so far this cycle has been characterized by justifiable Bitcoin outperformance. But it has also been characterized, up until the last few weeks anyway, by the outperformance of the low/zero meme coin sector and its associated ecosystem (like the Solana chain), and the relative underperformance of utility cryptos (like Ethereum). That trend could be about to flip. The meme coin market has swooned hard in recent weeks. The Trump meme coin launch and LIBRA scandal has left crypto degenerates and retail exhausted and burnt. Trump coin bagged a lot of people. A President should have never done this. Period. Down 70% from peak. $TRUMP pic.twitter.com/3jDLT8QUye — Prof (@Prof_heist) February 3, 2025 A preference towards cryptos that actually have some underlying value thanks to their underlying utility, but still have massive upside potential, could soon set in. That could see retail traders starting to flood back to undervalued utility plays like Ethereum, Aave (AAVE) and Chainlink (LINK) in droves, rather than chasing the next high-risk, lower-reward meme play. Given that Solana is the main meme coin casino, SOL’s relative outperformance versus ETH could soon flip on its head. That’s especially the case as Ethereum extends its lead over another altcoin in terms of institutional adoption. Having secured spot US ETFs in mid-2024, Ethereum ETFs are soon likely to feature staking, making them substantially more attractive to institutional investors. Whilst ETF inflows have slowed in recent days, they are likely to remain mostly positive this year against the backdrop of the positive shift in the US regulatory environment. FUD may be high right now, but ETH remains the undisputed king of DeFi and, as BlackRock’s preferred altcoin, is likely to remain a major crypto market leader in the years ahead.

Among the many emerging projects, three have stood out—Qubetics ($TICS), EOS, and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). These top cryptos to invest in today offer innovative solutions that aim to solve problems ranging from scalability to decentralized applications. Each project brings its own unique vision, but with so many different blockchain technologies emerging, the real question is: which of these is the best fit for the future of digital finance? In this article, it’ll take a deep dive into Qubetics , EOS, and ICP to help you navigate this exciting landscape.Also explore how Qubetics is making waves with its presale, offering real-world solutions that previous projects have failed to address. So, whether you’re a seasoned investor or just getting started in the crypto space, going to break down why these projects are worth your attention and investment. Let’s explore why Qubetics, EOS, and ICP are making a big impact in today’s crypto market. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace When talk about the top cryptos to invest in today, Qubetics ($TICS) undeniably grabs attention. It’s a project that’s not just about theoretical solutions; it’s focused on solving real-world problems. Qubetics is transforming the way that think about asset tokenization, specifically in terms of real-world assets. The Qubetics Real-World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace is making it easier for businesses, professionals, and individuals to digitize physical assets and tokenize them on the blockchain. What makes Qubetics stand out is its presale success. With more than 489 million tokens sold and over 21,200 holders, Qubetics is clearly gaining traction. The ongoing crypto presale has raised over $14 million, and there’s still a lot of buzz surrounding it. Currently, Qubetics tokens are priced at $0.0888 each, and with the presale nearing its final stages, there’s a real sense of excitement about its growth potential. Analysts are predicting that $TICS will see an 181.52% ROI by the end of the presale, with the price expected to soar to $1 or even $5 after the mainnet launch, offering investors massive returns. As more and more industries move toward blockchain integration, Qubetics offers businesses a seamless way to tokenize their assets and unlock liquidity. With the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the increasing importance of asset-backed tokens, Qubetics positions itself as one of the top cryptos to invest in today—for anyone who believes in the future of decentralized finance and asset tokenization. EOS: Empowering the Decentralized Future Now let’s look at EOS, another key player in the crypto market that has earned its spot as one of the top cryptos to invest in today. EOS is a blockchain protocol that aims to offer high-speed transactions, scalability, and an efficient development environment for decentralized applications (dApps). EOS’s architecture was built to tackle some of the common problems seen in earlier blockchain systems, such as slow transaction speeds and high fees. Launched by block.one, EOS has a unique delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which gives it a distinct advantage over other platforms in terms of scalability. One of the key features that sets EOS apart from other platforms like Ethereum is its ability to process thousands of transactions per second, with minimal fees. This makes it an attractive option for developers looking to build dApps that require high throughput without breaking the bank. As an established blockchain platform, EOS has already seen considerable success in terms of adoption. It’s become a go-to choice for developers aiming to build dApps and smart contracts, and it’s positioning itself as a leader in blockchain scalability. The introduction of tools like EOSIO, a software that enables businesses to launch custom blockchains, further strengthens its market position. Investing in EOS means betting on a project with real-world utility and proven technology. As one of the top cryptos to invest in today, EOS continues to evolve, and its strong developer community is a testament to its growing influence in the blockchain space. Internet Computer Protocol (ICP): The Blockchain for the Web Next up is Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), a project that’s aiming to reimagine how to interact with the internet itself. ICP’s ambitious goal is to create an entirely decentralized internet where applications can run directly on the blockchain, removing the need for centralized servers and traditional cloud services. The project is led by the DFINITY Foundation and seeks to build a new kind of global cloud computing system. Internet Computer stands out by bringing smart contract execution to an entirely new level, allowing developers to build decentralized applications that are much more efficient and scalable than what’s possible on other blockchains. ICP integrates its own version of WebAssembly to provide faster execution times for decentralized apps, which makes it a more practical solution for everyday use cases. What’s particularly exciting about ICP is its potential to drive the next generation of decentralized internet infrastructure. Unlike traditional cloud services, where data is hosted by a few major corporations, ICP promises a more distributed model, making the internet more secure and resilient. This vision of a decentralized web has captured the imagination of many, and it’s no surprise that ICP is considered one of the top cryptos to invest in today. However, ICP is not without its challenges. Despite the excitement, the project has faced some volatility in its price since its launch. But for long-term investors who believe in the vision of a decentralized internet, ICP presents a fascinating opportunity for future growth. Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace: A Deeper Dive into Qubetics’ Vision Now look at Qubetics, EOS, and ICP as some of the top cryptos to invest in today, let’s focus on one of the most exciting aspects of Qubetics—its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace. Tokenization has become a buzzword in the crypto space, and for good reason. It allows tangible assets—whether they’re real estate, art, or even commodities—to be digitized and represented as tokens on the blockchain. Qubetics is streamlining this process, making it easier for businesses and individuals to tokenize their assets in a secure and efficient way.

Per the South Korean media outlets Gukje News and Sky E Daily , officers at the Busan Main Customs Office said they had arrested a man and a woman, both of whom are aged “in their twenties.” The officials do not believe the duo know one another. However, they suspect that both were recruited by the same “drug lord” via a Telegram open channel. South Korean Customs Officers: Drug Lord Paid Smugglers in Crypto The customs office said it had charged the pair with violations of the Narcotics Control Act. A Korean-language Telegram open channel that South Korean customs officials think a ‘drug lord’ used to recruit smugglers as ‘part-time workers.’ (Source: Busan Main Customs Office) Officials think the Telegram channel operator “advertised” on the platform, calling the “opportunity” a “high-paying part-time job.” In total, officials said the duo smuggled over 7kg worth of narcotics into the country. They may also have been involved in distributing narcotics to drug users or local dealers in South Korea. In one instance, one of the suspected “drug smugglers” was been accused of “attempting to import at least 700g of highly concentrated liquid marijuana” into the nation from the United States via South Korea’s Incheon International Airport. The same individual also reportedly “received” 4.5kg of synthetic marijuana from Vietnam. The other individual also imported 1.2kg of synthetic marijuana from Vietnam and then helped “distribute it” to buyers in multiple cities including Suwon. Narcotics seized by Busan-based customs officers. (Source: Busan Main Customs Office) Telegram Open Channel Used as Recruitment Platform, Say Officials Officers added that the “drug lord mastermind” gave the duo “specific instructions” via Telegram chats. The mastermind reportedly paid the two individuals crypto via an “unregistered crypto exchange ” that made payments “difficult to trace.” Officers said they had worked on the case with the Gyeonggi Southern Provincial Police Agency and other law enforcement services. A Busan Customs official told reporters that drug dealers were preying on “young people who are familiar with” social media platforms and crypto.

That is how they turned small investments into massive fortunes with ETH and SOL. After riding the waves of growth with these giants, they’re now shifting their profits into this low cap crypto, RCO Finance , aiming to replicate the same success. They know the cycle: identify an undervalued gem before the masses, accumulate before the surge, and watch your profits flow in. With RCOF’s groundbreaking AI-driven trading and real-world use cases, they see another golden opportunity and they’re taking it. Let’s break down why. Solana and Ethereum Are Stalling While Investors Look Elsewhere Two of its biggest giants in the crypto market, Solana and Ethereum, are struggling to push higher. Solana , which saw an incredible rally over the last few months, recently dipped below its $175 support, sparking concerns of a deeper correction. Bulls attempted to reclaim lost ground, but resistance at $175 has turned into a barrier, keeping the price suppressed. If this level holds, SOL risks sliding further to $155 or even $133, as sellers continue to dominate. Ethereum isn't faring much better. It has been hovering below the key $2,850 level for days, unable to mount a convincing recovery. Although support at $2,500 has held firm, buyers are yet to regain control. If ETH cannot push above the downtrend line, the risk of dropping to $2,400 or even $2,300 remains. Whales who once fueled these coins’ parabolic rise are looking for fresh opportunities, and the lack of upward momentum is causing them to reallocate their funds elsewhere. This is why they’re pouring millions into RCO Finance before it blows up. RCO Finance Is a Game Changer Unlike Solana and Ethereum, which are mature assets with slower growth, RCOF is at the beginning of its journey; offering both real-world utility and the kind of explosive potential that made early ETH and SOL investors millionaires. RCO Finance is a revolutionary AI-powered investment ecosystem designed to remove guesswork from crypto trading. The centerpiece of this ecosystem is the Robo Advisor, a next-generation AI tool that scans the market in real-time to provide precise entry and exit points. Just recently, we saw the TRUMP token explode by 100x within hours. While most traders only jumped in late, the RCO Finance Robo Advisor would have detected its early momentum, analyzing price action, social media trends, and institutional movements, to alert users before the surge. But the AI doesn’t just identify winners; it also protects your portfolio from losses. If a coin in your portfolio suddenly shows signs of a breakdown, the Robo Advisor can trigger automated alerts or even execute trades, ensuring you don’t ride an asset all the way down. And it learns. Over time, its machine-learning algorithms improve, adapting to market conditions and refining predictions. But RCO Finance doesn’t stop at AI-powered trading. The project unlocks an unparalleled level of diversification, offering more than 120,000 investment options. Users can allocate capital across stocks, ETFs, bonds, and even tokenized real estate, all from a single KYC-free platform. Additionally, RCO Finance integrates debit cards, allowing you to spend your holdings instantly. No need to swap assets or go through lengthy conversion processes. You can use your crypto for everyday transactions. Presale Demand Surges as Whales Rush in Before the Next Price Hike Unlike most presales, RCO Finance has launched its Beta platform with over 10,000 active users. So you can see the ecosystem in action before committing. As the project transitions into the alpha phase, even more advanced features are set to roll out, further increasing its appeal. Currently in its fifth presale phase , the token is trading at $0.10, but that price won’t last much longer. Once the next phase kicks in, RCOF will jump to $0.13; a guaranteed 30% increase in just a matter of weeks. The project has already raised over $13 million, and as demand continues to surge, early investors are locking in gains before the next price hike. A $1,000 investment at today’s price of $0.10 would be worth $1,300 in the next stage. But the real potential lies in the long term. With major exchange listings on the horizon and widespread adoption ahead, some analysts believe RCOF could experience a 10,000x surge turning that $1,000 into over $100,000 this year. SolidProof’s audit confirms that the smart contract is fully secure, with no vulnerabilities, making it a safe and lucrative bet. The Smart Money Knows When to Move Ethereum and Solana have cemented themselves as pillars of the crypto world, but their early days of explosive growth are behind them. Ethereum went from pennies to thousands, Solana surged from under $1 to over $200, and those who got in early became millionaires. But today, these assets face slower gains. Their market caps are massive, and 10x returns are no longer a guarantee. RCO Finance , however, is just getting started. It offers the same kind of ground-floor opportunity that ETH and SOL had in their infancy. Solana and Ethereum whales aren’t waiting. They see what’s coming, and they’re positioning themselves before the crowd catches on. You too can get in today.

Ltd affiliate has admitted to processing over $1 trillion in transactions for US customers without a license. It will pay more than $504 million in penalties. On Monday, the exchange pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to a felony charge of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. OKX, which supports spot trading for over 300 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, acknowledged its violations. U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla imposed the penalties, including fines and forfeitures, as part of an agreement between the exchange and federal prosecutors. OKX said in a Feb. 24 statement that the firm acknowledged that certain US customers had previously traded on the company’s global platform due to legacy compliance gaps. According to the exchange, the number of US clients involved amounted to a small percentage of the crypto exchange’s total customer base, and none of these customers remain on its platform. Source: OKX The Seychelles-based crypto exchange emphasized that no customer harm was alleged, and no charges were filed against any OKX employee. However, Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky criticized the OKX affiliate for “knowingly” violating Anti-Money Laundering laws, alleging it facilitated over $5 billion in suspicious transactions and criminal proceeds. ”Today’s guilty plea and penalties emphasize that there will be consequences for financial institutions that avail themselves of US markets but violate the law by allowing criminal activity to continue.” FBI Assistant Director in Charge James E. Dennehy noted that the OKX affiliate advised individuals to provide false information to circumvent requisite procedures. ”Blatant disregard for the rule of law will not be tolerated,” Dennehy added. The DOJ stated that the violations took place between 2018 and early 2024, despite OKX having an official policy since 2017 prohibiting U.S. users from trading on its platform.

Together, they launched four major Money Market Fund (MMF) tokens, tapping into the growing demand for more investment vehicles amongst institutional investors. Institutional Investors Demands Spurs XDC Network’s MMF Launch According to XDC Network’s announcement on Monday, these are its first tokenized funds. Notably, the MMFs are from abrdn, Fidelity International, BlackRock, and State Street and are now available on the XDC Network platform. XDC Network and Archax are keen to expand institutional investors’ access to Traditional Finance (TradFi) through blockchain technology . Keith O’Callaghan, the Head of Asset Management and Structuring at Archax, opines, “Providing digital representations of major MMFs opens up a potential new audience for these types of yield-bearing products that historically have been challenging for some to access.” RWA Tokenization and What XDC Network Brings to the Table XDC’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism will be utilized as part of the strategic partnership. This will facilitate transaction settlement and maintain near-zero gas fees. It is worth noting that this blockchain platform boasts of being the ideal protocol for Real-world Asset (RWA) tokenization, especially for institutions that wish to work with regulated entities like Archax. There is a general rise in the demand for tokenized MMFs amongst institutional investors. This is highly reflected in the RWA tokenization market’s financial value and current outlook. In the first week of February, the RWA tokenization market hit a record Total Value Locked (TVL) of $17.1 billion. Explicitly, this caused it to reach levels last seen in mid-January. Projection For RWA Tokenization Market In its paper “Real-world asset tokenization: A game changer for global trade,” Standard Chartered hinted that the tokenized RWA market could grow to $30.1 trillion by 2034. This forecast is not far-fetched, especially if the suggestion of Eli Cohen, general counsel at Centrifuge, comes into play. Cohen stated that US President Donald Trump’s administration will likely pull away from restrictive financial policies. In his opinion, such moves hold potential for RWA tokenization in 2025 , as it would further boost the sector’s growth.

On the flip side, analysts say the move could be a trigger for an accumulation spree amid prolonged bearish sentiments. Whale Moves $127 Million Worth Of Sol TO Unknown Wallet A Solana (SOL) whale has transferred 846,613 SOL to an unknown wallet in a single transaction amid falling asset prices. With Solana price hovering around the $150 mark, the transferred assets are valued at a hefty $127 million, spiking SOL’s daily trading volumes. While the sizable transfer appears to have gone under the radar, investors say the move could have far-reaching consequences for the beleaguered asset. A majority of traders are viewing the $127 million transfer as preliminary moves for a sell-off given prevailing sentiments. Only a handful of investors see the transfer as an accumulation play ahead of a market breakout. Solana Price Continues To Fall Onchain data indicates SOL has lost 11% in under 24 hours to settle at the $152 mark. Since the asset reached its peak of $294 at the start of the year, it has shed 49% of its value in less than a month. SOL’s market capitalization of $75.4 billion manages to keep it among the top cryptocurrencies by valuation. However, underlying metrics remain grim as it plays second fiddle to Ethereum in DEX weekly volumes. Solana network fees and memecoin activity have also taken a hit in recent weeks while the number of active Solana users fell to its lowest level in five months. SOL Expected To Slip Even Further Amid the unsavory metrics for SOL, chances for a break out remain unlikely for the asset. For starters, the Solana price descent has seen it fall below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, setting the stage for a bearish death cross pattern. MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are painting a depressing picture for SOL with indicators tipping prices to reach $109.

Monero (XMR) is poised for an up to 140% jump following a pivotal privacy ruling, underscoring its lead in the privacy coin niche. Post-mainnet, Celestia (TIA) is drawing eyes with its modular blockchain advancements, potentially driving its value up. Yet, the standout is BlockDAG (BDAG). Having amassed over $197.5 million, with its presale nearing completion and the compelling LISTING1000 bonus offering a 350% increase in coins, BlockDAG offers a prime buying opportunity. Beyond mere market buzz, BDAG’s solution to blockchain inefficiencies is robust, with predictions setting its value at $1 by 2025, offering early adopters substantial potential returns. Monero Set to Soar by 140% After Critical Privacy Decision Currently, Monero, the premier privacy-centric cryptocurrency, trades at about $220.75, marking a 1.87% rise since its last close. Over the previous day, XMR has recorded a trade volume of roughly $58 million, indicating robust market activity. Recent analysis indicates Monero’s value could climb by up to 140% following a beneficial outcome in the Tornado Cash case, likely boosting the appeal of privacy-focused coins. Moreover, Monero’s distinctive privacy capabilities continue to draw those desiring transaction anonymity, further solidifying its market stance. Celestia (TIA) Climbs Post-Mainnet Launch: Is More Growth Ahead? Celestia is trading around $3.20, showing a 2.78% increase over the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization is approximately $1.67 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $81.46 million. Key updates include Celestia’s successful Mainnet Beta rollout, dubbed Lemon Mint, initiating the launch of the inaugural modular data availability layer. Celestia has also partnered with Arbitrum Orbit, enhancing its modular data availability offerings. A consistent price above $3.50 could signal more bullish trends, whereas a fall below $3.00 might suggest bearish possibilities. BlockDAG’s LISTING1000: The Optimal Crypto Entry Point Blockchain networks often suffer from congestion, high fees, and inefficiencies, struggling to meet increasing demands. BlockDAG is engineered to alleviate these problems, and it has captured significant market attention. It’s a pioneering Layer 1 blockchain that combines blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technologies, ensuring exceptional speed, scalability, and efficiency. Unlike traditional blockchains that sequentially process transactions, BlockDAG enables parallel transaction validation, which eliminates bottlenecks and lowers fees. Since its presale, it has gathered over $197.5 million, selling 18.5 billion BDAG coins swiftly. Buyers from Batch 1 have already realized gains of 2,380%, with BDAG currently priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27. Projections for 2025 place BDAG’s value at $1, suggesting a remarkable 3,930% ROI. With the LISTING1000 bonus now in effect, this potential return is even more enticing. BlockDAG recently introduced a bonus code — LISTING1000, providing a 350% bonus on every BDAG purchase. For example, buying 10,000 BDAG at $0.0248 each would result in receiving 45,000 BDAG post-bonus. If BDAG hits $1 as projected, that $248 purchase could swell to $45,000. The LISTING1000 promotion is temporary and could end at any time, making this the prime moment to act before this chance vanishes. Key Insights! The crypto market favors those who move swiftly, and fleeting opportunities like BlockDAG’s LISTING1000 bonus are rare. While Monero’s privacy-driven revival and Celestia’s cutting-edge blockchain method are promising, BDAG is already establishing its superiority, amassing $197.5 million and delivering a 2,380% ROI to early backers. With the presale now in its 27th batch at $0.0248 and demand soaring, BDAG’s anticipated 3,930% return positions it as the best crypto to buy now . The LISTING1000 bonus is fleeting—missing out could mean losing out on potentially transformative returns. If you’re seeking the next significant crypto development, BlockDAG isn’t just an option—it’s the essential move before time runs out.

Whether aiming for quick profits or steady gains, choosing projects with real-world value is essential. Here’s a look at the best-performing cryptos to buy today, with Web3Bay leading the way for its decentralized e-commerce platform. Web3Bay (3BAY): Presale Gem with Unmatched Growth Potential Web3Bay is drawing attention with its decentralized marketplace that goes beyond price speculation. The platform removes middlemen, letting buyers and sellers trade directly through smart contract escrow services. Starting at $0.003 during its presale, the 3BAY coin has risen to $0.004562625 and is expected to launch at $0.1959—a 6430% ROI for those who joined early. With more than $1.5 million raised, interest in Web3Bay keeps growing. The project offers practical benefits, including a 5% discount for coin holders and planned integrations with PayPal and Google Pay, enhancing accessibility. With limited supply and a governance model, Web3Bay offers long-term value, making it one of the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Web3Bay stands out from projects driven by hype. Its decentralized marketplace delivers real services, allowing secure transactions using smart contracts that lower fraud risk and fees. As more people adopt Web3Bay’s system, demand for 3BAY coins grows since they are essential for transactions and governance. With major payment integrations and community-led governance, Web3Bay has strong long-term potential. Its ability to disrupt traditional e-commerce solidifies its position as one of the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Polkadot (DOT): Expanding Utility With JAM Chain Polkadot is known for its advanced blockchain network. The JAM Chain upgrade simplifies development by letting creators deploy smart contracts directly on Polkadot’s Layer 0, removing the need for parachains and improving efficiency. With greater scalability and new governance tools, JAM Chain is attracting more developers to Polkadot. Its interoperability feature allows smooth integration with other blockchains, boosting the adoption of interconnected apps. As blockchain scalability becomes essential, Polkadot’s solutions may increase DOT’s value, keeping it among the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Avalanche (AVAX): Growing Subnets and GameFi Momentum Avalanche is a top choice for scalability, with its subnet system gaining more users. GameFi and DeFi platforms prefer Avalanche due to its high speed and low costs. Avalanche’s subnets let developers build custom blockchains that still connect to the mainnet, supporting more projects. This flexibility is driving adoption and increasing AVAX demand. The GameFi sector is growing on Avalanche as developers seek fast, scalable networks, positioning AVAX as one of the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Avalanche’s affordable fees and fast transactions are key for developers, attracting many new projects. As more apps use Avalanche, AVAX demand rises, reinforcing its status among the best performing cryptos to buy today. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Building Utility Beyond Memes Shiba Inu is proving meme coins can offer real utility. Its Shibarium Layer-2 blockchain lowers transaction costs and boosts scalability, making SHIB more than just a speculative coin. With ongoing token burns, staking, and an expanding ecosystem of DeFi apps and NFTs, Shiba Inu continues to add value. Community support and regular upgrades make SHIB a crypto to watch. Its growth beyond memes, along with lower fees through Shibarium, solidifies SHIB as one of the best performing cryptos to buy today. Shiba Inu’s improving tokenomics and use cases give it long-term growth potential. With faster, cheaper transactions and added utility, SHIB stands among the best performing cryptos to buy today. Wrapping Up– Best Performing Cryptos to Buy Today! Many cryptos aim for growth, but only a few combine strong fundamentals with future potential. Web3Bay leads the pack with its decentralized e-commerce platform and fast-rising presale, standing out as one of the best performing cryptos to buy today.

This decline pushes BTC’s value even further from its January all-time high of over $109,000. Amid the bearish momentum, analysts are observing signs of renewed interest from retail investors—a critical market segment that could shape Bitcoin’s near-term direction. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Price Manipulated? Expert Exposes The Truth Bitcoin Retail Demand Slowly Recovers A new analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost has highlighted a promising shift in Bitcoin’s retail demand metrics. Specifically, the 30-day demand change has climbed back into the neutral zone around 0%, recovering from a highly negative -21% seen late last year. According to the insight shared by Darkfost, this is the first time since 2021 that retail demand has shown such a notable turnaround. Historically, periods of recovering retail demand have been linked to eventual price rebounds. For example, in July 2024, retail demand reached a similar low point before beginning to recover. Although it took roughly three months for Bitcoin’s price to respond positively, the subsequent upward movement demonstrated the impact of growing retail interest. Bitcoin retail Investor demand is brewing “Notably, past instances of recovering retail demand have often coincided with upward price movements in the short-term.” – By @Darkfost_Coc Full post ⤵️https://t.co/lvhC8JnvBD pic.twitter.com/YdBr6F78W7 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 24, 2025 Darkfost noted that if this trend holds true this time, the current recovery in retail demand could lay the groundwork for future price gains—though such changes may take time to materialize. Network Activity and Investor Sentiment on the Decline Despite the positive signs from retail demand, overall network activity and investor sentiment tell a more cautious story. Darkfost in a separate post revealed a downward trend in the number of active Bitcoin wallets and transactions used for deposits and withdrawals. The accumulation of Bitcoin by spot ETFs has also slowed, with minor outflows suggesting a more hesitant investor base. Additionally, the number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) is decreasing at a pace reminiscent of previous market corrections. Although this alone does not confirm a market cycle peak, it does raise questions about the underlying strength of current market participants. Investor sentiment has also been weighed down by broader macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Darkfost highlighted that while initial bullish sentiment was buoyed by optimism surrounding Trump’s election and the possibility of favorable US crypto regulations, no substantial policy changes or legislative actions have yet emerged.

In fact, the artificial intelligence industry has entered a state of self-regulation, which is a sharp contrast with the short leash the Biden administration afforded the industry. The Trump administration appears to be trying a similar hands-off approach with the crypto industry. In the last week alone, the SEC dropped investigations into major players, Robinhood and Coinbase. A breath of fresh air from regulation by enforcement The U.S. SEC under the leadership of Gary Gensler regulated the crypto sector by enforcement actions, characterized by unpredictable crackdowns on the crypto projects that popped up on its radar. The return of the Trump administration in January 2025 signaled a paradigm shift, and the resolution of two high-profile cases against Robinhood Crypto and Coinbase are perfect exhibits of the new era for crypto. On February 21, 2025, the SEC’s Enforcement Division sent a letter to Robinhood Crypto (RHC) saying it concluded its investigation and will not move forward with any enforcement actions. This is a sequel to the May 2024 Wells Notice the watchdog issued to the crypto RHC, which many readily point out as an example of the agency’s overreach. Robinhood’s Chief Legal Officer, Dan Gallagher, stated that the investigation should have never been opened, arguing that the company has always operated within federal securities laws. “As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed. We appreciate the formal closing of this investigation, and we are happy to see a return to the rule of law and commitment to fairness at the SEC,” Gallagher explained. Recent financial disclosures from Robinhood show that crypto trading has been a major driver of revenue. The company reported transaction-based revenue of approximately $672 million in the fourth quarter, with about $336 million coming from crypto transactions. This staggering 700% increase in crypto revenue alongside a 38% increase in Robinhood shares since the start of the year is one of many indicators of investors’ enthusiasm, primarily stoked by a perceived accommodating regulatory environment. Similarly, Coinbase, another industry heavyweight, experienced a reprieve from its marathon legal bout with the SEC. The SEC had previously approved Coinbase’s business model in 2021, however, in 2023, it accused the exchange of operating as an unregistered securities exchange. After almost two years in court, it announced that it was dropping its lawsuit against Coinbase on February 21, 2025, pending final approval from the commissioner. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase said that the SEC is finally righting a major wrong and that the case should have never been filed, maintaining that the company has always operated within legal boundaries. He suggested that the crackdown was politically motivated, saying what we are all thinking: “What changed over those two years was the political leadership at the SEC.” Of course, the resolutions of the cases against Robinhood and Coinbase relieve immediate legal concerns, they are also tangible evidence of the broader narrative change in crypto industry regulation. By choosing not to pursue the case further, the SEC under the Trump administration sent a message: innovation should not be killed by vague or overly aggressive regulatory practices. The market responded positively to the news of these developments, with Coinbase’s shares rising by 4.9% in premarket trading, and Robinhood seeing close to a 3.3% rise. The AI industry is a blueprint for self-regulation In July 2023, the White House coordinated an initiative with OpenAI, Google, and Meta, to institute standards that include watermarking AI-generated content to enhance transparency and safety in AI applications and improvements like investment in research on AI safety. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) introduced the global AI management standard, ISO/IEC 42001 In October 2024. Speaking about the standard developed in a process involving multiple stakeholders, Susan Taylor-Martin, Chief Executive of the British Standards Institution (BSI), said that “although the regulatory landscape is evolving” this standard provides a reliable framework for managing AI’s risks and opportunities, enabling innovation while maintaining governance. Without the guardrails limiting their European counterparts, American AI firms have become far and away the most valuable within the space—the brief DeepSeek disruption notwithstanding. Similarly, the crypto industry could benefit from self-regulation, by creating Self-Regulatory Organizations (SRO), which create and enforce guidelines for members. Self-regulation isn’t a new concept in crypto; a few countries have crypto SROs like Japan and South Korea. Japan has the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association and Korea has South Korea’s Digital Asset Exchange Alliance. The Winklevoss Twins, founders of Gemini Exchange even proposed a Virtual Commodity Association in 2019. With the Trump administration’s more relaxed stance, the crypto industry can follow the AI industry’s blueprint and develop internal compliance measures and best practices that prioritize transparency, security, and consumer protection. Just as the AI industry collaborated with the government to shape policies that balance innovation with public interest, the crypto industry can also work with regulators to develop a logical framework that protects customers and protects digital asset innovation. For now, a regulatory vacuum The ease of regulatory clampdown on crypto organizations seems optimistic, however, it potentially leaves a vacuum in bad actor policing. A hands-off approach removes the shackles around companies’ ankles, a sudden and unchecked relaxing of regulatory oversight could expose investors and customers to risks. Case in point, just a few hours after news broke that the SEC had dropped Coinbase’s case, Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit confirmed that his exchange suffered a $1.4 billion hack. The Bybit incident, the largest heist in crypto history, is an immediate reminder of how self-regulation could go wrong. How many companies can be trusted to ensure adequate security measures across platforms? It’s worth mentioning that the Trump administration still plans to regulate crypto with albeit with sensible guidelines. Part of those efforts is the SEC’s acting chairman, Mark T. Uyeda, commissioning a task force to develop a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets US President, Donald Trump also issued the “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” executive order on January 23, 2025. While we can already see the benefits of a relaxed regulatory environment in surging revenues and stock prices, the long-term viability of this model hinges on how well the industry can self-police and collaborate with the powers that be. Whatever happens, the next few months will be critical. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The primary reason for this bearish outlook is the current market sentiment and the price action XLM has formed on the daily timeframe. Current Price Momentum XLM is currently trading near $0.297 and has experienced a price drop of over 12% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume jumped by 120%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. This jump in trading volume is potentially caused by the shift in market sentiment and XLM’s bearish outlook. XLM Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XLM appears bearish as it has broken through the crucial support level of $0.311, which the asset tested multiple times in recent days. Additionally, it closed a daily candle below this level, partially confirming that the price is poised to continue its decline. Source: Trading View With this breakdown and candle closing, there is a strong possibility that the asset could drop by 35% to reach the $0.189 mark in the coming days. Meanwhile, during the price drop, XLM may find temporary support at the $0.25 mark before reaching $0.189. Despite the breakdown of the crucial support, XLM’s price remains above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, which currently acts as a support level. If the asset breaches the 200 EMA and falls below it, there is a high possibility that XLM’s price will continue declining smoothly to that level in the coming days. $6.75 Million Worth Bets on Short Side With the notable price drop and recent breakdown, sentiment has completely shifted as intraday traders appear to be strongly backing short positions, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from the XLM exchange liquidation map shows that bears, or traders betting on short positions, are currently dominating the asset. Meanwhile, with the recent price drop, traders betting on long positions seem to be exhausted. Source: Coinglass Based on recent data, $0.3321 is a level where traders betting on short positions are over-leveraged, holding $6.75 million worth of short positions. Meanwhile, $0.2821 is another level where traders betting on long positions are over-leveraged, holding $1.10 million worth of long positions. This liquidation data and over-leveraged positions indicate that bears are currently dominating the asset and could push XLM’s price toward the $0.189 level soon.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|XLM|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 00:31:36

The Inflation Protection Act, as it was called, was passed by the House Business and Labor Committee, but voted down by the full House on its second reading on Feb. 22. The bill would have established a special revenue account for the state’s Board of Investments to invest in precious metals and digital assets. It was introduced by Republican representative Curtis Schomer on Feb. 7 without Democratic support. The fund received a nonpartisan rejection The final vote was not along party lines, however, with 16 Republicans opposing it and one Democrat voting yea. The final vote was 41 for and 59 against. The bill was two pages long. It would have allowed transfers from the state’s general fund into the state’s Inflation Protection Act special fund by the legislature with a maximum of $50 million. The bill would have left revenue from the account in the account and given the state legislature control over the money in the account. Digital assets would have to have a market cap of $750 billion to be eligible for investment under the bill. In other words, the bill would authorize investment in Bitcoin, as it is the only qualifying digital asset. The debate over the bill focused on whether or not the fund was a worthy use of taxpayers’ money, with proponents saying it was a way to optimize state funds. Opponents called the bill speculative and risky. “I am not signing on to that stuff [cryptocurrency] and I can’t imagine a majority of your constituents want you to,” Republican Bill Mercer told the assembly. There is another law affecting cryptocurrency currently before the Montana legislature. An Act Revising Cryptocurrency Laws would prohibit the state from participating in testing a central bank digital currency and legalize the payment of taxes in cryptocurrency. It also protects mining and staking and exempts certain tokens from state security laws. Montana passed a law in 2023 to protect crypto mining in the state. The law prohibits discriminatory utility rates for crypto miners and prevents local governments from “exercising powers related to digital asset mining.” It also defines digital assets as personal property and prohibits taxation of cryptocurrency used as a method of payment. Federal digital asset fund may be created The so-called White House crypto czar, David Sacks, has confirmed in a press conference that a national Bitcoin reserve would be considered . Many states have pulled far ahead of the federal government. According to Bitcoinlaws.com, 18 states currently have cryptocurrency reserve fund proposals. Utah is the furthest ahead. Its Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments bill has made it through the House and is up for its second reading in the Senate. Montana joins North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wyoming as states that have voted down cryptocurrency reserves. Montana’s four federal legislators are all strong supporters of crypto.

Over the past month, SHIB price has remained bearish, reflecting the overall downtrend in the market. However, the token failed to sustain a consistent uptrend owing to selling pressure as shown by other technical factors. Nevertheless, some analysts remain optimistic, suggesting that a bullish pattern may be forming. If key support levels hold, SHIB price could see a 400% rally, indicating a potential recovery from oversold conditions. Shiba Inu Price Drops, Analysts Spot Signs of a Possible Reversal In the past month, as per analysis, Shiba Inu price has declined by 29%, similar to the decline in the crypto market. At the time of writing, SHIB price is $0.00001476, with its market capitalization at $8.7 billion. However, there is a bearish outlook for SHIB in the general market recording a 9% decline in the last 24 hours. Recent data shows that transactions of above 1000 SHIB across the Shiba Inu network have reduced by over 80% in the last 12 weeks. This indicates a lack of trust among major investors. On the other hand, analysts have recognized the signs of the formation of an Inverse Head & Shoulders formation. This might suggest that the movement of the meme coin price is going to reverse in the near future. If so, SHIB could go up by 400% and its value could reach $0.000081. However, experts caution that such projections must be interpreted carefully, given the overall uncertainty in the meme coin market. More so, the latest burn activity has fueled optimism among traders anticipating a 300% meme coin rally . A 120.3% increase in the weekly burn rate suggests reduced supply, which could drive demand higher. If momentum sustains, Shiba Inu price may attempt a breakout. Technical Indicators Suggest Bearish Momentum Shiba Inu price drop coincides with an 80% decline in large whale transactions over the past 12 weeks. This sharp decrease in whale participation is a sign of declining confidence in Shiba Inu, which could further contribute to short-term market instability. As the crypto market faces broader bearish trends, SHIB’s ability to maintain its levels at critical support levels is crucial for its recovery. From a technical perspective, the Bollinger Bands have widened, signaling increased volatility in SHIB price action. The price is currently below the middle band, which typically suggests a bearish market momentum. Additionally, the MACD indicator remains in negative territory, with the MACD line positioned below the signal line, reinforcing the downward trend. The histogram also shows a continued decline in bullish momentum. These indicators point to the continued pressure on SHIB price, although the lower Bollinger Band could support buying recovery. Source: TradingView Meme Coin Must Defend $0.000011 Support The price of Shiba Inu faces a critical test as it approaches essential support levels. The primary support level at $0.000011 has become a key threshold for SHIB’s short-term future. A break below this support could lead to a further decline in the meme coin price. Conversely, if SHIB can hold above this support level, there may be an opportunity for the bulls to re-enter, and a reversal could be possible. With the broader market facing bearish pressure, SHIB’s ability to stabilize and defend key levels will determine whether the top meme coin can rebound or face further losses.

Can Cardano Soar to $3 as Spot ETF Speculation Builds?,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-traders-are-flocking-to-web3bays-4200-growth-potential-can-cardano-soar-to-3-as-spot-etf-speculation-builds/,"As the cryptocurrency sector evolves swiftly, investors are spotlighting two key opportunities: Cardano (ADA) and Web3Bay (3BAY) . The potential approval of a Cardano spot ETF may drive ADA’s price to $3, stirring considerable enthusiasm. Simultaneously, an innovative blockchain initiative, Web3Bay, is capturing attention with its novel decentralized commerce approach and a prospective 4200% ROI for early backers. While Cardano continues to draw long-term investors with its consistent growth, Web3Bay is making strides in the dynamic e-commerce domain by cutting out excessive fees and intermediaries. Having already raised over $1.50 million and sold 370 million tokens, this blockchain-enabled marketplace is quickly becoming a hot topic in the 2025 crypto investment landscape. This discussion explores the possible surge in Cardano’s value due to ETF speculation and contrasts it with Web3Bay’s disruptive market entry, positioning Web3Bay as potentially the best current investment opportunity. Cardano Price Prediction: Will ADA Hit $3? Cardano remains a blockchain with substantial foundational strength, celebrated for its low-energy proof-of-stake mechanism and solid smart contract framework. Forecasts indicate that ADA’s price could reach $3 with a regulatory green light for a spot ETF, potentially heightening institutional interest. Cardano is favored by both individual and large-scale investors due to its clear strategic direction, scalability, and increasing adoption in decentralized finance. With robust community support and ongoing improvements, ADA is a sound option for those seeking dependable, long-term appreciation. Yet, while steady gains are anticipated for ADA, early backers are increasingly turning their attention to altcoins with utility that promise greater returns, particularly in burgeoning sectors like Web3 commerce. Web3Bay: Unlocking a 4200% ROI in Decentralized E-Commerce While the buzz around Cardano’s ETF fuels market excitement, Web3Bay is emerging as a leading presale in crypto by addressing the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry. Unlike centralized entities such as Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay facilitates direct, zero-fee transactions between buyers and sellers via blockchain. The momentum for Web3Bay’s presale is strong, with over $1.50 million raised and 375 million tokens distributed. With an initial price of $0.1959 and early purchase price of $0.00456, early participants could witness an impressive 4200% profit. Why Web3Bay Surpasses Other Presales Decentralized Market – Eliminates intermediaries, reduces transaction costs, and gives users complete purchase control. Versatile Payment Options – Supports both digital currencies and traditional money (including PayPal) for frictionless deals. Secure Smart Contract Escrow – Guarantees safe, scam-free transactions. Staking Perks – Token holders gain passive income and bolster the ecosystem. DAO Leadership – Investors dictate the platform’s future. Robust Presale Interest – With $1.50M+ raised, investor confidence is high ahead of its trading debut. Unlike speculative tokens, Web3Bay addresses actual market needs, merging blockchain with decentralized commerce in a way that could redefine online shopping. Cardano’s Stability vs. Web3Bay’s Unmatched ROI Potential Investors now have a pivotal choice: stick with a reliable, established blockchain like Cardano or gamble on the immense upside potential of Web3Bay in a fast-expanding market. Although Cardano’s ETF might push its price to $3, Web3Bay offers early access to a decentralized marketplace poised to revolutionize e-commerce. With blockchain integration accelerating and practical utility becoming crucial for cryptocurrency success, Web3Bay positions itself as one of 2025’s most compelling investment opportunities. With the crypto presale closing soon, now could be the ideal moment to acquire 3BAY tokens before anticipated price increases post-launch.

Van de Poppe tells his 776,000 followers on the social media platform X that the layer-1 protocol Near ( NEAR ) appears to be carving a cycle bottom. The analyst says that NEAR is likely in the final stages of its accumulation phase before kicking off a bull run. “This is a typical chart of a standard Altcoin bull run. At first, it runs up, then fully corrects before the real run occurs. Those runs start from the double-bottom retest –> that’s happening right now. Good accumulation area.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X A double-bottom pattern is a bullish reversal structure, indicating that an asset is cementing a price floor before launching an upside burst. At time of writing, NEAR is trading for $3.45. Looking at the payments altcoin XRP , the trader says the coin has already printed massive gains this cycle and that any upside potential will likely be limited. But he also says that it is within the realm of possibility for XRP to do the unexpected and spark another big rally. “In four weeks, the price rallied by 500% on a $30 billion asset. My best guess is that most of the upside is captured already and only the laggards are buying in at these levels. My second best guess is that we’ll consolidate before we continue to go up, which probably takes time. In that sense, you still want to be buying the dip if you’re interested in this one. The question is, where? Anywhere in the lower areas of the range, so let’s say $1.50-2.25. That’s a good region.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.57. Turning to the smart contract platform Sui ( SUI ), Van de Poppe says he remains long-term bullish on the altcoin but warns that a drop to $1.50 is possible. He also believes that a 9x rally is in the cards for SUI if it manages to pull off a real bull cycle. “This has been one of the trending ones and I think it will continue to show strength… I think that, ultimately, the area at $2.50 is the key zone… Invalidation? Sub $1.50… If it loses the trend sub $1.50 –> your potential loss is 40-50%. If it really turns into a bull cycle, then your upside might be 300-800%.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, SUI is trading for $3.41. The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the fellow layer-1 altcoin Sonic ( S ). According to Van de Poppe, Sonic is in the midst of a solid uptrend, and he believes it will go beyond $1. “The new, shiny, diamond in the markets. Strong upward trend and a lot of momentum on social media. Likely not going to stop in the coming period. From a trader’s perspective, I think that you’d be willing to buy the dips… S o then the region between $0.675-0.775 is the area to go for… Targets? New highs. Uptrend is clear.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, S is worth $0.86.

As markets closed, Bitcoin slipped under $91,015 , marking a 2% drop over the past 24 hours and the lowest price this month. On the other hand, Ether (ETH) saw a steeper decline, falling 5.9% during the same period. This follows a major hack on the ByBit platform last Friday, which resulted in the theft of over 446,000 tokens worth more than $1.4 billion. Still, ByBit has assured users that it has restored a 1:1 backing for customer assets and closed the so-called “ether gap.” The attack has been linked to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-backed hacker collective known for targeting cryptocurrency platforms. After last week’s sharp declines, an attempted rebound in major US stock indices faltered Monday afternoon, with the Nasdaq closing 1.2% lower and the S&P 500 slipping 0.5%. Solana leads crypto declines as inflation and token unlocks weigh Among major cryptocurrencies, Solana (SOL) was the worst performer, plunging nearly 10% in the past 24 hours and a staggering 41% over the past month. Beyond its association with the waning meme coin frenzy, SOL is also under pressure from upcoming token unlocks in March and a 30% rise in SOL inflation following the implementation of SIMD-96, which modified the network’s fee structure. Trading at $151 at press time, SOL has now erased all its post-election gains. “Trying to communicate to folks who may be feeling complacency/denial that $95,000 is still not a bad exit price relative to where I think we could trade in 6-12 months,” Quinn Thompson, founder of Lekker Capital, a crypto hedge fund that specializes in using macroeconomic data for its trades, posted on social media. Thompson projected an 80% probability that Bitcoin will not reach new highs within the next three months and a 51% chance that it will remain below record levels for the next year. Economic risks mount as the job market weakens Meanwhile, Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, noted growing risks to the labor market in the US economy. He cited lagging real incomes, a weakening housing market, and lower spending levels by state and local governments. These concerns are weighed against a market median GDP forecast of about 2.5%, which has not improved. Dutta noted that if 2023 was about being surprised to the upside, there is more risk in 2025 of being surprised to the downside. He continued: A passive tightening of monetary policy is the dominant risk, and that has important implications for financial market investors. Neil Dutta Dutta said he would anticipate a decline in longer-term interest rates and a selloff in equity prices as risk appetite wanes. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

House Bill 1202, introduced by Representative Logan Manhart, proposed creating a Bitcoin reserve for South Dakota. The bill aimed to allow the state to invest up to 10% of its total portfolio in Bitcoin. However, the lawmakers referred the bill, which means that its progress was halted for this legislative session. State Bitcoin Reserve Plan Fails as South Dakota Lawmakers Defer South Dakota House Commerce and Energy Committee refused to move HB 1202 to the next level. The proposed bill sought to facilitate the state to buy Bitcoins using public funds; the state would actually become one of the pioneers in holding a Bitcoin reserve. But the lawmakers made it difficult for the process by voting to take the bill to the next stage after 40 days which brought an end to it for the year. The bill was introduced by Representative Logan Manhart and he plans to propose the bill during the next year 2026. The deferral reflects concerns about regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and the risks associated with using public funds for crypto investments. Despite these concerns, Bitcoin reserve proposals continue to emerge in other states, indicating ongoing interest in integrating digital assets into public investment strategies. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Strategy continues to gain traction with institutional adoption as Michael Saylor’s firm expands its holdings. MicroStrategy, now rebranded as Strategy, has nearly 500,000 BTC after its latest $2 billion purchase. Concerns Over Volatility and Regulation The primary concerns cited for deferring HB 1202 were Bitcoin’s price volatility and the lack of clear federal regulations. Opponents of the bill argued that investing in a highly fluctuating asset could expose public funds to financial risk. The unpredictability of Bitcoin prices made some lawmakers hesitant to approve the allocation of taxpayer money toward a digital asset. Moreover, crypto regulation uncertainty at both the state and federal levels also played a role in the bill’s stagnation. With the legal landscape surrounding Bitcoin reserves still evolving, lawmakers expressed caution about moving forward without clearer guidelines. The deferral follows similar rejections in other states, such as North Dakota and Montana, where Bitcoin reserve proposals also failed to gain approval. Although HB 1202 failed to pass, discussions around state-held Bitcoin reserves are expected to continue. Some of the states that have started making such motions for new laws include Florida, Missouri, and Arizona. Currently at press time, Bitcoin price is at $91,824, the asset depreciated by 4% in the last 24 hours. The total market cap is $1.82 trillion with a daily trade volume being $48.24 billion and having an increase rate of 180%.

Analyst Weighs In,https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/is-toncoin-building-a-foundation-for-a-long-term-comeback-analyst-weighs-in/,"Toncoin (TON) continues to face a challenging market environment, struggling to reverse its recent downward trajectory. Trading below the $4 mark, the asset’s price performance over the past weeks has remained largely in the red. Amid these conditions, CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost has shed light on some underlying trends, highlighting that long-term investors are still seeing positive returns despite the overall bearish climate. Related Reading: Key Metrics Indicate Toncoin Accumulation Continues Despite Price Struggle Evaluating TON’s Long-Term Viability and Market Stability According to Darkfost in the post uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, long-term holders—those who have maintained their positions for over a year—are currently enjoying a 69% profit, even as short-term investors face losses. This dynamic raises questions about TON’s potential as a long-term investment, prompting a closer look at the project’s ecosystem and liquidity. A key metric in this regard is the total value locked (TVL) on the network. Despite market-wide downturns affecting numerous altcoins, data shared by Darkfost revealed that TON’s TVL remains steady at $300 million, maintaining a level of stability since the start of 2024. This resilience in liquidity and locked value suggests a level of sustained confidence in the platform’s fundamentals. Is $TON made for the long term ?

Darkfost notes that examining the masterchain and workchain can provide valuable insights into the project’s adoption. The TON workchain, a flexible blockchain layer designed for executing smart contracts and handling user transactions, has demonstrated consistent activity throughout the year. Related Reading: Analyst Says Toncoin (TON) May Be Primed for Major Recovery—Here’s Why Notably, the “Hamster Kombat” phenomenon earlier in 2024 caused a noticeable uptick in network usage, highlighting the workchain’s capacity to support various applications and drive engagement. Meanwhile, the masterchain serves as the network’s backbone. By storing global configuration data, validator states, and hashes from all workchains, the masterchain ensures that the entire ecosystem runs smoothly. According to Darkfost, the ongoing growth of the masterchain highlights TON’s structural stability and increasing adoption. These factors collectively point to an ecosystem that has not only maintained but also expanded its operational scope amid broader market challenges. The analyst wrote: In conclusion, the TON ecosystem has developed impressively throughout 2024, maintaining robust activity and a solid TVL despite a general decline in crypto market interest.

As of today, February 25, 2025, ADA has dropped 13% and is currently trading near $0.67, while its trading volume has surged by 110%. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA’s recent price drop has brought it to a crucial support level at the $0.65 mark. Historically, this level has acted as a strong price reversal zone. Additionally, ADA’s daily chart is flashing a bullish signal, as technical indicators show a bullish divergence over the same period. Source: Trading View Besides this bullish divergence, ADA’s daily chart appears to be forming a double-bottom price action pattern on the daily timeframe. This bullish outlook suggests that ADA’s price could soon recover and experience notable upside momentum. Based on recent price action and historical trends, if ADA holds above the $0.65 level, there is a strong possibility that the asset could soar by 20%, reaching the $0.84 level in the near future. Mixed-Sentiment By On-Chain Metrics Following a notable price drop and as ADA reaches a crucial support level, whales and long-term holders have been accumulating ADA tokens, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $22 million worth of ADA tokens. Source: Coinglass This substantial outflow from exchanges suggests potential accumulation, which could create buying pressure and drive further upside momentum, a trend that the price has already begun to experience gradually. Despite the bullish market sentiment among whales and long-term holders, traders appear to be betting on the short side, expecting the price to continue declining in the coming days. At press time, the major liquidation areas are at $0.663 on the lower side and $0.708 on the upper side, with traders being over-leveraged at these levels. Source: Coinglass Additionally, traders have held $3.25 million worth of long positions and $8.41 million worth of short positions at these levels.

With its decentralized lending platform, strong presale momentum, and features like an overcollateralized stablecoin, Mutuum is attracting widespread interest. As the project moves through its presale phases, many investors are seeing it as a compelling addition to their portfolios. Here’s why MUTM is gaining traction and why it could be worth considering for long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum among investors who recognize its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Currently in its presale phase, the token is priced at just $0.015. The project has already raised $1,200,000, successfully selling over 120 million tokens out of the 1.82 billion allocated for presale. By purchasing MUTM now, investors have the opportunity to secure tokens at the lowest possible price before the listing, where experts predict significant price appreciation. Many analysts estimate that MUTM will see at least 15x growth after launch, making early entry a strategic move. What is Mutuum Finance? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to supply and borrow crypto assets without intermediaries. The platform enables lenders to earn passive income by providing liquidity, while borrowers can access funds by using their assets as collateral. Beyond its lending protocol, the team is also developing an overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will be minted against collateral supplied within Mutuum’s ecosystem, ensuring its value remains stable and fully backed. Unlike traditional stablecoins, which rely on centralized reserves, Mutuum’s approach guarantees that each issued token is secured by on-chain assets, maintaining transparency and decentralization. MUTM’s potential price increase is largely driven by its utilities. The lending and borrowing features provide real use cases that will attract more users to the platform. This growing demand is expected to play a key role in pushing the token’s value higher. Additionally, major exchange listings are highly anticipated, further increasing accessibility and liquidity. The team has also announced plans to launch a beta version of the platform before the token’s official release. This early access will allow investors and users to test key features, boosting interest and driving demand for MUTM tokens. With these factors in place, a 15x increase shortly after launch appears realistic. For example, if an investor purchases 150,000 MUTM tokens at the current price of $0.015, the total cost would be $2,250. When the token experiences 15x growth, as experts predict, the value of that investment would reach up to $35,000, demonstrating the potential returns for early investors. Mutuum Finance has implemented a buy-and-distribute mechanism designed to create continuous buy pressure and support long-term token growth. A portion of the platform’s revenue, generated from lending and borrowing activities, is allocated to repurchasing MUTM tokens from the open market. These repurchased tokens are distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards, encouraging long-term participation and increasing demand for MUTM over time. As platform activity grows, more revenue is used to buy back MUTM, creating continuous buy pressure. This sustained demand supports price stability and potential appreciation, making MUTM a strong choice for both short-term and long-term investors. Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway, offering investors a chance to win a share of the prize. A total of 10 winners will be selected, making it an exciting opportunity for early supporters of the project. Participation rules and entry details can be found on the official Mutuum Finance website. Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining attention for its strong presale performance, real utility, and growth potential. With lending, borrowing, and a buy-and-distribute mechanism driving demand, experts anticipate significant price appreciation. As the presale progresses and the platform’s beta launch approaches, early investors have a chance to secure MUTM before its expected surge.

The SEC’s task force started work just one month earlier, on January 21, under Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda, and Commissioner Hester Peirce leads it. Michael’s conversation with the SEC’s task force specifically covered how crypto assets need clear and easy-to-understand categories. The meeting aimed to create straightforward rules so issuers, traders, and everyday people know exactly what they can and can’t do with digital assets. The task force wants regulations that help people innovate, rather than slow everything down. SEC hard at work on crypto regulations The task force shared a draft framework at the meeting, called “Taxonomy,” to put different digital assets into categories. According to details from the discussion, this would include six basic asset types: digital commodities, digital securities, digital currencies, digital tokens, digital NFTs, and digital asset-backed tokens (ABTs). Each type has a very specific meaning. Digital commodities like Bitcoin don’t have an issuer behind them, meaning no company directly controls them. Digital securities, by contrast, have clear issuers backing them up, like equity, debt, or derivative contracts. Digital currencies are issued and directly backed by fiat currency like the US dollar. Digital tokens are assets with an issuer designed to offer utility online. NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are unique digital assets issued by creators, artists, or brands. Finally, digital ABTs are assets issued but backed by physical items such as gold, oil, or agricultural products. According to Michael’s conversation with the SEC, the task force also discussed setting rights and responsibilities clearly for issuers, crypto exchanges, and asset owners. The goal behind creating clear rules for responsibilities is to let everybody in the crypto market trade, own, or issue digital assets safely, without confusion. For issuers, the SEC proposed clear rights to issue digital assets but stressed that companies must disclose all relevant facts and behave ethically. Exchanges also got a very specific outline: they have the right to custody digital assets, trade them, and move them between clients or other exchanges. At the same time, exchanges must openly publish asset disclosures, keep client money safe, and always avoid conflicts of interest. Regular owners also got straightforward rights, including self-custody of assets, the ability to trade freely, and responsibility for following local laws wherever they live. Michael confirmed that a major theme at the meeting was that nobody has a right to cheat, lie, or steal, and everyone will face both civil and criminal consequences if they do. The SEC task force also told Michael they want practical compliance rules that don’t add unnecessary bureaucracy or extra costs. A key idea discussed was creating standardized disclosures. Under this plan, every single digital asset would have a simple, standardized data set clearly stating its details, risks, and purpose. To make life easier, exchanges could gather and publish this data as a free industry service. Cost controls were another important topic covered in Michael’s meeting. The SEC’s plan would set hard limits on compliance costs. Issuers would spend no more than 1% of their assets under management (AUM) to issue a new crypto asset. Keeping a crypto asset listed each year would cost companies less than 0.1% annually. The task force also wants to get regulators out of the direct path of asset issuance, letting exchanges handle most routine compliance tasks directly. Michael’s discussion with the SEC also covered the idea of a faster and cheaper issuance process to bring more businesses into the crypto and digital asset industry. Instead of taking months or years, new digital assets could be issued in hours or days. Costs for launching new digital assets, currently running anywhere from $10 million up to $100 million, would drastically drop to just $10,000 to $100,000 under the proposed system. The SEC told Michael that cutting these costs and simplifying rules could open up American capital markets to far more businesses. Right now, only about 4,000 companies in America can access traditional public capital markets. If new digital asset rules take effect, about 40 million businesses—from mom-and-pop shops to mid-size enterprises, small artists, celebrities, or entrepreneurs—could directly raise capital through tokenized digital assets. Michael was also briefed that the new rules could give regular investors access to thousands of new digital assets backed by tangible commodities like real estate, art, collectibles, sports teams, intellectual property, brands, and more. They would also have access to digital financial instruments, like tokenized equity, bonds, debt instruments, derivatives, and currencies. The SEC wants regular investors to have plenty of choices in digital assets tied directly to products and services they actually care about. “A strategic digital asset policy can strengthen the US dollar, neutralize the national debt, and position America as the global leader in the 21st-century digital economy,” said Michael. The SEC explained that creating clear digital asset rules could expand digital assets beyond Bitcoin, pushing their global market from today’s roughly $1 trillion up to about $590 trillion in the future, with the US dominating this sector.

Amidst this cautious sentiment, a new price target of $86,000 has emerged, reflecting the current market dynamics and investor behavior. Recent Market Performance Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline from its peak of $108,309 on December 17, 2024, trading between $93,000 and $100,000 in recent sessions. This downward movement has raised concerns about the sustainability of the previous bullish trend and the potential for further corrections. Technical Indicators Signal Potential Downside Technical analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s recent price action has breached critical support levels, indicating a possible continuation of the downward trend. The next significant support is identified at $91,500. A decisive break below this level could open the path toward the $86,000 target, representing a substantial retracement from recent highs. On the other hand, if Bitcoin can sustain itself above the $91,500 threshold, it may have a chance to recover and attempt a retest of the $100,000 resistance zone. However, for bullish momentum to return, it would need to establish strong support above this level. On-Chain Analysis Reflects Reduced Activity On-chain metrics reveal a decline in network activity, with reduced transaction volumes and active addresses. This decrease suggests waning user engagement and may contribute to the selling pressure observed in the market. Such trends often precede further price declines as demand diminishes. Additionally, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges have slightly increased, indicating that some investors may be preparing to sell rather than hold. When exchange inflows rise, it often signals a shift toward short-term profit-taking or risk-off sentiment among traders. Macroeconomic Factors Influence Investor Sentiment Broader economic conditions, including concerns over inflation and monetary policy adjustments, have contributed to increased uncertainty in financial markets. These factors have led investors to reassess their risk exposure, impacting assets like Bitcoin that are often viewed as speculative investments. Geopolitical tensions and regulatory uncertainties have also weighed on investor confidence. Recent developments in China and the United States regarding cryptocurrency regulations have caused market participants to exercise caution, limiting the influx of new capital into the market. Historical Context and Future Projections Historically, Bitcoin has experienced cyclical patterns of rapid appreciation followed by corrections. The current market behavior appears to align with these historical trends, suggesting that the recent weakness may be a natural part of Bitcoin’s long-term price movements. Many analysts believe that if Bitcoin does drop to $86,000, it could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, and any significant pullback could encourage accumulation before the next potential leg up in price. Conclusion The current market weakness has raised concerns about Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory, with analysts setting an $86,000 price target as a potential bottom if selling pressure intensifies. However, whether Bitcoin reaches this level depends on key technical support holding firm and broader macroeconomic conditions stabilizing.

33767162,[object Object],1740450604,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Crypto Funds See Massive $508M Outflow—Are Investors Getting Cold Feet?,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-funds-see-massive-508m-outflow-are-investors/,"Crypto asset investment products experienced significant outflows last week, according to the latest fund flows report from CoinShares. The report revealed that outflows totaled $508 million, bringing the cumulative two-week outflows to $924 million. These recent trends follow an 18-week streak of inflows that had accumulated $29 billion. CoinShares attributes this reversal to cautionary investor behavior amid macroeconomic uncertainty . Altcoins Buck the Trend as XRP Leads Inflows Despite the broader outflows, altcoins saw continued interest from investors. XRP particularly led the inflows with $38.3 million, continuing a strong trend since mid-November. According to the CoinShares report, XRP has now recorded $819 million in cumulative inflows, reflecting optimism among investors that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s lawsuit against the cryptocurrency may be resolved favorably . Other altcoins followed suit, with Solana, Ethereum, and Sui posting inflows of $8.9 million, $3.7 million, and $1.47 million, respectively. Bitcoin, however, bore the brunt of the outflows, with $571 million leaving Bitcoin-focused investment products. Interestingly, some investors increased their exposure to short-Bitcoin positions, which saw inflows of $2.8 million. This divergence in investor sentiment between Bitcoin and certain altcoins highlights the nuanced dynamics at play in the crypto investment space . Notably, while altcoins managed to buck the outflow trend which affected Bitcoin, same can’t be said concerning price performance. Over the past weeks, not only BTC has faced a bearish trend other altcoins have also faced their share of decline. For instance, while Bitcoin dropped by 0.8% in the past week, Ethereum, XRP and Solana has plunged by 3.2%, 7.6% and 14.3% respectively over the same period. This decrease in each of these cryptocurrencies has led to several breach of key support levels. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $95,567 down by 0.5% in the past day. Ethereum trades at $2,674 dropping by 4.9% in the past 24 hours. XRP also currently trades at $2.48 recording a 3.5% in the past day, Solana at $158 with a 6.8% drop while Sui at $3.17 decreasing 6% in value over the same period. Regional Trend And Reason Behind The Crypto Funds Outflow Commenting on the fund outflows, James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, noted: We believe investors are exercising caution following the US Presidential inauguration and the consequent uncertainty around trade tariffs, inflation and monetary policy. Butterfill added that trading turnover also declined substantially, falling from $22 billion two weeks ago to $13 billion last week. This decrease reflects a more hesitant market sentiment , particularly in the US, where outflows were most concentrated. The region saw $560 million in outflows, in stark contrast to Europe , which continued to record healthy inflows, including $30.5 million from Germany and $15.8 million from Switzerland.

Abandoning Raydium whole hog would be a ""strategic miscalculation"" for the massively popular — and profitable — memecoin factory, core contributor InfraRAY said in a post on X. He cast doubt on the notion that Pump.Fun could replicate its success if it swaps Raydium out for in-house trading infrastructure. Token investors dumped RAY en-masse this weekend after hawkeyed observers noticed Pump.Fun was apparently testing its own AMM, presumably with the intent to replace Raydium's longstanding liquidity pools as its platform of choice. Such a move would shake up the economics of decentralized token trading on Solana. Right now, Raydium, the chain's largest AMM platform, captures trading fees generated by Pump.Fun memecoins that ""graduated"" from the launchpad to its own pools. The arrangement — in place since Pump.Fun's earliest days — has been a financial boon for Raydium But it also leaves Pump.Fun out of the long-term upside of the tokens its users create. That's not to say it's making nothing: Pump.Fun has amassed half a billion dollars on the fees it collects from early-stage token launches, one of crypto's grandest warchest. Raydium is currently generating over $1 million in fees every day from trading across all its liquidity pools, not just those of Pump.fun tokens. That said, over 30% of Raydium's daily trading volume comes from Pump.fun tokens, according to a Dune dashboard, meaning a good share of its fees could dry up if Pump.Fun switches away. ""100%, revenue hit is real,"" InfraRAY said in a message to CoinDesk. But he cautioned that the market's 30% haircut on RAY tokens was ""overblown"" and partially due to SOL's own weakness. He said any pivot to a new AMM could hit myriad issues: inadequate supporting infrastructure, low demand for migrated tokens, a flop on volume at launch. ""I think that’s a real risk they are overlooking but I could be wrong,"" InfraRAY said.

Per the Russian state-run news agency TASS , the ministry claimed the consumption on the Siberian power grid was down by “more than 300 MW” as a result of the ban orders. Russian Energy Ministry: Regular Crypto Mining Meetings Planned The ministry made the claims at a “digital currency mining regulation” meeting, with Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev in attendance. Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev. (Source: The Global Energy Association/YouTube/Screenshot) The ministry credited the ban with helping Siberian power providers “avoid imposing restrictions” such as rolling blackouts. The ban came into force on January 1, 2025. It also outlaws mining in several other Russian and Russian-occupied areas until 2031. However, the ban is only effective in the winter months, when electricity demands are typically highest. Some Siberian officials say the bans do not do enough. And some have instead called for “year-long” bans in certain parts of the region . The Ministry of Energy also reiterated its desire to “create a national directory of equipment” used to “mine cryptocurrencies.” This will help it keep track of “legal” miners and assist power companies in the fight against illegal and quasi-legal (or “grey”) mining. The ministry added that it would begin holding “regular” meetings on “mining regulation.” The meetings will see participants discuss a new “regulatory framework” for crypto mining and assess the efficacy of the ban “in a number of Russian regions.” Russia's overheating economy is on the cusp of serious cooling, as huge fiscal stimulus, soaring interest rates, high inflation and Western sanctions take their toll, but after three years of war, Washington may just have thrown Moscow a lifeline https://t.co/9OWMbo1ch8 — Reuters (@Reuters) February 24, 2025 Siberia – Still a BTC Mining Hub? However, recent reports have claimed that crypto mining is growing fast, both in Siberia and beyond. Earlier this month, the Siberian power firm Irkutskenergosbyt claimed that “household electricity consumption” in the first month of this year grew by 1% compared to January 2024 figures. The firm said that the fact that January was unseasonably warm in Irkutsk meant that the rise was even more noteworthy. Also this month, Russian data compilers have claimed that the nation’s Bitcoin mining sector grew by 7% in 2024 . Russia's power grid took a $14M hit from illegal #CryptoMining in 2024. Authorities crack down on unauthorized operations, imposing bans & stricter regulations. #Blockchain #Russia https://t.co/DDxLOdJIVE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 18, 2025 Still Bitcoin-keen: Russian Miners Meanwhile, the Russian media outlet Comnews reported that most Russian industrial crypto mining “enterprises” (10%) are “still active” in the Irkutsk region. The ban covers only part of Irkutsk, although the remainder of the Oblast says that it is at “full capacity” for crypto mining. The same media outlet quoted MTS experts as stating that Bitcoin (BTC) remains Russian miners’ favorite coin. BTC, they said, “accounts for 90% of” industrial capacity. Other industrial miners focus their efforts on Litecoin (LTC) , Kaspa (KAS) , Ethereum (ETH) , and Monero (XMR) . The Kaspa (KAS) market cap over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Experts Divided on ‘Ban Success’ Claims Valery Petrov, a member of the expert council of the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RACIB), claimed that Moscow’s move to “legalize” crypto has helped the sector. But Petrov also claimed that new “differentiated” tariffs for crypto mining have also “significantly limited business growth.” He explained: “Electricity consumption problems need to be solved by increasing the efficiency of managing power flows and bringing new generators online. Negatively affecting business growth will decrease government revenues from tax payments.” Russia will hold talks with the US at the end of this week to address “irritants” in bilateral relations, Tass reported, citing Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov https://t.co/gJi31oC8a1 — Bloomberg (@business) February 23, 2025 One of Russia’s biggest industrial crypto players cast doubt on the 7% growth figures, however. Oleg Ogienko, the Deputy General Director for Communications at BitRiver, noted that official power grid association figures allocate 3.6 GW worth of nationwide power consumption for “data centers.” Ogienko said that he thought crypto miners accounted for 2.7 GW of that figure. However, the BitRiver expert added that grid firms have “approved” measures that would potentially see this figure “rise to 11 GW” in the next “three to five” years.

Lightchain AI , now in presale at $0.006, has already raised over $16.4 million, positioning itself as a major player in the AI and blockchain space. With its groundbreaking technology and strong community support, Lightchain AI is poised for rapid growth. Investors are eyeing it as a unique opportunity to capitalize on the future of decentralized AI-powered applications—offering a chance for massive returns in a fraction of the time Solana took. Lightchain AI Could Deliver Solana’s ROI in Just 8 Months As of February 18, 2025, Solana (SOL) is trading at $164.09, reflecting a 6.48% decrease from the previous close. Solana’s remarkable growth in 2021, where it surged from approximately $0.50 to over $250, exemplifies the substantial returns early investors can achieve in the cryptocurrency market. Lightchain AI , currently in its presale phase at $0.006, is drawing attention for its innovative integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Analysts project that Lightchain AI could reach $3 by the end of 2025, indicating a potential 500x return from its presale price. If these projections materialize, early investors in Lightchain AI could experience returns comparable to Solana’s historic performance, potentially achieving significant gains within a short timeframe. However, it’s important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and such projections are speculative. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks before making investment decisions. Why Lightchain AI Is Poised for Explosive Growth Lightchain AI is poised for explosive growth due to its innovative tokenomics and strong security measures. With a total supply of 10,000,000,000 LCAI tokens, 40% is allocated to the presale, ensuring early adoption and liquidity. Additionally, 28.5% is reserved for staking rewards, incentivizing network validators and participants, while 15% is dedicated to liquidity pools to maintain market stability. The remaining tokens are allocated for marketing, partnerships, and team rewards. Lightchain AI also places a premium on security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques like Zero-Knowledge Proofs and homomorphic encryption to ensure privacy and secure AI computations. Lightchain AI combines scalable AI applications, decentralized governance, and strong tokenomics to provide a secure, sustainable, and promising investment opportunity, paving the way for long-term growth and success. Invest Now In Lightchain AI For Major Gain Potential With a unique value proposition, strong community support, and promising technology, Lightchain AI is attracting investors seeking high returns in the cryptocurrency market. Its groundbreaking integration of AI and blockchain technology sets it apart from other projects and could position it as a major player in the industry. Investors who get in during the presale phase have the potential to experience significant gains within a short timeframe, making Lightchain AI an attractive opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the future of decentralized applications and artificial intelligence. Do not miss the chance to invest in Lightchain AI and potentially achieve the same ROI that Solana has delivered, but in just eight months. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,SOL|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-25 03:00:00

Martinez warned that losing this support could significantly derail any potential altcoin rally. Ethereum Must Defend Key Price Level Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset by market cap, continues to trade in the mid-$2,000 range. At the time of writing, ETH is priced just below $2,700, offering bulls a glimmer of optimism for a potential breakout above the $3,000 resistance level. Related Reading: Ethereum Short Positions Surge 500% In 3 Months – What’s Behind The Bearish Sentiment? However, in his latest analysis, Martinez emphasized the $2,600 level as a critical price point for ETH. He added that if the digital asset falls below this level, then “altseason will be canceled.” The recent Bybit crypto exchange hack sent shockwaves across the cryptocurrency industry as hackers stole digital assets worth more than $1.4 billion. Notably, ETH accounted for the bulk of the stolen funds. Despite this, ETH held up relatively well compared to Bitcoin (BTC), according to fellow crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades. The analyst pointed out that ETH’s ability to remain at essentially the same price level after such a massive hack is “interesting.” They added: To see ETH at basically the same level as before a $1B+ hack is pretty interesting. Would not be surprised it there’s indeed some entity buying back some of that lost ETH or people frontrunning such a thing. At some point the ETH likely has to get back somehow, whether it’s recovered or bought back. Otherwise there would not be a 100% cover of funds. Crypto analyst Ted echoed this sentiment in his own analysis of the Bybit hack. In an X post, he highlighted that not only did the hack fail to push ETH to new lows, but the cryptocurrency has already rebounded 35% from its bottom. Meanwhile, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader provided some hope for ETH bulls, sharing a three-week Ethereum chart that suggests ETH is poised to break out of a symmetrical triangle pattern for its “biggest bull run yet.” Altseason In Jeopardy? Seasoned crypto analyst Rekt Capital also weighed in, sharing a daily altcoin market cap chart that shows altcoins failing to close above key resistance levels, highlighted in red circles. They explained: Altcoin Market Cap is transitioning into this triangular market structure (blue). Alts will need to daily close above the blue lower high and then above black resistance to confirm a major trend shift. Related Reading: Ethereum Positioned For A ‘Major Move Upward’ In 2025, Analyst Forecasts That said, there may still be hope for an impending altseason led by Ethereum. A recent report found that ETH reserves on crypto exchanges are at a nine-year low, which could exacerbate supply scarcity and drive up prices. At press time, ETH trades at $2,671, down 5.2% in the past 24 hours.

This promising prospect underscores the growing enthusiasm for the innovative financial solutions offered by RCO Finance. But can RCO Finance truly deliver such extraordinary gains? Keep reading to find out. RCO Finance Gears Up For A Market Revolution RCO Finance is gaining attention among Dogecoin and Shiba Inu investors as a promising low-cap crypto project poised for significant growth by 2025. With its impressive features, the DeFi trading platform is also positioned as an appealing opportunity for those looking to diversify their portfolios and increase gains. Fueling the growing adoption of RCO Finance is its flagship AI-Powered Robo Advisor that offers personalized investment recommendations based on users’ goals and risk tolerance. It analyzes market data and adjusts portfolios in real-time, helping both beginners and experienced traders manage market changes easily. The Robo Advisor excels at spotting early-stage opportunities in the cryptocurrency market, such as the MELANIA token’s rise from under $1 to $14 in less than 24 hours—over a 1,000% increase.

RCO Finance is entirely non-KYC, offering traders a seamless, privacy-focused experience free of regulatory hurdles.

By subjecting its smart contracts to thorough audit by the reputable security firm SolidProof, RCO Finance ensures users’ funds are protected. This focus on safety allows investors to engage with the platform without the constant worry of risks, making financial transactions stress-free. Dogecoin Could Still Surge to $3 if it Holds This Key Support Line Over the past week, Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a downward trend, with its price dropping by over 10%. This recent performance has led to increased discussions about Dogecoin’s future trajectory. Technical analysis indicates that Dogecoin price is approaching a critical support level, often referred to as the “golden ratio” in Fibonacci retracement terms. Maintaining this support is crucial for potential bullish reversals. Analysts suggest that if Dogecoin holds above this key level, it could pave the way for a surge towards the $3 mark. However, a breach below this support might signal further declines, underscoring the importance of this threshold in guiding Dogecoin’s near-term price action. Shiba Inu Price in Red as First Major Death Cross in 2025 Appears Similarly, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has declined by 24.4% in the past month. Shiba Inu’s latest burn rate has decreased by 61%, suggesting a slowdown in efforts to reduce the circulating supply. This decline in the burn rate contributes to concerns about the Shiba Inu’s long-term stability. Technical analysis indicates the emergence of a ‘death cross’ pattern, where SHIB’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average, often signaling potential for further bearish momentum. This development suggests that SHIB may face continued downward pressure in the near term. RCOF Presale Heats Up – Don’t Miss Out! The recent buzz surrounding RCO Finance’s ongoing token presale has captured significant attention from investors, particularly after attracting Dogecoin and Shiba Inu investors . This heightened interest has led to a surge in participation, with the token presale raising over $13 million. Currently, the RCOF presale is in its fifth stage, offering each token at $0.10 . Analysts predict that upon its official launch, the token price could surge to $0.60, potentially providing early investors with returns exceeding 300%. Moreover, experts are drawing comparisons between RCOF and the explosive rise of Dogecoin in 2021, suggesting that it could even by over 1000x in the first quarter of 2025 alone. This optimism is largely attributed to its unique deflationary features, which are expected to drive up both demand and value. For investors looking to make significant profits, now may be the perfect moment to get involved with RCOF!

On the presumption that their meager investment funds won’t stretch enough to buy a substantial share, an expert has revealed a better, cheaper, and even more promising alternative. According to the expert, WallitIQ (WLTQ,) whose price is currently around a low rate of $0.042 , presents a better opportunity and is poised to rake in millions. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Perfect Crypto Investment Bet For Both Large and Small-Scale Investors WallitIQ (WLTQ) has made headlines times without number as the next AI-powered wallet-based crypto poised for mainstream dominance in the crypto market. While this has largely contributed to its popularity and widespread interest, it is also worth noting that the new presale crypto is also receiving high investment interest due to its ultra-low presale price of just $0.0420 . This makes it a perfect investment choice for large and small-scale investors seeking ways to grow their assets. Although it has employed artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to integrate its network with advanced wallet-based features, the platform also offers an opportunity to earn on the side while managing crypto assets. This is because it houses a staking mechanism and a referral reward system. Users can stake their holdings to earn rewards of up to 180% APR while also becoming eligible for token rewards and NFT giveaways when they refer people to the platform and actively engage with it. Beyond these earning opportunities, WallitIQ (WLTQ) also poses as a major market player as it allows investors to manage physical assets on-chain with a Physical-to-Digital tool while offering a SolidProof-audited network for high-tier security. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is widely recognized for its advanced AI features, which include a round-the-clock multilingual AI chatbot, predictive analytics modeling, automated transaction categorization, and AI-based fraud detection tools. These interesting features have further increased its relevance in the crypto wallet space, with expert predictions that it could potentially dominate the AI crypto space. New and existing investors in this new crypto project are already anticipating the launch of its beta platform . It doesn’t take any expert knowledge to see that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will surely gain massive traction when its beta platform launches due to access to its alluring features. In fact, this new project will soon launch the MVP (minimum viable product) of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App. This MVP will give investors a glimpse of its trend-setting wallet infrastructure by providing access to a few of its capabilities, including tracking cryptocurrencies in real-time and simulating its transaction processes with ETH and USDT. Bitcoin Price Struggles Below Weekly Resistance The Bitcoin price has fallen to a weekly range of $93,902.52 – $98,623.62, reflecting an over 10% dip from its price in the past month. This long-standing stagnation is causing BTC to struggle around its weekly resistance of $96,220. Although expert predictions from Arthur Hayes hint that the Bitcoin price will hit as high as $250,000 this year, investors are still cautious, and many are diversifying their holdings with BTC. Furthermore, Coin Eagle recently shared that the negative sentiment towards BTC is growing, which means the Bitcoin price may face a huge correction. AltcoinGordon also highlighted that Japan plans to lift its ban on BTC, cut taxes, and approve Bitcoin ETFs. BTC holders see this as bullish news for the Bitcoin price, with many expecting it to hold strongly amid its negative sentiments. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Bullish Sentiment Is Sky-High—Don’t Wait; Invest Now! Amid Bitcoin’s positive for the year, investing in BTC is a huge opportunity for exponential returns. Still, due to how high the Bitcoin price is, WallitIQ (WLTQ) serves as a cheaper alternative for even higher gains. With its strong positioning in the AI crypto market, an expert has likened its growth potential to BTC’s, implying its capability to rake in millions. According to an expert, it also serves as the perfect low-cap gem for small investors looking to scale their ROI. Invest here now before it’s too late.

Solana (SOL) is showing strong similarities to Ethereum’s past breakout, setting the stage for a potential 80% surge to $340. Binance Coin (BNB) is facing a key test, with technical indicators flashing caution while fundamental strength remains intact. However, the real head-turner is Web3Bay (3BAY) —a presale that’s selling out at record speed as investors secure early positions. With over $1.50 million already raised and 375 million tokens grabbed, Web3Bay is proving to be February’s most talked-about token. Unlike speculative assets, it brings real-world commerce to the blockchain by enabling both crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal. As whale wallets stack up and social interest soars, Web3Bay stands out as one of the most promising plays right now. Can Solana and BNB keep pace, or is Web3Bay about to take over Solana’s Chart Patterns Suggest $340 Upside—Will It Follow Ethereum’s Run? Solana (SOL) is forming a double-bottom pattern, a well-known bullish setup that could lead to a major breakout. Currently hovering near $172, SOL’s price action mirrors Ethereum’s 2024 trajectory, where ETH shot up 80% after completing a similar formation. If Solana follows suit, its valuation could reach $340. Overcoming the $210 resistance level would signal further momentum, with $230 as the next checkpoint. However, failure to breach this barrier might send SOL back to test $160 support. Beyond technical indicators, institutional demand is increasing—Pantera Capital and other major players are watching Solana’s ecosystem closely, boosting its potential. If investor demand continues rising alongside technical strength, Solana could be primed for significant gains. Will it replicate Ethereum’s rally, or will resistance halt its momentum? BNB Approaches Critical Support—Will Buyers Step In or Is a Drop Ahead? Binance Coin (BNB) is at a decisive moment as market forces create uncertainty. Trading near $679, the token is facing resistance from technical indicators while fundamental factors remain strong. A drop below $550 could accelerate selling pressure, whereas reclaiming $600 would set the stage for a reversal. Current indicators show a weakening trend, with the RSI sliding below 40 and trading volume rising amid price declines—suggesting that sellers have the upper hand. Additionally, a potential death cross—when the 50-day moving average dips below the 200-day—raises concerns of a deeper pullback. Despite this, BNB’s ecosystem remains solid. Binance’s quarterly token burns, network enhancements, and continued dominance in crypto trading all support its long-term outlook. Traders should monitor whether $550 holds as a buying opportunity or if a breakdown leads to further downside. Can BNB withstand the pressure and reclaim higher ground? Web3Bay: The Crypto Taking Over February—Will You Get In Before the Next Jump? Web3Bay is taking the crypto world by storm, emerging as the most in-demand presale this month. With over $1.50 million raised and 360 million tokens gone in weeks, interest is soaring. Each presale phase is selling out fast, and prices are climbing at every stage—Web3Bay is the clear FOMO-driven opportunity of February. What makes Web3Bay a must-watch? Unlike hype-driven tokens, it offers real utility, transforming online shopping with a decentralized marketplace that supports both crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal. Cutting out middlemen, it lowers costs and creates a seamless global commerce experience. With increasing adoption, early buyers stand to benefit significantly. Currently priced at just $0.00456, Web3Bay’s projected launch value of $0.1959 offers an extraordinary 6,000% potential return. Large-scale investors are accumulating, and social discussions are driving it into viral status. The best time to enter is now—before the next batch sells out and prices increase. Crypto is watching—will you act before Web3Bay explodes? Final Thoughts: Solana’s price action suggests a breakout could be on the horizon, but overcoming the $210 resistance is key before a full 80% rally can play out. BNB, meanwhile, is at a make-or-break moment—will its support level hold, or is a further drop on the way? Yet, the most exciting story is Web3Bay. Its record-breaking crypto presale , growing whale accumulation, and viral traction indicate a project set for massive gains. History has shown that early investments in strong projects yield the highest returns—Web3Bay’s 6,000% growth potential could make it one of 2025’s biggest crypto success stories. The chance to buy before the next price hike is closing fast. Will you take action now or miss out on what could be the year’s most rewarding investment?

ETH is down over 10% and is struggling to stay above the $2,500 level. Ethereum is facing an increase in selling below the $2,650 zone. The price is trading below $2,750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,600 and $2,650. Ethereum Price Takes A Hit Ethereum price failed to clear the $2,850 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH gained pace below the $2,720 and $2,650 support levels to enter a bearish zone. The price declined over 10% and even declined below the $2,550 support zone. A low was formed at $2,458 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,854 swing high to the $2,458 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,600 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,650 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,854 swing high to the $2,458 low. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,750 resistance. An upside break above the $2,750 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,850 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,550 level. The first major support sits near the $2,450 zone. A clear move below the $2,450 support might push the price toward the $2,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,250 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

40799381,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=681728,1740453852,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40799381.jpeg,JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon says Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E effort ‘needs to be done’,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-says-elon-musks-d-o-g-e-effort-needs-to-be-done/,"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) is taking on an overdue challenge, calling the U.S. government wasteful and inefficient as the Trump administration slashes thousands of federal jobs and restructures entire agencies. Speaking to CNBC’s Leslie Picker, Dimon refused to give a direct yes-or-no response when asked if he supported D.O.G.E, but his message was clear: Washington’s bureaucracy is bloated, outdated, and needs fixing. “The government is inefficient, not very competent, and needs a lot of work,” Dimon said . “It’s not just waste and fraud, it’s outcomes.” He added that the administration’s push to rein in spending and scrutinize federal agencies ‘needs to be done.’ Dimon: D.O.G.E will be held accountable if it overreaches D.O.G.E, which operates under Musk’s advisory role in the Trump administration, has been moving fast, entering federal offices and reviewing budgets with the goal of eliminating waste, streamlining operations, and dismantling agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. When asked about the risks of overreach, Dimon said, “If it does something illegal, the courts will stop it.” Despite the criticism D.O.G.E has faced, Dimon emphasized that the fundamental idea behind it is necessary. “Why are we spending the money on these things? Are we getting what we deserve? What should we change?” he said. “It’s not just about the deficit, it’s about building the right policies and procedures and the government we deserve.” He also said he hopes Musk’s efforts succeed, signaling that even from Wall Street’s most powerful players, there is little patience for runaway government inefficiency. Markets react to tariffs, stock valuations, and uncertainty Beyond government spending, Dimon also weighed in on the U.S. stock market, tariffs, and economic uncertainty. JPMorgan analysts have warned that investors may be too relaxed about tariffs, even as the S&P 500 has stayed near 6,000, despite months of turbulence. The CBOE Volatility Index, often called Wall Street’s fear gauge, has risen 11.5% since the start of the year. Mislav Matejka, JPMorgan’s top equity strategist, warned in a note Monday that investors are underestimating the risks of Trump’s escalating trade war. “We do not believe that we are out of the woods on the tariffs front yet,” Matejka wrote. “We see tariff headline newsflow risk as a continuous theme through this year, and beyond.” Stocks soared in Trump’s first year in office, with the S&P 500 gaining nearly 20% in 2017. But by 2018, trade war fears and Federal Reserve rate hikes drove the market down 6%. Analysts are warning of similar risks now. Even billionaire investor Steve Cohen is skeptical. He told investors last week that tariffs, immigration policy, and spending cuts will drive inflation higher. “Tariffs cannot be positive,” Cohen said. Matejka also pointed out that U.S. stock valuations are stretched. Historically, the S&P 500 has traded at a 10% premium to global markets. Right now, that gap is 50%, a major red flag. “The ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks are not what they were in the past,” Matejka warned, referring to Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Tesla. These companies drove 40% of the market’s gains over the last decade, but their influence is fading. “If the group stops driving the market returns, that would be a meaningful impediment for the chances of renewed U.S. outperformance,” he wrote. Despite these concerns, JPMorgan isn’t telling clients to sell yet. “We do not advocate an underweight U.S. position,” Matejka wrote, citing strong growth and earnings compared to the rest of the world. But with trade war risks and tariffs still on the table, it’s a wild card. Federal judge blocks D.O.G.E from accessing student loan data While Musk’s government overhaul gains momentum, D.O.G.E just ran into its first legal roadblock. A federal judge in Maryland issued a restraining order Monday, blocking it from accessing personal data of millions of student loan borrowers. Judge Deborah Boardman ruled that D.O.G.E officials cannot access data held by the Department of Education and Office of Personnel Management, halting their ability to conduct investigations into waste and fraud in student loan programs. The ruling was prompted by a lawsuit from the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), a union representing 1.8 million members. The union accused the Department of Education of illegally sharing student borrower records with D.O.G.E staffers, including income information and Social Security numbers. “When people give their financial and other personal information to the federal government—namely to secure financial aid for their kids to go to college, or to get a student loan—they expect that data to be protected and used for the reasons it was intended,” said AFT president Randi Weingarten. According to court filings, six D.O.G.E affiliates had already begun working inside the Education Department, requesting access to student loan records to investigate potential fraud. But Boardman ruled that there was no justification for why they needed such sweeping access to borrower data. The restraining order is temporary and will last until March 10 at 8 a.m. Boardman said she believes the plaintiffs will likely succeed in their claim that the Education Department violated the Privacy Act by handing over private data. Ben Winters, the director of AI and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America, said the case raises serious concerns about data security. “The data in question includes really sensitive information on a population of people who had to give that information for one clear purpose: borrow money to get an education,” Winters said. “It’s crucial that institutions like governments only allow your data to be used for strictly the purpose you gave it for.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Bankman-Fried, who was convicted on seven different counts of fraud and conspiracy in November 2023, is serving out a 25-year prison sentence . He's currently detained in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn as his lawyers work through an appeal of his conviction. Still, his account on X (formerly Twitter) posted a 10-tweet thread about layoffs, seemingly referencing Elon Musk's push to have federal employees email their work activities from the past week or risk resignations. ""I have a lot of sympathy for [government] employees: I, too, have not checked my email for the past few (hundred) days,"" his thread began . FTT, the token associated with FTX, briefly spiked from roughly $1.55 to $2.07 after his tweets before falling back to around $1.78, according to CoinGecko . Bankman-Fried does not have direct access to sites like X or email, but can send messages through the Corrlinks system, which lets prisoners in the U.S. communicate with others, a person familiar confirmed. It was not immediately clear who might be posting the tweets on Bankman-Fried's behalf. Over the weekend , Musk, who according to court documents is a special government employee, tweeted that federal employees would have to tell the Office of Personnel and Management what they did last week, with a non-response being considered a resignation. While some federal agency heads or other leaders told their employees not to respond, others said their employees should reply. It's another step in Musk's efforts to lay off broad swaths of the federal workforce at the behest of U.S. President Donald Trump. Bankman-Fried's tweets referenced layoffs and detailed circumstances that might cause an employer to fire employees. ""It isn’t the employee’s fault, when that happens. It isn’t their fault if their employer doesn’t really know what to do with them, or doesn’t really have anyone to effectively manage them. It isn’t their fault if internal politics lead their department to lose its way,"" the thread said . After Bankman-Fried's tweets, another X account claiming without evidence to be him linked a contract address, claiming he received a pardon from Trump and now works for DOGE, the government entity that may or may not be led by Elon Musk. The linked token saw some immediate trading volume, according to on-chain data . The new, seemingly fake account has a label saying ""it is a government or multilateral organization account,"" suggesting a government agency account may have been compromised and renamed.

Based on recent analysis , the price action is indicating potential for both short and long-term moves depending on how it behaves around certain price levels. At press time, Pi Coin is down by more than two percent and is trading at $1.57. Now, what happens next is crucial. If Pi manages to hold above the $1.50 mark and breaks the resistance at $1.72, it could see a bullish reversal that might push the price higher. In this case, a potential rally could take the price toward the $1.80-$1.85 range. However, if Pi fails to hold the $1.60 support level, we might see more downside action, potentially confirming a deeper bearish trend. The support and resistance levels at $1.50 and $1.72-$1.75 will be key to determining which direction the price will head in the near future. Risks to Consider While Pi’s rally is impressive, the crypto market is known for its volatility. After the initial excitement, early adopters might sell off their tokens, causing prices to dip. The possibility of a Binance listing adds credibility but also invites more speculative trading, which could lead to price swings. Predictions for Pi’s future range from $2.50 to $10 per coin. What is Pi Network? Pi Network, launched in 2019, was created to make crypto mining accessible to anyone with a smartphone, without the need for expensive equipment or high energy consumption. This approach has helped Pi gain millions of users worldwide. On February 20th, Pi Network took a major step by transitioning to an open mainnet, allowing users to convert their Pi tokens into real value like other cryptocurrencies or even cash. With millions of users already, Pi has created a unique, user-friendly way to mine and participate in crypto.

And I can confirm that being unemployed is a lot less relaxing than it looks,” Sam wrote. Cryptopolitan immediately recognized the subtext. He wasn’t just talking about jobs, he was aligning himself with Donald Trump’s administration and its decision to fire thousands of federal workers. His comments came days after Trump’s White House ramped up its layoffs, targeting government agencies, defense employees, and research departments. 1) I have a lot of sympathy for gov’t employees: I, too, have not checked my email for the past few (hundred) days And I can confirm that being unemployed is a lot less relaxing than it looks — SBF (@SBF_FTX) February 25, 2025 SBF draws outrage online Crypto Twitter exploded within minutes of SBF’s post. Questions flooded in—How did he get access to Twitter? Was he using a smuggled phone? Did someone post on his behalf? “How did this guy get a phone?” one user asked. Another wrote, “You stole billions of dollars from people, nobody cares at all what you have to say.” SBF’s post turned into a defense of terminations, saying that it’s not always about poor performance but bad management, job misalignment, or lack of resources. He even compared it to competitors who hired 30,000 too many employees and let them sit around doing nothing all day. “And we saw it internally, when a manager would get busy or distracted, and half of a department would lose its bearing at the same time,” said Sam. “It isn’t the employee’s fault, when that happens. It isn’t their fault if their employer doesn’t really know what to do with them, or doesn’t really have anyone to effectively manage them. It isn’t their fault if internal politics lead their department to lose its way.” The layoffs Sam referenced in his Twitter post are part of Trump’s ongoing workforce purge, which has already eliminated thousands of federal jobs. The Department of Veterans Affairs dismissed more than 1,000 employees on February 13, including researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, and prosthetics. Government data from March 2024 shows that 220,000 federal employees had less than a year on the job, making them prime targets for mass layoffs. The Department of Defense announced a 5,400-person reduction, with plans to cut up to 8% of its civilian workforce. The Pentagon has frozen hiring, while military personnel remain exempt from the cuts. SBF has his first prison interview Just four days ago, Sam sat down for his first interview from prison, where he accused Biden’s Department of Justice (DOJ) of targeting him and all but hinted at changing his political loyalty to Trump. “Trump had a lot of frustrations with Kaplan,” said SBF, referring to Judge Lewis Kaplan, the man who sentenced him to 25 years in prison. “I certainly did as well.” He blamed the DOJ for allegedly manipulating his case, accusing them of telling the jury that FTX customers lost everything while barring his team from arguing the opposite. “The jury was told something that was just not true, and Kaplan blocked us from correcting it,” Sam said. He also took a jab at Danielle Sassoon, the lead prosecutor in his case. She recently resigned instead of dismissing a corruption case involving NYC Mayor Eric Adams. He suggested that her resignation raised questions about her role in his trial. “My prosecutor has been in the news recently for tussles with Trump’s DOJ,” Sam said. He then claimed that his donations to Republicans were hidden, while his Democratic contributions were widely publicized. “There was a lot of explicit politicization going on,” Sam said. “Threats were made. A Republican congressional candidate was told his wife would be indicted if he didn’t play along with Biden’s DOJ.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

DOGE remains in a holding pattern, waiting for whale accumulation to spark its next surge. ADA jumped 20% on ETF excitement but fell short of holding key resistance, dipping below $0.80. In contrast, Web3Bay has raised over $1.50 million, selling 375 million tokens faster than expected. This difference shows how utility-driven projects are gaining traction over speculative price swings. Unlike DOGE and ADA, Web3Bay is reshaping online shopping by enabling crypto and fiat payments, pushing toward long-term growth. As DOGE and ADA struggle with market uncertainty, Web3Bay’s presale is moving fast, with a potential 6,000% return before its launch at $0.1959. Will buyers lock in gains before the next batch sells out? Cardano (ADA) Fails to Hold Gains: Can It Rebound? ADA climbed 20% last week, rising from $0.663 to $0.83 after Grayscale’s Cardano ETF (GADA) filing. Yet, despite the hype, ADA couldn’t hold above $0.80 and slipped back to $0.77. Technical indicators suggest weakness. ADA trades below the median Bollinger Band, signaling a lack of upward momentum. With ETF excitement already priced in, uncertainty might push ADA lower short term. Still, a sudden market shift could drive ADA back toward resistance. ADA’s next move depends on broader market trends. A recovery could happen quickly if sentiment turns bullish. Otherwise, more downside is possible. Traders should monitor for a breakout or a deeper drop—will ADA regain momentum or keep falling? Dogecoin (DOGE) Nears Breakout: Can It Hit $1? DOGE’s whale activity remains slow, with large holders maintaining balances at 24.35 billion DOGE. This steady holding pattern signals that major investors are waiting for a clear price direction. Currently, DOGE is consolidating between $0.255 and $0.288, forming a symmetrical triangle that often leads to a breakout. Technical indicators show growing bullish momentum. The RSI is climbing, reflecting increasing buying interest, while the PMO suggests accelerating price momentum. If DOGE breaks above resistance, it could climb to $0.50, $0.75, and even $1. However, if buying weakens, DOGE may test lower support, risking a sell-off. As price compression tightens, traders should watch for whale accumulation—a key trigger for DOGE’s next rally. Will DOGE break resistance and hit new highs? Web3Bay’s Presale Hits $1.5 Million in Weeks– Is It Next Market Leader? While most cryptos face volatility, Web3Bay’s presale is thriving, attracting strong interest as other projects struggle. With over $1.50 million raised and 375 million tokens sold in just weeks, its rapid progress shows that investors see it as a standout in a shaky market. Unlike speculative coins, Web3Bay offers real-world value with its decentralized marketplace that supports both crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal. This practical use case is drawing serious buyers, including whales who are accumulating in anticipation of exponential growth. With each presale batch selling out quickly and prices rising at every stage, early participants secure a launch price advantage. At $0.00456 per token, with a projected listing at $0.1959, Web3Bay offers a potential 6,000% return. While many altcoins face uncertain futures, Web3Bay’s fast-growing demand shows that practical blockchain solutions are gaining ground. The Bottom Line! Crypto markets are at a turning point. DOGE’s breakout depends on whale activity, while ADA struggles to hold gains despite ETF excitement. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is surging ahead, driven by its real-world value and strong buyer demand. With its crypto presale price at $0.00456 rising fast and whales accumulating aggressively, now may be the best time to act. By the time ADA and DOGE find momentum, Web3Bay’s early buyers could be enjoying exponential returns. Which side of the market will you be on?

The seizure, announced on Monday by the Southern District of New York (SDNY), follows a joint operation with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in San Diego. In April 2021, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in Uranium Finance’s automated market maker (AMM) on the Binance Smart Chain, stealing around $50 million in various tokens. The incident was one of the largest hacks in DeFi history. Following the hack, the attacker tried to launder the stolen funds using methods such as crypto mixing services and small deposits on centralized exchanges. In an unexpected turn, blockchain researcher Zack XBT even suggested that the hacker may have used some of the stolen funds to purchase rare Magic: The Gathering trading cards. SDNY and @HSISanDiego seize cryptocurrency worth approximately $31 million related to April 2021 hack of Uranium Finance. If you believe you have been a victim of this hack, please contact UraniumVictims@hsi.dhs.gov. — US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) February 24, 2025 The hack ultimately led to the shutdown of Uranium Finance, leaving victims without restitution. However, the recent seizure of the $31 million offers a potential recovery for those affected, nearly four years after the attack. While further details on the investigation have not been provided, this marks a major development in the case.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BNB|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 04:06:07

The price is now testing $2.250 and might continue to move down. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.50 level. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.4880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down unless there is a close above the $2.50 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips Below Support XRP price failed to continue higher above the $2.75 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.65 and $2.55 support levels. The price even dipped below the $2.50 support to enter a bearish zone. A low was formed at $2.2310 and the price is now attempting to recover toward the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.7450 swing high to the $2.2310 low. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.3250 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.40 level. The next resistance is $2.4880 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.7450 swing high to the $2.2310 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.4880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. A clear move above the $2.4880 resistance might send the price toward the $2.550 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.620 resistance or even $2.650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.750. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.3250 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.250 level. The next major support is near the $2.220 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.220 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.120 support. The next major support sits near the $2.050 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.220 and $2.120.
