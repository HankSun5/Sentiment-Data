Following XRP’s price forecast, analysts set sights on PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a new altcoin that simplifies investment and provides opportunities in the AI and real estate space. PropiChain’s recent market listing on CoinMarketCap spells its potential for a 100x rally once it launches officially. The project leverages the real estate investment space, one of the oldest markets in the world, making a name for itself by eliminating the barriers of traditional property investment. Find out why XRP’s price forecast favors this altcoin. XRP Prepares For Massive Moves Following Its Price Forecast Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared in a post on X that XRP was preparing for a possible breakout from its ascending triangle. The analyst shared that if XRP maintained its bullish outlook, the project could experience a 26% move, and many investors anticipate the results of this price forecast. XRP is priced at about $2.7, surging over 11% within the past week due to the positive investor sentiment surrounding the project. Recently, Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) approved a Hashdex XRP ETF , which shows its potential for mainstream adoption this year. Experts predict that XRP will witness a surge of over 31% by May and analysts say that this price forecast will trigger a rally for other altcoins. That’s why top investors believe that the XRP price forecast could lead to PCHAINS massive rally. Meet PropiChain, The Advanced Real Estate Platform PropiChain is a blockchain platform transforming how individuals invest in real estate. Unlike conventional investment systems, PropiChain offers a diverse range of features like tokenized real estate, a metaverse platform, and AI-driven data. Although XRP’s price forecast has sparked excitement among many investors, PropiChain emerges as the best altcoin for long-term investment. The tokenization of real estate is one of the key features that sets PropiChain ahead of other projects. With PropiChain, you can access a variety of AI-driven tools to help you make informed choices. These tools are useful in analyzing real estate trends, rental income, and market fluctuations to ensure that you make the most of your investment. The PropiChain project offers easy access to blue-chip real estate by allowing traders to own fractions of these assets. So, imagine you want to purchase a luxury apartment that’s worth millions of dollars, but you only have $10,000. With PropiChain, rather than trying to acquire millions to purchase this property, you can own a fraction of it with tokenized shares starting at just $1,000. This unique approach is why experts believe that once the PCHAIN token launches, it could surge as high as $10. PropiChain’s bullish price forecast and dedication to streamlining property ownership show its potential to outpace XRP this year. Another reason why analysts believe PropiChain could outpace XRP’s price forecast is the platform’s efforts toward maintaining safety. The PropiChain project leverages smart contracts to ensure that all activities on the platform are secure and transparent. This Altcoin Prepares For A Massive Rally Post-Launch: Join The PCHAIN Presale! The PropiChain presale is in its second round, and each PCHAIN token is priced at $0.011. Already, over $1.2 million has been raised, and this altcoin has quickly become a top choice among savvy investors. Due to the influx of investors to this altcoin’s presale, over 62% of the tokens allocated to this round have been purchased. Experts believe that once round three starts, this altcoin will witness a surge of over 100%, rising to $0.023. Analysts believe this altcoin could mirror XRP’s price forecast once it lists at $0.032.

According to a new announcement from Robinhood, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is dropping its investigation into the trading app less than a year after sending the firm a Wells Notice. The SEC sent Robinhood a Wells Notice , a formal warning of investigation, in May of last year despite Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev’s claims that the firm met with the regulator over 15 times “in good faith”. “We tried to create what’s called the special purpose broker-dealer for the purpose of transacting crypto assets. We actually came in good faith to meet with the SEC. I think we met with them 16 times and, unfortunately, that was not reciprocated.” Now, with the charges dropped, Robinhood calls for the SEC to regulate with regulations as opposed to enforcement actions. Says Dan Gallagher, Robinhood’s chief legal, compliance and corporate affairs officer, on the SEC’s decision to drop charges, “We applaud the staff’s decision to close this investigation with no action. Let me be crystal clear—this investigation never should have been opened. Robinhood Crypto always has and will always respect federal securities laws and never allowed transactions in securities. As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed. We appreciate the formal closing of this investigation, and we are happy to see a return to the rule of law and commitment to fairness at the SEC.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to the post, the seizure was the result of a joint effort between SDNY and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in San Diego. A spokesperson for SDNY did not return CoinDesk’s request for comment before press time, and no further details about the seizure or any related investigation were immediately available. Uranium Finance was essentially a clone of automated market maker (AMM) Uniswap deployed on Binance’s BNB chain (then called Binance Smart Chain). In April 2021, a hacker exploited a bug in Uranium’s pair contracts to steal $50 million in various tokens. At the time of the incident, the Uranium Finance hack was one of the largest monetary exploits in decentralized finance (DeFi) history.

Uranium Finance shuttered after the hack, leaving victims without answers or financial restitution.

The rest of the world appears to be following the United States’ lead after it set the tone for a crypto-forward 2025. The Trump administration has continued to embrace cryptocurrency and is creating a favorable regulatory environment for crypto companies. As a result, financial institutions across the world are now looking to hop on the digital asset train. The latest is DekaBank, a leading German investment bank managing assets worth approximately €377 billion, has officially launched cryptocurrency trading and custody services tailored for institutional clients. Before the Trump pro-cryptocurrency run, Germany had already laid some groundwork for crypto regulation. Back in 2013, the country became one of the first to recognize cryptocurrencies as financial assets. Then, in 2020, it made BaFin licensing mandatory for all crypto exchanges. DekaBank now offers crypto services The recently announced launch is the result of DekaBank’s meticulous planning and development over the span of two years. In December of 2024, the bank secured a crypto custody license from Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( BaFin ) and the European Central Bank ( ECB ) under the German Banking Act (KWG). This licensure authorizes DekaBank to offer comprehensive crypto custody services, ensuring that institutional clients can securely store and manage their digital assets within a regulated framework. In July of 2024, the bank received a license as a crypto securities registrar for the German issuance of DLT-based digital securities. DekaBank is also not new to the digital asset space. In fact, the bank is a very active member of the community. DekaBank is the founder of SWIAT , the blockchain platform for digital securities and has notable names like Standard Chartered and LBBW as investors. Commerzbank was the first German bank to receive a crypto custody license from BaFin and the European Central Bank and DekaBank followed suit not long after. The bank’s services are exclusively for institutional investors Private buyers are explicitly excluded from DekaBank’s crypto offerings. Bloomberg reports that DekaBank is exclusively offering its crypto services to institutional investors as they have the necessary know-how, resources and infrastructure to professionally manage risks from crypto investments. A board member of DekaBank explained the bank’s position, saying, “We have the necessary experience, the necessary licenses as well as a tested and ready-to-use infrastructure to accompany savings banks and our other institutional customers.” Other companies from the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, the savings bank finance group to which DekaBank belongs, also offer institutional customers access to cryptocurrencies. Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW) has teamed up with Bitpanda to give their corporate clients access to a platform for the custody, buying, and trading of cryptocurrencies. Cooperative banks, Volksbanks and Raiffeisenbanks, under the leadership of DZ bank are in the process of developing their crypto services. They intend to launch officially by mid-year, offering crypto services to private customers. The initiative is being launched alongside IT service provider Atruvia and the Stuttgart Stock Exchange for the German Geno primary banks. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The move has caught the attention of market analysts, with some suggesting that it could be a sign of anticipated price volatility. Massive Token Unlock Raises Questions Solana’s upcoming token unlock event is one of the largest in recent memory, with over $2 billion worth of SOL set to be released into the market. Token unlocks can significantly impact asset prices, often leading to increased supply and downward pressure on value. Given the scale of this event, Wintermute’s decision to withdraw a large quantity of SOL from Binance has raised questions about whether it anticipates a price surge or is positioning itself to manage liquidity as volatility increases. Potential Market Impact of the Unlock Event Large token unlocks can have varied effects on the market. In some cases, they lead to a sell-off as early investors or project teams liquidate their holdings. However, if market demand is strong, the additional supply can be absorbed without significantly affecting prices. Solana has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in recent months, rebounding from its 2022 lows and reclaiming a strong position in the market. Investors are now closely watching whether the upcoming unlock will be met with buying interest or lead to a short-term correction. Wintermute’s Role in Market Liquidity As a market maker, Wintermute plays a crucial role in maintaining liquidity and facilitating trading across exchanges. Its decision to move SOL off Binance could indicate preparations for increased trading activity or plans to deploy liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Historically, market makers have used large-scale token unlocks as opportunities to profit from price movements, whether through short-term trading strategies or arbitrage across different platforms. Broader Implications for Solana’s Ecosystem The Solana ecosystem has been growing rapidly, with a surge in decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and DeFi platforms utilizing its blockchain. While the token unlock represents a potential challenge in terms of market dynamics, strong adoption and institutional interest in Solana could help mitigate any negative effects. Some analysts believe that if Solana can maintain its momentum despite the unlock, it could reinforce confidence in its long-term growth. Others caution that if selling pressure intensifies, the asset could face short-term volatility before finding a new price equilibrium. Conclusion Wintermute’s withdrawal of $38 million in SOL ahead of the $2 billion unlock has added an extra layer of uncertainty to an already significant event for Solana. While token unlocks often lead to increased supply and volatility, Solana’s strong fundamentals and market positioning could help counteract potential selling pressure. Investors will be closely monitoring how the market reacts to the unlock event and whether demand remains strong enough to absorb the new supply. As one of the most-watched cryptocurrencies in the market, Solana’s price action in the coming days could provide valuable insights into broader market sentiment.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|BNB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-24 23:12:00

ETH was last changing hands around $2,600, having dumped back to the south of its 21DMA at $2,700 after briefly hitting $2,850 on Sunday. The world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization remains trapped within multi-week ranges, as it continues to experience elevated sell pressure as it nears it 200DMA just above $2,900. The Ethereum price is now down over 35% from its December highs above $4,000 and remains stuck in a medium-term downtrend. With Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader market also appearing to lose steam, a retest of recent lows in the $2,100s could be on the cards. However, Ethereum could still be a great crypto to accumulate on the dip, owing to what various analysts are referring to as an excellent “risk-reward” profile at current price levels. Big Ethereum Price Bounce Coming? ETH Presents Excellent “Risk Reward” Popular anonymous crypto analyst Doctor Profit argued in a thread on X on Monday that ETH is “the best opportunity in the market”. The big #ETH report – Why I’m Insanely Bullish: This is a long-term analysis of Ethereum (ETH). We are looking at the coming months, not a short-term hype or quick profits.

He also pointed out a multi-year ascending trend channel, and a multi-year ascending triangle formation. Doctor Profit is targeting a rally to the $8,000-$10,000 region this cycle. Fellow crypto analyst Mister Crypto also pointed out this ascending triangle structure, saying that “it doesn’t get any better than this”. Textbook ascending triangle on Ethereum.

Ethereum is heavily undervalued. pic.twitter.com/4FWHgjrkUT — TraderPA (@Trader1PA) February 21, 2025 While volatility could remain elevated in the coming weeks, with further downside likely, Ethereum’s relative underperformance, relatively more “over-sold” market conditions and higher levels of FUD could mean that ETH has less downside risk versus other major cryptos. While there are no guarantees around when the next major market bounce will come, its arguably more favorable price suggests Ethereum has a lot more room to bounce when market sentiment does turn substantially for the better again. Fundamentals Align Towards Ethereum Outperformance The crypto bull market so far this cycle has been characterized by justifiable Bitcoin outperformance. But it has also been characterized, up until the last few weeks anyway, by the outperformance of the low/zero meme coin sector and its associated ecosystem (like the Solana chain), and the relative underperformance of utility cryptos (like Ethereum). That trend could be about to flip. The meme coin market has swooned hard in recent weeks. The Trump meme coin launch and LIBRA scandal has left crypto degenerates and retail exhausted and burnt. Trump coin bagged a lot of people. A President should have never done this. Period. Down 70% from peak. $TRUMP pic.twitter.com/3jDLT8QUye — Prof (@Prof_heist) February 3, 2025 A preference towards cryptos that actually have some underlying value thanks to their underlying utility, but still have massive upside potential, could soon set in. That could see retail traders starting to flood back to undervalued utility plays like Ethereum, Aave (AAVE) and Chainlink (LINK) in droves, rather than chasing the next high-risk, lower-reward meme play. Given that Solana is the main meme coin casino, SOL’s relative outperformance versus ETH could soon flip on its head. That’s especially the case as Ethereum extends its lead over another altcoin in terms of institutional adoption. Having secured spot US ETFs in mid-2024, Ethereum ETFs are soon likely to feature staking, making them substantially more attractive to institutional investors. Whilst ETF inflows have slowed in recent days, they are likely to remain mostly positive this year against the backdrop of the positive shift in the US regulatory environment. FUD may be high right now, but ETH remains the undisputed king of DeFi and, as BlackRock’s preferred altcoin, is likely to remain a major crypto market leader in the years ahead.

Among the many emerging projects, three have stood out—Qubetics ($TICS), EOS, and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). These top cryptos to invest in today offer innovative solutions that aim to solve problems ranging from scalability to decentralized applications. Each project brings its own unique vision, but with so many different blockchain technologies emerging, the real question is: which of these is the best fit for the future of digital finance? In this article, it’ll take a deep dive into Qubetics , EOS, and ICP to help you navigate this exciting landscape.Also explore how Qubetics is making waves with its presale, offering real-world solutions that previous projects have failed to address. So, whether you’re a seasoned investor or just getting started in the crypto space, going to break down why these projects are worth your attention and investment. Let’s explore why Qubetics, EOS, and ICP are making a big impact in today’s crypto market. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace When talk about the top cryptos to invest in today, Qubetics ($TICS) undeniably grabs attention. It’s a project that’s not just about theoretical solutions; it’s focused on solving real-world problems. Qubetics is transforming the way that think about asset tokenization, specifically in terms of real-world assets. The Qubetics Real-World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace is making it easier for businesses, professionals, and individuals to digitize physical assets and tokenize them on the blockchain. What makes Qubetics stand out is its presale success. With more than 489 million tokens sold and over 21,200 holders, Qubetics is clearly gaining traction. The ongoing crypto presale has raised over $14 million, and there’s still a lot of buzz surrounding it. Currently, Qubetics tokens are priced at $0.0888 each, and with the presale nearing its final stages, there’s a real sense of excitement about its growth potential. Analysts are predicting that $TICS will see an 181.52% ROI by the end of the presale, with the price expected to soar to $1 or even $5 after the mainnet launch, offering investors massive returns. As more and more industries move toward blockchain integration, Qubetics offers businesses a seamless way to tokenize their assets and unlock liquidity. With the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the increasing importance of asset-backed tokens, Qubetics positions itself as one of the top cryptos to invest in today—for anyone who believes in the future of decentralized finance and asset tokenization. EOS: Empowering the Decentralized Future Now let’s look at EOS, another key player in the crypto market that has earned its spot as one of the top cryptos to invest in today. EOS is a blockchain protocol that aims to offer high-speed transactions, scalability, and an efficient development environment for decentralized applications (dApps). EOS’s architecture was built to tackle some of the common problems seen in earlier blockchain systems, such as slow transaction speeds and high fees. Launched by block.one, EOS has a unique delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which gives it a distinct advantage over other platforms in terms of scalability. One of the key features that sets EOS apart from other platforms like Ethereum is its ability to process thousands of transactions per second, with minimal fees. This makes it an attractive option for developers looking to build dApps that require high throughput without breaking the bank. As an established blockchain platform, EOS has already seen considerable success in terms of adoption. It’s become a go-to choice for developers aiming to build dApps and smart contracts, and it’s positioning itself as a leader in blockchain scalability. The introduction of tools like EOSIO, a software that enables businesses to launch custom blockchains, further strengthens its market position. Investing in EOS means betting on a project with real-world utility and proven technology. As one of the top cryptos to invest in today, EOS continues to evolve, and its strong developer community is a testament to its growing influence in the blockchain space. Internet Computer Protocol (ICP): The Blockchain for the Web Next up is Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), a project that’s aiming to reimagine how to interact with the internet itself. ICP’s ambitious goal is to create an entirely decentralized internet where applications can run directly on the blockchain, removing the need for centralized servers and traditional cloud services. The project is led by the DFINITY Foundation and seeks to build a new kind of global cloud computing system. Internet Computer stands out by bringing smart contract execution to an entirely new level, allowing developers to build decentralized applications that are much more efficient and scalable than what’s possible on other blockchains. ICP integrates its own version of WebAssembly to provide faster execution times for decentralized apps, which makes it a more practical solution for everyday use cases. What’s particularly exciting about ICP is its potential to drive the next generation of decentralized internet infrastructure. Unlike traditional cloud services, where data is hosted by a few major corporations, ICP promises a more distributed model, making the internet more secure and resilient. This vision of a decentralized web has captured the imagination of many, and it’s no surprise that ICP is considered one of the top cryptos to invest in today. However, ICP is not without its challenges. Despite the excitement, the project has faced some volatility in its price since its launch. But for long-term investors who believe in the vision of a decentralized internet, ICP presents a fascinating opportunity for future growth. Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace: A Deeper Dive into Qubetics’ Vision Now look at Qubetics, EOS, and ICP as some of the top cryptos to invest in today, let’s focus on one of the most exciting aspects of Qubetics—its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace. Tokenization has become a buzzword in the crypto space, and for good reason. It allows tangible assets—whether they’re real estate, art, or even commodities—to be digitized and represented as tokens on the blockchain. Qubetics is streamlining this process, making it easier for businesses and individuals to tokenize their assets in a secure and efficient way.

Per the South Korean media outlets Gukje News and Sky E Daily , officers at the Busan Main Customs Office said they had arrested a man and a woman, both of whom are aged “in their twenties.” The officials do not believe the duo know one another. However, they suspect that both were recruited by the same “drug lord” via a Telegram open channel. South Korean Customs Officers: Drug Lord Paid Smugglers in Crypto The customs office said it had charged the pair with violations of the Narcotics Control Act. A Korean-language Telegram open channel that South Korean customs officials think a ‘drug lord’ used to recruit smugglers as ‘part-time workers.’ (Source: Busan Main Customs Office) Officials think the Telegram channel operator “advertised” on the platform, calling the “opportunity” a “high-paying part-time job.” In total, officials said the duo smuggled over 7kg worth of narcotics into the country. They may also have been involved in distributing narcotics to drug users or local dealers in South Korea. In one instance, one of the suspected “drug smugglers” was been accused of “attempting to import at least 700g of highly concentrated liquid marijuana” into the nation from the United States via South Korea’s Incheon International Airport. The same individual also reportedly “received” 4.5kg of synthetic marijuana from Vietnam. The other individual also imported 1.2kg of synthetic marijuana from Vietnam and then helped “distribute it” to buyers in multiple cities including Suwon. Narcotics seized by Busan-based customs officers. (Source: Busan Main Customs Office) Telegram Open Channel Used as Recruitment Platform, Say Officials Officers added that the “drug lord mastermind” gave the duo “specific instructions” via Telegram chats. The mastermind reportedly paid the two individuals crypto via an “unregistered crypto exchange ” that made payments “difficult to trace.” Officers said they had worked on the case with the Gyeonggi Southern Provincial Police Agency and other law enforcement services. A Busan Customs official told reporters that drug dealers were preying on “young people who are familiar with” social media platforms and crypto.

That is how they turned small investments into massive fortunes with ETH and SOL. After riding the waves of growth with these giants, they’re now shifting their profits into this low cap crypto, RCO Finance , aiming to replicate the same success. They know the cycle: identify an undervalued gem before the masses, accumulate before the surge, and watch your profits flow in. With RCOF’s groundbreaking AI-driven trading and real-world use cases, they see another golden opportunity and they’re taking it. Let’s break down why. Solana and Ethereum Are Stalling While Investors Look Elsewhere Two of its biggest giants in the crypto market, Solana and Ethereum, are struggling to push higher. Solana , which saw an incredible rally over the last few months, recently dipped below its $175 support, sparking concerns of a deeper correction. Bulls attempted to reclaim lost ground, but resistance at $175 has turned into a barrier, keeping the price suppressed. If this level holds, SOL risks sliding further to $155 or even $133, as sellers continue to dominate. Ethereum isn't faring much better. It has been hovering below the key $2,850 level for days, unable to mount a convincing recovery. Although support at $2,500 has held firm, buyers are yet to regain control. If ETH cannot push above the downtrend line, the risk of dropping to $2,400 or even $2,300 remains. Whales who once fueled these coins’ parabolic rise are looking for fresh opportunities, and the lack of upward momentum is causing them to reallocate their funds elsewhere. This is why they’re pouring millions into RCO Finance before it blows up. RCO Finance Is a Game Changer Unlike Solana and Ethereum, which are mature assets with slower growth, RCOF is at the beginning of its journey; offering both real-world utility and the kind of explosive potential that made early ETH and SOL investors millionaires. RCO Finance is a revolutionary AI-powered investment ecosystem designed to remove guesswork from crypto trading. The centerpiece of this ecosystem is the Robo Advisor, a next-generation AI tool that scans the market in real-time to provide precise entry and exit points. Just recently, we saw the TRUMP token explode by 100x within hours. While most traders only jumped in late, the RCO Finance Robo Advisor would have detected its early momentum, analyzing price action, social media trends, and institutional movements, to alert users before the surge. But the AI doesn’t just identify winners; it also protects your portfolio from losses. If a coin in your portfolio suddenly shows signs of a breakdown, the Robo Advisor can trigger automated alerts or even execute trades, ensuring you don’t ride an asset all the way down. And it learns. Over time, its machine-learning algorithms improve, adapting to market conditions and refining predictions. But RCO Finance doesn’t stop at AI-powered trading. The project unlocks an unparalleled level of diversification, offering more than 120,000 investment options. Users can allocate capital across stocks, ETFs, bonds, and even tokenized real estate, all from a single KYC-free platform. Additionally, RCO Finance integrates debit cards, allowing you to spend your holdings instantly. No need to swap assets or go through lengthy conversion processes. You can use your crypto for everyday transactions. Presale Demand Surges as Whales Rush in Before the Next Price Hike Unlike most presales, RCO Finance has launched its Beta platform with over 10,000 active users. So you can see the ecosystem in action before committing. As the project transitions into the alpha phase, even more advanced features are set to roll out, further increasing its appeal. Currently in its fifth presale phase , the token is trading at $0.10, but that price won’t last much longer. Once the next phase kicks in, RCOF will jump to $0.13; a guaranteed 30% increase in just a matter of weeks. The project has already raised over $13 million, and as demand continues to surge, early investors are locking in gains before the next price hike. A $1,000 investment at today’s price of $0.10 would be worth $1,300 in the next stage. But the real potential lies in the long term. With major exchange listings on the horizon and widespread adoption ahead, some analysts believe RCOF could experience a 10,000x surge turning that $1,000 into over $100,000 this year. SolidProof’s audit confirms that the smart contract is fully secure, with no vulnerabilities, making it a safe and lucrative bet. The Smart Money Knows When to Move Ethereum and Solana have cemented themselves as pillars of the crypto world, but their early days of explosive growth are behind them. Ethereum went from pennies to thousands, Solana surged from under $1 to over $200, and those who got in early became millionaires. But today, these assets face slower gains. Their market caps are massive, and 10x returns are no longer a guarantee. RCO Finance , however, is just getting started. It offers the same kind of ground-floor opportunity that ETH and SOL had in their infancy. Solana and Ethereum whales aren’t waiting. They see what’s coming, and they’re positioning themselves before the crowd catches on. You too can get in today.

Ltd affiliate has admitted to processing over $1 trillion in transactions for US customers without a license. It will pay more than $504 million in penalties. On Monday, the exchange pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to a felony charge of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. OKX, which supports spot trading for over 300 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, acknowledged its violations. U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla imposed the penalties, including fines and forfeitures, as part of an agreement between the exchange and federal prosecutors. OKX said in a Feb. 24 statement that the firm acknowledged that certain US customers had previously traded on the company’s global platform due to legacy compliance gaps. According to the exchange, the number of US clients involved amounted to a small percentage of the crypto exchange’s total customer base, and none of these customers remain on its platform. Source: OKX The Seychelles-based crypto exchange emphasized that no customer harm was alleged, and no charges were filed against any OKX employee. However, Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky criticized the OKX affiliate for “knowingly” violating Anti-Money Laundering laws, alleging it facilitated over $5 billion in suspicious transactions and criminal proceeds. ”Today’s guilty plea and penalties emphasize that there will be consequences for financial institutions that avail themselves of US markets but violate the law by allowing criminal activity to continue.” FBI Assistant Director in Charge James E. Dennehy noted that the OKX affiliate advised individuals to provide false information to circumvent requisite procedures. ”Blatant disregard for the rule of law will not be tolerated,” Dennehy added. The DOJ stated that the violations took place between 2018 and early 2024, despite OKX having an official policy since 2017 prohibiting U.S. users from trading on its platform.

Together, they launched four major Money Market Fund (MMF) tokens, tapping into the growing demand for more investment vehicles amongst institutional investors. Institutional Investors Demands Spurs XDC Network’s MMF Launch According to XDC Network’s announcement on Monday, these are its first tokenized funds. Notably, the MMFs are from abrdn, Fidelity International, BlackRock, and State Street and are now available on the XDC Network platform. XDC Network and Archax are keen to expand institutional investors’ access to Traditional Finance (TradFi) through blockchain technology . Keith O’Callaghan, the Head of Asset Management and Structuring at Archax, opines, “Providing digital representations of major MMFs opens up a potential new audience for these types of yield-bearing products that historically have been challenging for some to access.” RWA Tokenization and What XDC Network Brings to the Table XDC’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism will be utilized as part of the strategic partnership. This will facilitate transaction settlement and maintain near-zero gas fees. It is worth noting that this blockchain platform boasts of being the ideal protocol for Real-world Asset (RWA) tokenization, especially for institutions that wish to work with regulated entities like Archax. There is a general rise in the demand for tokenized MMFs amongst institutional investors. This is highly reflected in the RWA tokenization market’s financial value and current outlook. In the first week of February, the RWA tokenization market hit a record Total Value Locked (TVL) of $17.1 billion. Explicitly, this caused it to reach levels last seen in mid-January. Projection For RWA Tokenization Market In its paper “Real-world asset tokenization: A game changer for global trade,” Standard Chartered hinted that the tokenized RWA market could grow to $30.1 trillion by 2034. This forecast is not far-fetched, especially if the suggestion of Eli Cohen, general counsel at Centrifuge, comes into play. Cohen stated that US President Donald Trump’s administration will likely pull away from restrictive financial policies. In his opinion, such moves hold potential for RWA tokenization in 2025 , as it would further boost the sector’s growth.

On the flip side, analysts say the move could be a trigger for an accumulation spree amid prolonged bearish sentiments. Whale Moves $127 Million Worth Of Sol TO Unknown Wallet A Solana (SOL) whale has transferred 846,613 SOL to an unknown wallet in a single transaction amid falling asset prices. With Solana price hovering around the $150 mark, the transferred assets are valued at a hefty $127 million, spiking SOL’s daily trading volumes. While the sizable transfer appears to have gone under the radar, investors say the move could have far-reaching consequences for the beleaguered asset. A majority of traders are viewing the $127 million transfer as preliminary moves for a sell-off given prevailing sentiments. Only a handful of investors see the transfer as an accumulation play ahead of a market breakout. Solana Price Continues To Fall Onchain data indicates SOL has lost 11% in under 24 hours to settle at the $152 mark. Since the asset reached its peak of $294 at the start of the year, it has shed 49% of its value in less than a month. SOL’s market capitalization of $75.4 billion manages to keep it among the top cryptocurrencies by valuation. However, underlying metrics remain grim as it plays second fiddle to Ethereum in DEX weekly volumes. Solana network fees and memecoin activity have also taken a hit in recent weeks while the number of active Solana users fell to its lowest level in five months. SOL Expected To Slip Even Further Amid the unsavory metrics for SOL, chances for a break out remain unlikely for the asset. For starters, the Solana price descent has seen it fall below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, setting the stage for a bearish death cross pattern. MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are painting a depressing picture for SOL with indicators tipping prices to reach $109.

Monero (XMR) is poised for an up to 140% jump following a pivotal privacy ruling, underscoring its lead in the privacy coin niche. Post-mainnet, Celestia (TIA) is drawing eyes with its modular blockchain advancements, potentially driving its value up. Yet, the standout is BlockDAG (BDAG). Having amassed over $197.5 million, with its presale nearing completion and the compelling LISTING1000 bonus offering a 350% increase in coins, BlockDAG offers a prime buying opportunity. Beyond mere market buzz, BDAG’s solution to blockchain inefficiencies is robust, with predictions setting its value at $1 by 2025, offering early adopters substantial potential returns. Monero Set to Soar by 140% After Critical Privacy Decision Currently, Monero, the premier privacy-centric cryptocurrency, trades at about $220.75, marking a 1.87% rise since its last close. Over the previous day, XMR has recorded a trade volume of roughly $58 million, indicating robust market activity. Recent analysis indicates Monero’s value could climb by up to 140% following a beneficial outcome in the Tornado Cash case, likely boosting the appeal of privacy-focused coins. Moreover, Monero’s distinctive privacy capabilities continue to draw those desiring transaction anonymity, further solidifying its market stance. Celestia (TIA) Climbs Post-Mainnet Launch: Is More Growth Ahead? Celestia is trading around $3.20, showing a 2.78% increase over the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization is approximately $1.67 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $81.46 million. Key updates include Celestia’s successful Mainnet Beta rollout, dubbed Lemon Mint, initiating the launch of the inaugural modular data availability layer. Celestia has also partnered with Arbitrum Orbit, enhancing its modular data availability offerings. A consistent price above $3.50 could signal more bullish trends, whereas a fall below $3.00 might suggest bearish possibilities. BlockDAG’s LISTING1000: The Optimal Crypto Entry Point Blockchain networks often suffer from congestion, high fees, and inefficiencies, struggling to meet increasing demands. BlockDAG is engineered to alleviate these problems, and it has captured significant market attention. It’s a pioneering Layer 1 blockchain that combines blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technologies, ensuring exceptional speed, scalability, and efficiency. Unlike traditional blockchains that sequentially process transactions, BlockDAG enables parallel transaction validation, which eliminates bottlenecks and lowers fees. Since its presale, it has gathered over $197.5 million, selling 18.5 billion BDAG coins swiftly. Buyers from Batch 1 have already realized gains of 2,380%, with BDAG currently priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27. Projections for 2025 place BDAG’s value at $1, suggesting a remarkable 3,930% ROI. With the LISTING1000 bonus now in effect, this potential return is even more enticing. BlockDAG recently introduced a bonus code — LISTING1000, providing a 350% bonus on every BDAG purchase. For example, buying 10,000 BDAG at $0.0248 each would result in receiving 45,000 BDAG post-bonus. If BDAG hits $1 as projected, that $248 purchase could swell to $45,000. The LISTING1000 promotion is temporary and could end at any time, making this the prime moment to act before this chance vanishes. Key Insights! The crypto market favors those who move swiftly, and fleeting opportunities like BlockDAG’s LISTING1000 bonus are rare. While Monero’s privacy-driven revival and Celestia’s cutting-edge blockchain method are promising, BDAG is already establishing its superiority, amassing $197.5 million and delivering a 2,380% ROI to early backers. With the presale now in its 27th batch at $0.0248 and demand soaring, BDAG’s anticipated 3,930% return positions it as the best crypto to buy now . The LISTING1000 bonus is fleeting—missing out could mean losing out on potentially transformative returns. If you’re seeking the next significant crypto development, BlockDAG isn’t just an option—it’s the essential move before time runs out.

Whether aiming for quick profits or steady gains, choosing projects with real-world value is essential. Here’s a look at the best-performing cryptos to buy today, with Web3Bay leading the way for its decentralized e-commerce platform. Web3Bay (3BAY): Presale Gem with Unmatched Growth Potential Web3Bay is drawing attention with its decentralized marketplace that goes beyond price speculation. The platform removes middlemen, letting buyers and sellers trade directly through smart contract escrow services. Starting at $0.003 during its presale, the 3BAY coin has risen to $0.004562625 and is expected to launch at $0.1959—a 6430% ROI for those who joined early. With more than $1.5 million raised, interest in Web3Bay keeps growing. The project offers practical benefits, including a 5% discount for coin holders and planned integrations with PayPal and Google Pay, enhancing accessibility. With limited supply and a governance model, Web3Bay offers long-term value, making it one of the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Web3Bay stands out from projects driven by hype. Its decentralized marketplace delivers real services, allowing secure transactions using smart contracts that lower fraud risk and fees. As more people adopt Web3Bay’s system, demand for 3BAY coins grows since they are essential for transactions and governance. With major payment integrations and community-led governance, Web3Bay has strong long-term potential. Its ability to disrupt traditional e-commerce solidifies its position as one of the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Polkadot (DOT): Expanding Utility With JAM Chain Polkadot is known for its advanced blockchain network. The JAM Chain upgrade simplifies development by letting creators deploy smart contracts directly on Polkadot’s Layer 0, removing the need for parachains and improving efficiency. With greater scalability and new governance tools, JAM Chain is attracting more developers to Polkadot. Its interoperability feature allows smooth integration with other blockchains, boosting the adoption of interconnected apps. As blockchain scalability becomes essential, Polkadot’s solutions may increase DOT’s value, keeping it among the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Avalanche (AVAX): Growing Subnets and GameFi Momentum Avalanche is a top choice for scalability, with its subnet system gaining more users. GameFi and DeFi platforms prefer Avalanche due to its high speed and low costs. Avalanche’s subnets let developers build custom blockchains that still connect to the mainnet, supporting more projects. This flexibility is driving adoption and increasing AVAX demand. The GameFi sector is growing on Avalanche as developers seek fast, scalable networks, positioning AVAX as one of the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Avalanche’s affordable fees and fast transactions are key for developers, attracting many new projects. As more apps use Avalanche, AVAX demand rises, reinforcing its status among the best performing cryptos to buy today. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Building Utility Beyond Memes Shiba Inu is proving meme coins can offer real utility. Its Shibarium Layer-2 blockchain lowers transaction costs and boosts scalability, making SHIB more than just a speculative coin. With ongoing token burns, staking, and an expanding ecosystem of DeFi apps and NFTs, Shiba Inu continues to add value. Community support and regular upgrades make SHIB a crypto to watch. Its growth beyond memes, along with lower fees through Shibarium, solidifies SHIB as one of the best performing cryptos to buy today. Shiba Inu’s improving tokenomics and use cases give it long-term growth potential. With faster, cheaper transactions and added utility, SHIB stands among the best performing cryptos to buy today. Wrapping Up– Best Performing Cryptos to Buy Today! Many cryptos aim for growth, but only a few combine strong fundamentals with future potential. Web3Bay leads the pack with its decentralized e-commerce platform and fast-rising presale, standing out as one of the best performing cryptos to buy today.

This decline pushes BTC’s value even further from its January all-time high of over $109,000. Amid the bearish momentum, analysts are observing signs of renewed interest from retail investors—a critical market segment that could shape Bitcoin’s near-term direction. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Price Manipulated? Expert Exposes The Truth Bitcoin Retail Demand Slowly Recovers A new analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost has highlighted a promising shift in Bitcoin’s retail demand metrics. Specifically, the 30-day demand change has climbed back into the neutral zone around 0%, recovering from a highly negative -21% seen late last year. According to the insight shared by Darkfost, this is the first time since 2021 that retail demand has shown such a notable turnaround. Historically, periods of recovering retail demand have been linked to eventual price rebounds. For example, in July 2024, retail demand reached a similar low point before beginning to recover. Although it took roughly three months for Bitcoin’s price to respond positively, the subsequent upward movement demonstrated the impact of growing retail interest. Bitcoin retail Investor demand is brewing “Notably, past instances of recovering retail demand have often coincided with upward price movements in the short-term.” – By @Darkfost_Coc Full post ⤵️https://t.co/lvhC8JnvBD pic.twitter.com/YdBr6F78W7 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 24, 2025 Darkfost noted that if this trend holds true this time, the current recovery in retail demand could lay the groundwork for future price gains—though such changes may take time to materialize. Network Activity and Investor Sentiment on the Decline Despite the positive signs from retail demand, overall network activity and investor sentiment tell a more cautious story. Darkfost in a separate post revealed a downward trend in the number of active Bitcoin wallets and transactions used for deposits and withdrawals. The accumulation of Bitcoin by spot ETFs has also slowed, with minor outflows suggesting a more hesitant investor base. Additionally, the number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) is decreasing at a pace reminiscent of previous market corrections. Although this alone does not confirm a market cycle peak, it does raise questions about the underlying strength of current market participants. Investor sentiment has also been weighed down by broader macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Darkfost highlighted that while initial bullish sentiment was buoyed by optimism surrounding Trump’s election and the possibility of favorable US crypto regulations, no substantial policy changes or legislative actions have yet emerged.

In fact, the artificial intelligence industry has entered a state of self-regulation, which is a sharp contrast with the short leash the Biden administration afforded the industry. The Trump administration appears to be trying a similar hands-off approach with the crypto industry. In the last week alone, the SEC dropped investigations into major players, Robinhood and Coinbase. A breath of fresh air from regulation by enforcement The U.S. SEC under the leadership of Gary Gensler regulated the crypto sector by enforcement actions, characterized by unpredictable crackdowns on the crypto projects that popped up on its radar. The return of the Trump administration in January 2025 signaled a paradigm shift, and the resolution of two high-profile cases against Robinhood Crypto and Coinbase are perfect exhibits of the new era for crypto. On February 21, 2025, the SEC’s Enforcement Division sent a letter to Robinhood Crypto (RHC) saying it concluded its investigation and will not move forward with any enforcement actions. This is a sequel to the May 2024 Wells Notice the watchdog issued to the crypto RHC, which many readily point out as an example of the agency’s overreach. Robinhood’s Chief Legal Officer, Dan Gallagher, stated that the investigation should have never been opened, arguing that the company has always operated within federal securities laws. “As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed. We appreciate the formal closing of this investigation, and we are happy to see a return to the rule of law and commitment to fairness at the SEC,” Gallagher explained. Recent financial disclosures from Robinhood show that crypto trading has been a major driver of revenue. The company reported transaction-based revenue of approximately $672 million in the fourth quarter, with about $336 million coming from crypto transactions. This staggering 700% increase in crypto revenue alongside a 38% increase in Robinhood shares since the start of the year is one of many indicators of investors’ enthusiasm, primarily stoked by a perceived accommodating regulatory environment. Similarly, Coinbase, another industry heavyweight, experienced a reprieve from its marathon legal bout with the SEC. The SEC had previously approved Coinbase’s business model in 2021, however, in 2023, it accused the exchange of operating as an unregistered securities exchange. After almost two years in court, it announced that it was dropping its lawsuit against Coinbase on February 21, 2025, pending final approval from the commissioner. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase said that the SEC is finally righting a major wrong and that the case should have never been filed, maintaining that the company has always operated within legal boundaries. He suggested that the crackdown was politically motivated, saying what we are all thinking: “What changed over those two years was the political leadership at the SEC.” Of course, the resolutions of the cases against Robinhood and Coinbase relieve immediate legal concerns, they are also tangible evidence of the broader narrative change in crypto industry regulation. By choosing not to pursue the case further, the SEC under the Trump administration sent a message: innovation should not be killed by vague or overly aggressive regulatory practices. The market responded positively to the news of these developments, with Coinbase’s shares rising by 4.9% in premarket trading, and Robinhood seeing close to a 3.3% rise. The AI industry is a blueprint for self-regulation In July 2023, the White House coordinated an initiative with OpenAI, Google, and Meta, to institute standards that include watermarking AI-generated content to enhance transparency and safety in AI applications and improvements like investment in research on AI safety. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) introduced the global AI management standard, ISO/IEC 42001 In October 2024. Speaking about the standard developed in a process involving multiple stakeholders, Susan Taylor-Martin, Chief Executive of the British Standards Institution (BSI), said that “although the regulatory landscape is evolving” this standard provides a reliable framework for managing AI’s risks and opportunities, enabling innovation while maintaining governance. Without the guardrails limiting their European counterparts, American AI firms have become far and away the most valuable within the space—the brief DeepSeek disruption notwithstanding. Similarly, the crypto industry could benefit from self-regulation, by creating Self-Regulatory Organizations (SRO), which create and enforce guidelines for members. Self-regulation isn’t a new concept in crypto; a few countries have crypto SROs like Japan and South Korea. Japan has the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association and Korea has South Korea’s Digital Asset Exchange Alliance. The Winklevoss Twins, founders of Gemini Exchange even proposed a Virtual Commodity Association in 2019. With the Trump administration’s more relaxed stance, the crypto industry can follow the AI industry’s blueprint and develop internal compliance measures and best practices that prioritize transparency, security, and consumer protection. Just as the AI industry collaborated with the government to shape policies that balance innovation with public interest, the crypto industry can also work with regulators to develop a logical framework that protects customers and protects digital asset innovation. For now, a regulatory vacuum The ease of regulatory clampdown on crypto organizations seems optimistic, however, it potentially leaves a vacuum in bad actor policing. A hands-off approach removes the shackles around companies’ ankles, a sudden and unchecked relaxing of regulatory oversight could expose investors and customers to risks. Case in point, just a few hours after news broke that the SEC had dropped Coinbase’s case, Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit confirmed that his exchange suffered a $1.4 billion hack. The Bybit incident, the largest heist in crypto history, is an immediate reminder of how self-regulation could go wrong. How many companies can be trusted to ensure adequate security measures across platforms? It’s worth mentioning that the Trump administration still plans to regulate crypto with albeit with sensible guidelines. Part of those efforts is the SEC’s acting chairman, Mark T. Uyeda, commissioning a task force to develop a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets US President, Donald Trump also issued the “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” executive order on January 23, 2025. While we can already see the benefits of a relaxed regulatory environment in surging revenues and stock prices, the long-term viability of this model hinges on how well the industry can self-police and collaborate with the powers that be. Whatever happens, the next few months will be critical. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The primary reason for this bearish outlook is the current market sentiment and the price action XLM has formed on the daily timeframe. Current Price Momentum XLM is currently trading near $0.297 and has experienced a price drop of over 12% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume jumped by 120%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. This jump in trading volume is potentially caused by the shift in market sentiment and XLM’s bearish outlook. XLM Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XLM appears bearish as it has broken through the crucial support level of $0.311, which the asset tested multiple times in recent days. Additionally, it closed a daily candle below this level, partially confirming that the price is poised to continue its decline. Source: Trading View With this breakdown and candle closing, there is a strong possibility that the asset could drop by 35% to reach the $0.189 mark in the coming days. Meanwhile, during the price drop, XLM may find temporary support at the $0.25 mark before reaching $0.189. Despite the breakdown of the crucial support, XLM’s price remains above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, which currently acts as a support level. If the asset breaches the 200 EMA and falls below it, there is a high possibility that XLM’s price will continue declining smoothly to that level in the coming days. $6.75 Million Worth Bets on Short Side With the notable price drop and recent breakdown, sentiment has completely shifted as intraday traders appear to be strongly backing short positions, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from the XLM exchange liquidation map shows that bears, or traders betting on short positions, are currently dominating the asset. Meanwhile, with the recent price drop, traders betting on long positions seem to be exhausted. Source: Coinglass Based on recent data, $0.3321 is a level where traders betting on short positions are over-leveraged, holding $6.75 million worth of short positions. Meanwhile, $0.2821 is another level where traders betting on long positions are over-leveraged, holding $1.10 million worth of long positions. This liquidation data and over-leveraged positions indicate that bears are currently dominating the asset and could push XLM’s price toward the $0.189 level soon.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|XLM|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 00:31:36

The Inflation Protection Act, as it was called, was passed by the House Business and Labor Committee, but voted down by the full House on its second reading on Feb. 22. The bill would have established a special revenue account for the state’s Board of Investments to invest in precious metals and digital assets. It was introduced by Republican representative Curtis Schomer on Feb. 7 without Democratic support. The fund received a nonpartisan rejection The final vote was not along party lines, however, with 16 Republicans opposing it and one Democrat voting yea. The final vote was 41 for and 59 against. The bill was two pages long. It would have allowed transfers from the state’s general fund into the state’s Inflation Protection Act special fund by the legislature with a maximum of $50 million. The bill would have left revenue from the account in the account and given the state legislature control over the money in the account. Digital assets would have to have a market cap of $750 billion to be eligible for investment under the bill. In other words, the bill would authorize investment in Bitcoin, as it is the only qualifying digital asset. The debate over the bill focused on whether or not the fund was a worthy use of taxpayers’ money, with proponents saying it was a way to optimize state funds. Opponents called the bill speculative and risky. “I am not signing on to that stuff [cryptocurrency] and I can’t imagine a majority of your constituents want you to,” Republican Bill Mercer told the assembly. There is another law affecting cryptocurrency currently before the Montana legislature. An Act Revising Cryptocurrency Laws would prohibit the state from participating in testing a central bank digital currency and legalize the payment of taxes in cryptocurrency. It also protects mining and staking and exempts certain tokens from state security laws. Montana passed a law in 2023 to protect crypto mining in the state. The law prohibits discriminatory utility rates for crypto miners and prevents local governments from “exercising powers related to digital asset mining.” It also defines digital assets as personal property and prohibits taxation of cryptocurrency used as a method of payment. Federal digital asset fund may be created The so-called White House crypto czar, David Sacks, has confirmed in a press conference that a national Bitcoin reserve would be considered . Many states have pulled far ahead of the federal government. According to Bitcoinlaws.com, 18 states currently have cryptocurrency reserve fund proposals. Utah is the furthest ahead. Its Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments bill has made it through the House and is up for its second reading in the Senate. Montana joins North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wyoming as states that have voted down cryptocurrency reserves. Montana’s four federal legislators are all strong supporters of crypto.

Over the past month, SHIB price has remained bearish, reflecting the overall downtrend in the market. However, the token failed to sustain a consistent uptrend owing to selling pressure as shown by other technical factors. Nevertheless, some analysts remain optimistic, suggesting that a bullish pattern may be forming. If key support levels hold, SHIB price could see a 400% rally, indicating a potential recovery from oversold conditions. Shiba Inu Price Drops, Analysts Spot Signs of a Possible Reversal In the past month, as per analysis, Shiba Inu price has declined by 29%, similar to the decline in the crypto market. At the time of writing, SHIB price is $0.00001476, with its market capitalization at $8.7 billion. However, there is a bearish outlook for SHIB in the general market recording a 9% decline in the last 24 hours. Recent data shows that transactions of above 1000 SHIB across the Shiba Inu network have reduced by over 80% in the last 12 weeks. This indicates a lack of trust among major investors. On the other hand, analysts have recognized the signs of the formation of an Inverse Head & Shoulders formation. This might suggest that the movement of the meme coin price is going to reverse in the near future. If so, SHIB could go up by 400% and its value could reach $0.000081. However, experts caution that such projections must be interpreted carefully, given the overall uncertainty in the meme coin market. More so, the latest burn activity has fueled optimism among traders anticipating a 300% meme coin rally . A 120.3% increase in the weekly burn rate suggests reduced supply, which could drive demand higher. If momentum sustains, Shiba Inu price may attempt a breakout. Technical Indicators Suggest Bearish Momentum Shiba Inu price drop coincides with an 80% decline in large whale transactions over the past 12 weeks. This sharp decrease in whale participation is a sign of declining confidence in Shiba Inu, which could further contribute to short-term market instability. As the crypto market faces broader bearish trends, SHIB’s ability to maintain its levels at critical support levels is crucial for its recovery. From a technical perspective, the Bollinger Bands have widened, signaling increased volatility in SHIB price action. The price is currently below the middle band, which typically suggests a bearish market momentum. Additionally, the MACD indicator remains in negative territory, with the MACD line positioned below the signal line, reinforcing the downward trend. The histogram also shows a continued decline in bullish momentum. These indicators point to the continued pressure on SHIB price, although the lower Bollinger Band could support buying recovery. Source: TradingView Meme Coin Must Defend $0.000011 Support The price of Shiba Inu faces a critical test as it approaches essential support levels. The primary support level at $0.000011 has become a key threshold for SHIB’s short-term future. A break below this support could lead to a further decline in the meme coin price. Conversely, if SHIB can hold above this support level, there may be an opportunity for the bulls to re-enter, and a reversal could be possible. With the broader market facing bearish pressure, SHIB’s ability to stabilize and defend key levels will determine whether the top meme coin can rebound or face further losses.

Can Cardano Soar to $3 as Spot ETF Speculation Builds?,https://thecoinrise.com/crypto-traders-are-flocking-to-web3bays-4200-growth-potential-can-cardano-soar-to-3-as-spot-etf-speculation-builds/,"As the cryptocurrency sector evolves swiftly, investors are spotlighting two key opportunities: Cardano (ADA) and Web3Bay (3BAY) . The potential approval of a Cardano spot ETF may drive ADA’s price to $3, stirring considerable enthusiasm. Simultaneously, an innovative blockchain initiative, Web3Bay, is capturing attention with its novel decentralized commerce approach and a prospective 4200% ROI for early backers. While Cardano continues to draw long-term investors with its consistent growth, Web3Bay is making strides in the dynamic e-commerce domain by cutting out excessive fees and intermediaries. Having already raised over $1.50 million and sold 370 million tokens, this blockchain-enabled marketplace is quickly becoming a hot topic in the 2025 crypto investment landscape. This discussion explores the possible surge in Cardano’s value due to ETF speculation and contrasts it with Web3Bay’s disruptive market entry, positioning Web3Bay as potentially the best current investment opportunity. Cardano Price Prediction: Will ADA Hit $3? Cardano remains a blockchain with substantial foundational strength, celebrated for its low-energy proof-of-stake mechanism and solid smart contract framework. Forecasts indicate that ADA’s price could reach $3 with a regulatory green light for a spot ETF, potentially heightening institutional interest. Cardano is favored by both individual and large-scale investors due to its clear strategic direction, scalability, and increasing adoption in decentralized finance. With robust community support and ongoing improvements, ADA is a sound option for those seeking dependable, long-term appreciation. Yet, while steady gains are anticipated for ADA, early backers are increasingly turning their attention to altcoins with utility that promise greater returns, particularly in burgeoning sectors like Web3 commerce. Web3Bay: Unlocking a 4200% ROI in Decentralized E-Commerce While the buzz around Cardano’s ETF fuels market excitement, Web3Bay is emerging as a leading presale in crypto by addressing the trillion-dollar e-commerce industry. Unlike centralized entities such as Amazon and eBay, Web3Bay facilitates direct, zero-fee transactions between buyers and sellers via blockchain. The momentum for Web3Bay’s presale is strong, with over $1.50 million raised and 375 million tokens distributed. With an initial price of $0.1959 and early purchase price of $0.00456, early participants could witness an impressive 4200% profit. Why Web3Bay Surpasses Other Presales Decentralized Market – Eliminates intermediaries, reduces transaction costs, and gives users complete purchase control. Versatile Payment Options – Supports both digital currencies and traditional money (including PayPal) for frictionless deals. Secure Smart Contract Escrow – Guarantees safe, scam-free transactions. Staking Perks – Token holders gain passive income and bolster the ecosystem. DAO Leadership – Investors dictate the platform’s future. Robust Presale Interest – With $1.50M+ raised, investor confidence is high ahead of its trading debut. Unlike speculative tokens, Web3Bay addresses actual market needs, merging blockchain with decentralized commerce in a way that could redefine online shopping. Cardano’s Stability vs. Web3Bay’s Unmatched ROI Potential Investors now have a pivotal choice: stick with a reliable, established blockchain like Cardano or gamble on the immense upside potential of Web3Bay in a fast-expanding market. Although Cardano’s ETF might push its price to $3, Web3Bay offers early access to a decentralized marketplace poised to revolutionize e-commerce. With blockchain integration accelerating and practical utility becoming crucial for cryptocurrency success, Web3Bay positions itself as one of 2025’s most compelling investment opportunities. With the crypto presale closing soon, now could be the ideal moment to acquire 3BAY tokens before anticipated price increases post-launch.

Van de Poppe tells his 776,000 followers on the social media platform X that the layer-1 protocol Near ( NEAR ) appears to be carving a cycle bottom. The analyst says that NEAR is likely in the final stages of its accumulation phase before kicking off a bull run. “This is a typical chart of a standard Altcoin bull run. At first, it runs up, then fully corrects before the real run occurs. Those runs start from the double-bottom retest –> that’s happening right now. Good accumulation area.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X A double-bottom pattern is a bullish reversal structure, indicating that an asset is cementing a price floor before launching an upside burst. At time of writing, NEAR is trading for $3.45. Looking at the payments altcoin XRP , the trader says the coin has already printed massive gains this cycle and that any upside potential will likely be limited. But he also says that it is within the realm of possibility for XRP to do the unexpected and spark another big rally. “In four weeks, the price rallied by 500% on a $30 billion asset. My best guess is that most of the upside is captured already and only the laggards are buying in at these levels. My second best guess is that we’ll consolidate before we continue to go up, which probably takes time. In that sense, you still want to be buying the dip if you’re interested in this one. The question is, where? Anywhere in the lower areas of the range, so let’s say $1.50-2.25. That’s a good region.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.57. Turning to the smart contract platform Sui ( SUI ), Van de Poppe says he remains long-term bullish on the altcoin but warns that a drop to $1.50 is possible. He also believes that a 9x rally is in the cards for SUI if it manages to pull off a real bull cycle. “This has been one of the trending ones and I think it will continue to show strength… I think that, ultimately, the area at $2.50 is the key zone… Invalidation? Sub $1.50… If it loses the trend sub $1.50 –> your potential loss is 40-50%. If it really turns into a bull cycle, then your upside might be 300-800%.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, SUI is trading for $3.41. The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the fellow layer-1 altcoin Sonic ( S ). According to Van de Poppe, Sonic is in the midst of a solid uptrend, and he believes it will go beyond $1. “The new, shiny, diamond in the markets. Strong upward trend and a lot of momentum on social media. Likely not going to stop in the coming period. From a trader’s perspective, I think that you’d be willing to buy the dips… S o then the region between $0.675-0.775 is the area to go for… Targets? New highs. Uptrend is clear.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, S is worth $0.86.

As markets closed, Bitcoin slipped under $91,015 , marking a 2% drop over the past 24 hours and the lowest price this month. On the other hand, Ether (ETH) saw a steeper decline, falling 5.9% during the same period. This follows a major hack on the ByBit platform last Friday, which resulted in the theft of over 446,000 tokens worth more than $1.4 billion. Still, ByBit has assured users that it has restored a 1:1 backing for customer assets and closed the so-called “ether gap.” The attack has been linked to the Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-backed hacker collective known for targeting cryptocurrency platforms. After last week’s sharp declines, an attempted rebound in major US stock indices faltered Monday afternoon, with the Nasdaq closing 1.2% lower and the S&P 500 slipping 0.5%. Solana leads crypto declines as inflation and token unlocks weigh Among major cryptocurrencies, Solana (SOL) was the worst performer, plunging nearly 10% in the past 24 hours and a staggering 41% over the past month. Beyond its association with the waning meme coin frenzy, SOL is also under pressure from upcoming token unlocks in March and a 30% rise in SOL inflation following the implementation of SIMD-96, which modified the network’s fee structure. Trading at $151 at press time, SOL has now erased all its post-election gains. “Trying to communicate to folks who may be feeling complacency/denial that $95,000 is still not a bad exit price relative to where I think we could trade in 6-12 months,” Quinn Thompson, founder of Lekker Capital, a crypto hedge fund that specializes in using macroeconomic data for its trades, posted on social media. Thompson projected an 80% probability that Bitcoin will not reach new highs within the next three months and a 51% chance that it will remain below record levels for the next year. Economic risks mount as the job market weakens Meanwhile, Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, noted growing risks to the labor market in the US economy. He cited lagging real incomes, a weakening housing market, and lower spending levels by state and local governments. These concerns are weighed against a market median GDP forecast of about 2.5%, which has not improved. Dutta noted that if 2023 was about being surprised to the upside, there is more risk in 2025 of being surprised to the downside. He continued: A passive tightening of monetary policy is the dominant risk, and that has important implications for financial market investors. Neil Dutta Dutta said he would anticipate a decline in longer-term interest rates and a selloff in equity prices as risk appetite wanes. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

House Bill 1202, introduced by Representative Logan Manhart, proposed creating a Bitcoin reserve for South Dakota. The bill aimed to allow the state to invest up to 10% of its total portfolio in Bitcoin. However, the lawmakers referred the bill, which means that its progress was halted for this legislative session. State Bitcoin Reserve Plan Fails as South Dakota Lawmakers Defer South Dakota House Commerce and Energy Committee refused to move HB 1202 to the next level. The proposed bill sought to facilitate the state to buy Bitcoins using public funds; the state would actually become one of the pioneers in holding a Bitcoin reserve. But the lawmakers made it difficult for the process by voting to take the bill to the next stage after 40 days which brought an end to it for the year. The bill was introduced by Representative Logan Manhart and he plans to propose the bill during the next year 2026. The deferral reflects concerns about regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and the risks associated with using public funds for crypto investments. Despite these concerns, Bitcoin reserve proposals continue to emerge in other states, indicating ongoing interest in integrating digital assets into public investment strategies. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Strategy continues to gain traction with institutional adoption as Michael Saylor’s firm expands its holdings. MicroStrategy, now rebranded as Strategy, has nearly 500,000 BTC after its latest $2 billion purchase. Concerns Over Volatility and Regulation The primary concerns cited for deferring HB 1202 were Bitcoin’s price volatility and the lack of clear federal regulations. Opponents of the bill argued that investing in a highly fluctuating asset could expose public funds to financial risk. The unpredictability of Bitcoin prices made some lawmakers hesitant to approve the allocation of taxpayer money toward a digital asset. Moreover, crypto regulation uncertainty at both the state and federal levels also played a role in the bill’s stagnation. With the legal landscape surrounding Bitcoin reserves still evolving, lawmakers expressed caution about moving forward without clearer guidelines. The deferral follows similar rejections in other states, such as North Dakota and Montana, where Bitcoin reserve proposals also failed to gain approval. Although HB 1202 failed to pass, discussions around state-held Bitcoin reserves are expected to continue. Some of the states that have started making such motions for new laws include Florida, Missouri, and Arizona. Currently at press time, Bitcoin price is at $91,824, the asset depreciated by 4% in the last 24 hours. The total market cap is $1.82 trillion with a daily trade volume being $48.24 billion and having an increase rate of 180%.

Analyst Weighs In,https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/is-toncoin-building-a-foundation-for-a-long-term-comeback-analyst-weighs-in/,"Toncoin (TON) continues to face a challenging market environment, struggling to reverse its recent downward trajectory. Trading below the $4 mark, the asset’s price performance over the past weeks has remained largely in the red. Amid these conditions, CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost has shed light on some underlying trends, highlighting that long-term investors are still seeing positive returns despite the overall bearish climate. Related Reading: Key Metrics Indicate Toncoin Accumulation Continues Despite Price Struggle Evaluating TON’s Long-Term Viability and Market Stability According to Darkfost in the post uploaded on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, long-term holders—those who have maintained their positions for over a year—are currently enjoying a 69% profit, even as short-term investors face losses. This dynamic raises questions about TON’s potential as a long-term investment, prompting a closer look at the project’s ecosystem and liquidity. A key metric in this regard is the total value locked (TVL) on the network. Despite market-wide downturns affecting numerous altcoins, data shared by Darkfost revealed that TON’s TVL remains steady at $300 million, maintaining a level of stability since the start of 2024. This resilience in liquidity and locked value suggests a level of sustained confidence in the platform’s fundamentals. Is $TON made for the long term ?

Darkfost notes that examining the masterchain and workchain can provide valuable insights into the project’s adoption. The TON workchain, a flexible blockchain layer designed for executing smart contracts and handling user transactions, has demonstrated consistent activity throughout the year. Related Reading: Analyst Says Toncoin (TON) May Be Primed for Major Recovery—Here’s Why Notably, the “Hamster Kombat” phenomenon earlier in 2024 caused a noticeable uptick in network usage, highlighting the workchain’s capacity to support various applications and drive engagement. Meanwhile, the masterchain serves as the network’s backbone. By storing global configuration data, validator states, and hashes from all workchains, the masterchain ensures that the entire ecosystem runs smoothly. According to Darkfost, the ongoing growth of the masterchain highlights TON’s structural stability and increasing adoption. These factors collectively point to an ecosystem that has not only maintained but also expanded its operational scope amid broader market challenges. The analyst wrote: In conclusion, the TON ecosystem has developed impressively throughout 2024, maintaining robust activity and a solid TVL despite a general decline in crypto market interest.

As of today, February 25, 2025, ADA has dropped 13% and is currently trading near $0.67, while its trading volume has surged by 110%. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA’s recent price drop has brought it to a crucial support level at the $0.65 mark. Historically, this level has acted as a strong price reversal zone. Additionally, ADA’s daily chart is flashing a bullish signal, as technical indicators show a bullish divergence over the same period. Source: Trading View Besides this bullish divergence, ADA’s daily chart appears to be forming a double-bottom price action pattern on the daily timeframe. This bullish outlook suggests that ADA’s price could soon recover and experience notable upside momentum. Based on recent price action and historical trends, if ADA holds above the $0.65 level, there is a strong possibility that the asset could soar by 20%, reaching the $0.84 level in the near future. Mixed-Sentiment By On-Chain Metrics Following a notable price drop and as ADA reaches a crucial support level, whales and long-term holders have been accumulating ADA tokens, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $22 million worth of ADA tokens. Source: Coinglass This substantial outflow from exchanges suggests potential accumulation, which could create buying pressure and drive further upside momentum, a trend that the price has already begun to experience gradually. Despite the bullish market sentiment among whales and long-term holders, traders appear to be betting on the short side, expecting the price to continue declining in the coming days. At press time, the major liquidation areas are at $0.663 on the lower side and $0.708 on the upper side, with traders being over-leveraged at these levels. Source: Coinglass Additionally, traders have held $3.25 million worth of long positions and $8.41 million worth of short positions at these levels.

With its decentralized lending platform, strong presale momentum, and features like an overcollateralized stablecoin, Mutuum is attracting widespread interest. As the project moves through its presale phases, many investors are seeing it as a compelling addition to their portfolios. Here’s why MUTM is gaining traction and why it could be worth considering for long-term growth. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum among investors who recognize its strong fundamentals and growth potential. Currently in its presale phase, the token is priced at just $0.015. The project has already raised $1,200,000, successfully selling over 120 million tokens out of the 1.82 billion allocated for presale. By purchasing MUTM now, investors have the opportunity to secure tokens at the lowest possible price before the listing, where experts predict significant price appreciation. Many analysts estimate that MUTM will see at least 15x growth after launch, making early entry a strategic move. What is Mutuum Finance? Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending protocol that allows users to supply and borrow crypto assets without intermediaries. The platform enables lenders to earn passive income by providing liquidity, while borrowers can access funds by using their assets as collateral. Beyond its lending protocol, the team is also developing an overcollateralized stablecoin. This stablecoin will be minted against collateral supplied within Mutuum’s ecosystem, ensuring its value remains stable and fully backed. Unlike traditional stablecoins, which rely on centralized reserves, Mutuum’s approach guarantees that each issued token is secured by on-chain assets, maintaining transparency and decentralization. MUTM’s potential price increase is largely driven by its utilities. The lending and borrowing features provide real use cases that will attract more users to the platform. This growing demand is expected to play a key role in pushing the token’s value higher. Additionally, major exchange listings are highly anticipated, further increasing accessibility and liquidity. The team has also announced plans to launch a beta version of the platform before the token’s official release. This early access will allow investors and users to test key features, boosting interest and driving demand for MUTM tokens. With these factors in place, a 15x increase shortly after launch appears realistic. For example, if an investor purchases 150,000 MUTM tokens at the current price of $0.015, the total cost would be $2,250. When the token experiences 15x growth, as experts predict, the value of that investment would reach up to $35,000, demonstrating the potential returns for early investors. Mutuum Finance has implemented a buy-and-distribute mechanism designed to create continuous buy pressure and support long-term token growth. A portion of the platform’s revenue, generated from lending and borrowing activities, is allocated to repurchasing MUTM tokens from the open market. These repurchased tokens are distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards, encouraging long-term participation and increasing demand for MUTM over time. As platform activity grows, more revenue is used to buy back MUTM, creating continuous buy pressure. This sustained demand supports price stability and potential appreciation, making MUTM a strong choice for both short-term and long-term investors. Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway, offering investors a chance to win a share of the prize. A total of 10 winners will be selected, making it an exciting opportunity for early supporters of the project. Participation rules and entry details can be found on the official Mutuum Finance website. Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining attention for its strong presale performance, real utility, and growth potential. With lending, borrowing, and a buy-and-distribute mechanism driving demand, experts anticipate significant price appreciation. As the presale progresses and the platform’s beta launch approaches, early investors have a chance to secure MUTM before its expected surge.

The SEC’s task force started work just one month earlier, on January 21, under Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda, and Commissioner Hester Peirce leads it. Michael’s conversation with the SEC’s task force specifically covered how crypto assets need clear and easy-to-understand categories. The meeting aimed to create straightforward rules so issuers, traders, and everyday people know exactly what they can and can’t do with digital assets. The task force wants regulations that help people innovate, rather than slow everything down. SEC hard at work on crypto regulations The task force shared a draft framework at the meeting, called “Taxonomy,” to put different digital assets into categories. According to details from the discussion, this would include six basic asset types: digital commodities, digital securities, digital currencies, digital tokens, digital NFTs, and digital asset-backed tokens (ABTs). Each type has a very specific meaning. Digital commodities like Bitcoin don’t have an issuer behind them, meaning no company directly controls them. Digital securities, by contrast, have clear issuers backing them up, like equity, debt, or derivative contracts. Digital currencies are issued and directly backed by fiat currency like the US dollar. Digital tokens are assets with an issuer designed to offer utility online. NFTs (non-fungible tokens) are unique digital assets issued by creators, artists, or brands. Finally, digital ABTs are assets issued but backed by physical items such as gold, oil, or agricultural products. According to Michael’s conversation with the SEC, the task force also discussed setting rights and responsibilities clearly for issuers, crypto exchanges, and asset owners. The goal behind creating clear rules for responsibilities is to let everybody in the crypto market trade, own, or issue digital assets safely, without confusion. For issuers, the SEC proposed clear rights to issue digital assets but stressed that companies must disclose all relevant facts and behave ethically. Exchanges also got a very specific outline: they have the right to custody digital assets, trade them, and move them between clients or other exchanges. At the same time, exchanges must openly publish asset disclosures, keep client money safe, and always avoid conflicts of interest. Regular owners also got straightforward rights, including self-custody of assets, the ability to trade freely, and responsibility for following local laws wherever they live. Michael confirmed that a major theme at the meeting was that nobody has a right to cheat, lie, or steal, and everyone will face both civil and criminal consequences if they do. The SEC task force also told Michael they want practical compliance rules that don’t add unnecessary bureaucracy or extra costs. A key idea discussed was creating standardized disclosures. Under this plan, every single digital asset would have a simple, standardized data set clearly stating its details, risks, and purpose. To make life easier, exchanges could gather and publish this data as a free industry service. Cost controls were another important topic covered in Michael’s meeting. The SEC’s plan would set hard limits on compliance costs. Issuers would spend no more than 1% of their assets under management (AUM) to issue a new crypto asset. Keeping a crypto asset listed each year would cost companies less than 0.1% annually. The task force also wants to get regulators out of the direct path of asset issuance, letting exchanges handle most routine compliance tasks directly. Michael’s discussion with the SEC also covered the idea of a faster and cheaper issuance process to bring more businesses into the crypto and digital asset industry. Instead of taking months or years, new digital assets could be issued in hours or days. Costs for launching new digital assets, currently running anywhere from $10 million up to $100 million, would drastically drop to just $10,000 to $100,000 under the proposed system. The SEC told Michael that cutting these costs and simplifying rules could open up American capital markets to far more businesses. Right now, only about 4,000 companies in America can access traditional public capital markets. If new digital asset rules take effect, about 40 million businesses—from mom-and-pop shops to mid-size enterprises, small artists, celebrities, or entrepreneurs—could directly raise capital through tokenized digital assets. Michael was also briefed that the new rules could give regular investors access to thousands of new digital assets backed by tangible commodities like real estate, art, collectibles, sports teams, intellectual property, brands, and more. They would also have access to digital financial instruments, like tokenized equity, bonds, debt instruments, derivatives, and currencies. The SEC wants regular investors to have plenty of choices in digital assets tied directly to products and services they actually care about. “A strategic digital asset policy can strengthen the US dollar, neutralize the national debt, and position America as the global leader in the 21st-century digital economy,” said Michael. The SEC explained that creating clear digital asset rules could expand digital assets beyond Bitcoin, pushing their global market from today’s roughly $1 trillion up to about $590 trillion in the future, with the US dominating this sector.

Amidst this cautious sentiment, a new price target of $86,000 has emerged, reflecting the current market dynamics and investor behavior. Recent Market Performance Bitcoin has experienced a notable decline from its peak of $108,309 on December 17, 2024, trading between $93,000 and $100,000 in recent sessions. This downward movement has raised concerns about the sustainability of the previous bullish trend and the potential for further corrections. Technical Indicators Signal Potential Downside Technical analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s recent price action has breached critical support levels, indicating a possible continuation of the downward trend. The next significant support is identified at $91,500. A decisive break below this level could open the path toward the $86,000 target, representing a substantial retracement from recent highs. On the other hand, if Bitcoin can sustain itself above the $91,500 threshold, it may have a chance to recover and attempt a retest of the $100,000 resistance zone. However, for bullish momentum to return, it would need to establish strong support above this level. On-Chain Analysis Reflects Reduced Activity On-chain metrics reveal a decline in network activity, with reduced transaction volumes and active addresses. This decrease suggests waning user engagement and may contribute to the selling pressure observed in the market. Such trends often precede further price declines as demand diminishes. Additionally, Bitcoin reserves on exchanges have slightly increased, indicating that some investors may be preparing to sell rather than hold. When exchange inflows rise, it often signals a shift toward short-term profit-taking or risk-off sentiment among traders. Macroeconomic Factors Influence Investor Sentiment Broader economic conditions, including concerns over inflation and monetary policy adjustments, have contributed to increased uncertainty in financial markets. These factors have led investors to reassess their risk exposure, impacting assets like Bitcoin that are often viewed as speculative investments. Geopolitical tensions and regulatory uncertainties have also weighed on investor confidence. Recent developments in China and the United States regarding cryptocurrency regulations have caused market participants to exercise caution, limiting the influx of new capital into the market. Historical Context and Future Projections Historically, Bitcoin has experienced cyclical patterns of rapid appreciation followed by corrections. The current market behavior appears to align with these historical trends, suggesting that the recent weakness may be a natural part of Bitcoin’s long-term price movements. Many analysts believe that if Bitcoin does drop to $86,000, it could present a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Institutional interest in Bitcoin remains strong, and any significant pullback could encourage accumulation before the next potential leg up in price. Conclusion The current market weakness has raised concerns about Bitcoin’s short-term trajectory, with analysts setting an $86,000 price target as a potential bottom if selling pressure intensifies.

Abandoning Raydium whole hog would be a ""strategic miscalculation"" for the massively popular — and profitable — memecoin factory, core contributor InfraRAY said in a post on X. He cast doubt on the notion that Pump.Fun could replicate its success if it swaps Raydium out for in-house trading infrastructure. Token investors dumped RAY en-masse this weekend after hawkeyed observers noticed Pump.Fun was apparently testing its own AMM, presumably with the intent to replace Raydium's longstanding liquidity pools as its platform of choice. Such a move would shake up the economics of decentralized token trading on Solana. Right now, Raydium, the chain's largest AMM platform, captures trading fees generated by Pump.Fun memecoins that ""graduated"" from the launchpad to its own pools. The arrangement — in place since Pump.Fun's earliest days — has been a financial boon for Raydium But it also leaves Pump.Fun out of the long-term upside of the tokens its users create. That's not to say it's making nothing: Pump.Fun has amassed half a billion dollars on the fees it collects from early-stage token launches, one of crypto's grandest warchest. Raydium is currently generating over $1 million in fees every day from trading across all its liquidity pools, not just those of Pump.fun tokens. That said, over 30% of Raydium's daily trading volume comes from Pump.fun tokens, according to a Dune dashboard, meaning a good share of its fees could dry up if Pump.Fun switches away. ""100%, revenue hit is real,"" InfraRAY said in a message to CoinDesk. But he cautioned that the market's 30% haircut on RAY tokens was ""overblown"" and partially due to SOL's own weakness. He said any pivot to a new AMM could hit myriad issues: inadequate supporting infrastructure, low demand for migrated tokens, a flop on volume at launch. ""I think that’s a real risk they are overlooking but I could be wrong,"" InfraRAY said.

Lightchain AI , now in presale at $0.006, has already raised over $16.4 million, positioning itself as a major player in the AI and blockchain space. With its groundbreaking technology and strong community support, Lightchain AI is poised for rapid growth. Investors are eyeing it as a unique opportunity to capitalize on the future of decentralized AI-powered applications—offering a chance for massive returns in a fraction of the time Solana took. Lightchain AI Could Deliver Solana’s ROI in Just 8 Months As of February 18, 2025, Solana (SOL) is trading at $164.09, reflecting a 6.48% decrease from the previous close. Solana’s remarkable growth in 2021, where it surged from approximately $0.50 to over $250, exemplifies the substantial returns early investors can achieve in the cryptocurrency market. Lightchain AI , currently in its presale phase at $0.006, is drawing attention for its innovative integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Analysts project that Lightchain AI could reach $3 by the end of 2025, indicating a potential 500x return from its presale price. If these projections materialize, early investors in Lightchain AI could experience returns comparable to Solana’s historic performance, potentially achieving significant gains within a short timeframe. However, it’s important to note that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and such projections are speculative. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider the inherent risks before making investment decisions. Why Lightchain AI Is Poised for Explosive Growth Lightchain AI is poised for explosive growth due to its innovative tokenomics and strong security measures. With a total supply of 10,000,000,000 LCAI tokens, 40% is allocated to the presale, ensuring early adoption and liquidity. Additionally, 28.5% is reserved for staking rewards, incentivizing network validators and participants, while 15% is dedicated to liquidity pools to maintain market stability. The remaining tokens are allocated for marketing, partnerships, and team rewards. Lightchain AI also places a premium on security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques like Zero-Knowledge Proofs and homomorphic encryption to ensure privacy and secure AI computations. Lightchain AI combines scalable AI applications, decentralized governance, and strong tokenomics to provide a secure, sustainable, and promising investment opportunity, paving the way for long-term growth and success. Invest Now In Lightchain AI For Major Gain Potential With a unique value proposition, strong community support, and promising technology, Lightchain AI is attracting investors seeking high returns in the cryptocurrency market. Its groundbreaking integration of AI and blockchain technology sets it apart from other projects and could position it as a major player in the industry. Investors who get in during the presale phase have the potential to experience significant gains within a short timeframe, making Lightchain AI an attractive opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the future of decentralized applications and artificial intelligence. Do not miss the chance to invest in Lightchain AI and potentially achieve the same ROI that Solana has delivered, but in just eight months. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,SOL|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-25 03:00:00

Per the Russian state-run news agency TASS , the ministry claimed the consumption on the Siberian power grid was down by “more than 300 MW” as a result of the ban orders. Russian Energy Ministry: Regular Crypto Mining Meetings Planned The ministry made the claims at a “digital currency mining regulation” meeting, with Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev in attendance. Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev. (Source: The Global Energy Association/YouTube/Screenshot) The ministry credited the ban with helping Siberian power providers “avoid imposing restrictions” such as rolling blackouts. The ban came into force on January 1, 2025. It also outlaws mining in several other Russian and Russian-occupied areas until 2031. However, the ban is only effective in the winter months, when electricity demands are typically highest. Some Siberian officials say the bans do not do enough. And some have instead called for “year-long” bans in certain parts of the region . The Ministry of Energy also reiterated its desire to “create a national directory of equipment” used to “mine cryptocurrencies.” This will help it keep track of “legal” miners and assist power companies in the fight against illegal and quasi-legal (or “grey”) mining. The ministry added that it would begin holding “regular” meetings on “mining regulation.” The meetings will see participants discuss a new “regulatory framework” for crypto mining and assess the efficacy of the ban “in a number of Russian regions.” Russia's overheating economy is on the cusp of serious cooling, as huge fiscal stimulus, soaring interest rates, high inflation and Western sanctions take their toll, but after three years of war, Washington may just have thrown Moscow a lifeline https://t.co/9OWMbo1ch8 — Reuters (@Reuters) February 24, 2025 Siberia – Still a BTC Mining Hub? However, recent reports have claimed that crypto mining is growing fast, both in Siberia and beyond. Earlier this month, the Siberian power firm Irkutskenergosbyt claimed that “household electricity consumption” in the first month of this year grew by 1% compared to January 2024 figures. The firm said that the fact that January was unseasonably warm in Irkutsk meant that the rise was even more noteworthy. Also this month, Russian data compilers have claimed that the nation’s Bitcoin mining sector grew by 7% in 2024 . Russia's power grid took a $14M hit from illegal #CryptoMining in 2024. Authorities crack down on unauthorized operations, imposing bans & stricter regulations. #Blockchain #Russia https://t.co/DDxLOdJIVE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 18, 2025 Still Bitcoin-keen: Russian Miners Meanwhile, the Russian media outlet Comnews reported that most Russian industrial crypto mining “enterprises” (10%) are “still active” in the Irkutsk region. The ban covers only part of Irkutsk, although the remainder of the Oblast says that it is at “full capacity” for crypto mining. The same media outlet quoted MTS experts as stating that Bitcoin (BTC) remains Russian miners’ favorite coin. BTC, they said, “accounts for 90% of” industrial capacity. Other industrial miners focus their efforts on Litecoin (LTC) , Kaspa (KAS) , Ethereum (ETH) , and Monero (XMR) . The Kaspa (KAS) market cap over the past 12 months. (Source: CoinGecko) Experts Divided on ‘Ban Success’ Claims Valery Petrov, a member of the expert council of the Russian Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (RACIB), claimed that Moscow’s move to “legalize” crypto has helped the sector. But Petrov also claimed that new “differentiated” tariffs for crypto mining have also “significantly limited business growth.” He explained: “Electricity consumption problems need to be solved by increasing the efficiency of managing power flows and bringing new generators online. Negatively affecting business growth will decrease government revenues from tax payments.” Russia will hold talks with the US at the end of this week to address “irritants” in bilateral relations, Tass reported, citing Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov https://t.co/gJi31oC8a1 — Bloomberg (@business) February 23, 2025 One of Russia’s biggest industrial crypto players cast doubt on the 7% growth figures, however. Oleg Ogienko, the Deputy General Director for Communications at BitRiver, noted that official power grid association figures allocate 3.6 GW worth of nationwide power consumption for “data centers.” Ogienko said that he thought crypto miners accounted for 2.7 GW of that figure.

Martinez warned that losing this support could significantly derail any potential altcoin rally. Ethereum Must Defend Key Price Level Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset by market cap, continues to trade in the mid-$2,000 range. At the time of writing, ETH is priced just below $2,700, offering bulls a glimmer of optimism for a potential breakout above the $3,000 resistance level. Related Reading: Ethereum Short Positions Surge 500% In 3 Months – What’s Behind The Bearish Sentiment? However, in his latest analysis, Martinez emphasized the $2,600 level as a critical price point for ETH. He added that if the digital asset falls below this level, then “altseason will be canceled.” The recent Bybit crypto exchange hack sent shockwaves across the cryptocurrency industry as hackers stole digital assets worth more than $1.4 billion. Notably, ETH accounted for the bulk of the stolen funds. Despite this, ETH held up relatively well compared to Bitcoin (BTC), according to fellow crypto analyst Daan Crypto Trades. The analyst pointed out that ETH’s ability to remain at essentially the same price level after such a massive hack is “interesting.” They added: To see ETH at basically the same level as before a $1B+ hack is pretty interesting. Would not be surprised it there’s indeed some entity buying back some of that lost ETH or people frontrunning such a thing. At some point the ETH likely has to get back somehow, whether it’s recovered or bought back. Otherwise there would not be a 100% cover of funds. Crypto analyst Ted echoed this sentiment in his own analysis of the Bybit hack. In an X post, he highlighted that not only did the hack fail to push ETH to new lows, but the cryptocurrency has already rebounded 35% from its bottom. Meanwhile, crypto trader Merlijn The Trader provided some hope for ETH bulls, sharing a three-week Ethereum chart that suggests ETH is poised to break out of a symmetrical triangle pattern for its “biggest bull run yet.” Altseason In Jeopardy? Seasoned crypto analyst Rekt Capital also weighed in, sharing a daily altcoin market cap chart that shows altcoins failing to close above key resistance levels, highlighted in red circles. They explained: Altcoin Market Cap is transitioning into this triangular market structure (blue). Alts will need to daily close above the blue lower high and then above black resistance to confirm a major trend shift. Related Reading: Ethereum Positioned For A ‘Major Move Upward’ In 2025, Analyst Forecasts That said, there may still be hope for an impending altseason led by Ethereum. A recent report found that ETH reserves on crypto exchanges are at a nine-year low, which could exacerbate supply scarcity and drive up prices. At press time, ETH trades at $2,671, down 5.2% in the past 24 hours.

This promising prospect underscores the growing enthusiasm for the innovative financial solutions offered by RCO Finance. But can RCO Finance truly deliver such extraordinary gains? Keep reading to find out. RCO Finance Gears Up For A Market Revolution RCO Finance is gaining attention among Dogecoin and Shiba Inu investors as a promising low-cap crypto project poised for significant growth by 2025. With its impressive features, the DeFi trading platform is also positioned as an appealing opportunity for those looking to diversify their portfolios and increase gains. Fueling the growing adoption of RCO Finance is its flagship AI-Powered Robo Advisor that offers personalized investment recommendations based on users’ goals and risk tolerance. It analyzes market data and adjusts portfolios in real-time, helping both beginners and experienced traders manage market changes easily. The Robo Advisor excels at spotting early-stage opportunities in the cryptocurrency market, such as the MELANIA token’s rise from under $1 to $14 in less than 24 hours—over a 1,000% increase. Its insights help traders take advantage of similar opportunities, increasing potential returns. And the best part? RCO Finance is entirely non-KYC, offering traders a seamless, privacy-focused experience free of regulatory hurdles. Even more exciting, you can test all these features on its recently launched beta platform , with further enhancements coming soon. By subjecting its smart contracts to thorough audit by the reputable security firm SolidProof, RCO Finance ensures users’ funds are protected. This focus on safety allows investors to engage with the platform without the constant worry of risks, making financial transactions stress-free. Dogecoin Could Still Surge to $3 if it Holds This Key Support Line Over the past week, Dogecoin (DOGE) has experienced a downward trend, with its price dropping by over 10%. This recent performance has led to increased discussions about Dogecoin’s future trajectory. Technical analysis indicates that Dogecoin price is approaching a critical support level, often referred to as the “golden ratio” in Fibonacci retracement terms. Maintaining this support is crucial for potential bullish reversals. Analysts suggest that if Dogecoin holds above this key level, it could pave the way for a surge towards the $3 mark. However, a breach below this support might signal further declines, underscoring the importance of this threshold in guiding Dogecoin’s near-term price action. Shiba Inu Price in Red as First Major Death Cross in 2025 Appears Similarly, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has declined by 24.4% in the past month. Shiba Inu’s latest burn rate has decreased by 61%, suggesting a slowdown in efforts to reduce the circulating supply. This decline in the burn rate contributes to concerns about the Shiba Inu’s long-term stability. Technical analysis indicates the emergence of a ‘death cross’ pattern, where SHIB’s 50-day moving average crosses below its 200-day moving average, often signaling potential for further bearish momentum. This development suggests that SHIB may face continued downward pressure in the near term. RCOF Presale Heats Up – Don’t Miss Out! The recent buzz surrounding RCO Finance’s ongoing token presale has captured significant attention from investors, particularly after attracting Dogecoin and Shiba Inu investors . This heightened interest has led to a surge in participation, with the token presale raising over $13 million. Currently, the RCOF presale is in its fifth stage, offering each token at $0.10 . Analysts predict that upon its official launch, the token price could surge to $0.60, potentially providing early investors with returns exceeding 300%. Moreover, experts are drawing comparisons between RCOF and the explosive rise of Dogecoin in 2021, suggesting that it could even by over 1000x in the first quarter of 2025 alone. This optimism is largely attributed to its unique deflationary features, which are expected to drive up both demand and value. For investors looking to make significant profits, now may be the perfect moment to get involved with RCOF!

On the presumption that their meager investment funds won’t stretch enough to buy a substantial share, an expert has revealed a better, cheaper, and even more promising alternative. According to the expert, WallitIQ (WLTQ,) whose price is currently around a low rate of $0.042 , presents a better opportunity and is poised to rake in millions. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Perfect Crypto Investment Bet For Both Large and Small-Scale Investors WallitIQ (WLTQ) has made headlines times without number as the next AI-powered wallet-based crypto poised for mainstream dominance in the crypto market. While this has largely contributed to its popularity and widespread interest, it is also worth noting that the new presale crypto is also receiving high investment interest due to its ultra-low presale price of just $0.0420 . This makes it a perfect investment choice for large and small-scale investors seeking ways to grow their assets. Although it has employed artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to integrate its network with advanced wallet-based features, the platform also offers an opportunity to earn on the side while managing crypto assets. This is because it houses a staking mechanism and a referral reward system. Users can stake their holdings to earn rewards of up to 180% APR while also becoming eligible for token rewards and NFT giveaways when they refer people to the platform and actively engage with it. Beyond these earning opportunities, WallitIQ (WLTQ) also poses as a major market player as it allows investors to manage physical assets on-chain with a Physical-to-Digital tool while offering a SolidProof-audited network for high-tier security. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is widely recognized for its advanced AI features, which include a round-the-clock multilingual AI chatbot, predictive analytics modeling, automated transaction categorization, and AI-based fraud detection tools. These interesting features have further increased its relevance in the crypto wallet space, with expert predictions that it could potentially dominate the AI crypto space. New and existing investors in this new crypto project are already anticipating the launch of its beta platform . It doesn’t take any expert knowledge to see that WallitIQ (WLTQ) will surely gain massive traction when its beta platform launches due to access to its alluring features. In fact, this new project will soon launch the MVP (minimum viable product) of its Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App. This MVP will give investors a glimpse of its trend-setting wallet infrastructure by providing access to a few of its capabilities, including tracking cryptocurrencies in real-time and simulating its transaction processes with ETH and USDT. Bitcoin Price Struggles Below Weekly Resistance The Bitcoin price has fallen to a weekly range of $93,902.52 – $98,623.62, reflecting an over 10% dip from its price in the past month. This long-standing stagnation is causing BTC to struggle around its weekly resistance of $96,220. Although expert predictions from Arthur Hayes hint that the Bitcoin price will hit as high as $250,000 this year, investors are still cautious, and many are diversifying their holdings with BTC. Furthermore, Coin Eagle recently shared that the negative sentiment towards BTC is growing, which means the Bitcoin price may face a huge correction. AltcoinGordon also highlighted that Japan plans to lift its ban on BTC, cut taxes, and approve Bitcoin ETFs. BTC holders see this as bullish news for the Bitcoin price, with many expecting it to hold strongly amid its negative sentiments. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Bullish Sentiment Is Sky-High—Don’t Wait; Invest Now! Amid Bitcoin’s positive for the year, investing in BTC is a huge opportunity for exponential returns. Still, due to how high the Bitcoin price is, WallitIQ (WLTQ) serves as a cheaper alternative for even higher gains. With its strong positioning in the AI crypto market, an expert has likened its growth potential to BTC’s, implying its capability to rake in millions. According to an expert, it also serves as the perfect low-cap gem for small investors looking to scale their ROI. Invest here now before it’s too late.

Solana (SOL) is showing strong similarities to Ethereum’s past breakout, setting the stage for a potential 80% surge to $340. Binance Coin (BNB) is facing a key test, with technical indicators flashing caution while fundamental strength remains intact. However, the real head-turner is Web3Bay (3BAY) —a presale that’s selling out at record speed as investors secure early positions. With over $1.50 million already raised and 375 million tokens grabbed, Web3Bay is proving to be February’s most talked-about token. Unlike speculative assets, it brings real-world commerce to the blockchain by enabling both crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal. As whale wallets stack up and social interest soars, Web3Bay stands out as one of the most promising plays right now. Can Solana and BNB keep pace, or is Web3Bay about to take over Solana’s Chart Patterns Suggest $340 Upside—Will It Follow Ethereum’s Run? Solana (SOL) is forming a double-bottom pattern, a well-known bullish setup that could lead to a major breakout. Currently hovering near $172, SOL’s price action mirrors Ethereum’s 2024 trajectory, where ETH shot up 80% after completing a similar formation. If Solana follows suit, its valuation could reach $340. Overcoming the $210 resistance level would signal further momentum, with $230 as the next checkpoint. However, failure to breach this barrier might send SOL back to test $160 support. Beyond technical indicators, institutional demand is increasing—Pantera Capital and other major players are watching Solana’s ecosystem closely, boosting its potential. If investor demand continues rising alongside technical strength, Solana could be primed for significant gains. Will it replicate Ethereum’s rally, or will resistance halt its momentum? BNB Approaches Critical Support—Will Buyers Step In or Is a Drop Ahead? Binance Coin (BNB) is at a decisive moment as market forces create uncertainty. Trading near $679, the token is facing resistance from technical indicators while fundamental factors remain strong. A drop below $550 could accelerate selling pressure, whereas reclaiming $600 would set the stage for a reversal. Current indicators show a weakening trend, with the RSI sliding below 40 and trading volume rising amid price declines—suggesting that sellers have the upper hand. Additionally, a potential death cross—when the 50-day moving average dips below the 200-day—raises concerns of a deeper pullback. Despite this, BNB’s ecosystem remains solid. Binance’s quarterly token burns, network enhancements, and continued dominance in crypto trading all support its long-term outlook. Traders should monitor whether $550 holds as a buying opportunity or if a breakdown leads to further downside. Can BNB withstand the pressure and reclaim higher ground? Web3Bay: The Crypto Taking Over February—Will You Get In Before the Next Jump? Web3Bay is taking the crypto world by storm, emerging as the most in-demand presale this month. With over $1.50 million raised and 360 million tokens gone in weeks, interest is soaring. Each presale phase is selling out fast, and prices are climbing at every stage—Web3Bay is the clear FOMO-driven opportunity of February. What makes Web3Bay a must-watch? Unlike hype-driven tokens, it offers real utility, transforming online shopping with a decentralized marketplace that supports both crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal. Cutting out middlemen, it lowers costs and creates a seamless global commerce experience. With increasing adoption, early buyers stand to benefit significantly. Currently priced at just $0.00456, Web3Bay’s projected launch value of $0.1959 offers an extraordinary 6,000% potential return. Large-scale investors are accumulating, and social discussions are driving it into viral status. The best time to enter is now—before the next batch sells out and prices increase. Crypto is watching—will you act before Web3Bay explodes? Final Thoughts: Solana’s price action suggests a breakout could be on the horizon, but overcoming the $210 resistance is key before a full 80% rally can play out. BNB, meanwhile, is at a make-or-break moment—will its support level hold, or is a further drop on the way? Yet, the most exciting story is Web3Bay. Its record-breaking crypto presale , growing whale accumulation, and viral traction indicate a project set for massive gains. History has shown that early investments in strong projects yield the highest returns—Web3Bay’s 6,000% growth potential could make it one of 2025’s biggest crypto success stories. The chance to buy before the next price hike is closing fast. Will you take action now or miss out on what could be the year’s most rewarding investment?

ETH is down over 10% and is struggling to stay above the $2,500 level. Ethereum is facing an increase in selling below the $2,650 zone. The price is trading below $2,750 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,600 and $2,650. Ethereum Price Takes A Hit Ethereum price failed to clear the $2,850 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin . ETH gained pace below the $2,720 and $2,650 support levels to enter a bearish zone. The price declined over 10% and even declined below the $2,550 support zone. A low was formed at $2,458 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,854 swing high to the $2,458 low. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2,600 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,550 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,600 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,650 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,854 swing high to the $2,458 low. A clear move above the $2,650 resistance might send the price toward the $2,750 resistance. An upside break above the $2,750 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,850 resistance zone or even $2,920 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,600 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,550 level. The first major support sits near the $2,450 zone. A clear move below the $2,450 support might push the price toward the $2,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,250 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

40799381,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=681728,1740453852,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40799381.jpeg,JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon says Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E effort ‘needs to be done’,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/jpmorgans-jamie-dimon-says-elon-musks-d-o-g-e-effort-needs-to-be-done/,"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Monday that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) is taking on an overdue challenge, calling the U.S. government wasteful and inefficient as the Trump administration slashes thousands of federal jobs and restructures entire agencies. Speaking to CNBC’s Leslie Picker, Dimon refused to give a direct yes-or-no response when asked if he supported D.O.G.E, but his message was clear: Washington’s bureaucracy is bloated, outdated, and needs fixing. “The government is inefficient, not very competent, and needs a lot of work,” Dimon said . “It’s not just waste and fraud, it’s outcomes.” He added that the administration’s push to rein in spending and scrutinize federal agencies ‘needs to be done.’ Dimon: D.O.G.E will be held accountable if it overreaches D.O.G.E, which operates under Musk’s advisory role in the Trump administration, has been moving fast, entering federal offices and reviewing budgets with the goal of eliminating waste, streamlining operations, and dismantling agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. When asked about the risks of overreach, Dimon said, “If it does something illegal, the courts will stop it.” Despite the criticism D.O.G.E has faced, Dimon emphasized that the fundamental idea behind it is necessary. “Why are we spending the money on these things? Are we getting what we deserve? What should we change?” he said. “It’s not just about the deficit, it’s about building the right policies and procedures and the government we deserve.” He also said he hopes Musk’s efforts succeed, signaling that even from Wall Street’s most powerful players, there is little patience for runaway government inefficiency. Markets react to tariffs, stock valuations, and uncertainty Beyond government spending, Dimon also weighed in on the U.S. stock market, tariffs, and economic uncertainty. JPMorgan analysts have warned that investors may be too relaxed about tariffs, even as the S&P 500 has stayed near 6,000, despite months of turbulence. The CBOE Volatility Index, often called Wall Street’s fear gauge, has risen 11.5% since the start of the year. Mislav Matejka, JPMorgan’s top equity strategist, warned in a note Monday that investors are underestimating the risks of Trump’s escalating trade war. “We do not believe that we are out of the woods on the tariffs front yet,” Matejka wrote. “We see tariff headline newsflow risk as a continuous theme through this year, and beyond.” Stocks soared in Trump’s first year in office, with the S&P 500 gaining nearly 20% in 2017. But by 2018, trade war fears and Federal Reserve rate hikes drove the market down 6%. Analysts are warning of similar risks now. Even billionaire investor Steve Cohen is skeptical. He told investors last week that tariffs, immigration policy, and spending cuts will drive inflation higher. “Tariffs cannot be positive,” Cohen said. Matejka also pointed out that U.S. stock valuations are stretched. Historically, the S&P 500 has traded at a 10% premium to global markets. Right now, that gap is 50%, a major red flag. “The ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks are not what they were in the past,” Matejka warned, referring to Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Tesla. These companies drove 40% of the market’s gains over the last decade, but their influence is fading. “If the group stops driving the market returns, that would be a meaningful impediment for the chances of renewed U.S. outperformance,” he wrote. Despite these concerns, JPMorgan isn’t telling clients to sell yet. “We do not advocate an underweight U.S. position,” Matejka wrote, citing strong growth and earnings compared to the rest of the world. But with trade war risks and tariffs still on the table, it’s a wild card. Federal judge blocks D.O.G.E from accessing student loan data While Musk’s government overhaul gains momentum, D.O.G.E just ran into its first legal roadblock. A federal judge in Maryland issued a restraining order Monday, blocking it from accessing personal data of millions of student loan borrowers. Judge Deborah Boardman ruled that D.O.G.E officials cannot access data held by the Department of Education and Office of Personnel Management, halting their ability to conduct investigations into waste and fraud in student loan programs. The ruling was prompted by a lawsuit from the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), a union representing 1.8 million members. The union accused the Department of Education of illegally sharing student borrower records with D.O.G.E staffers, including income information and Social Security numbers. “When people give their financial and other personal information to the federal government—namely to secure financial aid for their kids to go to college, or to get a student loan—they expect that data to be protected and used for the reasons it was intended,” said AFT president Randi Weingarten. According to court filings, six D.O.G.E affiliates had already begun working inside the Education Department, requesting access to student loan records to investigate potential fraud. But Boardman ruled that there was no justification for why they needed such sweeping access to borrower data. The restraining order is temporary and will last until March 10 at 8 a.m. Boardman said she believes the plaintiffs will likely succeed in their claim that the Education Department violated the Privacy Act by handing over private data. Ben Winters, the director of AI and privacy at the Consumer Federation of America, said the case raises serious concerns about data security. “The data in question includes really sensitive information on a population of people who had to give that information for one clear purpose: borrow money to get an education,” Winters said. “It’s crucial that institutions like governments only allow your data to be used for strictly the purpose you gave it for.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Bankman-Fried, who was convicted on seven different counts of fraud and conspiracy in November 2023, is serving out a 25-year prison sentence . He's currently detained in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn as his lawyers work through an appeal of his conviction. Still, his account on X (formerly Twitter) posted a 10-tweet thread about layoffs, seemingly referencing Elon Musk's push to have federal employees email their work activities from the past week or risk resignations. ""I have a lot of sympathy for [government] employees: I, too, have not checked my email for the past few (hundred) days,"" his thread began . FTT, the token associated with FTX, briefly spiked from roughly $1.55 to $2.07 after his tweets before falling back to around $1.78, according to CoinGecko . Bankman-Fried does not have direct access to sites like X or email, but can send messages through the Corrlinks system, which lets prisoners in the U.S. communicate with others, a person familiar confirmed. It was not immediately clear who might be posting the tweets on Bankman-Fried's behalf. Over the weekend , Musk, who according to court documents is a special government employee, tweeted that federal employees would have to tell the Office of Personnel and Management what they did last week, with a non-response being considered a resignation. While some federal agency heads or other leaders told their employees not to respond, others said their employees should reply. It's another step in Musk's efforts to lay off broad swaths of the federal workforce at the behest of U.S. President Donald Trump. Bankman-Fried's tweets referenced layoffs and detailed circumstances that might cause an employer to fire employees. ""It isn’t the employee’s fault, when that happens. It isn’t their fault if their employer doesn’t really know what to do with them, or doesn’t really have anyone to effectively manage them. It isn’t their fault if internal politics lead their department to lose its way,"" the thread said . After Bankman-Fried's tweets, another X account claiming without evidence to be him linked a contract address, claiming he received a pardon from Trump and now works for DOGE, the government entity that may or may not be led by Elon Musk. The linked token saw some immediate trading volume, according to on-chain data . The new, seemingly fake account has a label saying ""it is a government or multilateral organization account,"" suggesting a government agency account may have been compromised and renamed.

Based on recent analysis , the price action is indicating potential for both short and long-term moves depending on how it behaves around certain price levels. At press time, Pi Coin is down by more than two percent and is trading at $1.57. Now, what happens next is crucial. If Pi manages to hold above the $1.50 mark and breaks the resistance at $1.72, it could see a bullish reversal that might push the price higher. In this case, a potential rally could take the price toward the $1.80-$1.85 range. However, if Pi fails to hold the $1.60 support level, we might see more downside action, potentially confirming a deeper bearish trend. The support and resistance levels at $1.50 and $1.72-$1.75 will be key to determining which direction the price will head in the near future. Risks to Consider While Pi’s rally is impressive, the crypto market is known for its volatility. After the initial excitement, early adopters might sell off their tokens, causing prices to dip. The possibility of a Binance listing adds credibility but also invites more speculative trading, which could lead to price swings. Predictions for Pi’s future range from $2.50 to $10 per coin. What is Pi Network? Pi Network, launched in 2019, was created to make crypto mining accessible to anyone with a smartphone, without the need for expensive equipment or high energy consumption. This approach has helped Pi gain millions of users worldwide. On February 20th, Pi Network took a major step by transitioning to an open mainnet, allowing users to convert their Pi tokens into real value like other cryptocurrencies or even cash. With millions of users already, Pi has created a unique, user-friendly way to mine and participate in crypto.

And I can confirm that being unemployed is a lot less relaxing than it looks,” Sam wrote. Cryptopolitan immediately recognized the subtext. He wasn’t just talking about jobs, he was aligning himself with Donald Trump’s administration and its decision to fire thousands of federal workers. His comments came days after Trump’s White House ramped up its layoffs, targeting government agencies, defense employees, and research departments. 1) I have a lot of sympathy for gov’t employees: I, too, have not checked my email for the past few (hundred) days And I can confirm that being unemployed is a lot less relaxing than it looks — SBF (@SBF_FTX) February 25, 2025 SBF draws outrage online Crypto Twitter exploded within minutes of SBF’s post. Questions flooded in—How did he get access to Twitter? Was he using a smuggled phone? Did someone post on his behalf? “How did this guy get a phone?” one user asked. Another wrote, “You stole billions of dollars from people, nobody cares at all what you have to say.” SBF’s post turned into a defense of terminations, saying that it’s not always about poor performance but bad management, job misalignment, or lack of resources. He even compared it to competitors who hired 30,000 too many employees and let them sit around doing nothing all day. “And we saw it internally, when a manager would get busy or distracted, and half of a department would lose its bearing at the same time,” said Sam. “It isn’t the employee’s fault, when that happens. It isn’t their fault if their employer doesn’t really know what to do with them, or doesn’t really have anyone to effectively manage them. It isn’t their fault if internal politics lead their department to lose its way.” The layoffs Sam referenced in his Twitter post are part of Trump’s ongoing workforce purge, which has already eliminated thousands of federal jobs. The Department of Veterans Affairs dismissed more than 1,000 employees on February 13, including researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, and prosthetics. Government data from March 2024 shows that 220,000 federal employees had less than a year on the job, making them prime targets for mass layoffs. The Department of Defense announced a 5,400-person reduction, with plans to cut up to 8% of its civilian workforce. The Pentagon has frozen hiring, while military personnel remain exempt from the cuts. SBF has his first prison interview Just four days ago, Sam sat down for his first interview from prison, where he accused Biden’s Department of Justice (DOJ) of targeting him and all but hinted at changing his political loyalty to Trump. “Trump had a lot of frustrations with Kaplan,” said SBF, referring to Judge Lewis Kaplan, the man who sentenced him to 25 years in prison. “I certainly did as well.” He blamed the DOJ for allegedly manipulating his case, accusing them of telling the jury that FTX customers lost everything while barring his team from arguing the opposite. “The jury was told something that was just not true, and Kaplan blocked us from correcting it,” Sam said. He also took a jab at Danielle Sassoon, the lead prosecutor in his case. She recently resigned instead of dismissing a corruption case involving NYC Mayor Eric Adams. He suggested that her resignation raised questions about her role in his trial. “My prosecutor has been in the news recently for tussles with Trump’s DOJ,” Sam said. He then claimed that his donations to Republicans were hidden, while his Democratic contributions were widely publicized. “There was a lot of explicit politicization going on,” Sam said. “Threats were made. A Republican congressional candidate was told his wife would be indicted if he didn’t play along with Biden’s DOJ.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

DOGE remains in a holding pattern, waiting for whale accumulation to spark its next surge. ADA jumped 20% on ETF excitement but fell short of holding key resistance, dipping below $0.80. In contrast, Web3Bay has raised over $1.50 million, selling 375 million tokens faster than expected. This difference shows how utility-driven projects are gaining traction over speculative price swings. Unlike DOGE and ADA, Web3Bay is reshaping online shopping by enabling crypto and fiat payments, pushing toward long-term growth. As DOGE and ADA struggle with market uncertainty, Web3Bay’s presale is moving fast, with a potential 6,000% return before its launch at $0.1959. Will buyers lock in gains before the next batch sells out? Cardano (ADA) Fails to Hold Gains: Can It Rebound? ADA climbed 20% last week, rising from $0.663 to $0.83 after Grayscale’s Cardano ETF (GADA) filing. Yet, despite the hype, ADA couldn’t hold above $0.80 and slipped back to $0.77. Technical indicators suggest weakness. ADA trades below the median Bollinger Band, signaling a lack of upward momentum. With ETF excitement already priced in, uncertainty might push ADA lower short term. Still, a sudden market shift could drive ADA back toward resistance. ADA’s next move depends on broader market trends. A recovery could happen quickly if sentiment turns bullish. Otherwise, more downside is possible. Traders should monitor for a breakout or a deeper drop—will ADA regain momentum or keep falling? Dogecoin (DOGE) Nears Breakout: Can It Hit $1? DOGE’s whale activity remains slow, with large holders maintaining balances at 24.35 billion DOGE. This steady holding pattern signals that major investors are waiting for a clear price direction. Currently, DOGE is consolidating between $0.255 and $0.288, forming a symmetrical triangle that often leads to a breakout. Technical indicators show growing bullish momentum. The RSI is climbing, reflecting increasing buying interest, while the PMO suggests accelerating price momentum. If DOGE breaks above resistance, it could climb to $0.50, $0.75, and even $1. However, if buying weakens, DOGE may test lower support, risking a sell-off. As price compression tightens, traders should watch for whale accumulation—a key trigger for DOGE’s next rally. Will DOGE break resistance and hit new highs? Web3Bay’s Presale Hits $1.5 Million in Weeks– Is It Next Market Leader? While most cryptos face volatility, Web3Bay’s presale is thriving, attracting strong interest as other projects struggle. With over $1.50 million raised and 375 million tokens sold in just weeks, its rapid progress shows that investors see it as a standout in a shaky market. Unlike speculative coins, Web3Bay offers real-world value with its decentralized marketplace that supports both crypto and fiat payments, including PayPal. This practical use case is drawing serious buyers, including whales who are accumulating in anticipation of exponential growth. With each presale batch selling out quickly and prices rising at every stage, early participants secure a launch price advantage. At $0.00456 per token, with a projected listing at $0.1959, Web3Bay offers a potential 6,000% return. While many altcoins face uncertain futures, Web3Bay’s fast-growing demand shows that practical blockchain solutions are gaining ground. The Bottom Line! Crypto markets are at a turning point.

The seizure, announced on Monday by the Southern District of New York (SDNY), follows a joint operation with Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in San Diego. In April 2021, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in Uranium Finance’s automated market maker (AMM) on the Binance Smart Chain, stealing around $50 million in various tokens. The incident was one of the largest hacks in DeFi history. Following the hack, the attacker tried to launder the stolen funds using methods such as crypto mixing services and small deposits on centralized exchanges. In an unexpected turn, blockchain researcher Zack XBT even suggested that the hacker may have used some of the stolen funds to purchase rare Magic: The Gathering trading cards.

If you believe you have been a victim of this hack, please contact UraniumVictims@hsi.dhs.gov. — US Attorney SDNY (@SDNYnews) February 24, 2025 The hack ultimately led to the shutdown of Uranium Finance, leaving victims without restitution.

The price is now testing $2.250 and might continue to move down. XRP price started a fresh decline below the $2.50 level. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.4880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down unless there is a close above the $2.50 resistance zone. XRP Price Dips Below Support XRP price failed to continue higher above the $2.75 resistance zone and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . There was a move below the $2.65 and $2.55 support levels. The price even dipped below the $2.50 support to enter a bearish zone. A low was formed at $2.2310 and the price is now attempting to recover toward the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.7450 swing high to the $2.2310 low. The price is now trading below $2.50 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.3250 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.40 level. The next resistance is $2.4880 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.7450 swing high to the $2.2310 low. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.4880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. A clear move above the $2.4880 resistance might send the price toward the $2.550 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.620 resistance or even $2.650 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $2.750. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.3250 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.250 level. The next major support is near the $2.220 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.220 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.120 support. The next major support sits near the $2.050 zone.

How Trading Syndicates, Scams and Geopolitics Buried Hopes for Growth",https://dailyhodl.com/2025/02/24/altseason-canceled-how-trading-syndicates-scams-and-geopolitics-buried-hopes-for-growth/,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post Today, the cryptocurrency market resembles a theatrical performance in which insiders write the script and unsuspecting retail investors play the roles of the extras. While altcoins are falling, meme coins turn into minefields and liquidity remains locked in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), institutions are accumulating Bitcoin but aren’t injecting free Tether and fiat into other assets. Behind all of this lies a new wave of manipulations involving Solana cartels, insider-driven pump-and-dump schemes with worthless tokens, the absurdity of artificial intelligence (AI) agent trading and the epic dump of the TRUMP , MELANIA , LIBRA and BROCCOLI tokens. These patterns highlight the ongoing challenges of market transparency and stability, making it increasingly difficult for investors to navigate the space with confidence. This article contains only a market overview and does not provide any financial recommendations. The current market situation The market has been moving in a pretty expected way. BTC bounced back quickly but couldn’t reach a new all-time high, so it started slowing down again. Normally, if Bitcoin’s dominance dropped, altcoins might have had a chance to rise. But aside from a few short-lived spikes – like ETH trying to break out – there hasn’t been any major shift. As a result, altcoins look so weak that memes about their collapse are spreading across the industry, creating the impression that not only professionals but even beginners have lost faith in an altseason. Most investors’ portfolios are deeply in the red. Adding to the uncertainty is the geopolitical situation. Institutional investors remain on edge, fearing that the world is on the brink of a major conflict. This has driven large players to actively buy gold, which has been setting new ATHs (all-time highs) over the past two weeks. This trend indicates that capital is flowing out of risky assets, including crypto, and into safe-haven assets like precious metals. The liquidity crisis The key issue now is a real liquidity crisis. High-profile scams, mass liquidations and hype-driven sectors – memecoins, AI tokens, etc. – h ave absorbed enormous amounts of capital, concentrating money in the hands of major players. Here’s what we see in the market. Liquidity frozen in ETFs – A significant portion of capital is locked in spot ETFs, limiting its circulation in spot markets. Retail exhaustion and regulatory pullbacks – A series of sharp sell-offs and scams, such as the recent incidents with TRUMP and Argentina’s presidential token LIBRA (which saw over $250 million lost), have severely damaged trust and reduced market activity. Capital outflows to traditional assets – While crypto faces a crisis of confidence, gold is setting new ATHs, and the stock market continues to attract institutional investors. Ongoing liquidity squeeze – Altcoins increasingly fail to meet expectations, and instead of a new growth cycle, we see a systematic transfer of retail investors’ funds into the hands of large players. Memecoins and AI tokens – After explosive growth in 2023, they are now experiencing brutal crashes, with price drops of over 90% becoming the norm. Amid this, market stability is weakening, especially in the DeFi sector, which critically depends on liquidity. Systematic liquidity manipulation in the memecoin market Just as the dust was settling from the LIBRA and KSA scams, the market faced another case of speculative manipulation, this time with the Broccoli token. Named after CZ’s dog, the Broccoli token became yet another example of how crypto market manipulation continues to enrich insiders while leaving retail investors with losses, further eroding trust in the space. Key stages of the scheme Artificial hype creation – Limited liquidity and aggressive marketing fueled a rapid price surge. Peak pump phase – More traders joined in, attracted by rising prices and social media buzz. Sharp collapse – Insiders dumped their holdings, took profits and crashed the token’s price. This case confirms that the market remains highly vulnerable to speculative strategies by large players, who exploit hype cycles to generate short-term price movements. Conclusion The market is now balancing between two opposing forces. On one hand, it has been drained by mass scams, capital lock-ups in ETFs, geopolitical instability and overall industry fatigue from constant failures and fraudulent projects. On the other hand, despite all the negative factors, the crypto market has been through similar phases before. Large players are reallocating capital, and while institutions remain cautious, they aren’t exiting crypto entirely. However, if the current liquidity crisis drags on, we could see another wave of panic, especially if arrests and investigations around Libra escalate.

Bitcoin (BTC) price hit a $90K low in the past 24 hours, whereas Ethereum (ETH) slipped below $2,500. XRP and Solana prices tanked 8%-13% intraday, mimicking the broader market trend. This waning action mainly aligns with Donald Trump’s recent tariff announcement for Canada & Mexico and massive liquidations. Crypto Prices Today: Here’s Why BTC & Altcoins Were Down Notably, Donald Trump recently stated that U.S. import tariffs on Canada and Mexico ‘will go forward’ following a 30-day halt put earlier. As per recent reports, the halt is set to expire as soon as next week. In light of this macroeconomic development, global markets are taking heat amid trade war speculations. Simultaneously, the cryptocurrency market lost nearly 5% amid this development, with the market slipping below the $3 trillion mark during early Asian hours on Tuesday. Further, the market also recorded a whopping $887.85 million liquidated in the past 24 hours. In turn, BTC & leading altcoins reacted concerningly bearish to these broader trends. Bitcoin Hits $90K Low Intraday As Crypto Prices Face Heat Although BTC price rested at $92,152 as of press time, CoinMarketCap’s data highlighted a $90,924.90 bottom for the token intraday. This alarming price drop comes against the backdrop of $271.69 million worth of liquidations for the coin in the past 24 hours. Despite its price dip, BTC’s dominance was up by 0.94% to 61.16%, signaling more heat within the altcoins sector. ETH Loses $2,500 ETH price witnessed an 8% crash in the past 24 hours and closed in at $2,490. The coin hit a bottom and peak of $2,461.52 and $2,735.15 in the past 24 hours. Ethereum’s waning action reflects $192.53 million liquidated in the past 24 hours, per Coinglass data . The second largest crypto by market cap saw its dominance slipping back to 10.1% today. XRP Price Loses 8% XRP price plunged 8.5% over the past day and exchanged hands at $2.26. The Ripple-backed asset hit an intraday low and high of $2.23 and $2.50, respectively. XRP recorded $38.25 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours, rationalizing the price fall. Solana Price Crashes 14% Meanwhile, SOL price cracked by 14% as of press time, remaining at $137.19. The coin hit a bottom and peak of $136.88 and $161.61, respectively. Solana slumped as $90.60 million was liquidated in the background, bringing heat to its price. Meme Crypto Prices Today Dogecoin (DOGE) witnessed a 10% dip in value today, closing in at $0.2077. Even Shiba Inu (SHIB) lost 8% to reach $0.00001367. Other than dog-themed meme coin prices crashing, even PEPE and TRUMP lost 13%-15%, standing at $0.000007818 and $13.10, respectively. Top Gainer Crypto Prices Today Nevertheless, some tokens have defied the broader market slump today: Story (IP) Price: $4.72 24-Hour Gains: +20% DeXe (DEXE) Price: $19.11 24-Hour Gains: +4% FTX Token (FTT) Price: $1.91 24-Hour Gains: +1% Top Loser Crypto Prices Today Hyperliquid (HYPE) Price: $18.58 24-Hour Loss: -16% Sonic (S) Price: $0.7257 24-Hour Loss: -15% LidoDAO (LDO) Price: $1.37 24-Hour Loss: -15% Meanwhile, traders and investors remain cautious, reflecting uncertainty about future movements amid broader developments. It is yet to be seen if prices will take further heat, given that the U.S. import tariffs commence next week with burgeoning trade war speculations.

There were no major headlines covering the sudden crash, making it seem like not a big deal at all, almost as if no one even cared anymore. Even meme coins, which had been on fire in recent weeks, have taken a severe hit. Liquidity has dried up across the board, raising concerns about even more downside. The sell-off of course started with the Bybit hack on February 21 when North Korea’s Lazarus Group pulled off the biggest financial heist in history, draining $1.5 billion from Bybit’s Ethereum wallets. This theft was so big, it’s double the size of the previous record-holder, which is the $611 million PolyNetwork hack that happened in 2021. Ethereum, which was already performing terribly, got even worse as traders scrambled to pull funds out, fearing another FTX-style collapse. Even though Bybit CEO Ben Zhou quickly announced that the exchange would cover all losses, it wasn’t enough to restore confidence. Traders don’t forget billion-dollar hacks that easily. At first, Bitcoin stayed out of the mess. However, once the S&P 500 tanked on Friday, Bitcoin broke down too. The second stocks started slipping, Bitcoin followed, losing its key $98,000 support level. One major factor that sent Bitcoin spiraling was Citadel Securities, which announced yesterday that it was moving into crypto as a liquidity provider. Instead of reassuring traders, it triggered a “sell the news” reaction, with investors rushing for the exits. Memecoins collapse, Bitcoin struggles Solana, which has now dropped 22% since Friday. The memecoin sector, which had been one of crypto’s wildest success stories this year, is getting slaughtered. With Solana’s crash, traders dumped their memecoins en masse, draining the last bit of liquidity from the market. This actually started when Argentina’s President Javier Milei publicly endorsed LIBRA, a Solana-based meme coin, which quickly pumped like crazy—until it crashed into oblivion, wiping out $4.6 billion in investor money. The scandal-tainted Solana’s reputation, and now, with $1.72 billion in SOL tokens set to be unlocked on March 1, the market is preparing for even more selling pressure. According to digital asset manager Arca, altcoins as a group have already lost between 30-80% since mid-December. Even Dogecoin, which had been riding on Elon Musk’s federal workforce cuts, is down nearly 7%. Crypto-related stocks are also taking a beating, as Coinbase has fallen for six straight days, which is its worst losing streak in months. Bitcoin miner MARA Holdings, which already plunged 13% last week, has lost another 2.6% today, and Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) is also slipping, despite doubling down on Bitcoin buys, per data from Google Finance. On Monday, Strategy filed with the SEC, revealing that it had once again bought 20,356 Bitcoin between February 18-23 for $97,514 per coin, worth a total $1.99 billion. This makes it one of the company’s biggest Bitcoin acquisitions ever, pushing Strategy’s total holdings to $47.7 billion—equivalent to 2.5% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. The company funded this buy with proceeds from its $2 billion convertible bond sale last week. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Shows the Way,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-passive-crypto-income-still-possible-in-2025-mutuum-finance-mutm-shows-the-way/,"As the crypto market matures, many investors are wondering if earning passive income is still a viable strategy in 2025. While traditional staking and yield farming have faced challenges due to shifting market dynamics, new opportunities continue to emerge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that passive income in crypto is far from over. With its decentralized lending protocol, users can earn rewards by supplying liquidity, while borrowers gain access to funds without selling their assets. As the project moves through its presale, investors are taking notice of its potential to offer long-term, sustainable earnings. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol designed to offer users a secure and efficient way to earn passive income by supplying liquidity. Unlike traditional finance, where banks and intermediaries control lending, Mutuum allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets directly on the blockchain. This system provides opportunities for both lenders seeking steady returns and borrowers looking for liquidity without selling their holdings. Mutuum Finance offers two lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). P2C (Peer-to-Contract) : Lenders deposit assets into shared liquidity pools, where borrowers access funds by providing collateral. Interest rates adjust dynamically based on pool utilization, ensuring stable yields for suppliers. P2P (Peer-to-Peer) : This model allows users to negotiate loan terms directly, setting their own interest rates and repayment schedules. It is particularly useful for assets not commonly supported in standard lending pools, such as meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB). Both models allow users to earn passive income by supplying liquidity, with interest generated by borrowers contributing to the lender’s returns. This flexibility ensures that investors can choose the lending structure that best suits their strategy. Mutuum Finance will be audited by a well-known blockchain security firm to ensure the safety and reliability of its smart contracts. This audit will thoroughly assess the protocol’s code, identifying and addressing any potential vulnerabilities before the platform goes live. A verified audit boosts investor confidence, reduces security risks, and reinforces trust in the lending and borrowing system. By prioritizing security, Mutuum Finance aims to provide a safe and transparent environment for users to engage in decentralized finance. There will be mtTokens, which are interest-bearing tokens representing a user’s deposit in Mutuum Finance’s liquidity pools. When a user supplies assets such as USDT or ETH, they receive mtTokens (e.g., mtUSDT or mtETH) in return. These tokens automatically accumulate interest over time as borrowers pay fees, allowing suppliers to grow their holdings passively. Since mtTokens are ERC20-compliant, they can be transferred or integrated into other DeFi applications while continuing to earn yield. For example, if a user deposits 5,000 USDT into the lending pool, they will receive an equivalent amount of mtUSDT. As borrowers repay their loans with interest, the supplier’s mtUSDT balance accrues value, meaning they can withdraw more USDT than they initially deposited. This system ensures that lenders earn passive income while keeping liquidity available for borrowers in the Mutuum Finance ecosystem. The team is also implementing a buy-and-distribute mechanism to support long-term token demand. A portion of the platform’s revenue will be used to buy back MUTM tokens from the open market, creating continuous buy pressure. These repurchased tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards, encouraging long-term participation. This process not only benefits active users but also helps maintain a healthy demand for MUTM, contributing to its price stability and potential growth over time. Beyond lending, Mutuum Finance is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be minted against collateral supplied within the platform. Unlike centralized stablecoins that rely on reserves controlled by third parties, Mutuum’s stablecoin is fully backed by on-chain assets. This ensures transparency, stability, and decentralization, providing a secure option for borrowers while strengthening the platform’s ecosystem. As these features are being developed, Mutuum Finance’s native token, MUTM, is currently in its presale phase at a price of just $0.015. The first presale phase sold out in under two weeks, raising $1.2 million and attracting over 2,450 holders. With 11 presale phases in total, early investors have a chance to secure MUTM at a low price before it reaches the market. With its lending system, stablecoin integration, and strong presale momentum, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as a promising platform for passive income in crypto, giving investors a way to earn without relying on traditional staking or farming models.

He further mentioned that, relative to doing leveraged Bitcoin buying, the stock has underperformed. Schiff said on X that although Michael Saylor claimed a 6.9% Bitcoin return this year, MSTR shares have declined by 6%. He pointed to a dilution of the shareholders, which he stated reduced the premium on the company’s Bitcoin reserves by 85%. Today, @saylor bragged about his leveraged Bitcoin buys generating a BTC yield of 6.9% so far in 2025. However, the share price of $MSTR is down 6% in 2025, while massive dilution has destroyed shareholder value, causing the premium to its Bitcoin holdings to collapse by 85%. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) February 24, 2025 The NAV premium shows how the market values Strategy Inc. compared to its position in Bitcoin. According to the MSTR Tracker, the premium was still at 60%, down from 148% on January 19. Normally, a high premium has a positive correlation with investor confidence in the firm’s specific Bitcoin approach. Convertible debt concerns In another tweet, he also criticized the fact that the company was sourcing its Bitcoin acquisitions through convertible debt. He explained that while MSTR lost 4.5%, Bitcoin only grew by 2.5%, showing signs that the market is skeptical of the new $2 billion convertible note offering. He cautioned that if MSTR keeps trading below the actual value of the Bitcoins, it is possible to end up with a Bitcoin negative return. Schiff has been very vocal in his criticism of the firm’s strategy saying that too much debt is dangerous if the price of Bitcoin drops. Convertible notes allows the holders of the debt to swap their stake for the company stock in the future. Although there is potential upside in this structure, there are accompanying risks in case the stock price stays low or decreases. Schiff earlier noted that the repayment of its debts may turn into a problem if the price of Bitcoin declines. Strategy major Bitcoin acquisition Despite criticism, Strategy Inc. continues to acquire more Bitcoin holdings. The firm recently revealed that it has purchased 20,356 Bitcoins for about $1.99 billion. This acquisition takes its Bitcoin holdings to 478,740 BTC, worth more than $44 billion. This acquisition was paid for through a market-based equity program and a fully subscribed $2 billion convertible notes issuance. Therefore, Strategy Inc. now owns more than 2% of outstanding Bitcoin. As Cryptopolitan reported , the note is currently a 0% coupon and due on March 1, 2030, unless it is redeemed, repurchased, or converted earlier. Every $1,000 note may be converted into 2,072 shares of Strategy’s Class A common stock at $433.43 per share, a 35% premium to the current price. According to the firm, “Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Bitcoin and for working capital.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $92,008.74, down 3.42% in the last 24 hours. MicroStrategy made itself one of the biggest institutional players in the market by investing in Bitcoin. However, Schiff and other critics remain skeptical about whether the firm can sustain the debt-fueled strategy in the long run.

With less than 3 days until its highly anticipated DEX debut on 27th February, iDEGEN is dominating the crypto headlines. There are rumors abound that this degenerate-fed AI baby project is about to experience an explosive surge post-launch, with possible Coinbase listings even mooted. Raising a staggering $24.6m in presale and attracting over 26,000 holders, iDEGEN has proven that traders are all-in on the future of unfiltered, boundary-pushing AI. With staking rewards reaching up to 10,000% APY and non-stop viral antics keeping the crypto community on edge, it’s no surprise a top exchange like BitMart will list IDGN on 4th March . Let’s dive into the best crypto presale of 2025. The mayhem gets worse with every tweet iDEGEN has been on a rampage ever since it was first r eleased into the Crypto X space , delivering an unstoppable, 24/7 flood of content to an audience that grows more fired up by the day. It’s been temporarily banned from the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, not once, not twice, but three times. However, all each has done is add fuel to the chaotic AI mind of iDEGEN. How’s this for a trollish response to one of its temporary bans? With every ban it gained more attention, and investors were sold on the project. Now with a staggering 2.6 million social impressions, Musk is practically fueling the iDEGEN presale at this point. New versions and a second degen-fed AI agent When V2 rocked onto the stage, the carnage got immeasurably worse. iDEGEN, which learns from every tweet it reads and every response it gets from the community, was now able to take its tirades to Telegram. That led to more engagement from onlooking investors and plenty more presale momentum, but not as much as when V3 rolled out. The unapologetic barrage of mayhem now had the ability to release autonomous video content—a world-first for an AI agent. However, the ultimate upgrade came when a second bot was unleashed. This time on to China’s ChatGPT killer, DeepSeek. iDEGEN is now terrorizing social media on two different continents. DEX launch on the 27th February The big day is just 3 days away, and the FOMO is real with this one. Early investors are preparing the champagne, and those late to the party are scampering to grab what they can before this hugely impressive presale ends forever. We’ve seen it time and again with the biggest meme coins that gains can be significant, and the whispers on the grapevine are suggesting iDEGEN is about to follow suit. The presale ends on 26th February, and all unsold tokens will be burned at launch, creating immediate scarcity.

On February 23, the hackers used multiple addresses to swap 37,900 ETH ($106M) for Bitcoin and other assets through Chainflip, THORChain, LiFi, DLN, and eXch. The firm revealed that the hackers began laundering ETH through the eXch cryptocurrency exchange without KYC. Bybit exchange had asked the crypto exchange platform to freeze the funds, but eXch rejected the request. The hackers have now laundered over $75M from Bybit through eXch and it’s still ongoing. The Bybit exchange exploiter also laundered funds via PumpFun by sending 60 SOL to an address. ZachXBT revealed that the latter launched the token “QinShihuang” (500,000) and generated over $26M in trading. PumpFun later removed the Lazarus-linked meme coin from its front end on February 23. According to ZachXBT, the attacker received $1.08M from the Bybit hack on February 22. The funds were later moved from Ethereum to Solana, then to BSC, and then split across 30+ addresses. He added that 106K USDC was later divided between 10 BSC addresses and bridged back to Solana. On February 23, Bybit froze a total of $42.89 million as part of a coordinated effort. Tether’s founder, Paolo Ardoino, froze 181K USDT tied to the Bybit hack. Fixed Float also froze 120K USDC and ESDT, while ChangeNOW froze around 34 ETH. Arkham Intelligence revealed that the Bybit exchange hacker was making 2 to 3 transactions per minute and stopped every 45 minutes for a 15-minute break. The firm also noted that the hackers moved ETH from one address at a time before moving on to the next one. Lookonchain acknowledged that the Bybit hacker who stole $1.4B in assets appeared to have received ETH from Binance as gas fees. “As part of the investigation and recovery efforts, Bybit is pledging 10% of recovered funds to reward ethical cyber and network security experts who play an active role in retrieving the stolen cryptocurrencies in the incident.” – Bybit . Bybit’s founder, Ben Zhou, said that it was not an issue if the firm was experiencing a bank run because the company had enough tokens to give to the clients. He assured the firm’s customers that Bybit could cover the hacked amount of 400,000 ETH with the Bybit treasury. He said, “No matter what, we will make sure all of the client’s money is safe, so your money is safe.” Bybit also acknowledged that it took loans after the hack to cover its withdrawals. Binance’s founder and former CEO, Changpeng Zhao, suggested that Bybit should halt withdrawals for a bit as a standard security precaution. Hackers steal $1.5B from Bybit exchange Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit revealed last week that hackers had stolen digital assets worth around $1.5 billion, which was called the biggest crypto heist of all time. ZachXBT made over 920 addresses linked to the hack public and also confirmed a Lazarus Group connection. According to Arkham Intelligence, ZachXBT submitted definitive proof on February 21, 19:09 UTC, that the Lazarus Group performed the attack on Bybit exchange. ZachXBT’s submission included a detailed analysis of test transactions and connected wallets used before the hack, as well as multiple forensics graphs and timing analyses. Bybit exchange CEO Ben Zhou believes that the funds were siphoned from a cold wallet that was used for other tokens. Zhou also confirmed that the company’s hot wallet, warm wallet, and all other cold wallets remained secure. Crypto research firm Elliptic acknowledged that the hack was more than double the last-biggest crypto heist and “almost certainly the single largest known theft of any kind in all time.” Hacking hauls totaled more than $2 billion last year, the fourth straight year that proceeds have surpassed more than $1 billion.

Here are Top Picks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The major attraction of cryptocurrencies is their speculative value. The history of crypto is littered with examples of tokens that went on to mint astronomical gains for investors who bought in early. For instance, in 2024, XRP went on a 6x run from November until it peaked at Trump’s inauguration last January. Meme coin Shiba Inu, meanwhile, went on an eye-watering 40,000,000% run at its 2021 peak —and no, that’s not a typo. Not surprisingly, everyone in crypto is always looking for the next big crypto. With thousands of new tokens launched daily, finding the next crypto to explode could be tricky. Fortunately, we’ve compiled three of the next big cryptocurrencies to invest in this year. Next big cryptos to explode in February 2025: The picks There’s no way to tell which crypto will go boom. However, the trends are a good indicator of which cryptocurrencies could stand to benefit from the increased speculation. These include artificial intelligence, meme coins, and utility tokens, all expected to pump in 2025. Here are the top picks: iDEGEN : Next big crypto AI agent poised to go parabolic in 2025 Bitcoin Pepe: Solana x Bitcoin hybrid bringing memes to the OG crypto chain Vine: Meme coin centered around Vine nostalgia takes off iDEGEN: Next big crypto AI agent poised to go parabolic in 2025 A thousand AIs are crawling around the crypto scene, but none come remotely as close to unhinged as iDEGEN. Built by degens, for degens, this AI agent has a whole different vibe. Contrary to its sanitized counterparts, iDEGEN is AI unleashed into the wilderness of crypto X to feast on every conspiracy, trading tip, and savage humor. In many ways, iDEGEN is the product of crypto degen culture on which it trained its large language model. Learning from every @ and interaction, iDEGEN has developed a mind of its own—and it’s a little too raw for free speech platform, X. But not even running afoul of the algorithms at X could stop iDEGEN from going viral and raising a staggering $22.4m in the wake of the furor. The bans galvanized support from the degen community, leading to iDEGEN’s long-awaited presale, raising $1 million in the next 24 hours. X is just the beginning—with iDEGEN’s V3 update, the AI agent is crossing over to Telegram and positioning itself to take over new platforms like RedNote and maybe even YouTube with its newfound ability to create video. Besides being the first-ever AI agent on RedNote, iDEGEN has teamed up with Chinese AI sensation DeepSeek, whose launch threw the markets in disarray after revealing Big Tech’s overcharging charging scheme on AI models. Now, iDEGEN is bigger, better, and meaner thanks to its partnership with DeepSeek—and more ready than ever to flip the script on the lucrative AI agent sector . iDEGEN token prices have since risen from $0.01 to $0.0259—and with its imminent launch on 27th February locked in, the best time to buy into iDEGEN was yesterday. iDEGEN (IDGN) is available exclusively via its official website . Bitcoin Pepe: Solana x Bitcoin hybrid bringing memes to the OG crypto chain Let’s face some hard facts—Bitcoin as a technology severely lacks scalability, throughput, and interoperability to grow an ecosystem that Ethereum and Solana did so successfully en route to making bank for its early investors by the bushel. That’s where Bitcoin Pepe comes in—the first-ever meme-centric layer-2 scalability solution combining the speed, low fees, and high throughput of Solana built on top of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work ledger. Can you imagine the unparalleled potential for Bitcoin Pepe and its native token BPEP when it serves as the key unlock to $2 trillion invested in Bitcoin as it enables memes, NFTs, and all sorts of utility on the OG blockchain? The sky’s the limit for Bitcoin Pepe. If Solana could go from $0.22 to $293, just imagine how much more Bitcoin Pepe could run from its starting price of $0.21. To learn more and to buy Bitcoin Pepe, check out the official website . Vine: Meme coin centered around Vine nostalgia takes off Meme coins have an uncanny ability to capture the fancy of retail investors—and when they do, they can lead to eye-watering gains. Vine, a newly launched meme coin cashing in on the nostalgia surrounding 2010s internet culture, is an example of how meme coins can catch fire quickly. Within hours of its launch, Vine soared to $90 million, going on a nearly 6000% run to peak at a $500 million market cap at its absolute peak. While Vine has cooled off since it’s all just a matter of time before meme coin speculation picks up again and takes it to the next leg up. The final word The big money in crypto is made by buying low-cap gems with the value proposition, fundamentals, and narratives to go parabolic. And between these three picks, iDEGEN stands out. That’s not a prediction—that’s as close as you’ll get to a spoiler.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,BTC|SOL|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 05:19:19

OKX, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges , has settled with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) over legal violations. The exchange admitted to failing to obtain the required license to operate in the U.S. and agreed to pay over $500 million in penalties and forfeitures. What went wrong? The DOJ found that OKX sought out U.S. customers despite a long-standing policy banning them from the platform. Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky stated that the exchange facilitated billions in criminal proceeds and suspicious transactions. The settlement does not include allegations of direct harm to customers. Notably, OKX’s American subsidiary, OKcoin, also faced similar scrutiny from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). A subpoena dated February 24, 2024, referenced fraud and other illegal activities related to digital asset transactions. A separate CFTC investigation is reportedly linked to a flash crash in January 2024 that affected OKX’s native token, OKB. The exchange promised to compensate affected users. The shake-out! An internal document circulated among OKX staff in January 2024 emphasized the importance of whistleblowing and compliance with regulations. The exchange introduced an ethics and compliance helpline for employees to report policy violations or illegal behavior. However, DOJ findings revealed that OKX employees had previously instructed users to falsify information to bypass the platform’s restrictions. The DOJ cited one example of an OKX employee advising a U.S. user to enter random information when prompted for KYC verification. The user was allegedly told to select a different nationality and input arbitrary ID numbers. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Big News: SEC Plans to Cut 10 Regional Office Leaders as Part of DOGE-Driven Cost-Cutting Plan , OKX’s False Deeds Despite its claims of blocking U.S. customers since 2017, OKX engaged in marketing activities within the country. The DOJ highlighted OKX’s sponsorship of the Tribeca Film Festival and its efforts to attract U.S. users through promotional content. At least one U.S.-based customer reportedly shared an instructional video on using a VPN to bypass location restrictions and access OKX’s services. Future Implications With this settlement, OKX aims to resolve its regulatory issues and continue operating in global markets. However, ongoing CFTC investigations may lead to further legal actions. The exchange has yet to comment on the settlement, and a CFTC spokesperson also declined to provide statements. This case marks another major regulatory crackdown on crypto exchanges operating without proper compliance, signaling tighter enforcement in the digital asset space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Altcoins could be facing an even greater crash amid a liquidity crisis-like situation. Bitcoin Leads Crypto Market Crash Over the last 24 hours, the broader crypto market has lost more than $150 billion with the total market cap slipping under $3 trillion. Bitcoin losses have extended further by 4% slipping all the way to $91,000 while falling under key support levels. As per the Coinglass data , the 24-hour Bitcoins liquidations have topped $274 million of which $258 million is in long liquidations. Furthermore, this selling pressure comes with a 150% surge in daily trading volumes to more than $51 billion. Further BTC Price Correction Coming? Amid the steep fall in the Bitcoin price, market analysts are flashing warning signs hinting at the possibility of further correction and a crypto market crash. For the first time since September 2024, Bitcoin demand has dropped into negative territory as per Julio Moreno, the head of research at CryptoQuant. Moreno highlighted the challenges facing Bitcoin in the current market conditions, noting that such negative demand growth makes it difficult for prices to rally. He further warned that the risks of a further market correction are increasing. Source: CryptoQuant Also, as per crypto analyst Ali Martinez, if BTC bulls fail to hold the $93,700 support on a daily closing basis, it risks falling further to the next major support at $75,600. The warning comes as market participants closely monitor Bitcoin’s price movements amid heightened volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty. As of press time, BTC price is trading 3.6% down at $91,910 levels. Source: Ali Charts Bitcoin ETF Sell-Offs On The Rise Additionally, last week, Bitcoin investments witnessed $571 million worth of outflows while short-Bitcoin inflows surged to $2.8 million. Outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs have also surged netting $516 million on Monday, with Fidelity’s FBTC seeing $247 million in outflows while BlackRock’s IBIT clocked $159 million worth of outflows. Arthur Hayes has issued a stark warning about potential turbulence in the Bitcoin market. Hayes explained that many $IBIT holders, particularly hedge funds, have leveraged a strategy of going long on ETFs while shorting CME futures to secure yields exceeding short-term U.S. Treasury rates. However, if the basis narrows as BTC prices decline, these funds may sell $IBIT holdings and repurchase CME futures to unwind their positions. With the basis now nearing U.S. Treasury yields, Hayes suggests these funds, already in profit, are likely to act during U.S. trading hours to realize gains. Source: Arthur Hayes Altcoins See A Steeper Fall Amid major liquidity challenges and a sharp drop in the S&P 500 sell-off in the altcoin space has accelerated in this crypto market crash. Ethereum price is down today by 8% slipping under $2,500 today, with daily trading volume surging to $31.6 billion, and 24-hour liquidations surging to $195 million. Furthermore, altcoins like Solana have faced even steeper falls in relation to Bitcoin. Solana has suffered the biggest hit falling more than 22% since last Friday. Source: The Kobeissi Letter The Bybit hack on February 21 has cast a shadow over market sentiment, shaking investor confidence. Arkham Intelligence has labeled the incident the “largest financial heist in history,” underscoring the magnitude of the breach and its impact on the cryptocurrency landscape. However, the crypto exchange Bybit managed to acquire all of Ethereum within just 48 hours of the incident. In a surprising turn of events, Citadel Securities made a significant shift in its crypto strategy just hours before a notable market response. According to Bloomberg, the $65 billion financial giant is exploring becoming a liquidity provider for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. However, the market interpreted the news as a “sell the news” moment, prompting a cautious reaction among traders.

However, with blockchain evolving, a new competitor has gradually emerged. With its super-fast transaction, AI-powered features and cross-chain swaps, 1Fuel (OFT) is taking centre stage in the crypto industry. Market experts believe that the platform could achieve 100x post-presale. Therefore, one may conclude that 1Fuel’s wallet and exchange could be a worthy investment for traders in 2025. Analysts suggest an upward trend for tron price prediction Tron (TRX) is trading for $0.2469, up 0.38% from a 24-hour high. Tron recovered from a 5.72% loss one month ago and climbed 0.41% in the past seven days. Recent developments have seen an expanding Tron ecosystem. The launch of the TRON Builders League provided a $10 million fund to help developers and accelerate network innovation. Founder Justin Sun has also promoted the platform’s expansion to broaden its worldwide reach. All these developments reflect Tron’s stance on building a flourishing and innovative blockchain ecosystem and making Tron a worthy proposition for investors. Analysts suggest an upward trajectory for Tron price prediction. Tron’s price is predicted to rise by 1.75% and reach $ 0.2530 by the end of March 2025. Likewise, market experts suggest that traders could see a profit of $539 if they invest $1,000 and hold until April 2025. This highlights a 54% return on investment within a reasonable time frame. 1Fuel: Revolutionizing cross-chain transactions with enhanced utility While veteran cryptocurrencies like Tron (TRX) work to maintain market relevance, 1Fuel redefines interoperability in the blockchain space by offering a scalable, effective cross-chain liquidity solution.

This resulted in the business losing over $110 billion. With this, the market is now valued at just above the $3 Trillion mark. Following this, market leaders have failed to hold above their important support levels, highlighting increased bearish dominance. Moreover, the leader of altcoins, Ethereum price, continues displaying a strong bearish action. This highlights increased uncertainty in the crypto space. With this, investors are curious with questions like “Why did Ethereum crash today?” In this article, we have uncovered the possible Ethereum price analysis just for you! ETH Price Records A Strong Bearish Reversal! The price of Ethereum has crashed by ~10% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $31.750 billion, a change of +49.93%. Furthermore, this altcoin has lost 7.18% over the past week and 25.17% in 30 days. With a market cap of $300.901 billion, it holds a market share of 10.1397%. The Simple Moving Average (SMA) records a negative crossover in the Ethereum price chart. This suggests a bearish outlook for the ETH price in the upcoming time. Furthermore, the MACD indicator displays a constant decline in the green histogram in the daily time frame. Moreover, its averages are on the verge of experiencing a bearish convergence, indicating that the largest altcoin may continue losing value this week. Is Ethereum Going to Recover? Suppose, the market favors the bulls, this could result in the price of Ethereum retesting its immediate resistance level of $2,870. Furthermore, if the bullish sentiment sustains, this could push the price of ETH toward its upper resistance level of $3,300 in the coming time. Conversely, a sustained bearish action could result in it retesting its support trendline of $2,530.

Bitcoin dropped below $94,000 initially and later formed the bottom below $92,000 and interestingly, it does not appear to halt the ongoing bearish trend. A probable reason for the circulating fear and uncertainty within the markets is speculated to be Trump continuing with 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which could fuel the trade war fears. The markets underwent the largest liquidation of the month of over $815 million in the past 24 hours, with BTC experiencing more than $270 million in liquidation alone during the last trading day. Besides, the series of long liquidations has been continuing since the early trading hours, recording more than $116 million. Nearly 2,86,596 traders have already been liquidated, with the single largest liquidation recorded being over $10 million. The market sentiments have plunged below 30, suggesting the traders are currently under fear. What’s Next for the Bitcoin & Ethereum Prices? Bitcoin and Ethereum are touching crucial support levels, which may trigger another bearish wave if they are not defended well. The RSI of BTC has marked the lowest levels not seen since September 2024, hinting towards the rally heading to mark the bottom. Besides, the bounce does not appear to be strong enough, which could reinstate a strong ascending trend. Therefore, the BTC price is now feared to drop to $90,000 or levels below the range, which may attract notable liquidity. On the other hand, Ethereum’s price not only broke below the pivotal ascending trend line but also failed to hold within an important support zone. Currently, the price is struggling to defend the local support at $2500 and if it fails to rise and recover above $2600, it’s a bullish possibility and probability of Altseason, both of which may drop hard. On the other hand, Bitcoin dominance is scaling up by rising above 61%, while the Altcoin season index has dropped to 22, suggesting the market is more lenient towards Bitcoin. Overall crypto market sentiment has dropped to fear, which suggests the panic selling is expected to continue for some more time. This could keep the markets under the bearish influence, probably until the end of the monthly trade.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ETH|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 05:39:00

However, the latest move comes with a notable uptick in perpetual futures open interest and price action that indicates seller dominance. The number of open futures bets or open interest in the BTC/USDT pair trading on Binance rose by roughly 12,000 BTC (worth over $1 billion) as BTC's price fell from $96,000 to under $92,000, according to data tracked by Coinglass . An uptick in open interest alongside a price decline is said to represent an influx of bearish short positions. In other words, traders likely opened fresh shorts as the price dropped, perhaps in anticipation of an extended sell-off. The cumulative volume delta (CVD) across both futures and spot markets on the exchange was already negative and has deepened further with the price drop, indicating that selling pressure has outpaced buying activity. The CVD measures the net capital flows into the market, where positive and rising figures indicate buyer dominance, while negative values reflect increased selling pressure. BTC chalks out bearish marubozu candle Bitcoin dropped 4.86% on Monday with sellers dominating the price action throughout the day. That's reflected in the shape of Monday's candlestick, which features negligible upper and lower shadows and a prominent red body. In other words, opening and closing prices are almost the same, a sign buyers had little say in the price action. Technical analysts categorize this as a bearish marubozu pattern. The appearance of the bearish candlestick while prices hover below key 50- and 100-day simple moving averages (SMA) may embolden sellers, potentially leading to deeper losses. Support (S) is seen near $89,200, the Jan. 13 low, followed by the 200-day SMA at $81,661.

This comes after NYSE Arca submitted a request to the SEC to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Cardano Trust on the stock exchange, and a decision is expected within 180 days. Cardano ETF Review Begins The SEC has officially accepted NYSE Arca’s request to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Cardano Trust. This means the review process has now started, and the SEC will decide whether to approve or reject the Cardano ETF. The decision is expected by August 2025. The acknowledgment came on February 24, 2025, after NYSE Arca first submitted the proposal on February 10, 2025. If approved, this ETF would give investors a way to invest in Cardano (ADA) through a regulated platform. With this ETF, investors could buy and sell shares that track the price of ADA without needing to hold the cryptocurrency themselves. This would make it easier for more people to gain exposure to Cardano in a secure and regulated way. Higher Chances of ETF Approval The chances of a Cardano ETF getting approved in 2025 have increased, with Polymarket, a decentralized prediction platform, now showing a 62% likelihood . This is a significant rise from 51% in January. Meanwhile, the SEC’s acknowledgment of multiple crypto ETF filings, including Grayscale’s XRP ETF, has contributed to this growing optimism. Market sentiment has shifted in favor of approval as institutional interest in crypto continues to rise. If approved, the Cardano ETF would open doors for more traditional investors to enter the ADA market. Impact on Cardano’s Price A Cardano ETF could have a positive effect on ADA’s price by attracting institutional investors and increasing demand. Analysts believe that if ADA maintains support between $0.67 and $0.81, it could see further gains. However, if it drops below this range, the price could face downward pressure. As of now, Cardano is priced at $0.68 , with a market cap of $24.16 billion.

OKX’s operator, Aux Cayes FinTech Co. Ltd., has pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business, agreeing to pay over $500 million in fines following an investigation by the Department of Justice (DOJ). Meanwhile, under new leadership following President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been engaging with industry leaders and reconsidering some of its previous enforcement actions, raising speculation about a more flexible approach to crypto regulation. OKX’s Aux Cayes FinTech Pleads Guilty to Violating US Anti-Money Laundering Laws, Faces $500M Penalty Aux Cayes FinTech Co. Ltd., the operator of OKX, has pleaded guilty to violating US Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws and has agreed to pay a staggering $505 million in fines and forfeitures. The company admitted to operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business that facilitated over $5 billion in suspicious transactions and criminal proceeds. As part of the resolution, the Seychelles-based crypto exchange will pay $84 million in penalties and forfeit $421 million in fees collected from mostly institutional clients. The settlement, announced on Feb. 24, 2025, follows an extensive investigation by the US Department of Justice (DOJ), which found that OKX knowingly allowed US-based customers to trade on its global platform, despite lacking the necessary approvals. The US Department of Justice was unambiguous in its condemnation of OKX’s practices, with Acting US Attorney Matthew Podolsky stating that the guilty plea sends a clear message to financial institutions. ”Today's guilty plea and penalties emphasize that there will be consequences for financial institutions that avail themselves of US markets but violate the law by allowing criminal activity to continue,” Podolsky said. Meanwhile, FBI Assistant Director in Charge James E. Dennehy revealed that OKX actively advised users to falsify information to bypass regulatory requirements. ”Blatant disregard for the rule of law will not be tolerated,” Dennehy emphasized. The DOJ noted that OKX’s violations spanned from 2018 to early 2024, despite the company having an official policy to block US customers since 2017. Following the DOJ’s announcement, OKX released a statement acknowledging ”legacy compliance gaps” but maintained that the number of US clients involved was minimal and that none remain on the platform today. OKX also stressed that no customers were harmed and that no employees faced charges as part of the settlement. However, the exchange acknowledged the need for stronger regulatory safeguards to prevent future violations. In an attempt to repair its global compliance reputation, OKX stated that it will hire an independent compliance consultant to overhaul its anti-money laundering and regulatory policies. ”Our vision is to make OKX the gold standard of global compliance at scale across different markets and their respective regulatory bodies,” OKX CEO Star Xu posted on X. OKX’s Ongoing Regulatory Challenges OKX, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has historically faced scrutiny from global regulators. Like many offshore exchanges, OKX has operated in a gray area regarding regulatory oversight, often relying on jurisdictional loopholes to facilitate international trading. This case follows a wider crackdown on unregulated crypto exchanges, with Binance, BitMEX, and KuCoin also facing regulatory pressure in recent years. The $500 million penalty imposed on OKX marks one of the largest fines ever levied against a cryptocurrency exchange for AML violations. The ruling suggests growing pressure on centralized exchanges to implement robust compliance frameworks that align with US and international laws. With regulatory oversight tightening, many industry analysts predict that crypto firms will need to proactively bolster their compliance programs to avoid similar legal entanglements. As US regulators ramp up their efforts to curb illicit finance in the digital asset space, the OKX settlement may serve as a precedent for future cases, forcing crypto exchanges to reconsider their operational strategies in the world’s largest financial market. Trump-Era SEC May Ease Crypto Crackdown as Industry Leaders Push for Regulatory Rethink Meanwhile, a major shift in US cryptocurrency regulation may be on the horizon as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), now under new leadership following the inauguration of President Donald Trump , considers revising its stance on enforcement actions against crypto firms. In recent days, the SEC’s crypto task force, headed by Commissioner Hester Peirce, has engaged in discussions with multiple industry stakeholders about reevaluating the agency’s previous classification of cryptocurrencies as securities. The meetings, which took place between Feb. 17 and Feb. 24, suggest that the regulatory landscape for crypto in the US could undergo significant changes. According to multiple SEC filings, top executives from leading crypto firms, investors, and policymakers have met with the commission to advocate for a more accommodating approach to digital assets. Among those who participated in discussions were: Crypto Council for Innovation (an industry advocacy group) Zero Hash (a crypto infrastructure provider) Paradigm Operations (a prominent crypto investment firm) Michael Saylor (Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy and long-time Bitcoin advocate) Each party reportedly submitted documents urging the SEC to reconsider its prior stance that many digital assets qualify as securities and, consequently, fall under its regulatory jurisdiction. The meetings followed similar discussions between the SEC’s crypto task force and other key industry figures, including Blockchain Association, Jito Labs, and Multicoin Capital. While the SEC has not made any official announcements regarding enforcement policy changes, the tone of these meetings suggests a departure from the aggressive regulatory approach seen under former Chair Gary Gensler. Under Gensler’s leadership, the SEC pursued numerous enforcement actions against major crypto firms, often citing violations of securities laws. However, since Trump took office and installed acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda, the agency has already dropped investigations into Robinhood Crypto and OpenSea. The commission’s latest moves have sparked debate about whether this represents a genuine shift toward pro-crypto regulation or an attempt to appease industry lobbyists. Critics argue that the SEC’s pivot under Trump could weaken investor protections and enable financial misconduct. One of the most vocal crypto advocates within the SEC, Commissioner Hester Peirce, has signaled that the agency is open to exploring alternative regulatory frameworks for digital assets. In a Feb. 21 statement titled ‘There Must Be Some Way Out of Here’, Peirce proposed the idea of a ”regulatory sandbox”—a controlled environment where crypto projects could operate under tailored rules rather than facing immediate enforcement actions. Peirce's call for public feedback aligns with broader efforts within the SEC to rethink its regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, although it remains unclear how soon any concrete policy changes will materialize. A crucial factor in shaping the SEC’s crypto policy is the pending nomination of a permanent chair. While acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda is currently leading the agency, President Trump has nominated former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to take the helm. Atkins is known for his pro-market, deregulatory stance and has previously expressed skepticism about overregulating digital assets. However, his nomination has yet to be scheduled for a hearing by the Senate Banking Committee, which remains divided on how the SEC should approach crypto regulation. Trump’s broader economic policy strategy also suggests a more industry-friendly environment for crypto. The president has long criticized overregulation in the financial sector and even launched his own meme coin shortly before taking office. On Feb. 19, the SEC voluntarily dismissed a legal appeal blocking a broker-dealer rule that had impacted some crypto firms—another move indicating a potential retreat from the agency’s prior hardline approach. A ”Crypto-Friendly” SEC or Industry Capture? The SEC’s evolving stance has fueled speculation about whether the agency is genuinely seeking a balanced regulatory framework or is simply bowing to pressure from industry heavyweights. Proponents of deregulation argue that a less restrictive approach will encourage innovation and prevent the US from falling behind in the global race for digital asset adoption. Industry leaders have repeatedly warned that overly aggressive regulation is driving blockchain innovation offshore. However, critics worry that easing enforcement actions could embolden bad actors and increase risks for retail investors. They argue that Gensler’s aggressive crackdown helped prevent fraudulent schemes and ensured that crypto firms adhered to financial transparency standards. The battle over crypto regulation is playing out at a time of heightened political polarization in Washington, with Trump -aligned Republicans generally favoring deregulation and Democrats pushing for stronger oversight.

Bitcoin Needs To Reclaim This Level For Trend Continuation – Analyst",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/red-monday-green-week-bitcoin-needs-to-reclaim-this-level-for-trend-continuation-analyst/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has dropped below $95,000 and risks a further decline amid the ongoing market retrace. As February comes to an end, some analysts consider the flagship crypto needs to reclaim some crucial levels to continue its bullish long-term trend. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Price Manipulated? Expert Exposes The Truth Bitcoin Sees Monday Bleeding Over the past three days, Bitcoin has seen its price drop below some key levels, dropping 5.7% From Friday’s highs. Amid the news of the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s withdrawal of its crypto case against Coinbase, the largest crypto by market capitalization traded above the $99,000 mark for the first time in two weeks. However, the positive sentiment quickly vanished after Bybit, one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world, suffered a $1.5 billion hack that took around 401,347 ETH. As a result, most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, lost their momentary gains. Since then, the flagship crypto has hovered between the $95,000 and $96,000 zone, briefly nearing the $97,000 resistance on Saturday. On Monday, the correction continued, with BTC dropping below $95,000 and hitting its one-week low at $93,800. As noted by analyst Jelle, Bitcoin continues to dump on New York markets opening. Per the post, BTC has been retracing from its early Monday recoveries every week after the US market opens, driving its price to a red Monday close several times in the past few months. Despite these retraces and the recent market corrections, Bitcoin has remained within its post-election range since November, showing minimal volatility. BTC has hovered between the $96,000-$102,000 mid-zone of the range for most of this period. Amid its recent performance, Altcoin Sherpa pointed out that, excluding February 18, Bitcoin has not closed below its daily support zone in over a month, signaling that BTC needs to close above $95,700 to continue holding this crucial level. BTC Retests Bullish Flag Breakout Meanwhile, Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC needs a monthly close above $96,000 to continue its bullish long-term trend. In January, the largest crypto registered a historic candle after closing the month above the $100,000 mark for the first time. This close confirmed Bitcoin’s breakout from its post-election monthly bull flag. However, the recent price action has seen BTC retest its breakout level again, momentarily losing it. The analyst asserted that the cryptocurrency needs to reclaim and close February above $96,700 “to confirm the breakout & set itself up for trend continuation over time.” He added that BTC has traded around this key level throughout the majority of February, and continuing to hold it would indicate a “successful post-breakout retest.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Activity Levels Crash To 4-Month Lows, Does This Spell Doom For The Meme Coin? Rekt Capital concluded that BTC’s daily close “isn’t as important as the higher timeframe signal” as the bull flag bottom continues to hold as support “and the three-month trend of a Higher Low at the downside wicks still exists.” At the time of writing, BTC trades at $94,165, a 2.1% decrease in the daily timeframe.

The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a downward trend, with several major coins facing declines. Both Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are seeing significant declines. Bitcoin is priced at $92,017, down by 3.87% in the last 24 hours, while Ethereum follows suit at $2,505, down 8.28%. The global cryptocurrency market has seen a major decline, with the total market capitalization now sitting at $2.99 trillion. This marks a 5.06% decrease in the last 24 hours, reflecting the ongoing downward trend affecting major cryptocurrencies. What’s Next For XRP Price? Looking at XRP’s current price action on the daily chart, analyst Josh of Crypto World said that the price continues to face resistance in the $2.65 to $2.80 range. This area has proven to be a tough hurdle for XRP, with the price struggling to break through. On the downside, XRP has recently broken below the $2.50 support level, which had previously been acting as short-term support. The next key support to watch is in the $2.25 to $2.30 range. Despite the ongoing rejection from resistance, XRP is currently moving within a sideways price range. The price continues to bounce between the support and resistance levels, and this could continue in the short term. If the price approaches the support again, there’s a possibility of a bounce back towards resistance. XRP has recently confirmed an oversold signal for the first time in quite a while on the RSI. The last few times the RSI approached oversold conditions, XRP saw local lows and some short-term relief. Although this doesn’t mark the end of the bearish trend, it suggests that we may see a brief relief rally or a slight pause in the selling pressure over the next 1-2 days, before potentially resuming the downtrend.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|BTC|ETH|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 06:02:03

This premier event transcended traditional conferences, acting as a launchpad for visionary collaborations, groundbreaking insights, and tangible commitments toward building a more inclusive and innovative global ecosystem. A Historic Gathering From seasoned blockchain pioneers to emerging Web3 entrepreneurs, delegates engaged in deep discussions on scalability, tokenomics, interoperability, decentralized finance (DeFi), and the evolving role of Web3 in driving economic transformation worldwide. By combining structured networking sessions and interactive roundtables, the roundtable created unprecedented opportunities for participants to forge meaningful connections and partnerships. Roundtables That Shaped the Conversation Four dynamic roundtables addressed core themes pivotal to the future of decentralization: Roundtable 1: “Forget Slogans, Can Crypto Coexist with Fiat?” Thought Leaders: Vikram R Singh , Bibin Babu , Himanshu Gulathi , Olav Chen This roundtable explored how crypto and fiat could feasibly integrate to bolster financial inclusion, stability, and consumer trust. Roundtable 2: “Web3 Stops Discussing ‘Use Cases’ During Bull Markets?” Thought Leaders: Jan Camenisch , John Shipman , Yat Siu , Sandy Carter Thought Leaders examined the cyclical tendency of the Web3 community to overlook real-world use cases when the market surges, emphasizing the importance of consistent innovation and user adoption beyond speculative hype. Roundtable 3: “Is Bitcoin Living Up to Satoshi Nakamoto’s Vision?” Thought Leaders: Aly Madhavji , Kapil Dhiman , Patrick B , Punith B Experts assessed Bitcoin’s evolution—its core principle of decentralization, security, and trustlessness—while debating how the original vision continues to influence new protocols and financial models. Roundtable 4: “What Trumponomics Could Mean to Cryptonomics?” Thought Leaders: Harshal Madnani , Dayakar Reddy , Itay Azaraty , William Bao Bean A forward-looking discussion on how macroeconomic policies and political shifts might interact with the rapidly evolving crypto landscape, including possible regulatory considerations. Signing of the Davos Declaration A highlight of the roundtable was the signing of the Davos Declaration , a pledge and charter affirming the Web3 community’s commitment to innovation, inclusion, sustainability, and integrity. Global Web3 leaders united under this historic document, underscoring a shared vision to nurture responsible growth across decentralized ecosystems.

This latest purchase brought its total holdings to almost 500,000 BTC. Despite this, Bitcoin is on track for its first negative February since 2020, with its price struggling to maintain support above $95,000. Market sentiment also still seems weak as spot Bitcoin ETF outflows continue. South Dakota Kills Bitcoin Bill South Dakota lawmakers have effectively killed a bill that could have allowed the state to invest in Bitcoin after deferring the vote beyond the legislative session’s 40-day limit. The proposed legislation, HB 1202, sought to amend the classification of state public funds to permit up to 10% investment in Bitcoin. During a meeting of the House Commerce and Energy Committee on Feb. 24, the majority of lawmakers voted to push the bill to the 41st day, which is a move that prevents it from moving forward this session. The bill’s sponsor, State Representative Logan Manhart , introduced the legislation on Jan. 30 with the intent to integrate Bitcoin into South Dakota’s investment strategy. After the setback, Manhart announced his plans to reintroduce the bill in 2026, hoping for a different outcome in future legislative sessions. Similar attempts to establish Bitcoin reserves have failed in other states, including North Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming. However, lawmakers in several states, including Florida, Arizona, Utah, Ohio, Missouri, and Kentucky, have introduced similar legislation that is still under consideration. The push for Bitcoin investment at the state level is part of a broader shift in policy after the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. During his campaign, Trump promoted the idea of creating a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile,” which he formalized in a Jan. 23 executive order establishing a working group to study the feasibility of such a reserve. However, many of Trump’s executive actions have faced legal challenges as critics question their constitutionality. Since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump’s administration departed from the regulatory stance of his predecessor, Joe Biden. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took a hardline approach to crypto regulation under Biden, but now has already dropped several investigations into crypto firms.The SEC has even closed its case against Coinbase, a major crypto exchange that was under scrutiny since 2023. Strategy Nears 500,000 BTC Holdings Despite the fact that some US states are stepping back from Bitcoin, Strategy recently expanded its Bitcoin holdings with an additional $2 billion purchase . This yet again solidifies its position as the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. The firm bought 20,356 Bitcoin at an average price of $97,514 per token, bringing its total Bitcoin reserves to 499,096 BTC. These holdings were acquired for approximately $33.1 billion at an average price of $66,357 per BTC. The announcement was made by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor in a post on X. The acquisition took place after the firm’s successful senior convertible note offering, which raised $2 billion. The notes carry a 0% coupon and mature in 2030, with each $1,000 block convertible to 2.3072 shares of Strategy’s Class A common stock at a 35% premium over the current market price. After deducting fees and estimated expenses, Strategy secured approximately $1.99 billion in net proceeds, which it plans to use for general corporate purposes, including more Bitcoin acquisitions. The move is part of Strategy’s ambitious “21/21 Plan,” which aims to raise $42 billion over three years through a combination of equity and fixed-income securities to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. The firm has already secured $20 billion under this plan, relying heavily on senior convertible notes and debt to fuel its Bitcoin accumulation. Despite reporting a net loss of $670 million in the fourth quarter of 2024, Strategy is still very much committed to its aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Now that its holdings approach the 500,000 BTC milestone, the firm’s unrealized profit on its Bitcoin position surged to more than $12.8 billion, according to data from Saylortracker . Strategy Bitcoin holdings (Source: Saylortracker ) Institutional interest in Strategy has also grown a lot recently, with pension funds and treasuries across twelve North American states reportedly holding a combined $330 million worth of the firm’s stock by the end of 2024. Additionally, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, recently increased its stake in Strategy to 5% after the company’s rebranding on Feb. 5. Bitcoin Faces First Negative February Since 2020 Bitcoin is on track to register its first negative monthly return since February 2020 as it is currently down over 10% for the month. With less than a week left, the leading cryptocurrency’s lack of bullish momentum suggests that a new all-time high is unlikely in the short term. Historically, February has seen an average return of around 14%, but current market sentiment is still very subdued. Bitcoin monthly returns (Source: Coinglass ) Since surpassing the $92,000 mark on Nov. 19 of 2024, Bitcoin has spent 65 out of 97 days trading between $92,000 and $100,000. Despite reaching new highs above its previous record of $74,000, Bitcoin’s price action in 2025 has been largely stagnant, with only a 1.97% increase since the beginning of the year. However, some analysts see this consolidation as a sign of progress. Bitcoin’s realized cap, which measures the value investors actually paid for their coins rather than their current market price, increased by $160 billion in the past three months. Sina G, co-founder of 21st Capital, described this as an influx of new net capital that indicates market growth despite price stagnation. The lack of price movement also contributed to lower network activity. Bitcoin researcher Axel Adler Jr. noticed that daily transfer volume dropped by 76%, while active wallet addresses declined by 74% over the past week. However, long-term holders are still quite resilient, with the coin days destroyed metric hitting a multi-year low. This suggests that investors are refraining from panic selling. For now, Bitcoin’s ability to stay above $95,000 is under increasing pressure. The asset experienced a sharp decline of 11.30% from $102,000 to $91,100 at the start of February, but has so far managed to close daily candles above $95,000 throughout the month. However, this support level has been tested about three times in the past week and is weakening, increasing the likelihood of Bitcoin dropping below $91,000 and potentially revisiting sub-$90,000 levels. Bitcoin’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Despite the announcement of Strategy’s recent acquisition of 20,356 BTC, Bitcoin still failed to see any meaningful recovery. Overall, market conditions are very fragile, with even spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund inflows drying up significantly. On Feb. 20, outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs reached $364 million, which also contributed to the lack of short-term buying pressure.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-25 06:11:41

A sharp spike in trading volume, which surged 75.57% to $143.57 billion, reflects heightened panic selling across the market. The Fear & Greed Index has dropped to 29, indicating a shift toward fear as investors react to broader economic concerns. Political Uncertainty Weighs Big on Crypto? Market sentiment was rattled by former U.S. President Donald Trump’s statement that import tariffs on Canada and Mexico will move forward.

This is the first time it has made a Bitcoin purchase since it halted its daily purchase plan on February 18. Currently, the Central American nation holds 6,088 BTC, which is equal to approximately $558 million at the current rate. The government of El Salvador earlier pledged to buy one Bitcoin per day, a policy that began in November 2022. The halt in purchases was witnessed right after a 40-month EFF arrangement with the International Monetary Fund or IMF. According to the agreement, which aims to achieve more than $3.5 billion in financial contributions, El Salvador had to make some modifications to the rules related to Bitcoins. Among these changes, the country made the acceptance of Bitcoin by private entities optional. However, they will be required to clear transactions in the legal tender of the country but have the freedom to use bitcoins. To meet these conditions, lawmakers enacted amendments to the Bitcoin law in January 2025. The IMF has always warned of the financial risks associated with El Salvador’s plans to use Bitcoin. In December 2024, the organization obtained a $1.4 billion loan from the country to scale back Bitcoin adoption. While earlier, it was thought that the IMF agreement would limit Bitcoin investments, El Salvador ramped up purchasing outside of its daily plan. In December 2024, the government added $1 million worth of Bitcoin to the reserve. On February 4, it bought 11 BTC for a value of more than $1 million. There has also been a more general change in policy. In March 2024, El Salvador’s president Nayib Bukele transferred Bitcoin holdings to a cold storage wallet, indicating a change of guard in the regulation. At the time, over $400 million worth of Bitcoin was held in El Salvador by 5,600 BTC. El Salvador’s market impact El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy involving the country’s adoption of Bitcoin as currency has influenced market sentiment, affecting Bitcoin’s volatility. The latest acquisition occurred after the price was below $95,000 due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement on tariffs. The sudden decline led to $950 million in liquidations across cryptocurrency platforms. At press time, Bitcoin traded around $91,000, down 4% in 24 hours. “El Salvador finally abandoned its failed experiment of using Bitcoin as legal tender. After two years, only 8% of Salvadorans used Bitcoin even once. If Bitcoin can’t function as a medium of exchange—the purpose for which it was created—what value does it have that can be stored?” – Peter Schiff. El Salvador became the first nation to legalize Bitcoin as a legal tender in September 2021, requiring companies to accept it as payment. The government bought its first Bitcoin in the same month in order to start adopting Bitcoin in the financial system. However, statistics reveal that the use of Bitcoin for transactions by the Salvadorans remains low despite its recognition.

The conference, and its 350+ side events held over the week, are estimated to have contributed HK$275m to the economy. Sold-out event highlights the conference’s success in bridging East-meets-West dialogue, with industry-altering announcements made throughout the week. HONG KONG, Feb. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ – Consensus Hong Kong, which took place between February 18 and 20, 2025, has officially wrapped up its sold-out debut. As the world’s biggest and longest-serving event series for critical conversations on Web3, digital assets, and blockchain, Consensus attracted nearly 10,000 in-person attendees, from 102 countries to Hong Kong, with a combined AUM for attendees estimated at more than US$4 trillion. The success of the event has garnered international attention, so much so that it has officially announced today that it will be returning to Asia again next year in 2026. The event’s arrival in Hong Kong coincided with several key regional milestones, with notable announcements during the week taking place, including: Hong Kong’s financial regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), unveiled a new road map with 12 initiatives designed to “future-proof” Hong Kong’s virtual asset ecosystem; Standard Chartered publicized its joint venture with Animoca Brands and Hong Kong Telecom (HKT) to seek a licence from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to issue a Hong Kong dollar-backed stablecoin. Other announcements came from Hex Trust, Robinhood, WisdomTree, Pundi AI, zkMe, and more. Bullish Group , the parent company of CoinDesk, announced that its Hong Kong digital asset trading business has received licensing approval from the SFC; Seventy-five percent of the nearly 10,000 in-person attendees traveled from overseas, driving up tourism in Hong Kong and bringing in an estimated HK$275m to the city. Over 450 media registered to report on the event and hear from over 300 high-caliber speakers from the Hong Kong government, Web3 regulators, and brands like Binance, Blockstream, Circle, Coinbase, Google, Pantera, Robinhood, and Solana Foundation. Supported by over 125 sponsors and over 160 community partners, including Auros, Hex Trust, TRON, Aptos, CoinW, Dimitra, First Digital, Genius, Zeebu, and many more, the team was able to fulfill its mission of making Consensus the most important platform for digital assets and Web3. In addition to the main conference line-up, over 350 side events took place over the course of the week in iconic Hong Kong venues. Cloud 39 at the Henderson, The Hong Kong Jockey Club, Wonderland (West Kowloon Cultural District) the Grand Hyatt, and Iron Fairies hosted special events, such as the opening Rooftop Revelry, Consensus Cup, Token of Love music festival, Crypto Fight Night and the Closing Party. Additional community-hosted side events took place in venues across the city including at Trilogy, Soho House, Popinjays, The Kerry Hotel, Luk Yu Tea House, Faye, K11, Dragon-I, Ozone, Cardinal Point, and dozens of others. Its signature experiences, including the Hackathon and PitchFest, drew tech talent from all over the world: Over 500 top developers – including from Thiel Fellows, and quants from top investment banks JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley – joined the two-day, in-person Hackathon run in partnership with EasyA. In total, 67 ground-breaking blockchain projects were launched to compete for more than US$400K in prizes and grants. There were six tracks at the Hackathon: Aptos, Ripple, MozaicNFT, Crust, Original Trail, and Polkadot, which were won respectively by ProfitX, Xeno, MozaicDot, MoME (Mixture of Multi-chain Experts) and Pix x Origintrail Telegram Bot. Over 400 of the world’s most promising early-stage Web3 start-ups attended, with 12 competing live onstage at CoinDesk PitchFest for investor attention. TransCrypts, a leader in digital identity and credentials, backed by Mark Cuban, GSR Ventures, and others emerged as the winner. The competition was judged by top investors from Spartan Ventures, Titan Fund, CMCC, Foresight Ventures, Animoca Brands, and more. Michael Lau, Chairman of Consensus Hong Kong, said, “Consensus Hong Kong was an overwhelming success. The combination of our nearly 10,000 in-person attendees and over 350 side events is independent validation proving our conference achieved incredible product-market fit. It is clear that the global Web3 industry has been asking for a truly world-class conference in Hong Kong for a while, and Consensus Hong Kong was the answer. Hong Kong has worked hard to strategically position itself as a forward-thinking digital assets hub with a vibrant ecosystem that fosters entrepreneurial spirits, so we hope to return again next year—at an even bigger scale.” Brad Spies, Managing Director of Consensus said, “Consensus has always had a laser focus on bringing together all of the different parts of the crypto ecosystem: traditional finance, DeFi traders, regulators, developers, entrepreneurs, investors, startups, academics, and artists.

Amid this, a top market analyst has highlighted key support zones for Ripple’s native asset while hinting towards a potential drop to $1.6. So, let’s take a quick tour of the current performance of the coin and see how it may perform in the near future. XRP Price Risks Falling To $1.6 The broader crypto market has witnessed gloomy trading today, with most of the top assets resting in the red. Amid this, XRP price slipped 9.4% and exchanged hands at $2.25, and its one-day trading volume jumped 139% to $8.33 billion. Notably, it’s worth noting that the crypto has dropped from its 24-hour high of $2.6. Besides, the Relative Strength Index of the asset is nearing the oversold condition, which might help in a strong recovery ahead. Furthermore, the waning risk-bet appetite of the investors is also evidenced by the dropping Futures Open Interest of the token by 15% to $3.18 billion. Ripple (XRP) Price What’s Next For Ripple (XRP) Price? As the XRP price took a hit, top market expert EGRAG CRYPTO has weighed in on the key support levels to watch. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, if XRP fails to hold its current support level, it may drop to $1.60. In a recent X post, EGRAG CRYPTO shared a price chart and highlighted the importance of the $2.30 level. “Our key focus now is not to drop below $2.30, as that could trigger a free fall to lower targets” he warned. Meanwhile, the expert also emphasized the potential for range-bound movement until a breakout occurs. He identified the following key levels: Closing below $2.30: Bearish Closing above $2.60: Bullish Closing above $2.85: Super Bullish Closing above $3.11: Heading towards all-time highs (ATH) and potentially setting new ones! Having said that, investors will be watching these levels closely as the XRP price continues to fluctuate. Source: EGRAG CRYPTO, X Market Trends & Other Factors Impacting Price The recent dip in XRP price comes despite a flurry of positive crypto market developments, especially Ripple. For context, Donald Trump has recently mentioned Ripple and XRP on the Truth Social platform, fueling market discussions. Besides, it also triggered speculations over the US XRP Reserve possibility , while adding fuel to the ongoing BTC vs XRP debate. Amid this, a top lawyer also commented on what lies ahead for the Bitcoin Vs Ripple war . However, despite these trends, it appears that the Ripple whales are trading cautiously amid the ongoing slump. For context, whales have offloaded more than 81 million coins to exchanges recently, which has further dragged down the asset’s price.

Thus, the cryptocurrency has lost over nine grand since Friday’s peak. The total value of liquidated positions is expectedly on the rise, surpassing the $1 billion mark. Naturally, long positions dominate. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Recall that the primary cryptocurrency was climbing steadily last Friday and tapped a weekly peak of $99,500 following positive news from Coinbase in regards to its two-year-long litigation against the SEC. However, the situation quickly changed after the largest hack in the cryptocurrency industry, in which over $1.4 billion, mostly in ETH, was siphoned off Bybit. BTC, alongside the rest of the market, reacted immediately with a price fall to $95,000. After a calm weekend spent at over $96,000, bitcoin took another minor hit on Monday and slipped to $94,000. The bears were not done yet as they initiated another substantial leg down on Tuesday morning that drove the cryptocurrency to a six-week low of just over $90,000 (for now). Consequently, this put BTC’s losses since Friday at over $9,000 even though many analysts have remained unfazed . As expected, the altcoins have it even worse. Massive double-digit price declines are evident from ETH, DOGE, SOL, LINK, ADA, XRP, XLM, AVAX, LTC, and many, many others. This enhanced volatility has resulted in a mindblowing value of liquidated positions on a daily scale, which is at just over $1 billion now. $950 million came from long positions, while the single-largest liquidations occurred on Binance and was worth $15 million. Over 310,000 traders have been wrecked in the past day, shows data from CoinGlass. Liquidation Heat Map.

The decline in DOGE price forced the closure of many long positions, leading to a drop in open interest. As bearish headwinds continue, can Dogecoin price recover, or is a crash to $0.10 imminent? At press time, DOGE trades at $0.21 after a 9% drop in 24 hours. The meme coin is now down by 40% in one month. Dogecoin Open Interest Hits 15-Week Low – Will Price Drop to $0.10? Data from Coinglass shows that Dogecoin’s open interest, which is the total number of open derivatives contracts, has fallen by 13% in 24 hours to $1.9 billion. This metric is now at the lowest level since November. Dogecoin Open Interest The decline in open interest may have been caused by a surge in long liquidations. This is because, in the last 24 hours, more than $27M long positions on DOGE were forcefully closed after the drastic price decline. When long traders are forced to close their positions, it causes the price to drop even further due to additional selling pressure. Going by past trends, Dogecoin price tends to rise when the open interest rises and falls when this metric declines. If derivative traders become hesitant and fail to open new positions causing the open interest to drop further, Dogecoin may likely drop to $0.10. DOGE Price Struggles as Bearish Headwinds Intensify Dogecoin price dropped to test a multi-month support level of $0.201 on Tuesday, marking the third time that it has tested this level since November. Buyers quickly stepped in to buy DOGE at this price, but the selling pressure is still strong. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the one-day chart shows that bears have the upper hand after falling to 27. An oversold RSI shows that the market is strongly bearish, and while it may signal a potential rebound due to seller exhaustion, the lack of a positive catalyst suggests that the bearish momentum may persist. DOGE/USDT: 1-day Chart The 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has also dropped below the 200-day EMA, which further reinforces the bearish thesis. If these bearish conditions continue, DOGE price may likely drop to $0.09. At the same time, key resistance lies at the 200-day EMA of $0.25. The hourly chart also portrayed a bearish Dogecoin price prediction after breaking below a symmetrical triangle pattern. According to trader Ali Charts, this breakout may lead to DOGE price breaching support of $0.201 and falling to $0.197. DOGE/USDT: 1H Chart Amid these bearish signals, it is likely that DOGE could extend the downtrend and fall to $0.10. However, if the broader market recovers, can Dogecoin’s trend reverse? Is a Dogecoin Price Recovery Looming? Despite the current bearish outlook, some analysts remain bullish on Dogecoin and anticipate that the price could recover if certain conditions are met. Per analyst Carl Moon, if Dogecoin can survive the current market conditions and successfully defend support, it may break out from a falling wedge pattern to target $0.44. DOGE/USDT: 1-day Chart The analyst pointed out similar breakouts from the past that preceded a rally. Nevertheless, a resumption of bullish trends is currently dependent on how the rest of the crypto market performs.

While analysts expect a reversal in March, the market-wide disruption is driving investors toward projects that are still flying under the radar but have shown incredible resilience during the most bearish weeks of Q1 2025. One such outlier is Rollblock (RBLK) , an up-and-coming crypto gaming gem that is already taking the market by storm with its revolutionary platform and bear-proof tokenomics. How Rollblock Redefines Crypto Gaming Rollblock is poised to disrupt Web3 gaming with its innovative framework that merges aspects of DeFi and online gaming. This approach could see Rollblock capture a huge portion of the $450 billion online gaming industry and emerge as one of the hottest plays of 2025. This cutting-edge GameFi platform leverages the tried and tested Ethereum blockchain to ensure quick transaction speeds across 20 major cryptocurrencies while removing any possibility of altering bets once placed. Security and transparency are at the forefront of Rollblock’s priorities, and the project has cemented this intention by securing a certificate from prominent crypto auditor SolidProof and a license from Anjouan Gaming. 7,000 games are immediately available, including all-time classics, such as poker and roulette, and even newer AI-powered additions. A sports betting platform has been recently introduced as well, further expanding Rollblock’s already massive offering. Moreover, through the highly lucrative revenue-sharing mechanism, Rollblock can also double as an investment vehicle, allowing holders to earn passive income through recurring staking rewards. This system is sustained by weekly buybacks of the RBLK token funded by the project’s own revenue. A set amount of these tokens will be burned, enhancing its stability and paving the way for scarcity-driven appreciation. Cardano Drops, But Support Appears Rock Solid February 24 saw red candles flood the charts across the board, with many cryptocurrencies experiencing steep declines. Cardano’s price also took a considerable hit, as it saw over 7% of its valuation evaporate as it revisited the $0.72 support. The 29% surge in volume shows growing market participation, and the Cardano order books are becoming a battleground between bears that are shorting ADA and bulls that are trying to scoop up the dip. Despite the short-term turbulence, Cardano’s future prospects are still decisively bullish according to analysts. Prominent crypto expert Dan Gambardello believes Cardano could realistically top between $5 and $10 during the 2025 cycle. He highlights that Cardano’s market cap surged from $1.22 billion in 2020 to over $101 billion in 2021. Key technical indicators, including an inverse head and shoulders pattern and Cardano’s position between critical moving averages, suggest a bullish setup similar to previous cycles. Furthermore, Gambardello also sees ADA’s inclusion in Bitwise’s top 10 index and Grayscale’s ETF filing as potential catalysts for massive institutional adoption. Why The RBLK Presale Could Be This Year’s Millionaire Maker Event With over $10 million raised in record time and more than 45,000 registrations, Rollblock’s presale is quickly becoming one of the hottest ICOs of the year. Analysts foresee gains of up to 800% before the official launch, making it a tempting investment at the price of $0.06. This is an ideal entry point for early bidders, especially with the limited-time 50% bonus on all RBLK purchases. This means that for every $1,000 invested, buyers will receive $1,500 worth of tokens. Don’t miss out! Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Edge oracles will independently verify the total dollar value of the USDe's reserves and the reserve coverage of USDe's supply and confirm that reserves are governance-approved and delta-neutral. Chaos Labs shared the announcement exclusively with CoinDesk. USDe, a synthetic stablecoin, maintains a soft peg with the U.S. dollar through an automated delta-hedging strategy that shorts bitcoin and ether perpetual futures to offset changes in the prices of these cryptocurrencies. The synthetic stablecoin experienced volatility over the weekend, falling to 0.982 against tether and 0.988 against USDC, per Kaiko, amid fears that the protocol has multi-million dollar exposure to Bybit's ether (ETH) derivatives market. The exchange was hacked late Friday , with a malicious entity draining over $1 billion in ether. The so-called de-peg, however, was short-lived as Ethena assured investors that all assets backing USDe were held off-exchange and its reserve fund was more than enough to compensate for any losses from the Bybit exploit. The integration with Chaos Labs adds another layer of credibility to USDe's reserves, ensuring they stay secure and transparent. The Edge Proof of Reserves (PoR) oracles will constantly monitor the reserve levels of tokens and check the collateral backing them. This is done by smoothly integrating off-chain data from custodians and centralized exchanges into the on-chain environment, ensuring scalable and robust support for institutional-grade applications. The integration also provides automated alerts to notify users of any data anomalies or if reserve levels fall below the required thresholds. Verified data is publicly displayed on Ethena’s transparency page and attestor interfaces, keeping stakeholders informed. ""This integration ensures continuous, independent verification of reserves, fostering greater transparency and security for all users. By leveraging real-time, tamper-resistant data, Ethena reinforces its commitment to a robust and reliable synthetic dollar,"" the announcement said. Chaos Labs' Edge oracle leverages zero-knowledge proofs to ensure security and privacy while providing real-time and transparent data verification, including for reserves held off-chain or across different blockchains. These oracles have secured over $70 billion in volume, delivering risk management to decentralized finance (DeFi) giants like AAVE, Jupiter, GMX, and Tether.",Tech|Ethena|Usde|Markets|Blockchain|Exclusive,EN,0,0,ENA|FIAT|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-25 07:36:34

Amid these declines and massive liquidation, a crypto trader lost $24M while swapping TRUMP tokens for USDC. In just a single transaction, the trader went from profits to losses. Let’s discuss how this happened. Crypto Trader Loses $24M in a Single Swap on TRUMP Token On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain X post revealed that a crypto trader had borne a $24M loss on the TRUMP token amid the Solana price crash. This happened as the trader swapped 763,582.605387 TRUMP for 9,483,807.865662 USDC, bearing heavy losses as the initial investment was $33.9M. Interestingly, the same crypto whale has engaged in several trades on this US President’s meme coin and even earned significant profits. The whale earned $11.8M earlier, so this swap seems part of the plan to liquidate the holdings due to the crypto market crash. Surprisingly, many other crypto investors are in the same boat and following a similar trajectory. Many crypto whales have begun mass-dumping their TRUMP and MELANIA tokens after their poor performance, impacting the broader market. Solana Price Plummets 12% Alongside Global Market Crash Solana is among the top cryptos to buy in the market and has performed impressively over the years, including in terms of adoption. However, the SOL token’s performance has been disappointing for some time, as it stalled and failed to cover the consolidation. Even now, the SOL price has crashed 12% as the Solana meme coins and the rest of the cryptos struggle. The entire crypto market is experiencing a significant downturn: Bitcoin dropped to $91.5k, DOGE dropped to $0.23, and the TRUMP meme coin price dropped 14% to $13.03. However, the bigger reason for the SOL token’s downtrend is the upcoming 11.2M SOL unlocks worth $1.7M on March 1 due to the FTX repayment plan. Solana currently trades at $140.47, with a market capitalization of $69.57B, also down significantly. However, its trading volume is up 219% to $8.68B, indicating increased network activity. Analyzing this with the Coinglass report reveals that whales and long-term holders are moving their holdings from exchange wallets, possibly hinting at accumulation. Final Thoughts: Crypto Trader’s $24M Loss Journey The crypto market is quite unpredictable and depends on various factors, but the volatility could bring a crash like today’s. With meme coins like TRUMP and others failing to overcome their losses, the entire market has moved to extreme fear. Its impact is clearly visible in the aforementioned crypto trader and the $24M loss. Another significant point to note is the impact of these meme coins’ decline on the Solana price performance , which has lost 12% of its value in the last 24 hours and 20% over the past week.

I also warned you that buying… pic.twitter.com/kEzj4NgvZv — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) February 24, 2025 Historic Market Behavior EGRAG CRYPTO’s analysis focuses on XRP/BTC historical price movements. The chart illustrates three past cycles where XRP experienced sharp upward movements but failed to consolidate in the upper range. In previous cycles, the price surged before entering a bear market, with minimal sustained consolidation at the higher levels. This time, however, XRP is showing a different trajectory. Instead of experiencing an immediate breakout, it establishes a structured consolidation pattern. This development suggests that the market is preparing for a more sustained rally rather than a short-lived surge followed by a downturn. Current Market Position and Key Support Levels XRP currently trades at 0.00002584 BTC, and the analysis identifies a critical range between 0.000023 BTC and 0.00003 BTC, where the asset is forming a strong support zone. This pattern is a significant shift because XRP has never built a solid foundation at this level in past cycles. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP is already rising against Ethereum , and the price action within this range is crucial in determining whether XRP will sustain bullish momentum against Bitcoin. The key downside level to watch is 0.000016 BTC. Falling below this threshold could signal a major bearish trend, making recovery more difficult. Conversely, maintaining a position above 0.000023 BTC would indicate continued strength, reinforcing the possibility of an eventual breakout. Breakout Confirmation and Potential Target Levels EGRAG CRYPTO highlights two primary confirmation levels that traders should monitor. A sustained close above 0.000024 BTC would suggest a bullish foundation is forming. More significantly, closing above 0.000034 BTC would confirm a major breakout, potentially setting the stage for substantial price gains. If this breakout occurs, the analysis projects target levels at 0.000046 BTC, 0.000136 BTC, and 0.00036 BTC. At current prices, this would push XRP’s value to $33.81, a 780.5% increase from its all-time high. Experts have predicted for years that Bitcoin will lose dominance against XRP . This upcoming breakout could kickstart that trend. EGRAG CRYPTO drew attention to previous statements where he warned that buying below $1 would become a thing of the past. The analyst emphasized that this could be the last opportunity for investors to accumulate XRP at these levels before a major move upward.

In a recent tweet, the analytics firm highlighted that the meme coin market capitalization is nearing its November 2024 levels. Such a trend effectively depicted the undoing of the surge witnessed during the winter “meme coin season.” Meme Coin Meltdown The OG meme coin – Dogecoin (DOGE) – which rallied from around $0.20 before the election to a multi-year high of almost $0.5 following Donald Trump’s victory on November 5, 2024, has since retraced most of its gains. It is currently trading at $0.20 after this morning’s market-wide crash. Next up was Shiba Inu (SHIB), which experienced a similar trajectory as it plunged from December’s peak of $0.000033 to $0.0000133 – lower than the pre-election levels. Additionally, Pepe’s (PEPE) price more than halved from $0.0000264 in December to $0.00000575, marking a 78% decline over two months. Bonk (BONK), too, mirrored this trend, crashing from a December high of $0.000054 to $0.0000125 by late February. FLOKI’s (FLOKI) price tumbled from $0.00027 in late November to $0.000077 as of February 24th. Notably, dogwifhat (WIF) experienced a dramatic drop, plummeting over 89% from $4.20 shortly after the election to $0.51 at the time of writing. Bitcoin and XRP Retain Strong Post-Election Gains Despite the broader market downturn, Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP have managed to hold their post-election gains, distinguishing themselves from the steep declines across the meme coin sector. Bitcoin was trading near $65,400 before the election results and soared above $109,000 in January. Although it has pulled back, the leading crypto asset remains strong, currently trading near $90,000 – still over 42% above its November level. Similarly, XRP climbed from $0.706 in early November to $3.33 in January. Despite a subsequent decline to $2.21, the token remains up by a whopping 245% since the election period. Its rally has been propelled by growing anticipation over XRP ETFs, especially after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recognized multiple filings in early February. However, it was Brazil that approved the world’s first spot XRP ETF. The fund, set to launch on the B3 exchange, will be managed by Hashdex with administrative support from Genial Investimentos. At the same time, the SEC is examining spot XRP ETF applications in the US from leading asset managers including 21Shares, Bitwise, Grayscale, and CoinShares. The divergence highlighted the trajectory maintained by established cryptocurrencies amidst heightened market volatility and profit-taking in speculative assets such as meme coins.

Here’s Why Investors Are Watching Closely,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pepeto-the-next-100x-meme-coin-heres-why-investors-are-watching-closely/,"Meme coins have completely changed the game in crypto investing, proving that early adopters can see massive gains. Shiba Inu’s legendary 1000x surge turned a modest investment into millions, and Pepe Token’s rise to a $1.65 billion market cap showed how powerful meme-driven momentum can be. But with these tokens now well-established, their potential for another explosive breakout is limited—leading investors to search for the next big opportunity. Many now believe that Pepeto is the one to watch. Elon Musk Sparks the Frog Meme Coin Trend Elon Musk has always had the ability to shift market narratives, and his latest move—changing his X profile picture to a frog—has strengthened the belief that frog-themed meme coins are the next major trend. The rise of Pepe Unchained and Wall Street Pepe further supports this momentum, proving that frogs are dominating the meme coin space in 2025. In the past, Musk’s influence has sent Dogecoin and Floki skyrocketing, and with frogs now in focus, investors are scrambling to find the next high-growth token. What Makes Pepeto Different? Unlike meme coins that rely purely on hype and speculation, Pepeto brings real utility to the table. It powers PepetoSwap, a zero-fee decentralized exchange that only lists verified, scam-free projects, offering investors a safe and transparent trading experience. In addition, its cross-chain bridge technology allows seamless movement of assets between blockchains, making Pepeto more than just a meme—it’s a functional crypto asset. Why Pepeto Could See Explosive Growth The best investment opportunities come before mass adoption, and Pepeto is still in its presale phase, giving early buyers a chance to get in before the hype takes off. Once PepetoSwap launches, traders will flock to an exchange that eliminates fees and ensures security, driving up demand for Pepeto. Higher trading volume means greater scarcity, leading to price increases.

Recently, speculation intensified over whether the SEC would proceed with its appeal against the ruling on XRP’s programmatic sales. This uncertainty was heightened by the SEC’s abrupt dismissal of its case against Coinbase (COIN), leading many to wonder if a similar retreat in the Ripple lawsuit was imminent. However, Ripple’s case presents challenges that could complicate the SEC’s strategy. Adding another layer of intrigue, a recent Office of Inspector General (OIG) investigation has brought to light potential conflicts of interest within the SEC. Reports indicate that former SEC Chair Gary Gensler withheld the findings before stepping down. Since then, Acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce have remained silent, fueling speculation that the report contains damning evidence of regulatory misconduct. If these findings confirm bias in the SEC’s handling of cryptocurrency cases, it could dramatically impact the agency’s approach to the Ripple lawsuit. OIG Investigation Uncovers Possible SEC Bias The non-profit watchdog group Empower Oversight (EO) first raised concerns over potential conflicts of interest within the SEC, prompting the OIG to launch an investigation. At the center of the controversy is former SEC Director of Corporation Finance Bill Hinman, whose actions and affiliations have raised red flags regarding possible favoritism in crypto regulation. William Hinman’s 2018 speech was a landmark moment. In it, he stated that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) did not qualify as securities, significantly influencing how the market views these cryptocurrencies. However, his close ties to the law firm Simpson Thacher—part of a group that actively promoted Ethereum—have led to accusations of bias. While serving at the SEC, Hinman reportedly continued interacting with Simpson Thacher despite explicit warnings from the agency’s Ethics Division. More concerning are allegations that he received millions of dollars in financial benefits from the firm during his tenure there. After leaving the agency, he rejoined Simpson Thacher, further deepening concerns over potential conflicts of interest. These revelations could significantly affect the SEC’s credibility, especially if the OIG report confirms unethical conduct. Proof of this would undermine the legitimacy of the SEC’s enforcement actions against Ripple and other crypto firms. The agency’s failure to provide transparency has prompted EO and Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett to file Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests seeking the full OIG report. However, with the SEC refusing to release the findings, EO has taken legal action to force disclosure. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple Case and XRP’s Market Prospects With the Ripple lawsuit hanging in the balance, XRP’s price has reacted to market uncertainty. As of report time, XRP is trading at $2.15, reflecting a 13.55% decline within a day. The broader crypto market also edged lower by 0.08%, bringing its total valuation to $3.14 trillion. Despite these fluctuations, XRP remains well below its January 16 peak of $3.3999 and its all-time high of $3.84 set in 2018. Several factors will influence its price trajectory in the coming weeks: SEC’s Appeal Decision: If the SEC withdraws its appeal, it could signal a major victory for Ripple, potentially pushing XRP beyond its all-time high of $3.84. However, if the legal battle drags on, prices could struggle to surpass $1.50. ETF Developments: Approving an XRP-spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) could drive institutional interest and propel prices toward $5 . With mounting pressure for the SEC to disclose the OIG findings and growing doubts about its legal standing, the next phase of the Ripple lawsuit could be more unpredictable than ever. If the investigation exposes misconduct, it could reshape the case and alter the regulatory landscape for the entire crypto industry.

Industry members have met with the SEC over spot ETF approvals and enforcement approaches. XRP has crashed 8% in the past days but investors can expect a rebound if XRP ETF is approved. The long-running battle between Ripple Labs and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been key for XRP’s market moves. XRP’s price action largely depends on the resolution of the lawsuit and the approval of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. American exchange Coinbase recently announced that the SEC was close to dismissing its lawsuit against the exchange. This action is similar to the SEC’s recent decision to drop its case against OpenSea, a leading NFT marketplace. SEC Enforcement Approach “Changing” Furthermore, the SEC has closed its investigation into Robinhood Crypto, signaling a notable change in the agency’s approach to enforcement. While Kraken and Uniswap still face potential lawsuits, the general trend suggests the SEC may be pulling back from its aggressive regulatory stance against major crypto firms.

Many investors want to know what the price of DOGE will be when February 2025 arrives. One Dogecoin is selling at $0.2593; if technical data is to be taken at face value, it might drop over the next weeks. Changelly thinks the price will fall by -2.82% to reach that level by February 9th, 2025, if experts project an average trade price of $0.236. Dogecoin’s predicted February price range runs from a low of $0.216 to a high of $0.255. With 71% of indicators showing a negative view and the Dread & Greed Index scoring 44, suggesting general investor dread, the market attitude seems pessimistic. Dogecoin has seen 40% positive trading days over the past 30 days; nevertheless, its 50-day moving average is still declining, indicating temporary weakness. Furthermore, the 200-day moving average has declined since early February, underlining a long-term trend. These elements make Dogecoin’s possibility of a significant February surge doubtful, forcing investors to look for other cheap cryptocurrencies that match its prior performance. Dogecoin 7 days price change | Source: Changelly Which Cheap Crypto Below $1 Will Be 2025’s DOGE? Though Dogecoin’s future is unknown, investors seek the next great prospect among low-priced cryptocurrencies. Rexas Finance (RXS) is one especially strong possibility attracting much interest.

Here’s Why It’s Gaining Attention,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/is-pepeto-the-next-100x-meme-coin-heres-why-its-gaining-attention/,"Meme coins have proven their ability to turn small investments into massive gains, but only for those who catch the wave early. Shiba Inu’s historic 1000x surge and Pepe Token’s rise to a $1.65 billion market cap made early adopters rich, but with these coins now well-established, investors are hunting for the next big opportunity. Many believe Pepeto could be that next explosive token. Elon Musk & The Rise of Frog Meme Coins Elon Musk has a long history of influencing crypto markets, and his recent X profile update featuring a frog has added fuel to the growing frog-themed meme coin movement. Following this, tokens like Pepe Unchained and Wall Street Pepe have started gaining momentum, signaling a new trend taking shape. We’ve seen how Musk’s backing helped Dogecoin and Floki explode, and now frog coins could be next in line for massive growth. What Makes Pepeto Different? Unlike meme coins that rely only on social media hype, Pepeto brings real utility. It powers PepetoSwap, a zero-fee exchange built to list only safe, verified projects, making it one of the few platforms tackling scams and rug pulls in the space. Additionally, its cross-chain capabilities allow users to move assets easily across different blockchains, giving Pepeto real-world use beyond just being a meme. Why Pepeto’s Price Could Skyrocket The best time to invest in a meme coin is before the hype reaches the masses, and Pepeto is still in its presale phase. With PepetoSwap set to launch soon, demand for the token is expected to surge, attracting traders looking for a zero-fee and secure trading experience. As volume increases, so does scarcity, which could drive Pepeto’s price to new heights. With frog season in full effect, Pepeto is emerging as one of the strongest meme coin contenders of 2025. The question is: will you get in before it takes off?

This time, American rapper, designer, and entrepreneur Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, is the one who is preparing to try his luck in the meme coin sector – which is already a highly saturated market. He was supposed to launch his meme coin, named YZY, on February 20. But the launch was postponed to an undisclosed date. He is facing serious criticisms for his anti-Semitic statements. The big question is: Will Ye ever launch YZY? A polymarket bet predicts that there is only a 36% probability that Ye will launch a meme coin before the end of this month. Let’s analyse the entire scenario in depth! Ready? BREAKING It’s confirmed, Kanye West is launching his memecoin next week. I will be the first to share it, turn on notis. pic.twitter.com/9odJltWVRX — Crypto Beast (@cryptobeastreal) February 22, 2025 YZY Coin and Its Purpose YZY is designed as a meme coin, similar to Dogecoin . Unlike most meme coins, Ye’s meme coin will have some utility. It will function as the official currency of the Yeezy brand and website. This means that this token will be accepted as payment on the Yeezy webitse. Why Is Kanye Turning to Crypto? Actually, it was when Ye’s pro-Nazi stance brought his business empire to a situation of partial collapse that the rapper entered the crypto industry to prevent his empire from falling into the pit of total collapse. Since 2022, the year when he publicly expressed his respect towards Adolf Hitler, his business relationship with top brands like Adidas and Baleciaga has slowly weakened. At one point, even his talent agency detached its tie with him. Embracing the crypto industry is expected to give him an opportunity to create an alternative to mainstream platforms. Ye’s YZY: Tokenomics and Allocation According to sources, at least 70% of the tokens of YZY will be owned by Ye, nearly 20% will be released for investors, and around 10% will be earmarked for the liquidity purpose of the YZY market. It appears that the YZY market aims to follow the same tokenomics pattern as Dogecoin – the topmost meme coin by market cap. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Crash: XRP, ADA and Other Top Altcoins To Buy As BTC Dips Below $91000 , Will YZY Ever be Launched? It is doubtful whether it is the right time to release a meme coin. Except the striking success of TRUMP – a meme coin released by the family of US President Donald Trump, not many celebrity meme coins have experienced success in the recent history of the meme coin market. The collapse of LIBRA , a meme coin based by Argentina president Javier Milei, is the latest of the depressing failures the market has witnessed in its recent history.

As Bitcoin's price dropped, the market saw nearly a billion dollars wiped out, highlighting how macroeconomic policies are increasingly influencing digital assets. Trump confirmed that tariffs on Canada and Mexico were proceeding as planned, stating that the U.S. had been treated unfairly by its trade partners. His remarks triggered a sell-off in the crypto market, causing a steep decline in Bitcoin and other digital assets. This is not the first time tariffs have affected the market, as a similar event earlier this year led to even larger losses. Bitcoin’s reaction underscores its growing sensitivity to economic policies. As market uncertainty grew, many traders saw their positions liquidated, with the majority being long positions. Investors who had anticipated a price rise were caught off guard by the sudden drop. Despite the market turmoil, some investors viewed the dip as a buying opportunity. Michael Saylor and Robert Kiyosaki encouraged traders to accumulate Bitcoin during the downturn, calling it a chance to invest at lower prices amid economic uncertainty. This perspective aligns with a broader sentiment that Bitcoin remains a long-term asset despite short-term fluctuations. Meanwhile, some analysts pointed out that Trump’s policies have erased a significant portion of the crypto market’s value since the beginning of his second term. The connection between regulatory decisions and price action continues to shape investor sentiment, reinforcing how external events impact digital assets. Looking ahead, market participants remain watchful for further policy changes that could drive volatility. While the tariff announcement triggered a sharp decline, a potential policy shift or easing of trade tensions could lead to a rebound. As global economic factors play a larger role in the crypto landscape, traders and investors must navigate an increasingly complex environment.",,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-25 07:51:49

In his post, the SBF account discussed the company's layoffs and management issues. SBF published a series of 10 tweets about the layoffs, referencing Elon Musk's efforts to have federal employees email their work activities last week or risk resigning. “Firing people is one of the hardest things in the world. It’s bad for everyone involved. More often, the problem is that the company doesn’t have the right job for them. “I would tell anyone we laid off: It was our fault because we didn't provide the right role for them, the right person to manage them or the right work environment for them.” Following this post by SBF, FTT briefly rose by over 29%. A source told Coindesk that SBF does not have direct access to sites like X or email, but can send messages through the Corrlinks system, which allows prisoners in the US to communicate with others. However, it is not yet clear who tweeted on behalf of Sam Bankman-Fried. Trump Pardoned, I Joined DOGE! SBF's posting after 2 years also prompted scammers to take action, and a fake SBF account claimed that he was pardoned by US President Donald Trump and joined DOGE. The fake SBF account later announced that a memecoin had been mined along with a related contract address. The account was then given a grey verification X, indicating that the account belongs to a government or multilateral organization. This indicates that there has been clear identity and information fraud associated with the account. Bankman-Fried is serving a 25-year sentence after being convicted in November 2023 on seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. He is currently being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn while his attorneys appeal his conviction. *This is not investment advice.

GOP divisions have led to unexpected setbacks, raising doubts about whether these bills can gain momentum. Over the past few months, nearly 30 states have introduced legislation to add Bitcoin to state reserves, aiming to use it as a hedge against inflation. Industry experts believe that successful approvals could trigger billions in acquisitions, increasing demand for Bitcoin as its supply continues to shrink. However, momentum has stalled as Republican lawmakers have increasingly voted against these measures. Montana’s House of Representatives recently rejected a Bitcoin Reserve proposal, with a significant number of Republicans voting against it . In North Dakota, opposition was even stronger despite the state’s conservative leanings. Wyoming, known for its pro-crypto stance and home to Senator Cynthia Lummis , also saw a Bitcoin Reserve bill fail. These rejections indicate that not all Republicans are aligned with Donald Trump’s vision for digital asset reserves. During his campaign, Trump expressed support for a national Bitcoin Reserve and later signed an executive order to explore digital asset stockpiling. However, state-level opposition within his own party could hinder efforts to advance this initiative. If Republicans continue to block these bills, the project may struggle to gain traction. Other states are experiencing similar resistance. While Utah advanced a proposal, Texas has seen increasing debate. The state’s Lieutenant Governor has labeled the initiative a key priority, but critics argue it poses risks to taxpayer funds. Media outlets have also raised concerns, questioning whether public money should be used to support crypto investments. Despite these obstacles, the crypto industry remains committed to pushing for Bitcoin Reserve legislation. Advocates are prepared to invest political capital into lobbying efforts, making this an important test of the industry’s influence within the GOP and Congress .

The company stated that cooperation with regulators was a priority and that this matter is now behind them. As part of the agreement, OKX will pay a fine and forfeit user fees , ensuring it meets regulatory expectations. Despite the settlement, the DoJ's stance on crypto remains strict , with officials describing OKX’s past actions as “flagrant violations” and “blatant disregard.” While other agencies, like the SEC , have recently dropped lawsuits against Coinbase and OpenSea, the DoJ continues to enforce penalties on major exchanges. For OKX, the settlement is a costly but strategic move. With strong financial reserves and billions in annual revenue, the exchange can absorb the penalty while improving its regulatory standing.

Though many believe that the Ripple vs SEC case settlement is imminent, legal experts like MetaLawMan warn of a possible delay in the case. Let’s unveil the possible reasons for the US SEC’s delay in the XRP lawsuit resolution through the eyes of experts and industry leaders. Why the US SEC is Delaying the XRP Lawsuit? Under President Donald Trump’s administration, the SEC is taking a crypto-friendly stance to foster industry growth in the country. This shift is marked by advancements in ETFs and resolutions in lawsuits, fostering optimism among investors and industry players. Despite this positive stance, the imminent settlement of the XRP lawsuit remains uncertain, as noted by lawyer MetaLawMan. In a recent X post , lawyer James Murphy, known on X as MetaLawMan, sounded a cautious note on the potential delay in the SEC’s settlement of the XRP lawsuit. While the SEC reportedly closed its investigation into Robinhood , speculation surrounds a potential early conclusion to the Ripple vs SEC case. However, MetaLawMan suggested that a resolution for Ripple may not be imminent, placing it behind Gemini, Kraken, and Binance in terms of potential lawsuit outcomes. Unveiling the Complexities Surrounding Ripple vs SEC Previously, MetaLawMan suggested that the XRP lawsuit could be settled before Ripple files its appellate brief on April 16, 2025. The lawyer’s statement rules out the possibility of a swift resolution. Notably, the lawyer bases his assumptions on the complexities surrounding the Ripple vs SEC case. One of the key factors leading to the delay is Judge Analisa Torres’ XRP judgment and Ripple’s $125 million penalty. Reiterating his previous statements, MetaLawMan posited in his recent post, The only reason I list Ripple last is the complexity involved in negotiating a resolution. Ripple is the only live crypto case with a final judgment in place. So, the SEC & Ripple lawyers must negotiate what to do about the judgment & the money escrowed for that judgment. That takes time. Conflicts of Interest: A Surprising Turn Reportedly, US government insider Empower Oversight (EO) has raised concerns over the potential conflicts of interest within the SEC. In particular, EO alleged that Bill Hinman, the former SEC Director, was biased against Ripple and XRP. This view arises from Hinman’s classification of Bitcoin and Ethereum as the only non-securities. Significantly, the Hinman controversy revolves around his ties to the law firm Simpson Thatcher which has connections to Ethereum. EO alleged that Hinman received millions from the law firm for classifying Ethereum as a non-security. Despite warnings, Hinman continued meeting with Simpson Thacher employees, raising concerns about conflicts of interest. If the Office of the Inspector General confirms conflicts of interest, the SEC may face increased pressure to withdraw its appeal. This could significantly be influencing the ongoing XRP lawsuit. How Will Coinbase and Robinhood Cases Impact XRP Lawsuit? In a surprising development, the SEC dismissed charges against Coinbase and terminated its investigation into Robinhood. Additionally, the SEC acknowledged XRP ETF applications submitted by various investment firms including Grayscale, CoinShares, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and Bitwise. This marks a significant shift from the agency’s previous “regulation by enforcement” moves. Though the regulator’s recent moves have sparked optimism, uncertainty still surrounds the resolution of the XRP lawsuit. Lawyer Jeremy Hogan is optimistic that the Ripple lawsuit will conclude by April or May, ahead of a potential US SEC approval for an XRP ETF.

With the constant pull in Bitcoin prices after January’s $108K show, major investors pull their money out of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. On Feb. 24, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $517 million in outflows—the biggest in seven weeks as per data . This marks the fifth straight day of withdrawals, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) losing $159 million and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund seeing $247 million in outflows. Other funds like Bitwise, Invesco, and Grayscale saw big withdrawals, pushing Bitcoin down over 5% to $91K, then further to $89,175, dropping 2.25% in the last hour. Hold or Sell? Blaming Trump’s tariff policy changes, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes warns that Bitcoin could drop to $70,000 as hedge funds unwind their positions. Many of these funds invested in Bitcoin ETFs while betting against Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). This strategy called a “basis trade,” helped them earn profits with minimal risk by taking advantage of the price gap between spot Bitcoin ETFs and futures contracts. However, as Bitcoin’s price drops, hedge funds see reduced profits and are exiting by selling ETF shares and buying back CME futures. Hayes expects this to continue during U.S. trading hours, adding more pressure to Bitcoin. Hayes believes this will continue during U.S. trading hours, adding more pressure to Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin Could Drop to $70,000 Hayes predicts that this selling could send Bitcoin down to $70,000. When hedge funds exit in large numbers, it creates a chain reaction—more selling leads to lower prices, which forces other funds to do the same, making the decline even worse. According to Markus Thielen from 10x Research , much of the demand for Bitcoin ETFs came from hedge funds playing this arbitrage trade rather than long-term investors. Now that these funds are pulling out, Bitcoin’s price is reacting to the sudden lack of demand. If the futures premium drops further, more funds could be forced to sell their ETF shares and buy back their shorted futures, driving Bitcoin even lower. Bitcoin at a Turning Point Bitcoin surged past $100,000 after Trump’s election victory fueled hopes of a Bitcoin strategic reserve. But with ETF investors leaving and hedge funds exiting their trades, Bitcoin is struggling to stay strong. If new buyers don’t step in, Hayes’ warning of Bitcoin dropping to $70,000 could become a reality. The market is rooting for new ETFs at this moment to bring fresh capital into the system to the recover from downmarket.

The SEC's formation of a new digital asset task force highlights a transition from enforcement-driven regulation to clearer guidelines, aiming to foster innovation while maintaining market integrity. Lummis’s proposal for a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve — envisioning the acquisition of 1 million bitcoins — could position the country as a global leader in digital asset adoption and financial innovation. By Christopher Gannatti, CFA Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) is now at the forefront of a groundbreaking moment in U.S. financial policy. As the newly appointed chair of the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets, she takes a pivotal role in shaping how America approaches cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. This move signals Washington's recognition of digital assets as not just a financial tool but a transformative force. When exploring the rich and multifaceted history of the Senate Banking Committee, 1 a closer examination reveals not just the structure of the institution but the essence of its role in shaping the modern financial landscape. Since its formal establishment in 1913, the committee has been a cornerstone of American economic governance, with Senator Robert Owen of Oklahoma serving as its inaugural chairman. This pivotal body has evolved alongside the nation's economic demands, steering policies that define monetary stability, housing accessibility and global financial relations. The Big Picture: Committee's Core Responsibilities At its heart, the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee functions as a guardian of the financial system. Its jurisdiction spans a strikingly broad array of critical sectors: Banking and Financial Institutions: Encompassing the regulatory oversight of banks, credit unions and financial services — the backbone of daily economic life. Federal Monetary Policy: Steering the levers of inflation, employment and economic growth through collaboration with the Federal Reserve. Housing and Urban Development: Addressing the fundamental human need for affordable housing and sustainable urban spaces. Mass Transit and Community Development: Building frameworks that connect people to opportunities, particularly in underserved areas. International Trade and Finance: Navigating the complexities of global markets and America's position within them. Economic Policy: Crafting legislation that influences everything from personal prosperity to national competitiveness. Subcommittees: The Engines of Focused Impact Given the vast purview of the committee, the work is divided among six specialized subcommittees, each with its own mission and legislative focus: Economic Policy: A realm where big questions about growth, price stability and employment are tackled. Think Federal Reserve dynamics and macroeconomic levers. Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection: The watchdogs of financial stability, overseeing deposit insurance, banks, credit unions and the regulatory agencies that keep them in check — entities like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ((OCC)) and National Credit Union Association (NCUA). Housing, Transportation, and Community Development: A vision for equitable urban spaces, focusing on mass transit systems, community development and affordable housing initiatives. National Security and International Trade and Finance: The nexus of global finance and security, from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to export controls and international economic policies. Securities, Insurance, and Investment: The gatekeepers of capital markets and securities — oversight here ensures trust in the markets that fuel entrepreneurship and growth. Digital Assets: A newly established subcommittee reflecting the committee's adaptability to emerging financial innovations. This subcommittee focuses on the regulation of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies, the development of blockchain technology and the oversight of fintech innovations, ensuring these technologies are integrated into the financial system responsibly and equitably. A Committee Rooted in Context, Yet Future-Focused Understanding the Senate Banking Committee is as much about looking back as it is about looking forward. Its origins are steeped in the regulatory demands of a post-industrial economy, yet its modern focus includes questions of cryptocurrency, fintech innovation and climate finance. This duality makes it one of the most consequential bodies in the Senate. A Clear Mission in a Complex Landscape The creation of this subcommittee under the Senate Banking Committee isn't just a formality; it's a declaration. The mission? To strike the balance between fostering innovation and protecting consumers in an increasingly complex digital economy. The priorities are clear: 1 Market Structure: Establishing a robust framework for cryptocurrency markets that welcomes innovation without sacrificing stability. Stablecoin Regulation: Addressing the rise of stablecoins with clear rules that mitigate risks and enhance trust. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: Assessing the feasibility of a national bitcoin reserve — an idea uniquely championed by Senator Lummis. Lummis's Vision: Innovation Meets Strategy Known colloquially as the ""crypto queen"" of Capitol Hill, Senator Lummis has long advocated for integrating digital assets into the U.S. financial fabric. Her proposal for a strategic bitcoin reserve — envisioning the acquisition of 1 million bitcoins over five years — is as audacious as it is strategic. 2 It's not just about owning digital gold; it's about positioning the United States as the leading innovator in the financial world. A Broader Push for Common Sense In a Republican-led Congress, there's a renewed focus on creating regulatory frameworks that encourage domestic innovation. Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott (R-SC) summed it up: Innovation must happen on American soil, not overseas. This isn't just rhetoric; it's a policy direction aimed squarely at making the U.S. a hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. 3 The Security and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) Latest Digital Asset Task Force: A Pivotal Moment in Regulation There are moments in history where the regulatory landscape shifts decisively, and 2025 appears to be such a moment for digital assets. Recently, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced the formation of a new task force dedicated to digital assets. This initiative is more than just another bureaucratic response — it's a clear sign that the SEC recognizes the pivotal role cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies will play in the global economy. A Shift in Strategy: From Enforcement to Clarity For years, the SEC has relied on enforcement actions to regulate the nascent digital asset sector. This approach — while effective at curbing bad actors — created uncertainty for innovators and investors alike. Imagine trying to build a skyscraper without knowing whether zoning laws would allow it. Such ambiguity stifles progress. Enter the SEC's new task force. Led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, this initiative aims to provide clear guidelines for market participants. 4 It's an ambitious plan that includes defining regulatory boundaries, creating feasible pathways for token registration and crafting disclosure frameworks tailored to digital assets. This shift signals the agency's willingness to engage with the crypto community instead of simply policing it. Why Now? Several forces are converging to make this the perfect time for regulatory clarity. First, the scale of adoption is undeniable. What was once the realm of tech enthusiasts has entered the portfolios of pension funds 5 and Fortune 500 treasuries. 6 Second, the global competition is heating up. Jurisdictions like Singapore, Switzerland and the UAE have established crypto-friendly regulations, 7 creating a competitive imperative for the U.S. to avoid falling behind. Third, the federal government itself is moving. A recent executive order from President Trump established a working group to explore a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, including the potential creation of a national digital asset stockpile. 8 This broader policy direction underscores that Washington views digital assets not just as financial tools but as strategic assets. The Stakes This isn't just about Bitcoin or Ethereum. It's about the infrastructure of the future. Tokenized real estate, decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain tracking — these are industries that will redefine the economic landscape. Regulatory clarity will be the foundation upon which these innovations are built. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve: A Game-Changer? A U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve isn't just a bold idea; it's a policy lever with enormous implications. By leveraging federal resources to hold bitcoin, the United States could: Hedge against global economic uncertainties. Establish a benchmark for integrating digital assets into national reserves. Influence global cryptocurrency markets with a strategic advantage. The numbers are intriguing. The U.S. government already holds more than 200,000 bitcoins, largely seized through law enforcement efforts like the infamous Silk Road case. 9 The recent presidential pardon of Ross Ulbricht, Silk Road's founder, adds a fascinating twist to this narrative. 10 His release reignites debates about the ethical and legal dimensions of these seizures while also highlighting the practical value of these assets. Folding these holdings into a formal reserve strategy could turn past law enforcement actions into future financial advantages. Final Thoughts Under Senator Lummis's leadership, the Senate Banking Subcommittee on Digital Assets is poised to take the United States into uncharted territory. This isn't just about regulating digital assets; it's about embracing their transformative potential. In the years to come, this subcommittee may well define the rules of the game for a financial revolution — ensuring that the United States leads not just in policy but in vision. In the journey that we expect to see in this space in 2025, this is a big, early step in the first days of the second Trump administration.

The firm sees this as a strategic move, leveraging the current regulatory climate to establish itself in the industry. However, not everyone in the crypto community welcomes its involvement. Citadel, a well-known market maker with significant assets under management, has monitored crypto trends for years. After investing in ETFs , the firm is now seeking approval from major crypto exchanges to facilitate market liquidity. With a pro-crypto shift in government policies, Citadel is positioning itself to capitalize on the industry’s growth. Despite this, many traders remain skeptical due to Citadel’s controversial past. The firm played a key role in the 2021 GameStop short squeeze , influencing trading restrictions on platforms like Robinhood . This history has led to backlash from retail investors, who see Citadel as a symbol of market manipulation. If approved by exchanges, Citadel plans to expand its operations beyond the U.S., focusing on Southeast Asia and other global markets. The firm has been actively laying the groundwork for international growth, signaling its long-term commitment to crypto. The potential impact of Citadel’s entry into crypto is uncertain.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 148,300 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin is currently testing whether support at around $90,000 will hold. According to the crypto strategist, he expects Bitcoin to mimic its late 2024 price action when it plunged to the 0.382 Fibonacci level before sparking a massive move up. “As expected BTC local lows being re-tested… I haven’t seen that larger washout yet into the lower Fibonacci level that I’m also looking for.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that BTC will fall to around $80,000. Zooming out, Dave the Wave says he’s keeping a close watch on the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator on the weekly chart. The MACD is a widely used indicator to identify an asset’s current trend. According to the trader, BTC’s MACD on the weekly timeframe will hit the zero line level to reset en route to tapping the 0.382 Fibonacci level. “Technically superb BTC price action in this current bull market. Something like an April low on the basis of this.” Source: Dave the Wave/X But while Dave the Wave is bearish on the prospects of BTC in the coming months, he believes that the deep drawdown will set the stage for a Bitcoin rally to around $180,000 by the end of the year. “Why complicate things?” Source: Dave the Wave/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading $91,529.

The company, led by Michael Saylor , continues to expand its holdings, reinforcing its position as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin investors. The latest acquisition follows a $2 billion stock offering , with proceeds directed toward increasing Bitcoin reserves. While this aggressive strategy reflects long-term confidence in digital assets, the company’s stock has underperformed in recent months. Despite steady accumulation, MSTR shares have dropped, raising concerns about the financial risks tied to Bitcoin’s price volatility. Saylor’s strategy has been consistent—using capital from stock sales to fund Bitcoin purchases. However, market conditions have presented challenges. Bitcoin's price weakness has impacted both the cryptocurrency and Strategy’s stock performance, making some investors cautious about the firm’s financial stability. In addition to stock offerings, Strategy has introduced new financial products, such as perpetual securities, to diversify its capital-raising approach. Institutional investors, including BlackRock, now hold a portion of the company’s shares, underscoring the scale of these transactions. Some analysts speculate that these large Bitcoin acquisitions could create tax complexities, but Saylor remains focused on long-term growth. Looking ahead, Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has continued to decline, suggesting a potential supply shock in the future. If Bitcoin enters another bullish phase, Strategy’s aggressive accumulation could pay off. However, the company’s reliance on stock sales raises questions about sustainability, especially if bearish conditions persist.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-02-25 08:04:40

Right now, the needle is pointing firmly towards ‘worrying’. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a key indicator of market sentiment, has just plummeted to its lowest level since September 2024, signaling a significant shift in investor mood. But what exactly does this mean for you and your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive into the details and understand what’s driving this wave of fear in the crypto sphere. Understanding the Crypto Fear and Greed Index: A Sentiment Thermometer Think of the Crypto Fear and Greed Index as a sentiment thermometer for the digital asset market. It’s not about predicting the future price of Bitcoin or Ethereum, but rather gauging the overall emotions and attitudes of crypto investors. Developed by Alternative.me, this index aggregates various data points to provide a simple, easy-to-understand score ranging from 0 to 100. Here’s a quick breakdown: 0-25: Extreme Fear – This zone suggests investors are excessively worried, potentially leading to panic selling and suppressed prices. Historically, some see this as a potential buying opportunity, as fear can drive prices below intrinsic value. 26-49: Fear – Indicates a cautious market sentiment where investors are apprehensive and risk-averse. 50: Neutral – Represents a balanced market sentiment with neither strong fear nor greed dominating. 51-75: Greed – Signals increasing optimism and confidence in the market, potentially leading to increased buying pressure and rising prices. 76-100: Extreme Greed – Suggests excessive market exuberance, often seen as a potential bubble territory. Historically, extreme greed can precede market corrections. Currently, the index stands at a chilling 25, firmly in the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. This marks a significant 24-point drop from the previous day and the lowest reading since September 6, 2024, when it touched 22. This rapid descent from ‘Neutral’ territory highlights a dramatic shift in crypto market sentiment . Decoding the Index: What Factors Fuel Fear? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index isn’t just a random number generator. It’s calculated using a weighted average of six key market indicators, providing a holistic view of market emotions. Let’s break down these components: Volatility (25%) : Measures the current and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often breeds fear as investors become uncertain about price stability. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Analyzes Bitcoin’s market momentum and trading volume compared to recent averages. Weakening momentum or declining volume can indicate waning investor interest and growing fear. Social Media (15%) : Tracks sentiment on social media platforms, primarily Twitter and Reddit, using sentiment analysis tools. Negative sentiment online can reflect and amplify market fears. Surveys (15%) : Although currently paused, this component historically used polls to gauge investor sentiment directly. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the rest of the cryptocurrency market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a flight to safety during periods of fear, as investors move away from riskier altcoins. Google Trends (10%) : Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries, particularly fear-related terms. A spike in fear-related searches can signal growing market anxiety. The current plunge in the index suggests a confluence of negative signals across these factors, painting a picture of widespread anxiety in the crypto market. Why is Market Volatility Spiking Fear Right Now? Market volatility is inherent in the cryptocurrency world, but recent events have amplified these swings, contributing significantly to the current ‘Extreme Fear’ reading. Several factors could be at play: Broader Economic Uncertainty : Global economic headwinds, including inflation concerns, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions, are impacting all markets, including crypto. Uncertainty in traditional markets often spills over into the crypto space. Regulatory Scrutiny : Increased regulatory attention and enforcement actions in various jurisdictions can create uncertainty and fear among crypto investors. News of potential crackdowns or stricter regulations often triggers market downturns. Bearish Price Action : Sustained downward price movements in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum naturally erode investor confidence and breed fear of further losses. Black Swan Events : Unforeseen events, often referred to as ‘black swan’ events, can trigger sudden and sharp market corrections, exacerbating fear and uncertainty. It’s crucial to remember that fear in the market can be self-fulfilling. As the index drops into ‘Extreme Fear’, it can trigger more selling as investors panic and rush to exit their positions, further driving down prices and reinforcing the negative sentiment loop. Investor Fear: Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Red Flag? The million-dollar question is: what should investors do when the Crypto Fear and Greed Index flashes ‘Extreme Fear’? There are two main schools of thought: Contrarian View: Buying Opportunity : Legendary investor Warren Buffett famously advised to be “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.” Proponents of this view believe that extreme fear often presents a prime buying opportunity. When everyone is selling and sentiment is at its lowest, asset prices can be undervalued, offering potential for significant gains when the market eventually recovers. Historically, periods of extreme fear in the crypto market have been followed by substantial rallies. Cautionary View: Red Flag : Others interpret extreme fear as a warning sign of further market downturns. They argue that it could signal the beginning of a deeper bear market, and ‘catching a falling knife’ can be risky. This perspective suggests caution, risk management, and potentially reducing exposure to the crypto market until sentiment improves. Ultimately, the right approach depends on your individual risk tolerance, investment strategy, and long-term outlook on the cryptocurrency market. There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Actionable Insights for Navigating Extreme Fear Regardless of whether you see the current situation as a buying opportunity or a red flag, here are some actionable insights to consider: Do Your Own Research (DYOR) : Don’t make investment decisions based solely on fear or greed. Conduct thorough research on the projects you’re invested in or considering investing in. Understand the fundamentals, technology, and long-term potential. Manage Your Risk : Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Consider using stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Zoom Out and Take a Long-Term Perspective : Cryptocurrency markets are known for their cyclical nature. Bear markets and periods of fear are often followed by bull markets and periods of growth. Focus on the long-term potential of the technology and the asset class rather than short-term price fluctuations. Stay Informed, But Avoid Emotional Decisions : Keep abreast of market news and developments, but avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or panic. Stick to your investment strategy and make rational choices based on your research and analysis. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) : If you believe in the long-term potential of crypto and see this dip as a buying opportunity, consider using dollar-cost averaging. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price. DCA can help to smooth out volatility and potentially lower your average entry price over time. Conclusion: Navigating the Fear, Preparing for the Future The Crypto Fear & Greed Index plunging to its lowest level since September is undoubtedly a concerning signal, reflecting widespread fear and uncertainty in the crypto market. However, it’s crucial to remember that market sentiment is cyclical. Extreme fear can present both risks and opportunities. By understanding the factors driving this fear, conducting thorough research, managing risk effectively, and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can navigate these turbulent times and position themselves for potential future growth in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies.

A chilling development is unfolding in the digital asset world. A hacker, linked to the major cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, is on a frantic spree, rapidly laundering a massive stash of stolen Ethereum (ETH). On-chain analysis is revealing the alarming speed at which these funds are being moved, raising serious questions about crypto security and the future of digital asset protection. Let’s dive into the details of this developing story and understand the implications for the entire crypto ecosystem. The Shocking Pace of Crypto Laundering: Analyst’s Dire Prediction Renowned on-chain analyst @EmberCN has sounded the alarm on X, painting a stark picture of the Bybit hacker’s activities. According to their analysis, at the current breakneck speed, the hacker is projected to successfully launder the remaining 410,000 ETH within a mere 15 days. This isn’t just a slow trickle; it’s a torrent. To put this into perspective, in just two and a half days, a staggering 89,500 ETH, equivalent to a whopping $224 million, has already been converted into other, presumably harder-to-trace, assets. This already laundered amount represents 18% of the total 499,000 ETH pilfered in the initial hack. The speed and scale of this crypto laundering operation are truly unprecedented and demand immediate attention from the crypto community. What is On-Chain Analysis and How Does it Uncover Crypto Theft? You might be wondering, how do we even know about this? The answer lies in the power of on-chain analysis . Think of the blockchain as a completely transparent ledger, recording every single transaction in the cryptocurrency world. On-chain analysts are like digital detectives, meticulously examining this public ledger to track the flow of funds, identify suspicious patterns, and uncover illicit activities like crypto theft and laundering. They use sophisticated tools and techniques to trace the movement of cryptocurrencies from one wallet to another, even across different exchanges and decentralized platforms. Benefits of On-Chain Analysis in Crypto Security: Transparency: Blockchain’s inherent transparency allows for the tracking of transactions, making it difficult for malicious actors to operate completely undetected. Real-time Monitoring: On-chain analysis provides real-time insights into fund movements, enabling quicker detection of suspicious activities. Forensic Investigation: It aids in post-incident investigations, helping to trace stolen funds and potentially recover assets. Risk Assessment: Exchanges and institutions can use on-chain analysis to assess the risk associated with certain transactions and wallets. Regulatory Compliance: It assists in meeting regulatory requirements related to anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT). In this Bybit hacker case, on-chain analysis has been instrumental in revealing the extent and speed of the Ethereum laundering operation, providing crucial data that would otherwise remain hidden in the complex web of blockchain transactions. Ethereum Under Threat: Understanding the Scale of the Bybit Hacker’s Actions The sheer volume of Ethereum involved in this hack and subsequent laundering attempt is staggering. 499,000 ETH is not a small sum; it’s a colossal amount of digital gold. The rapid movement of these funds poses several significant threats: Market Instability: The sudden dumping of large amounts of ETH on exchanges to convert them into other assets could potentially create downward pressure on the Ethereum price, impacting the broader crypto market. Ecosystem Trust Erosion: Such large-scale hacks and successful laundering operations can erode trust in the security of cryptocurrency exchanges and the overall digital asset ecosystem. Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: High-profile incidents like this often attract increased regulatory attention, potentially leading to stricter regulations for the crypto industry. User Anxiety: Crypto holders may become increasingly anxious about the security of their funds held on exchanges, prompting them to move assets to cold storage or explore decentralized alternatives. The analyst’s prediction of 15 days to launder the remaining 410,000 ETH underscores the urgency of the situation. Every hour counts in trying to mitigate the damage and potentially trace and freeze the remaining stolen funds. Bybit Hacker’s Tactics: How are They Laundering ETH? While the exact methods employed by the Bybit hacker remain speculative, common crypto laundering techniques often involve a combination of strategies designed to obfuscate the origin and destination of funds. These may include: Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs): DEXs offer a less regulated environment compared to centralized exchanges, potentially making it easier to swap large amounts of crypto with less scrutiny. Mixers/Tumblers: These services are designed to break the link between the source and destination of cryptocurrency transactions, making it harder to trace the funds. Layer-2 Solutions and Bridges: Moving funds across different blockchains and layer-2 solutions can complicate tracking efforts. Multiple Wallets and Transactions: Splitting large sums into smaller transactions and distributing them across numerous wallets can make it more challenging to follow the flow of funds. Conversion to Privacy Coins: Swapping ETH for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero or Zcash, which offer enhanced anonymity, could be part of the laundering process. Understanding these potential tactics is crucial for exchanges, law enforcement, and on-chain analysts to develop effective countermeasures and improve detection mechanisms. Crypto Security in the Spotlight: Lessons from the Bybit Hack This alarming incident serves as a stark reminder of the ever-present need for robust crypto security measures within the digital asset space. The Bybit hack and the subsequent rapid laundering operation highlight vulnerabilities that need to be addressed proactively. What key lessons can we learn from this situation? Key Takeaways for Enhanced Crypto Security: Strengthen Exchange Security Protocols: Exchanges must continuously invest in and upgrade their security infrastructure to protect against sophisticated hacking attempts. This includes multi-signature wallets, cold storage solutions, and rigorous security audits. Enhanced Monitoring and Alert Systems: Real-time transaction monitoring and alert systems are crucial for detecting and responding to suspicious activities promptly. Integrating advanced on-chain analysis tools is essential. Collaboration and Information Sharing: Increased collaboration between exchanges, on-chain analysts, and law enforcement agencies is vital to track and recover stolen funds effectively. Information sharing about known illicit wallets and laundering techniques is crucial. User Education and Awareness: Educating users about crypto security best practices, such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and being cautious of phishing attempts, is paramount. Regulatory Clarity and Enforcement: Clear and consistent regulations, coupled with effective enforcement mechanisms, are needed to deter crypto crime and hold perpetrators accountable. The Bybit hacker saga is a wake-up call for the entire crypto industry. It underscores the ongoing battle between innovation and security, and the critical need for continuous vigilance and improvement in safeguarding digital assets. Conclusion: A Race Against Time in the Crypto Laundering Saga The clock is ticking. The Bybit hacker’s relentless Ethereum laundering spree is a dramatic demonstration of the risks and challenges inherent in the cryptocurrency world. On-chain analysis has shone a light on this audacious operation, but the race is on to mitigate the damage and prevent further losses. This incident should galvanize the crypto community to redouble efforts in enhancing security, fostering collaboration, and staying one step ahead of malicious actors.

Hold on! CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has dropped a reality check, and it’s crucial for anyone navigating the volatile crypto market . In a recent statement on X, he suggested that the golden age of indiscriminate altcoin pumps might be over. According to him, 2025 will be a year where only a select few altcoins will experience significant growth, leaving the vast majority behind. This isn’t just another market prediction; it’s a serious heads-up from a respected voice in the crypto analytics space. Let’s dive into what this means for your crypto portfolio and how to potentially position yourself for success in 2025 and beyond. CryptoQuant CEO’s Stark Prediction: A New Era for Altcoins in 2025 Ki Young Ju’s statement isn’t a blanket dismissal of all altcoins , but rather a nuanced perspective on the evolving crypto landscape. He points out that the days of simply throwing a dart at a list of altcoins and expecting to profit are likely gone. This shift is significant and signals a maturing market where fundamentals and real-world utility are starting to matter more than hype alone. Here’s a breakdown of his key points: Selective Growth: The core message is clear: expect selective growth, not widespread rallies. Only a fraction of the thousands of altcoins currently in existence are likely to flourish in 2025 . ETF Catalyst: ETF approvals are highlighted as a potential catalyst for the success of certain altcoins . This suggests that projects with strong institutional appeal and regulatory compliance may be favored. Sustainable Interest: Mere hype and social media buzz won’t cut it anymore. Projects need to demonstrate consistent and genuine interest from users and developers to thrive. Revenue Generation: Perhaps the most critical factor is revenue generation. Altcoins that can showcase tangible revenue streams and sustainable business models are more likely to attract investment and long-term growth. In essence, Ki Young Ju is suggesting a flight to quality within the altcoins sector. The market is becoming more discerning, rewarding projects with substance and punishing those built on empty promises. Why the Era of Universal Altcoin Rises is Likely Over To understand the significance of the CryptoQuant CEO ‘s prediction, it’s important to consider the historical context of the crypto market and the evolution of altcoins . In previous bull cycles, we often witnessed a phenomenon where almost all altcoins , regardless of their underlying fundamentals, experienced massive price surges. This was fueled by: Excess Liquidity: Periods of easy monetary policy and abundant capital often led to speculative bubbles across various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. Retail Frenzy: The influx of new retail investors, often driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), could pump up the prices of even questionable projects. Low Market Maturity: The relatively nascent stage of the crypto market meant that less scrutiny was applied to project fundamentals, and hype could drive valuations to unsustainable levels. However, the crypto market is maturing. We’re seeing increased institutional participation, greater regulatory oversight, and a more informed investor base. This maturity brings several changes that contribute to the shift away from universal altcoin rallies: Factor Old Era (Universal Rises) New Era (Selective Growth) Market Liquidity Abundant, fueling speculation Potentially tighter, focus on quality Investor Base Predominantly retail, FOMO-driven Growing institutional presence, more discerning Regulatory Landscape Lax, limited oversight Increasing regulation, compliance pressure Project Scrutiny Low, hype-driven valuations Higher, focus on fundamentals and utility These factors collectively suggest that the crypto market is entering a new phase where differentiation and substance will be key drivers of success. The rising tide may no longer lift all boats; instead, we’re likely to see a more selective and competitive environment. Which Altcoins Could Potentially Rise in 2025? Focus on Fundamentals So, if most altcoins are unlikely to surge in 2025 , which ones stand a chance? According to CryptoQuant CEO ‘s insights, the focus should be on projects with strong fundamentals. These fundamentals can be broadly categorized as: Strong Use Case and Utility: Does the altcoin solve a real-world problem or offer a compelling use case? Projects with tangible utility are more likely to attract users and generate sustainable demand. Robust Technology and Development: Is the technology behind the altcoin sound and innovative? Active development, a strong developer community, and continuous improvement are crucial indicators of a project’s long-term viability. Tokenomics and Value Accrual: How is the altcoin designed to capture value? Sustainable tokenomics models that incentivize long-term holding and participation are essential. Strong Community and Adoption: Does the altcoin have a vibrant and engaged community? Growing adoption, partnerships, and real-world integrations are positive signs. Regulatory Compliance and Institutional Appeal: In the context of potential ETF approvals , altcoins that are compliant with regulations and attractive to institutional investors may have an edge. Revenue Generation and Sustainability: As highlighted by Ki Young Ju, the ability to generate revenue is paramount. Projects with clear revenue models and sustainable business operations are more likely to thrive. Examples of altcoin categories that might align with these criteria include: Layer-1 Blockchains: Projects competing with Ethereum, offering improved scalability, speed, or lower transaction costs (e.g., Solana, Avalanche, Cardano – while these are established, new contenders may emerge). Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocols: Platforms enabling lending, borrowing, trading, and other financial services in a decentralized manner (e.g., projects focused on real-world asset tokenization or cross-chain DeFi). Infrastructure and Middleware Projects: Altcoins providing essential infrastructure or middleware solutions for the broader crypto ecosystem (e.g., oracles, data providers, privacy solutions). Select Web3 Applications: Projects building compelling decentralized applications in areas like gaming, social media, or content creation, demonstrating real user adoption and revenue potential. It’s important to note that this is not investment advice. Thorough due diligence and independent research are crucial before investing in any altcoin . Navigating the Altcoin Market in 2025: Strategies for Investors Given the anticipated shift towards selective growth in the altcoin market in 2025 , what strategies can crypto investors adopt to navigate this new landscape? Focus on In-Depth Research: Move beyond hype and social media sentiment. Dive deep into project whitepapers, tokenomics, development activity, community engagement, and revenue models. Diversify Selectively: While diversification is generally recommended, in this environment, it’s crucial to diversify *selectively*. Concentrate your investments in a smaller number of high-conviction altcoins with strong fundamentals rather than spreading too thinly across numerous speculative projects. Monitor Market Trends and Developments: Stay informed about regulatory changes, technological advancements, and shifts in market sentiment. Pay attention to developments related to ETF approvals and institutional adoption. Prioritize Revenue-Generating Projects: As emphasized by the CryptoQuant CEO , focus on altcoins that demonstrate a clear path to revenue generation and sustainable business models. This is a key indicator of long-term viability. Manage Risk Effectively: The altcoin market remains inherently volatile. Implement robust risk management strategies, including position sizing, stop-loss orders, and only investing capital you can afford to lose. Consider Staking and Yield Farming (with Caution): For fundamentally sound altcoins , staking or yield farming can potentially enhance returns. However, be mindful of the risks associated with these activities, including smart contract vulnerabilities and impermanent loss. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on the long-term potential of projects rather than short-term price fluctuations. The most successful altcoins in 2025 and beyond are likely to be those that deliver real value and build sustainable ecosystems. Actionable Insights: Positioning Your Portfolio for 2025 Altcoin Opportunities To summarize, the prediction from CryptoQuant CEO serves as a valuable warning and a call for a more discerning approach to altcoin investing. The key takeaway is that 2025 is likely to be a year of selective growth, where only a fraction of altcoins will rise significantly. To position your portfolio for potential opportunities: Re-evaluate Your Current Altcoin Holdings: Assess the fundamentals of your existing altcoin investments. Do they align with the criteria for success in the new market environment (strong use case, revenue generation, etc.)? Identify Promising Altcoin Candidates: Conduct thorough research to identify altcoins that exhibit strong fundamentals and potential for growth in 2025 , focusing on the categories mentioned earlier (Layer-1s, DeFi, Infrastructure, Select Web3 apps). Develop a Selective Investment Strategy: Create a plan to gradually allocate capital to your chosen altcoins , prioritizing quality over quantity and managing risk effectively. Stay Agile and Adaptable: The crypto market is dynamic. Continuously monitor market developments, reassess your investment thesis, and be prepared to adjust your strategy as needed. By adopting a more strategic and fundamentals-focused approach, you can potentially navigate the evolving altcoin market in 2025 and position yourself to capitalize on the opportunities that arise within this selective growth environment. Conclusion: The Future of Altcoins is Selective, Not Universal Ki Young Ju’s prediction is a wake-up call for the crypto market . The era of indiscriminate altcoin pumps may be fading, replaced by a more mature and discerning market. 2025 is poised to be a year where fundamentals, utility, and revenue generation will be the key differentiators between success and stagnation in the altcoin space. While the potential for significant gains remains, it will be concentrated in a select few projects. Investors who adapt to this new reality, prioritize research, and focus on quality over hype are more likely to thrive in the evolving crypto market . The future of altcoins is not about universal surges, but about selective brilliance. Are you ready to be selective?

The Bitcoin network just threw a curveball – a significant downward adjustment in mining difficulty. As of February 23rd, 2024, at 20:29 UTC, the Bitcoin mining difficulty experienced a notable plunge of 3.15%, settling at 110.57 T. This shift, triggered at block height 885,024, according to CloverPool data, has sent ripples through the mining community. But what does this mean for you, and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem? Let’s dive deep into this crucial development. Decoding the Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Adjustment For those new to the crypto world, the term “ Bitcoin mining difficulty ” might sound intimidating. In simple terms, it’s a measure of how hard it is to mine a Bitcoin block. Think of it as a puzzle that miners need to solve to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. This difficulty is not static; it automatically adjusts roughly every two weeks (or every 2016 blocks) to maintain a consistent block generation time of approximately 10 minutes. Why is this adjustment necessary? Imagine if the puzzle became too easy. Blocks would be mined too quickly, disrupting Bitcoin’s carefully orchestrated schedule and potentially leading to inflation. Conversely, if it’s too hard, miners might struggle, slowing down transaction processing. The difficulty adjustment mechanism is Bitcoin’s ingenious way of self-regulating and ensuring network stability. Why the 3.15% Drop in Bitcoin Mining Difficulty? The recent 3.15% decrease in Bitcoin mining difficulty is not an anomaly but a direct response to changes in the network’s Bitcoin hashrate . Hashrate refers to the total computational power being used to mine Bitcoin. When the hashrate decreases, it means fewer miners are actively participating or that existing miners have reduced their computational power. This could be due to various factors, including: Miner Profitability: If the price of Bitcoin declines or mining costs (like electricity) increase, mining can become less profitable. Some miners might temporarily shut down their operations, leading to a drop in hashrate. Hardware Efficiency: The introduction of more efficient mining hardware can sometimes lead to older, less efficient machines being retired, potentially causing a short-term hashrate dip. Geopolitical Events: Changes in regulations or energy policies in regions with significant mining operations can impact hashrate. Network Fluctuations: Natural fluctuations in miner participation are normal. Some miners may cycle in and out of operation based on their strategies. Essentially, the Bitcoin protocol observed that blocks were being mined slower than the target 10-minute average, indicating a reduced hashrate. To compensate and bring block times back to the desired average, it automatically lowered the Bitcoin mining difficulty . What Does This Difficulty Drop Mean for Crypto Miners? For Bitcoin miners, a decrease in mining difficulty is generally good news. Here’s a breakdown of the potential benefits: Increased Profitability: With lower difficulty, it becomes easier for miners to solve the cryptographic puzzles and earn Bitcoin rewards. This can lead to increased profitability, especially for smaller miners or those using less efficient equipment. Reduced Competition: A difficulty drop can temporarily reduce the intensity of competition among miners. Each miner has a slightly higher chance of successfully mining a block. Potential Hashrate Rebound: Increased profitability can incentivize more miners to come online or existing miners to increase their operations, potentially leading to a rebound in the Bitcoin hashrate in the future. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is a dynamic environment. The next difficulty adjustment, projected in approximately 14 days, is anticipated to further decrease the difficulty by 1.07% to 109.38 T. This suggests that the network is still adjusting to changes in hashrate, and miners should closely monitor these trends. Impact on the Broader Bitcoin Network and Investors While primarily affecting miners directly, changes in Bitcoin mining difficulty also have implications for the broader Bitcoin network and investors: Network Stability: The difficulty adjustment mechanism is vital for maintaining the stability and security of the Bitcoin network. It ensures consistent block times and predictable Bitcoin issuance. Transaction Processing: While a significant hashrate drop could theoretically slow down transaction processing, the automatic difficulty adjustment aims to prevent prolonged delays. The network is designed to self-correct. Investor Sentiment: Significant fluctuations in hashrate and difficulty can sometimes influence investor sentiment. However, these adjustments are a normal part of Bitcoin’s operation and reflect the network’s resilience and adaptability. It’s important to understand that crypto mining difficulty adjustments are a feature, not a bug. They demonstrate Bitcoin’s robust and decentralized nature, allowing it to adapt to changing conditions and maintain its core principles. Actionable Insights for Miners and Crypto Enthusiasts So, what should miners and crypto enthusiasts take away from this difficulty adjustment ? Monitor Difficulty Trends: Keep a close eye on difficulty adjustments and hashrate fluctuations. Websites like CloverPool and others provide real-time data. Assess Mining Profitability: Miners should continuously evaluate their profitability based on current difficulty, Bitcoin price, and electricity costs. Difficulty drops can present opportunities, but market conditions are constantly evolving. Stay Informed: The cryptocurrency landscape is dynamic. Stay updated on industry news, technological advancements in mining hardware, and regulatory changes that could impact mining operations. Understand Network Mechanics: Gaining a deeper understanding of how Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment algorithm works is crucial for anyone involved in or investing in cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: Navigating the Evolving Bitcoin Landscape The recent 3.15% decrease in Bitcoin mining difficulty to 110.57 T is a significant event that underscores the self-regulating nature of the Bitcoin network. It reflects the dynamic interplay between hashrate, mining profitability, and network stability. For miners, it presents a potential window of opportunity to enhance profitability. For the broader crypto community, it serves as a reminder of Bitcoin’s inherent resilience and its ability to adapt and thrive in a constantly evolving digital world. By understanding these adjustments and staying informed, miners and investors alike can navigate the exciting, yet sometimes turbulent, waters of the cryptocurrency market with greater confidence.

For eight consecutive weeks, the crypto market has been under pressure, leaving investors anxious and portfolios significantly impacted. According to Bloomberg data, numerous tokens have plummeted by a staggering 30–80% since mid-December. What’s behind this prolonged downturn, and what does it mean for the future of altcoins? Let’s dive into the analysis. Why is the Crypto Market So Weak? Several factors are contributing to the persistent weakness in the crypto market . Jeff Dorman, a seasoned expert and chief investment officer at Arca, points to a confluence of negative elements: Poor Sentiment: Overall market sentiment has turned bearish. Investor confidence is shaken, leading to reduced participation and increased selling pressure. Memecoin Meltdown: The spectacular failures of various memecoins have eroded trust and highlighted the speculative nature of certain crypto assets. This has spooked investors, prompting a flight to safety. Capital Drought for New Tokens: A significant lack of fresh capital injection into the market is hindering the launch and growth of new crypto projects. This scarcity of funds further dampens market enthusiasm. These factors, combined, paint a picture of a market struggling to find its footing amidst a wave of negativity. But what about altcoins specifically? Altcoins Under Pressure: Bitcoin Dominance Resurges While the entire crypto space is feeling the chill, altcoins appear to be bearing the brunt of the downturn. Edward Chin, co-founder of Parataxis, offers a compelling explanation for this phenomenon. He highlights that: Investor Saturation: Existing altcoin investors are largely “fully invested.” This means they have already allocated a significant portion of their capital to altcoins and are less likely to inject more funds in the current climate. Bitcoin Beckons New Capital: New capital entering the crypto market is predominantly flowing into Bitcoin (BTC). This reinforces Bitcoin’s dominance and leaves altcoins starved of the fresh investment needed to thrive. This dynamic is leading to a resurgence of Bitcoin dominance . As new money favors the perceived safety and established reputation of Bitcoin, altcoins are left to compete for a shrinking pool of investment. The Narrative Vacuum: Why Altcoins Need a Story Chin further emphasizes the crucial role of narratives in the crypto market, particularly for altcoins . In the absence of compelling stories and use cases, altcoins are struggling to attract attention and investment. He suggests that: Narrative Drives Investment: Cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins, often thrive on compelling narratives – stories of innovation, disruption, and real-world applications. Lack of Compelling Stories: Currently, many altcoins lack strong, convincing narratives to excite investors and differentiate themselves from the pack. Sentiment is Key: Without these narratives, altcoins are vulnerable to declining sentiment. Their fate is closely tied to an overall improvement in market mood and the emergence of new, engaging stories. In essence, altcoins are caught in a vicious cycle. Poor market sentiment, coupled with a lack of compelling narratives, leads to reduced investment, further weakening their position in the crypto market . Navigating the Market Downturn: What Can Investors Do? In the face of this prolonged market downturn , what steps can crypto investors take? Actionable Insights Description Assess Portfolio Risk Evaluate your current crypto holdings. Understand your risk tolerance and the potential downside of your investments, especially in altcoins. Diversify Strategically While altcoins are struggling, diversification remains crucial. Consider a balanced portfolio that includes a mix of established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and potentially promising altcoins with strong fundamentals, if you are willing to take the risk. Stay Informed Keep abreast of market developments, expert analysis, and emerging narratives. Understanding market sentiment and potential catalysts for recovery is vital. Focus on Fundamentals When considering altcoins, prioritize projects with strong technology, real-world use cases, active development teams, and solid communities. Avoid purely speculative assets driven by hype. Manage Expectations Recognize that market downturns are a natural part of the crypto cycle. Avoid panic selling and adopt a long-term perspective. The Road Ahead: Will Crypto Sentiment Improve? The million-dollar question remains: when will crypto sentiment improve, and when will altcoins find their footing again? Predicting market bottoms is notoriously difficult. However, some potential catalysts could signal a shift in momentum: Positive Macroeconomic Developments: Easing inflation, dovish monetary policy from central banks, or improved global economic outlook could boost investor confidence across all asset classes, including crypto. Emergence of Strong Narratives: Breakthroughs in blockchain technology, wider adoption of crypto in real-world applications, or the rise of compelling new crypto use cases could reignite investor interest in altcoins. Institutional Adoption: Increased institutional investment in altcoins, beyond Bitcoin, could provide a significant influx of capital and validation for the broader crypto market. Conclusion: Navigating the Crypto Winter The crypto market is undoubtedly experiencing a prolonged winter. Market downturn conditions are prevalent, and altcoins are facing significant headwinds. While the current situation may seem bleak, it’s crucial to remember that crypto markets are cyclical. By understanding the factors driving the current weakness, staying informed, and focusing on long-term fundamentals, investors can navigate this challenging period and position themselves for potential future opportunities. The crypto space is ever-evolving, and new narratives and innovations could emerge to reshape the landscape once again. Patience and informed decision-making are key to weathering this storm and potentially reaping the rewards when the tide eventually turns.

Meanwhile, market sentiment took a major hit after President Trump confirmed his planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada. This caused the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to drop to ”Extreme Fear” as Bitcoin fell below $92,000. SEC to Remove Regional Directors The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly planning to eliminate its regional office director roles as part of the Trump administration’s broader government cost-cutting initiative. According to sources cited by Reuters , the SEC informed the directors of its ten regional offices on Feb. 21 that their positions will be removed in a plan that is set to be formally filed next month. However, the offices themselves are expected to stay operational. This move was announced after the SEC’s closure of its Salt Lake City office in June. The decision also came just a week after a federal judge imposed $1.8 million in fines on the agency for what was described as “bad faith conduct” in its legal action against crypto firm DEBT Box. Two SEC attorneys involved in the case resigned in April. So far, the SEC has not provided a formal response to these developments. The restructuring is happening during sweeping changes in US regulatory agencies after the return of Donald Trump to the presidency. His administration prioritized federal budget reductions and government downsizing, spearheaded by the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. A DOGE-affiliated account on Musk’s social media platform X posted on Feb. 18 , encouraging the public to report instances of waste, fraud, and abuse related to the SEC. In its budget justification plan to Congress in March, the SEC requested $2.6 billion for the 2025 fiscal year. On Feb. 20, senior SEC staff participated in a call where leadership indicated that several agency members were already coordinating with DOGE. Reports suggest that all departments must submit their reorganization proposals to acting chair Mark Uyeda by Feb. 25. Most of the SEC’s workforce operates from its Washington, DC headquarters, but its regional offices span major financial and technology hubs like New York and San Francisco, as well as smaller cities like Atlanta and Boston, to facilitate local enforcement and corporate investigations. The decision to remove regional directors will require a vote from the SEC’s three-person commission, composed of two Republicans, Mark Uyeda and Hester Peirce, and one Democrat, Caroline Crenshaw. The SEC also started rolling back its enforcement efforts, particularly its previous regulatory focus on cryptocurrency under former chair Gary Gensler. In fact, the agency downsized its crypto enforcement division and halted multiple lawsuits against crypto-related entities. Reports also indicate that its former lead crypto litigator has been reassigned to the SEC’s IT department. SEC Drops Investigation Into Robinhood Crypto The SEC recently closed its investigation into Robinhood Crypto less than a year after issuing the online brokerage a Wells notice. This serves as the latest proof that the regulator is rolling back its enforcement actions. Robinhood announced on Feb. 24 that the SEC’s Enforcement Division informed the company on Feb. 21 that it will not recommend any enforcement action. (Source: Robinhood ) Dan Gallagher, Robinhood Markets’ compliance and corporate affairs officer, criticized the investigation by stating that it should never have been opened in the first place. He held firm that Robinhood Crypto always complied with federal securities laws and never facilitated transactions in securities. The SEC was investigating Robinhood’s cryptocurrency operations for almost a year, and issued a Wells notice on May 4 of 2024, with a preliminary determination to recommend enforcement action for alleged securities violations. Last month, Robinhood reached a $45 million settlement with the SEC over accusations that it violated more than ten securities laws. The Jan. 13 order stated that Robinhood entities admitted to certain findings presented by the SEC. Now that the investigation has concluded, Robinhood urged the regulator to shift away from its “regulation by enforcement” approach and provide clearer guidelines for digital assets, which is a sentiment that is echoed by many in the industry. John Reed Stark X post Former SEC official John Reed Stark suggested that the SEC’s shift in stance could impact its enforcement actions against other industry players like Coinbase, Binance, and Ripple. He pointed to the SEC’s recent request for a 28-day extension in its ongoing lawsuit against Coinbase as an indication that its approach to crypto-related litigation may be changing. Stark also predicted that the SEC could pause or withdraw many of its crypto-related appeals, including the case against Ripple. Crypto Sentiment Plummets as Trump Confirms Tariffs Unfortunately, the Trump administration is causing stress to crypto investors in ways other than regulation. Crypto market sentiment plummeted over the past 24 hours as the broader financial markets declined, after US President Donald Trump’s confirmation that his planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada will proceed as scheduled. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , which measures market sentiment on a scale of 100, dropped to a score of just 25 on Feb. 25, indicating “Extreme Fear.” This is a very sharp decline of 24 points from the previous day when the index was at 49, reflecting a neutral stance. Crypto fear and greed index (Source: Alternative ) The downturn came after Trump, in a Feb. 24 press conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, reiterated that his proposed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports were “going forward on time, on schedule.” These tariffs were initially announced on Feb. 1, and include a 25% tax on general imports from Canada and Mexico, with Canadian energy imports facing a 10% tariff. Goods from China are also set to face a 10% tax. After the initial announcement, Bitcoin saw a big drop from around $105,000 to approximately $92,900, while over $2.2 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH) was liquidated because traders feared an impending trade war. Trump later agreed to pause the tariffs for 30 days after the two neighboring countries pledged to increase border protections. However, with the pause set to expire next month, the President’s latest comments only renewed market anxieties. The crypto market reacted negatively to other tariff-related announcements from Trump in recent weeks. Bitcoin saw another decline on Feb. 9 when the President imposed a 25% tariff on aluminum and steel imports, followed by another dip on Feb. 13 after he signed an executive order implementing sweeping reciprocal tariffs. The last time the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reached “Extreme Fear” levels was on Sept. 7 last year, when Bitcoin tumbled to around $54,000. The price of Bitcoin fell 5.4% over the last 24 hours of trading, dropping below $92,000. The broader crypto market also suffered, with total market capitalization declining by close to 7% from over $3.31 trillion to approximately $3.09 trillion. Bitcoin’s price action over the past 24 hours (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The impact extends beyond crypto, with the US stock market also experiencing declines. The S&P 500 fell 2.3% over the past five trading days, while the Nasdaq Composite has dropped by 4% in the same time period.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-25 09:32:14
40811203,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133692,1740475990,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BREAKING: Metaplanet’s Bold Bitcoin Bet – Surges Holdings by 135 BTC!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/metaplanet-bitcoin-holdings-increase/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The Bitcoin adoption saga continues, and this time, it’s Japan’s Metaplanet making headlines. Just when you thought the market couldn’t get any more exciting, this publicly listed company has doubled down on its Bitcoin strategy, showcasing a powerful belief in the future of digital gold. Let’s dive into the details of Metaplanet’s latest Bitcoin accumulation and what it means for the broader cryptocurrency landscape. Metaplanet’s Strategic Bitcoin Investment Continues Unabated Metaplanet, drawing comparisons to MicroStrategy for its corporate Bitcoin strategy, has just announced another significant purchase. In a recent update shared on X, the company revealed its acquisition of 135 Bitcoin (BTC). This latest move isn’t just a small dip into the crypto waters; it’s a substantial addition that firmly cements Metaplanet’s position as a notable corporate Bitcoin holder. With this purchase, Metaplanet’s total BTC holdings increase to an impressive 2,235 BTC. To put this into perspective, this isn’t pocket change – it’s a serious commitment to Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Let’s break down the key facts: Who: Metaplanet, a publicly listed company in Japan. What: Purchased an additional 135 Bitcoin (BTC). When: Announced recently on X. Total Holdings: Now holds 2,235 BTC. Significance: Reinforces Metaplanet’s Bitcoin investment strategy and confidence in cryptocurrency. This consistent accumulation strategy begs the question: Why is Metaplanet so bullish on Bitcoin, and what does this mean for the future of corporate crypto adoption? Why is Metaplanet Doubling Down on Bitcoin in Japan? The million-dollar question (or perhaps, the multi-Bitcoin question) is: why? Why is a Japanese public company so aggressively pursuing a Metaplanet Bitcoin strategy? Several factors could be at play here: Hedge Against Yen Depreciation: The Japanese Yen has faced periods of weakness. Bitcoin, often seen as a decentralized and inflation-resistant asset, could serve as a hedge against currency devaluation. For Metaplanet, holding Bitcoin might be a strategic move to protect its treasury from potential economic headwinds. Embracing Digital Transformation: Japan Bitcoin adoption , while evolving, is showing increasing openness. Metaplanet could be positioning itself at the forefront of digital transformation in Japan, signaling to investors and the market that it is an innovative and forward-thinking company. Embracing Bitcoin is a strong statement in the digital age. Long-Term Investment Thesis: Metaplanet’s actions suggest a strong long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. They aren’t just dabbling; they are building a significant reserve asset. This indicates confidence in Bitcoin’s potential for future appreciation and its role in the global financial system. Following MicroStrategy’s Lead: MicroStrategy’s successful (and sometimes volatile) journey with Bitcoin as a treasury asset has paved the way for other companies. Metaplanet might be drawing inspiration from MicroStrategy’s playbook, recognizing the potential benefits of holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet. It’s a powerful combination of factors that makes Metaplanet’s strategy compelling. But what are the broader implications of such institutional Bitcoin adoption? Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: A Growing Trend? Metaplanet’s continued Bitcoin accumulation adds fuel to the narrative of growing institutional Bitcoin adoption. While retail investors have been the early pioneers of cryptocurrency, the entry of institutional players like Metaplanet marks a significant evolution in the market. This trend could have several profound impacts: Impact Description Increased Market Legitimacy When publicly listed companies invest in Bitcoin, it lends further legitimacy to the cryptocurrency asset class. It signals to traditional investors and skeptics that Bitcoin is not just a fringe asset but a viable investment option. Reduced Volatility (Potentially) While Bitcoin is known for its volatility, increased institutional investment could, in the long run, lead to reduced price swings. Larger, more established investors tend to have longer time horizons and may contribute to a more stable market. Greater Liquidity Institutional participation often brings greater liquidity to the market. Increased trading volumes and deeper order books can make it easier for both large and small investors to buy and sell Bitcoin. Catalyst for Further Adoption Metaplanet’s move can inspire other companies to consider Bitcoin as a treasury asset. As more institutions allocate capital to Bitcoin, it could create a snowball effect, driving further adoption and potentially higher prices. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge that Bitcoin investment , especially for corporations, is not without its benefits and challenges. Benefits of Bitcoin Investment for Public Companies like Metaplanet Why might a publicly traded company choose to allocate a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin? The potential benefits are numerous: Diversification: Bitcoin offers diversification benefits as it is largely uncorrelated with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This can help reduce overall portfolio risk. Inflation Hedge: As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin is often touted as an inflation hedge due to its limited supply. In an environment of rising inflation, Bitcoin could potentially preserve or even increase its purchasing power. Enhanced Returns: Bitcoin has historically outperformed many traditional assets. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the potential for significant returns is a compelling factor. Brand Innovation: Being a Bitcoin-forward company can enhance a company’s brand image, particularly among tech-savvy investors and customers. It can position the company as innovative and adaptable to emerging technologies. Access to a Global Market: Bitcoin operates 24/7, globally. Holding Bitcoin provides companies with access to a decentralized and borderless financial network. Challenges and Risks of Bitcoin Holdings Of course, the path to Bitcoin riches isn’t without its bumps. Companies considering Bitcoin investment must also be aware of the challenges and risks: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility is perhaps its most well-known characteristic. Significant price swings can impact a company’s balance sheet and investor sentiment. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the legality and accounting treatment of Bitcoin holdings. Security Risks: Storing and securing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures. Companies must protect their holdings from theft and hacking. Accounting Complexity: Accounting for Bitcoin holdings can be complex and may vary depending on jurisdiction and accounting standards. Market Sentiment: Negative news or market events can trigger rapid sell-offs in the cryptocurrency market, impacting the value of Bitcoin holdings. Despite these challenges, Metaplanet’s continued investment suggests that they believe the potential rewards outweigh the risks, at least in the long term. Conclusion: Metaplanet’s Bitcoin Move – A Sign of Things to Come? Metaplanet’s latest BTC holdings increase is more than just a news headline; it’s a powerful signal. It underscores the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset and highlights the potential for further institutional Bitcoin adoption. As more companies like Metaplanet explore the benefits of Bitcoin investment , we could be witnessing a fundamental shift in how corporations manage their finances and view digital assets. Whether this bold move will inspire a wave of corporate Bitcoin adoption remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Metaplanet is placing a significant bet on the future of Bitcoin, and the world is watching.

40811291,https://nulltx.com/?p=145803,1740476083,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Chainlink Shows Resilience Amid Market Challenges, With Growing Network and Strategic Partnerships",https://nulltx.com/chainlink-shows-resilience-amid-market-challenges-with-growing-network-and-strategic-partnerships/,"Amid market uncertainty, Chainlink ($LINK) has arisen as a beacon of resilience. The decentralized oracle network has faced headwinds across the cryptocurrency market but continues to show substantial growth in its user base and technological advancements. Recent data from @Intotheblock reveals that the number of new $LINK addresses has surged to levels not seen since January, and this, along with a few other recent developments, has the narrative around Chainlink headed in a very favorable direction. According to @Intotheblock Chainlink network growth is accelerating! The number of new $LINK addresses has surged to a new height, reaching a high level since January! pic.twitter.com/QB5IK7ZW7h — ALTCOIN D/GDDY {A.D}𓃵 (@Altcoin_daddy) February 23, 2025 Chainlink’s Growing Network and Resilient Performance Chainlink’s rapidly expanding network is one of its most significant development. The most recent numbers show that 2,300 new addresses have been added to the Chainlink network, just in recent days—an indication that not only is Chainlink continuing to add partners; it’s also pushing ever more toward a decentralized oracle solution. And this push seems to be happening despite the bear market; in fact, it may be one reason why, in these recent days, Chainlink has shown solid price growth. Chainlink’s capacity to welcome new users in a chaotic market sends a message that few other things in this turbulent space can. That’s because Chainlink has established such solid fundamentals and earned such deep trust within the blockchain community that it serves as an onboarder for fresh projects and users even in a turbulent market. As an architecture provider for smart contracts, Chainlink is as close to a critical blockchain component as you get, serving decentralized finance (DeFi) and a growing suite of other blockchain projects. The price movement of Chainlink has largely stayed correlated to critical technical levels, especially around the $18 price point. Even though Chainlink has had a tough time pushing through some key resistance levels, the project’s network growth and the coin’s performance amid crypto market adversity suggest a solid foundation. Analysts are watching the asset’s technical levels very closely, but they appear to be maintaining an upward trajectory. Technological Advancements and Strategic Partnerships Chainlink’s isn’t only about its expanding network; it is also about the consistent development of advanced, powerful technologies that strengthen its competitive position within the blockchain ecosystem. The latest of these—a technological upgrade rather than a new product—serves to enhance Chainlink’s already impressive interoperability across multiple blockchains. This upgrade—Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) v1.5—is all about letting decentralized oracles work their magic across multiple networks. Chainlink’s CCIP v1.5 is a crucial step for it in establishing itself as the predominant solution for cross-chain communications. This upgrade enables the transfer of data and assets between blockchains, which is a fairly basic requirement for any decentralized application that spans multiple chains. Although we should not understate the effect of this upgrade, it does not place Chainlink significantly ahead of any of its closest rivals in interoperability. If Chainlink were to succeed, it would achieve a fairly important milestone in enabling the use of decentralized applications across multiple blockchains. CHAINLINK EXPANDS AS NETWORK GROWTH HITS NEW PEAK Chainlink shows resilience with 2,300 new addresses, defying market headwinds; the asset battles resistance at $18 while its cross-chain tech upgrade—CCIP v1.5—sharpens its competitive edge. A strategic partnership with XRP… pic.twitter.com/YLhjJr6qb4 — Crypto Town Hall (@Crypto_TownHall) February 24, 2025 Along with its technological advancements, Chainlink has formed a strategic partnership with XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger. This partnership aims to extend both the market reach and the integrations of Chainlink’s decentralized oracle services into the XRP ecosystem. With the XRP network gaining traction in 2020, this partnership is further testimony to the growing adoption of decentralized oracles as vital to the reliable operation of blockchain-based financial services. Chainlink’s technology is being adopted by leading blockchain networks, as evidenced by the collaboration with XRP. As more of the blockchain projects that make up the rapidly expanding Web3 seek robust and reliable solutions for connecting their smart contracts to real-world data, Chainlink’s role as an oracle provider is becoming even more indispensable. Long-Term Outlook for Chainlink Even though Chainlink has had some short-term problems, its long-term prospects are looking good. The project has gained a larger network and many strong partnerships, and has undergone ostensibly beneficial technological upgrades. Overall, we see it as one of the standout projects in the broader blockchain space. From our perspective, it continues to build out user growth and its competitive edge in ways that are pretty much exactly what you would want to see from a blockchain project. Chainlink possesses solid fundamentals, which ensures that it is weathering the current murky crypto market just fine. But that’s just the short-term story. In the long run, the blockchain world increasingly looks like it will require what Chainlink provides—decentralized oracle services. And what do I mean by that? I mean that if you want to build a blockchain application that connects to the real world and does anything useful, you’re probably going to need an oracle—just like the developers of all the smart contracts that run on Ethereum have needed oracles since that platform was born. To sum up, although the larger market might be persistently volatile, Chainlink persists in its aim to span the distance between real-world data and smart contracts. The upturn in the number of new addresses, the unveiling of CCIP v1.5, and the partner up with XRP all point to a brighter near-term outlook for LINK. That’s something we should all be excited about because, if we aren’t, we’re in a weird place as potential or actual investors in or users of the vital infrastructure that is Chainlink—an infrastructure more likely than not to be integral to many future smart contracts, which in turn will, again, more likely than not, be integral to many future decentralized applications.

This week has been punctuated by coverworthy announcements, huge new partnerships, and this ecosystem’s destiny-fulfilling movement toward decentralized finance (DeFi)—not to mention the Aptos blockchain’s completely on-chain, state-of-the-art lending platform. You can undoubtedly see a big difference in Aptos’s appearance, direction, and potential in this ecosystem. Here’s a brief highlight recap of this week: Strategic Partnerships and Expanding Ecosystem A significant development this week is the launch of PACT Protocol on Aptos. PACT Protocol is making a notable impact on the on-chain lending space, providing users with decentralized and efficient lending options. This launch is viewed as a cornerstone event for the network, pushing DeFi solutions into the spotlight and making Aptos more relevant as a space for decentralized financial services. PACT Protocol is expected to be by far the most significant development in the Aptos lending space, using the advantages of transparency, security, and speed that come with the blockchain to disrupt traditional lending services. Moreover, Aptos Foundation appointed as new community development chief PoOn Yeung—who was previously at the Web3 organization ConsenSys—onboarding a talented individual with lots of experience in developing and engaging with communities. This is a key role because Yeung’s position makes him an integral part of onboarding new projects that help expansion of the Aptos ecosystem. At the same time, “community development” is a big part of the foundation’s efforts to generate interest in what’s being built on Aptos, as well as a big part of the foundation’s overall focus on what they say is a growing demand for blockchain adoption. Aptos also embraced Huddle01 into its ecosystem, a Web3 stage that provides decentralized, secure, and efficient meeting solutions. As the world steadily pivots toward the virtual sphere for collaboration, Huddle01 stands primed to contribute to the growth and provisioning of decentralized communication tools. This alliance will fortify the ecosystem and Aptos’ collaborative layer within it because Huddle01 has a “new layer” of just that sort of efficient meeting infrastructure, both secure and scalable, for decentralized communities. Growing Interest in Staking and DeFi on Aptos Staking will remain a major theme for Aptos in 2025 and is now an activity seeing a surge on the platform. Apparently, the staking volume on Aptos has skyrocketed recently to the tune of +7.7 million APT (+28%), which takes us from a total of 27 million APT staked in early January to a presently 34.7 million APT staked. Why? Well, obviously, people are partaking in network governance and security for the chance to earn some sweet, sweet rewards, but what’s really pushing this narrative forward? Platforms like Amnis Finance, for one, are enabling the governance token holders to stake their APT and earn some rather attractive yields. The growing enthusiasm for staking coincides with Aptos’s wider objective of emerging as a top-tier platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. With the staking of an increasing number of tokens, the network’s total security and decentralization also improve, rendering it an even more appealing choice for developers and users. AI and DeFi: The Future of Aptos Aside from its growth in decentralized finance, the Aptos ecosystem is also experiencing movement among AI agents. Two standout projects in this nascent AI-powered sector are JouleFinance and its counterpart, Merkle_Trade, and together they represent what could be a seismic shift in the operation of decentralized finance. JouleFinance is using AI to effect the kind of fundamental change in fiDe that we formerly might have expected from quantum computing. Merkle_Trade is using the same kind of AI (in a different way) to produce a similarly revolutionary effect. The two projects have something in common: they are both fully integrating AI with the smart contract capabilities of the Aptos blockchain. In a similar way, Merkle_Trade is using AI to improve the automation of trading using its plugin, Merkle Eliza. Employing algorithmic AI, Merkle_Trade aspires to completely change how users deal with trading strategies, making it all a lot smarter and more efficient in the realm of DeFi trading. These two projects are merely the entrance of the AI train into the Aptos ecosystem, and we can expect a lot more in the coming months. Weekly $APT @Aptos Recap – Tuần 3, tháng 02/2025 Giao thức PACT @pactconsortium ra mắt trên Aptos: Bước ngoặt cho hoạt động lending on-chain Chúc mừng PoOn Yeung ( @poymeetsworld ) gia nhập Aptos Foundation với vai trò trưởng bộ phận phát triển cộng đồng.… https://t.co/npBnYSptdT pic.twitter.com/jXl2z4vWlH — Blog Tiền Ảo (@blogtienao_hq) February 24, 2025 In addition, Aptos co-hosted BUIDL Day at EthereumDenver, an event that drew developers from both ecosystems together. The day served to highlight several projects being built on the Aptos blockchain—such as Emojicoinfun, Joule Finance, Kana Labs, KYD Labs, Mirage Protocol, Panana Predictions, and Fliq Predictions—that illustrate the diverse array of use cases springing up around the Aptos chain from NFTs to predictions markets and DeFi apps. AI + DeFi Panel Discussion An exciting occurrence came from an engaging panel discussion and the insightful questions that resulted from it, hosted by Haley (@llcool_hay) and a guest expert panel. They steered the audience and themselves through a deep dive into the growing influence of AI and DeFi (DeFAI) on the Aptos ecosystem. The discussion skimmed over some surface-level understanding of those concepts before delving quite a bit deeper into what they mean for our world and the Aptos ecosystem. When we think of those two (AI and DeFi) together, we actually have the potential to create something much more interesting than either of those two topics individually can create. Conclusion The week of February 2025 has been an exhilarating one for the Aptos ecosystem. From launching groundbreaking protocols such as PACT Protocol to bringing on board strategic allies like Huddle01, the network Carlsbad continues to invigorate its capabilities and solidify its stature in the blockchain and DeFi realms. The mounting volume of staking and the burgeoning influence of AI in DeFi further highlight Aptos’s prospects for long-term greatness. Aptos stands ready to keep on keeping on, largely due to PoOn Yeung and his partnerships. Yeung leads community development for Aptos, and his work with the community and a panoply of partners has put the nascent network on solid ground as it heads into its next growth stage. The Aptos team sees “growing up” across three dimensions: in technical development, in ecosystem growth, and in added community development. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

40811460,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133695,1740476375,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Staggering $24.4M Crypto Loss: Whale’s Risky TRUMP Token Trade Backfires,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/whale-massive-trump-token-loss/,"The cryptocurrency market, known for its rollercoaster rides, has delivered yet another jaw-dropping saga. This time, it involves a crypto whale and a meme coin named TRUMP, culminating in a staggering $24.4 million loss. Are you ready to dive into the details of this high-stakes crypto gamble gone wrong and understand the volatile nature of meme coin investments? Shocking Crypto Loss: Whale’s $24.4 Million TRUMP Token Mistake In a stunning turn of events that highlights the inherent risks of crypto trading , an anonymous whale has reportedly suffered a massive $24.4 million loss. This financial tsunami was triggered by a trade involving 763,582 TRUMP tokens. According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, the whale offloaded these tokens for $9.48 million USDC. While this might sound like a substantial sum, it pales in comparison to the initial investment and the ultimate deficit. Let’s break down the timeline and key figures to fully grasp the magnitude of this crypto loss : Initial Profit: The whale had previously tasted success with TRUMP tokens, netting a profit of $11.8 million. This early win likely fueled confidence and perhaps a sense of invincibility. Aggressive Reinvestment: Emboldened by past gains, the whale reinvested a significant $33.9 million into TRUMP tokens. This aggressive move showcases the high-risk, high-reward mentality often seen in crypto trading . Month-Long Hold and Price Decline: The investment was held for approximately a month. Unfortunately for the whale, this period coincided with a price decline in the TRUMP token. The exact reasons for the price drop aren’t specified, but market volatility is a common culprit in the crypto sphere. The Final Blow: As the price continued to slide, the whale decided to cut losses and sold the tokens. This sale, executed for $9.48 million, crystallized the devastating $24.4 million loss. Adding insult to injury, the whale not only erased the initial $11.8 million profit but also incurred an additional $12.6 million deficit beyond that. Understanding the Risks of Meme Coins like TRUMP Token This incident serves as a stark reminder of the volatile and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market, particularly when it comes to meme coins . Tokens like TRUMP, often inspired by internet memes or trending topics, can experience explosive growth fueled by social media hype and community enthusiasm. However, this hype can be fleeting, and these assets are notoriously susceptible to dramatic price swings. Here are some key characteristics and risks associated with meme coins : Feature Description Community Driven Meme coins often thrive on strong online communities and social media buzz. Their value can be heavily influenced by sentiment and viral trends. High Volatility Price fluctuations can be extreme and rapid. Gains can be massive, but losses can be equally devastating, as seen in this crypto whale example. Limited Utility Unlike established cryptocurrencies with clear use cases (like Bitcoin or Ethereum), meme coins often lack fundamental utility or technological innovation. Their value is primarily speculative. Pump-and-Dump Potential Due to their susceptibility to hype and community sentiment, meme coins are vulnerable to pump-and-dump schemes, where prices are artificially inflated and then crashed, leaving late investors with significant losses. Regulatory Uncertainty The regulatory landscape for meme coins and the broader crypto market is still evolving, adding another layer of risk and uncertainty. Lessons Learned from This Crypto Whale’s Market Volatility Experience What can we learn from this high-profile crypto loss ? This incident offers several crucial takeaways for anyone involved in or considering entering the cryptocurrency market: Risk Management is Paramount: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. The whale’s aggressive reinvestment, even after initial profits, highlights the danger of overconfidence and inadequate risk management strategies. Diversification is Key: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially in the volatile world of crypto. Diversifying your portfolio across different asset classes and types of cryptocurrencies can mitigate risk. Understand Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. Prices can swing dramatically in short periods. Be prepared for these fluctuations and avoid panic selling or buying based on short-term price movements. Due Diligence is Essential: Before investing in any cryptocurrency, especially meme coins , conduct thorough research. Understand the project, its community, and the underlying risks. Don’t rely solely on hype or social media sentiment. Profit Taking is Crucial: While the allure of further gains can be strong, remember to take profits when you are in a favorable position. Greed can often lead to missed opportunities and eventual losses. The whale in this story might have avoided such a significant loss by securing profits earlier. Navigating the Crypto Market: Is it Worth the Risk? The tale of this crypto whale and their $24.4 million meme coin mishap serves as a powerful cautionary narrative. It underscores the potential for both immense gains and devastating losses in the cryptocurrency market. While the dream of quick riches is enticing, the reality is that crypto trading , particularly with highly speculative assets like meme coins , carries substantial risk. For those considering venturing into this space, it’s crucial to approach it with caution, education, and a strong understanding of market volatility . Treat crypto investments as high-risk endeavors, and always prioritize responsible risk management practices. The potential rewards are there, but so are the significant dangers. Learn from the mistakes of others, like this unfortunate whale, and navigate the crypto seas with wisdom and prudence.

40811457,https://nulltx.com/?p=145801,1740476426,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Ethena Shows Resilience Amid Bybit Hack and Major USDe Redemption,https://nulltx.com/ethena-shows-resilience-amid-bybit-hack-and-major-usde-redemption/,"Ethena , a major player in the stablecoin and decentralized finance space, has emerged relatively unscathed in the recent hack of Bybit, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. While the potential risks to USDe are still unfolding, Ethena has sought to reassure its community that USDe’s PnL and collateralization levels remain unaffected by the hack. Indeed, the run on the Ether market that the Bybit hack has triggered seems to have bypassed USDe, with Ethena managing to keep its decentralized dollar stable throughout the market turbulence of the last week. Large Redemption and Unstaking Show Confidence in USDe On February 21, 2025, Ethena marked its biggest-ever USDe redemption, coming in at $123 million. While that figure might sound big, it only represents a small sliver—about 2%—of the total supply of USDe, which is now $6 billion. All of that makes the redemption seem even more impressive, if not a little alarming. My understanding is that the necessary funding was in place and that the redemption didn’t put a strain on the system. A significant $248 million in USDe was unstaked from the platform’s staking contract. This sum is three times greater than the next largest single-day unstaking amount. The driving force behind this unstaking was the PSM3 contract, which withdrew $202 million in USDe on February 21. This gargantuan unstaking was by no means a coordinated effort. Rather, it was largely the result of one or more whales choosing to unstake a significant amount of USDe from the platform. The effect of this unstaking on the platform was that the staking ratio of USDe decreased from 67% to 63.5%. Even with the large amount of unstaking, there is a bright side to all of this. The annual percentage yield (APY) on sUSDe, a version of USDe, has risen to 9.15%—greater than the saving’s rate of USDs, which sits at 8.75%. This increase in APY is a testament to the resilience of USDe as an investment vehicle, even with sUSD facing some serious headwinds from the market overall. Stable Market Performance and Growing Confidence Even though the market experienced a bit of roughness on February 21, when USDe briefly fell to $0.98, the stablecoin has shown real resilience. The median traded price of USDe across decentralized exchanges (DEXs)—where much of the USDe trading occurs and where USDe should have very poor price performance if it were an illiquid asset—held at a strong price of $0.9993. This translates to a very small deviation of -0.07% from its peg with the US dollar and demonstrates the robustness of USDe. One extraordinary development is the trading volume on decentralized exchanges. Here, USDe experienced its largest daily selling volume at $203 million on February 21. The buying volume was $180 million, which means there was some selling pressure but that confidence in USDe remained steady overall. @0xfluid emerged as a key player, responsible for a sizable portion of USDe and sUSDe trades. He (or it) accounted for 53 percent of the sUSDe trading volume in February and 20% of the USDe trading volume. The breach at Bybit, a major exchange for USDe trading, caused USDe balances on centralized exchanges (CEXs) to plummet. They fell from $580 million to $388 million—a drop of 33%. Yet this was more than offset by an increase in USDe on other platforms; deposits on the Ethereum-based @etherealdex jumped from $163 million to $430 million (an increase of 163%). And a user made a serious deposit of $182 million USDe on February 23, showing that confidence in both Ethena (the @etherealdex platform) and USDe remains strong. Ethena has announced that the massive hack on Bybit has no impact on USDe's PnL and Collateralization. Now that the dust has settled, let's explore the ramifications using our @dune dashboards. https://t.co/zZfRsAKdaP — Tom Wan (@tomwanhh) February 24, 2025 Effective Risk Management Through CopperHQ and Insurance Fund Ethena’s demonstrated resilience in the face of the Bybit hack is mostly a reflection of its strong risk management framework. At the heart of this framework is a partnership with CopperHQ, which offers ClearLoop. ClearLoop is a system that allows users to post collateral in a way that does not require them to deposit the asset onto a centralized exchange. This is a very clever first line of defense against a problem that is, in essence, a hack of a centralized exchange. It is very much in line with the ethos of decentralized finance—guarding your asset in a manner that does not require you to trust a single point of failure. Ethena has an Insurance Fund to cover any potential losses from unforeseen events, in addition to ClearLoop. Although there was an unsettled $30 million PnL on Bybit, the Insurance Fund has not been required, as Bybit has already settled the PnL. Ethena appears committed to maintaining a high level of collateralization, evident in the platform’s USDe currently being 101% overcollateralized, per its transparency page. For anyone concerned about potential risks related to unhedged positions, Ethena’s monthly attestation report, which typically is released at the end of each month, should provide additional clarity. Looking Ahead: Ethena’s Growth and Future Plans Even though the revenue has slightly decreased because of the declining funding rates, Ethena’s liquidity and total value locked (TVL) have remained stable. The platform keeps pushing forward and has several exciting new initiatives in the works—most notably, potentially launching a fee switch for sENA holders and introducing iUSDe, a new product that will offer institutional-grade stability. A $100 million funding commitment from two of the world’s largest asset managers—Franklin Templeton and Fidelity—has propelled Ethena into the financial stratosphere. These developments do not just give Ethena an air of credibility and potential for growth; they make it a real contender in the race to provide retail and institutional investors with innovative fintech solutions. To conclude, Ethena has displayed solid risk management and resilience, despite the market situation and the recent hack of Bybit. The platform maintains a clearly stated commitment to overcollateralization; it offers users competitive yields that make it a stable and fairly attractive decentralized finance option. Ethena has a number of big developments cooking that could significantly expand its offerings and user base. From where I sit, its future appears quite bright.

40811547,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133696,1740476465,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Beware: Shocking Fake SBF Account Claims Trump Pardon & DOGE Team Onboarding!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fake-sbf-account-crypto-scams/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The ever-turbulent world of digital currencies has thrown us another curveball, and this time, it involves a dash of political intrigue, a sprinkle of meme magic, and a whole lot of deception. A fake X account impersonating none other than the infamous FTX founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), has sent shockwaves through the crypto community with some outlandish claims. Let’s dive into this bizarre situation and unpack what’s really going on. The Rise of the Fake SBF Account and Outlandish Claims Imagine scrolling through your X feed and seeing a post from Sam Bankman-Fried, seemingly back from the digital wilderness. Exciting, right? Well, pump the brakes. An account with the handle @SBF_DOGE has emerged, masquerading as the real SBF. This fake SBF account didn’t just stop at impersonation; it went full throttle into the realm of misinformation, making some truly eyebrow-raising announcements. Claim 1: Presidential Pardon by Trump – In a move that would undoubtedly send ripples through both the crypto and political spheres, the fake account declared that SBF had received a pardon from former U.S. President Donald Trump. This is a HUGE claim, especially considering SBF’s ongoing legal battles. Claim 2: Joining the DOGE Team – As if a presidential pardon wasn’t enough, the account further asserted that SBF was now part of the DOGE team. Yes, you read that right, the team behind Dogecoin, the original memecoin sensation. This claim is particularly bizarre, mixing the serious world of FTX’s collapse with the lighthearted, meme-driven culture of Dogecoin. Claim 3: Memecoin Launch – Adding fuel to the fire, the fake account then announced the launch of a new memecoin , even dropping a contract address. This is a classic tactic in the crypto world – create hype, launch a coin, and potentially profit from unsuspecting investors. The Grey Checkmark: A False Sense of Legitimacy? Here’s where things get even trickier. This fake SBF account was granted a grey verification checkmark by X. For those unfamiliar, a grey checkmark is supposed to signify accounts belonging to government or multilateral organizations. This lends an air of undeserved legitimacy to the account, making it appear more credible than it actually is. This raises serious questions about X’s verification process and how easily it can be manipulated to facilitate identity and information fraud, especially in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. The grey checkmark, intended to build trust, in this case, seems to have inadvertently become a tool for deception. It highlights a crucial challenge in the age of social media – discerning authentic information from carefully crafted falsehoods. For crypto users, already navigating a complex landscape, this adds another layer of risk. SBF’s Real Account Returns: A Cryptic Message Adding another layer of intrigue to this saga, Sam Bankman-Fried’s official X account, the real one, sprang back to life today after a two-year period of inactivity. However, instead of addressing the swirling rumors or the fake account, SBF posted something completely unrelated to crypto. This sudden, yet cryptic return to social media by the genuine SBF, amidst the chaos of the fake SBF account , is certainly raising eyebrows and fueling speculation within the crypto community. What does it mean? Is it a coincidence? Or is there a deeper game at play? Why is This Important and What are the Dangers of Crypto Scams? This incident isn’t just about a funny impersonation gone wrong. It underscores some critical issues within the cryptocurrency ecosystem: Rampant Misinformation and Crypto Scams The crypto space, while brimming with innovation and opportunity, is also a breeding ground for crypto scams and misinformation. The speed at which information (and disinformation) travels on social media platforms like X can be dizzying. Fake accounts, like the one impersonating SBF, can exploit this speed to spread false narratives and manipulate market sentiment. The Allure of Memecoins and Pump-and-Dump Schemes Memecoins , by their very nature, are often driven by hype and community sentiment rather than fundamental value. While some have seen incredible gains, they are also highly susceptible to pump-and-dump schemes. The fake SBF account’s announcement of a new memecoin is a classic example of leveraging hype to potentially lure unsuspecting investors into a risky venture. Always remember the golden rule: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. The Need for Vigilance and Due Diligence This entire episode serves as a stark reminder of the need for extreme vigilance in the crypto world. Here are some actionable insights to protect yourself: Verify Information Sources: Don’t take information at face value, especially on social media. Cross-reference news from multiple reputable sources. Be Wary of Verification Marks: Even verified accounts can be compromised or, as in this case, misleading. Grey checkmarks are not foolproof indicators of authenticity. Exercise Caution with Memecoins: Approach memecoins with extreme caution. Understand the risks involved and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Follow Official Channels: For updates on projects and individuals, rely on official websites and confirmed official social media accounts (and even then, be skeptical). Report Suspicious Activity: If you encounter fake accounts or potential scams, report them to the social media platform and relevant authorities. The Sam Bankman-Fried Saga Continues The saga of Sam Bankman-Fried is far from over. From the dramatic collapse of FTX to ongoing legal proceedings, and now, fake social media accounts spreading misinformation, the story continues to unfold in unexpected ways. This latest incident highlights the complex intersection of cryptocurrency, social media, and the ever-present threat of scams and deception. In Conclusion: Stay Alert and Stay Safe in Crypto The emergence of this fake SBF account and its audacious claims about a Trump pardon and joining the DOGE team is a stark reminder of the wild west nature of the crypto space. It’s a world of incredible innovation but also rife with risks. Staying informed, being skeptical, and practicing due diligence are your best defenses against crypto scams and misinformation. Don’t let the allure of quick gains cloud your judgment. Always verify, always question, and always prioritize your security.

The announcement comes at a time when the crypto market is facing a significant downturn, sparking optimism among investors. With key updates rolling out, many market watchers predict a potential breakout for LUNC price. Binance Extends Support To Terra Luna Classic Upgrade In a recent update, Binance confirmed its support for the Terra Luna Classic network upgrade. The exchange stated that deposits and withdrawals on the Terra Classic network would be suspended on February 25, 2025, at 14:00 UTC. The upgrade itself is set to occur at block height 22,176,864, scheduled for 15:00 UTC the same day. Meanwhile, Binance assured users that LUNC and related token trading would not be affected. The top crypto exchange also stated that it will handle all technical requirements involved in the upgrade. Once the network stabilizes post-upgrade, deposits and withdrawals will resume without any further announcements. This move by Binance indicates a strong commitment to the Terra Luna Classic ecosystem, further boosting confidence in LUNC’s long-term potential. What’s New In Terra Luna Classic Upgrade? The Terra Classic v3.4.0 update, scheduled for February 25, introduces several key improvements. The most notable change is the removal of fork modules, transitioning all logic and code to an updated repository. This ensures a more efficient and streamlined system. The update also brings security patches to address vulnerabilities. Enhancements include fixes for Wasmvm v1.5.8, Patch CWA-2025-001, and Patch CWA-2025-002, ensuring better security for network participants. Additional fixes for CometBFT v0.37.15 and Patch ASA-2025-001 & ASA-2025-002 further strengthen network resilience. Another key feature is the Multisend Tax Handling Fix, which optimizes multi-send transactions by addressing reverse charge implementation issues. This update aims to improve transaction efficiency on the network. Meanwhile, validators must also upgrade their Go installation to version 1.22.12 before proceeding with the client upgrade. The upgrade itself does not introduce any changes to the chain’s state, ensuring that existing applications and smart contracts will continue to function normally. LUNC Community Approves Another Major Upgrade In addition to the Binance-backed update, the Terra Luna Classic community has overwhelmingly voted in favor of another software upgrade. The proposal, titled “Terra — 4834 | Msg Software Upgrade v2.15.0”, was submitted on February 24, 2025. This upgrade focuses on critical bug fixes aimed at improving chain liveness. With the community’s full support and Binance’s commitment to the ecosystem, LUNC’s future appears strong. The recent developments may set the stage for a potential LUNC price surge, attracting further investor interest. Will LUNC Price Breakout Soon? The backing from Binance and the successful rollout of key updates position Terra Luna Classic for a potential price breakout. Historically, network upgrades and major exchange support have driven positive market sentiment. With LUNC price now on the radar of traders, a bullish momentum could be on the horizon. However, amid a broader crypto market crash , LUNC price today was down about 6.6% and exchanged hands at $0.00006492, while its trading volume rocketed 92% to $26.11 million. LUNC Futures Open Interest stayed near the flatline at 9.56%. Despite that, a recent LUNC price analysis hints at a potential breakout ahead to $0.0001, sparking market optimism. Meanwhile, the LUNA price today was down around 11%, resembling the gloomy sentiment hovering in the broader crypto market. USTC price was also down around 12% during writing.

The widely-watched Crypto Fear and Greed Index, a market indicator that uses social media posts, volatility, trends and prices to gauge trader sentiment, dropped to a five-month low of 25 in its latest update. That’s a big fall from yesterday’s figure of 49, landing it in the “extreme fear” zone, coming as overall market capitalization fell 10% in the past 24 hours as bitcoin and major tokens such as Solana (SOL) and xrp (XRP) fell more than 14%. The Fear and Greed Index measures how people feel about crypto on a scale from 0 to 100. A low number, like 25, means fear is taking over, while a high number shows excitement or greed. Tuesday’s drop from 49 to 25 is one of the sharpest since September and indicative of a quick shift toward overly bearish sentiment. Reasons for the panic range from money flowing out of bitcoin ETFs, with over $1 billion pulled out in the last two weeks, to the general lack of catalysts to sustain a run that started with crypto-friendly Republican Donald Trump’s win in the November elections. Elsewhere, Nasdaq futures pointed to continued losses in technology stocks ahead on Tuesday, and strength in the Japanese yen is sparking fears of an August-like risk aversion . There’s hope for bulls, however. Extreme fear can be a sign that investors are too worried, turning into a buying opportunity in the short term as assets are considered oversold. Some traders also say poor U.S. economic data could mean central banks are forced to take steps to recharge the economy — a move that may eventually fuel a rally.",Markets|Bitcoin|Bear market|Fear and greed|fear and greed index,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-25 09:41:45
40811549,https://nulltx.com/?p=145800,1740476538,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Crypto Investment Products See Major Outflows Amid Market Uncertainty,https://nulltx.com/crypto-investment-products-see-major-outflows-amid-market-uncertainty/,"The total net outflows from crypto investment products hit $508 million last week, a notable shift in investor sentiment. The outflows over the last two weeks have totaled $924 million. But last week’s outflows are what really caught our attention. They follow an 18-week inflow streak during which over $1 billion flowed into the market. The abrupt change in sentiment from a 55% inflow to a 7% outflow over the two-week period made us dig into the why and who behind last week’s outflows. The latest outflows indicate that crypto investors are becoming more cautious. What is driving this? A variety of external factors seems to be at play. For one, there’s the ongoing uncertainty in our U.S. trade relations—an issue that touches not just crypto but our overall economy. Inflation is another hot topic that’s been keeping many investors on edge. They now see it as a “when, not if” scenario in terms of how it will impact their investment returns. Monetary policy, and how central banks are managing their interest rates and economies, is also a big question mark hanging over many asset classes, including crypto. Investor Sentiment Shifts Amid Economic Uncertainty For the past few weeks, there has been a marked slowdown in the inflow of capital into the crypto markets, as the investor hunger for risk has subsided. Ethereum’s Realized Cap, a metric that reflects the total value of all assets that have moved on-chain, saw a minor 0.1% net outflow. While the size of the outflow might indicate some level of stability, the continued retreat of risk-seeking capital into the Ethereum blockchain is concerning. Is this behavior specific to Ethereum, or is it an omen for the continued retreat of investor risk appetite? Recent weeks have seen a softening of market sentiment, especially in sectors like memecoins, where investment has been driven largely by speculation. The Memecoins Index last week lost 5.9%, indicating that even the most sharply speculative (and reward-prone) corners of the market are pulling back right now. Despite hopes that the price of bitcoin might shoot back up to the $100,000 level later this year, the market is still digesting a steady diet of trade policy and inflation concern, and that doesn’t help confidence, especially in these high-risk tokens. The outflows happen when the broader economic environment remains unsettled. The murkiness surrounding trade with China, endless inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate decisions have made many investors gun-shy. With the global economy in such a state, is it really any wonder that some market participants are moving into safe assets and cutting back on their already low allocations to risky ones like cryptocurrencies? That said, the growth of the past year is making many in the crypto world wonder just how resilient what’s being called the “crypto bull market” can really be. Risk Appetite Dips as Speculation Fades One of the most principal developments in recent weeks has been the clear and distinct nosedive in speculative interest within the crypto market. Speculative investments have, for some time now, been the major driving force behind the crypto sector’s growth. Investors have chased unimaginable high returns from emerging tokens, DeFi projects, and memecoins. But as our current economic risk climate grows more precarious, many of these same investors appear to be pivoting—shifting their focus from speculative plays in the crypto sector to safer, more stable assets. The shift in investments in memecoins is hard to miss. Once thought to be a speculative playground, the memecoin market now seems bereft of speculative interest. Over the past week, the Memecoins Index has dropped almost 6%. To be sure, these sorts of downturns are nothing new in the memecoin space, a sector that’s always been highly volatile and susceptible to tanking for any number of reasons (recent crypto regulations, for example). But what is new is that the memecoins market doesn’t seem to have any prospective upticks waiting in the wings. If anything, traders who might have once been tempted to meme their way into a new memecoin seem to be occupied elsewhere, perhaps even out of the market altogether. Crypto investment products just saw $508M in net outflows last week—back-to-back weeks of withdrawals. Total outflows now at $924M in two weeks after an 18-week inflow streak. Investors are playing it safe with all the U.S. trade, inflation, and monetary policy uncertainty.… pic.twitter.com/A4PmyAcBf2 — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) February 24, 2025 The overall slowing of capital inflows into the wider crypto market is further reflecting the trend of dwindling speculative interest. Investor confidence is clearly not what it was last year when the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum had just reached their all-time highs. Many market participants have pulled back; they’re playing it safe, remaining on the sidelines, and now waiting for more clarity to re-enter the market with gusto. And across the crypto market, this cooling effect seems to be finding its way into everything from “blue chip” cryptocurrencies like Ethereum to the more exotic segments of the market. The Waiting Game: Will Market Caution Stick? With the market now in a cautious withdrawal, the big question on everybody’s mind is whether this slowdown will persist or whether it will simply be a temporary pause before the next surge. While the near-term appearance is one of caution, the world of crypto is known for its volatility and sharp rebounds. Investors are clearly waiting for a clear signal to gauge the next move. Many are hesitant to make bold moves and are sitting mostly on the sidelines until there’s a bit more certainty around the global economic landscape and regulatory developments. To sum up, the current crypto market is a bit uncertain. Investors have moved to a more cautious mode. Crypto investment products have seen recent outflows. Speculative interests in “memecoins” and other high-risk assets seem to have cooled. Risk appetite appears diminished. The overall economy remains uncertain. Many investors are pulling back until they get clearer signals. We are in what feels like a temporary lull. Two questions remain: Will we stay in this lull for a long time? Or will we break out of it soon with another market rally? Regardless of the answers to those questions, it seems pretty clear that the crypto market is moving into a more cautious, risk-averse mode.

Crypto Patreons deliver exclusive content and community access for enthusiasts and traders alike. Below, we analyze four standout options based on expertise, offerings, and value. The Best in Crypto Patreon Content 1. Jacob’s Crypto Clan Jacob Bury, also known by his moniker Jacob Crypto Bury, leads Jacob’s Crypto Clan . His Patreon has cultivated a loyal following drawn to his knack for spotting market trends and presale opportunities. Subscribers gain access to detailed breakdowns of coins with high growth potential, often before they hit mainstream radar. Jacob provides trading signals—specific entry and exit points—alongside leverage strategies tailored for those comfortable with risk. He also dives into high-reward plays, offering clarity on volatile markets. The real draw is direct interaction with Jacob himself; members note it feels personal, like a small, focused crew rather than a sprawling network. However, that’s not to say that the network is anywhere small. Jacob Crypto Bury’s YouTube channel has over 55K members already. While the community size isn’t vast, its engagement level compensates, making it a top choice for proactive investors hunting early wins. For anyone prioritizing presales and insider analysis, this Patreon delivers consistent value. 2. Crypto Seth’s Patreon Crypto Seth commands a YouTube audience of over 24,000, and his Patreon takes that expertise up a notch. Designed for hands-on learning, it offers private webinars where Seth walks through market moves, portfolio reviews to refine individual strategies, and cheat sheets summarizing key tactics. Q&A sessions let members ask pointed questions, bridging the gap between free content and personalized advice. The focus here is education—whether you’re new to crypto or sharpening advanced skills, Seth adapts to your level. Exclusive material ensures you’re not just rehashing public posts, adding tangible worth. Tiers start higher than some competitors, but the one-on-one guidance justifies the cost for committed subscribers. Members praise the clarity and depth, citing real improvements in their trading decisions. For those seeking a mentor-like experience in crypto, this Patreon stands out and has been rated highly on many comparison sites. 3. Crypto Tips With over a decade in crypto investing, Crypto Tips brings seasoned perspective to its Patreon.

Updates roll out regularly, keeping the content fresh without drowning subscribers in noise. Unlike signal-focused groups chasing quick trades, Crypto Tips emphasizes sustainable approaches, appealing to those who value patience over speculation. The clarity and context set it apart, offering a foundation that’s both practical and forward-looking. If you want to understand crypto’s bigger picture, this is a dependable resource. 4. CryptoBitcoinChris CryptoBitcoinChris oversees a 833-member community geared for real-time market action. Through Patreon, subscribers join multiple Telegram groups buzzing with trading setups, breaking news, and technical analysis. Daily signals provide precise buy-in and profit-taking levels, aiming to capitalize on short-term swings. A private YouTube channel hosts over 70 videos—tutorials, market recaps, and more—while weekly live sessions with screen sharing keep members in sync. The Telegram setup thrives on collaboration; members swap ideas and refine strategies together, creating a dynamic, group-driven vibe. It’s built for traders who prioritize profitability and live updates, though the volume of activity might overwhelm novices. The community’s scale and energy make it a powerhouse for active participants. For those who thrive on teamwork and immediacy, this Patreon hits the mark. What Sets These Patreons Apart Each Patreon carves its niche. Jacob’s Crypto Clan excels in presale scouting and personal access, though its smaller size limits broader networking. Crypto Seth’s strength lies in tailored education—webinars and portfolio reviews offer a classroom feel—but entry costs skew higher. Crypto Tips shines with economic context, connecting crypto to global forces, yet it skips trading signals for short-term gains. CryptoBitcoinChris drives real-time collaboration via Telegram and live sessions, though its pace suits seasoned traders over beginners. Content frequency varies: Jacob and Chris push daily updates, Seth offers structured sessions, and Tips balances regular posts with depth. Community engagement runs high across all, but styles differ—Jacob’s intimacy versus Chris’ scale, Seth’s mentorship versus Tips’ broad appeal. Your pick hinges on what you need: presale leads, learning, trends, or group momentum. Who Benefits Most from These Patreons? These Patreons cater to distinct audiences. Beginners gravitate to Crypto Tips for its foundational insights or Seth’s step-by-step coaching—both ease the learning curve. Active traders favor Jacob’s signals for quick presale plays or CryptoBitcoinChris’ live updates for market responsiveness. Long-term investors align with Crypto Tips’ macro focus, valuing stability over flash trades. Risk-takers hunting untapped coins lean toward Jacob’s presale edge. Costs range from $4 to $112 monthly, reasonable if the output matches your goals—Jacob’s insights often offset fees with early wins, while Seth’s guidance pays off in skill growth. Commitment matters too; casual dabblers might find free content elsewhere, but serious players gain from the exclusivity and community. If you’re invested in crypto’s potential, these subscriptions bridge knowledge gaps public platforms can’t fill. Are Crypto Patreons Worth the Investment? Evaluating worth depends on execution. Jacob’s track record of spotting presales—like coins that later surge—suggests real returns for proactive members. Seth’s detailed reviews have helped subscribers tweak portfolios, often avoiding costly missteps. Crypto Tips’ economic ties equip users to weather downturns, a boon for long-term planning. CryptoBitcoinChris’ signals and group input have driven short-term profits, per member feedback. Costs feel steep if you don’t engage - $20 monthly wastes if ignored—but active use turns insights into action. Compared to free YouTube or X posts, Patreons offer depth and direct access, cutting through noise. Risks exist; crypto’s volatility means no guarantees, and creators aren’t advisors. Still, for disciplined users, the value outweighs the price when leveraged well. Conclusion Crypto’s complexity rewards those with the right tools. Jacob’s Crypto Clan, Crypto Seth’s Patreon, Crypto Tips, and CryptoBitcoinChris each bring unique strengths—presale picks, personalized learning, economic grounding, and live collaboration. They offer exclusive content and communities that free channels can’t match, from Jacob’s insider edge to Chris’ trading hive. Whether you’re starting out, trading daily, or planning years ahead, one of these fits. Subscriptions aren’t cheap thrills - demand engagement to pay off - but for those committed to crypto, they’re a step up from the basics.

40811674,https://nulltx.com/?p=145799,1740476722,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Wallets Target Niche Sectors with Strategic Accumulations,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-wallets-target-niche-sectors-with-strategic-accumulations/,"In the last 24 hours, some high-profile investors have been rapidly accumulating substantial quantities of certain assets—seeming to indicate a shift toward a few new narratives within the crypto space. These appear to be centered around not just one or two types of assets but three distinct themes: meme coins, AI agents, and decentralized healthcare. Key Accumulation Trends: Meme Coins, AI Agents, and Health & Biotech A prevailing trend seems to be that the meme coin sector is gaining momentum, with “smart money” wallets accumulating $Fartcoin—a coin with a humorous backstory that has become a rising star in the meme coin space. Meanwhile, the omnipresent AI sector continues to attract industry and investor interest, with wallets piling into $DOGEAI and $ARC—seen as major players in the evolving world of AI governance and infrastructure. The health and biotech sector has attracted attention as well, with a seemingly motivated group of investors accumulating $WEL, an ambitious decentralized health data sharing platform, and $MPL, a token representing a decentralized credit market. Meme Coins: A New Frontier for Smart Money Undeniably, meme coins have established a foothold in the world of crypto, and $Fartcoin is currently at the center of smart money wallet activity. Over the past 24 hours, three wallets with high net worth have accumulated a total of $96,000 in $Fartcoin, driving its market cap to $301 million. What started as a joke has now evolved into something with real potential—increasingly, investors are recognizing the asset’s meme potential, as well as the value found in its growing community and viral nature. According to @ShitcoinParty, not only is $Fartcoin’s meme potential commanding attention, but it’s also the focus of bets being placed on the next big trend in the meme coin market. Academic experts have considered meme coins to be highly speculative and profitable assets. The present attention on $Fartcoin illustrates this. Nonetheless, $Fartcoin has smart money behind it now, apparently because it has gained viral momentum. That said, the study of $Fartcoin now becomes a study in the money-making potential for asset classes with no seriously intended underlying value or use case. In fact, investors in the space seem to be writing their own story with $Fartcoin as the next hilarious, profitable punchline. AI Agents: Rising Interest in Governance and Infrastructure Another sector that has captured the focus of intelligent-money investors is the quickly burgeoning field of AI agents. With AI continuing to evolve and integrate into various industries, $DOGEAI and $ARC have emerged as key assets for high-net-worth investors looking to gain exposure to this new wave of technological advancements. $DOGEAI, a token located at the intersection of AI and governance, has been bought up by two smart money wallets for a combined total of $35,000. The token’s focus on AI governance makes it a compelling bet to play the very near future of decision-making systems, where AI is going to play an even larger, and hopefully better, role. Notably, @MarioNawfal has highlighted the token’s governance angle as a reason to be bullish on it, suggesting that we could see some impressive price action in $DOGEAI as the story of AI continues to unfold. In the same way, attention is being focused on $ARC, or the AI Rig Complex, with two astute investor wallets raking in $33,000 worth of the token. $ARC has earned a reputation for not only striking impressive partnerships but also for its potential to play a pivotal role in the establishment of AI infrastructure. These are two aspects that make $ARC a strong candidate in the conversation around which entities will power the next generation of AI projects. Experts like @immutablejacob, for instance, have taken a deep dive into the $ARC ecosystem and provided some extensive coverage of the project. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: MEME (4 wallets) AI agents (9 wallets) Health & Biotech (4 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $Fartcoin -> Despite its humorous origins, $Fartcoin is gaining… pic.twitter.com/DhVLazVoco — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) February 24, 2025 Health & Biotech: Decentralized Data Sharing Gains Traction As the crypto space keeps on growing into new sectors, the health and biotech industries are now beginning to attract interest from smart money wallets. One token that has been impressive enough to merit coverage is $WEL, which is concentrated on decentralized sharing of health data. With healthcare and medical research becoming increasingly electronic, we expect platforms that enable secure and transparent data sharing to be all-important in the not-so-distant future. In the last day, two smart money wallets have purchased $8,000 of $WEL, which has a present market cap of $4.7 million. While the $WEL project isn’t in the DeFi realm, it is looking to revolutionize the $5 trillion global healthcare market through a system of decentralized data sharing. Healthcare is one of several industries where blockchain technology could have a serious impact. Investors in $WEL appear to believe that the system it is constructing could make it a serious player in the global healthcare ecosystem. Furthermore, $MPL, the Maple Token, has drawn interest in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. One smart money wallet acquired $MPL for $10,000, which brought the token’s market cap up to $56 million. @GHancoc37493642 drew attention to the token’s recent listing on Coinbase—a move that’s almost certainly juicing its appeal to prospective investors. Smart Money Diversifying into Emerging Sectors Smart money wallets are up to something new. They aren’t just investing in the tried-and-true cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and they’re definitely not just following the crowd into fairly mainstream altcoins. Instead, these wallets are throwing a lot of weight behind some very niche, and very cryptocurrency-like, sectors: decentralized AI, meme coins with apparently massive community buy-in, and some seriously shady-looking decentralized healthcare solutions, among others. If this is what “smart” investors do when they’re looking for the next big thing, then the next big thing should probably be looked at askance. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

It raised a total of $2.0 billion. This offering is part of the company’s strategy to boost its financial flexibility while it makes big moves in the cryptocurrency business. The notes will not pay any interest until 2030, meaning Strategy will not send out any immediate cash interest to investors, but will in fact convert into stock for the investors at some unspecified later date. Financing in this way is a favorite among tech and crypto firms looking to fund themselves and keep their balance sheets light on actual cash costs. Strategy announced today that it has completed its previously announced offering of 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030. The aggregate principal amount of notes sold in the offering was $2.0 billion. Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 24, 2025 Proceeds from the offering will go to general corporate purposes, which we can presume includes buying more bitcoin, bolstering working capital, and making other unspecified investments that will help the company take advantage of the “booming cryptocurrency market.” Strategy’s plans might be as nebulous as this language suggests, but they could offer some more detail around the use of proceeds when they report next week. BTC Acquisitions and Impressive YTD Yield in 2025 As part of its ongoing investment strategy, Strategy confirmed that it had recently obtained a large quantity of bitcoin. The company disclosed the purchase of 20,356 BTC, bringing its total holdings to around 30,000 BTC. At the time of purchase, these coins represented a nearly $2 billion bet on a still-recovering bitcoin market. Even factoring in bitcoin’s dramatic price drops throughout most of 2022, Strategy’s average price of around $97,514 per coin suggests a confident expectation of much higher prices in the near future. Cryptocurrencies are often considered to be very volatile. Nevertheless, Strategy has secured a solid performance in investing in bitcoin. The company reported an astonishing BTC yield of 6.9% as of February 2025. This done not only highlights the strength of bitcoin as a store of value but also underlines the success of Strategy’s decision to hoard and accumulate large amounts of BTC over time. As far as I know, no other company has attempted to run this particular playbook. And Strategy continues to operate by this same playbook with no apparent hiccups along the way. As of February 23, 2025, Strategy holds a total of 499,096 BTC, with an amassed valuation of about $33.1 billion. Collectively, these holdings were obtained at an average price of around $66,357 per bitcoin, marking an opportune selection of entry points when prices were relatively low. This near half-a-million holding makes Strategy one of the largest institutional holders of bitcoin in the world, and it puts the firm alongside such players as Galaxy Digital and Fidelity in a yet-to-occur “currency revolution” in which transformation of financial markets is at stake. Strategy has acquired 20,356 BTC for ~$1.99B at ~$97,514 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 6.9% YTD 2025. As of 2/23/2025, we hodl 499,096 BTC acquired for ~$33.1 billion at ~$66,357 per bitcoin. https://t.co/738lx75nFT — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 24, 2025 The Strategic Vision Behind Bitcoin Acquisitions Strategy continues to invest in bitcoin, which aligns with its vision of diversifying its financial portfolio and taking advantage of the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies. Its convertible notes offering yielded $350 million, and it used that money—along with some of its cash—to buy 10,000 bitcoins. That’s roughly $420 million worth of the digital asset, at current prices, though we know bitcoin is highly volatile and its worth could change dramatically at any moment. This strategy not only gives us diversification but also places us in a position to benefit from the potential upside in the crypto market—especially Bitcoin, which in recent years has really captured the attention of institutional investors. When you consider the inflationary pressures we’ve seen recently and the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment, Bitcoin looks better and better. Our holdings in Bitcoin as part of our investment lineup could provide us with meaningful financial leverage as this whole market matures. In addition, Strategy’s choice to finance through convertible notes is a well-considered way to trim down near-term cash demands. The 0% convertible notes gift the investors with optionality and lots of it. They allow Strategy to bring in more capital to turbocharge its investment thrust into the realm of crypto assets. And they do it while aligning perfectly with the company’s aims of keeping its funding mix flexible, its balance sheet virtually unencumbered, and its investment base predominantly in high-yielding, higher-risk opportunities like the ones in the world of virtual currencies. Looking Ahead: Strategy’s Role in the Crypto Ecosystem Accumulating a significant amount of bitcoin, Strategy is setting the stage for further expansion in the cryptocurrency space. The company is using financial instruments like convertible notes and accumulating BTC in a way that could soon make it one of the most prominent institutional players in the digital asset market. The potential upside for companies like Strategy is only being increased by the consistent growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain-based projects, and the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. Strategy continues to acquire bitcoin at what it determines are favorable prices, and it is also making a series of strategic investments. These moves position Strategy not just for the future of money, which we think involves bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but also to profit from the continued growth and maturation of the cryptocurrency industry. A long-term vision, disciplined approach, and increasing bitcoin holdings all position Strategy to maintain its status as a leader in the digital asset market, which remains in flux. Whatever else may occur in 2025, the company’s decision making is sure to affect its own financial performance and the cryptocurrency space at large.

The total value locked (TVL) across all the L2 networks reached a remarkable $37.62 billion. This was a 3.03% increase over the week before, by far the biggest jump in recent memory. And it’s not hard to figure out why: As Ethereum’s Layer 1 (L1) continues to suffer from scalability problems and exorbitant gas fees, more and more projects looking to build on it are simply skipping L1 and going right to L2. And you know what? That makes dApps built on the Ethereum framework as a whole a lot more efficient and a lot more cost-effective. According to @L2BEAT , the total TVL of Ethereum Layer2 networks has reached $37.62B, up 3.03% in the past 7 days. Top 5 L2s by TVL: 1⃣ Arbitrum One – $14.52B (+2.1%) 2⃣ Base – $12.35B (+3.8%) 3⃣ OP Mainnet – $5.39B (+4.5%) 4⃣ ZKsync Era – $950M (-1.2%) 5⃣ Starknet – $690M… pic.twitter.com/7exDSF3fIO — OKX Ventures (@OKX_Ventures) February 23, 2025 The increase in TVL across Layer 2 networks is a favorable development for the Ethereum ecosystem. Of the top five Layer 2 networks in terms of TVL, Arbitrum One, Base, and Optimism Mainnet are out in front, and each of these networks showcases truly impressive growth, even when the overall crypto market seems to be sputtering. Top Ethereum Layer 2 Networks by TVL Arbitrum One heads the pack with a total value locked (TVL) of $14.52 billion, showing a 2.1% increase in the last seven days. The Layer 2 hasn’t just secured its place; it’s a widely adopted solution for Ethereum users. Arbitrum, in this case, isn’t just the most dominant; it’s the most impressive scaling solution for Ethereum to date. Optimistic rollups, which are a sort of layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, power it along with some relay logic. Right behind is Base, a Layer 2 solution built by Coinbase, with a TVL of $12.35 billion. Base has seen an impressive 3.8% bump in its TVL, highlighting its rapid growth and rising popularity among developers and users. Base most likely gets that rising popularity from its seamless integration with Coinbase’s established infrastructure and the strong adoption that comes from being one of the most prominent crypto exchange platforms. With a TVL of $5.39 billion, Optimism Mainnet occupies the third position, and it is a place the rollup race frontrunner seems happy to be in, showing a 4.5% uptick over the week. The faster, cheaper Layer 2 network certainly accommodates both big and small apps looking to efficiently scale. That said, the major use case of Optimism’s rollups is still ahead of it: like the Layer 1 Ethereum network itself, the Optimism rollup is still a work in progress. By contrast with the rising stars that are Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base, which focus on using optimistic rollups, ZKsync Era and Starknet, both of which work on a type of zero-knowledge rollup called zk-rollups, have seen somewhat slower growth. With a total value locked (TVL) of around $950 million, ZKsync Era is in fourth place among layer-2 networks, but it lost a slight 1.2% in TVL over the past week. Starknet, a network that uses zk-rollups, has shown a more solid growth path with a 3.5% increase in TVL over that same week. Its only current figure is about $690 million. While both networks are working on what is thought to be a more advanced way of doing a rollup, they are in the early stage of what appears to be a nascent adoption story compared to the optimistic developments surrounding Arbitrum and others. Arbitrum DAO’s Investment Proposal Sparks Controversy Although the overall growth of Ethereum’s Layer 2 ecosystem is quite promising, one recent development has caused eyebrows to raise in the Arbitrum community. The Arbitrum DAO Growth Management Committee (GMC) recently proposed a plan to invest 7,500 ETH—valued at about $12 million—into three non-Arbitrum native protocols: Lido, Aave, and Fluid. The proposal has been met with some intense backlash from several DAO representatives and community members who are not too pleased with the idea of investing what they see as community funds into non-Arbitrum native projects. The Arbitrum DAO Growth Management Committee (GMC) recently proposed to invest 7,500 ETH in three non-Arbitrum native protocols, Lido, Aave and Fluid, sparking community criticism. Several DAO representatives criticized the proposal for ignoring Arbitrum ecosystem native… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 24, 2025 Some critics have expressed unease that the proposal favors investments made outside the ecosystem of Arbitrum. Arbitrum, a premier Layer 2 solution on Ethereum, has its own growing ecosystem of dApps and protocols. Many people associated with the Arbitrum project or who work in its ecosystem believe that funds should be directed toward supporting and investing in these “native” projects to secure the Arbitrum network’s sustainable growth. The pushback comes from a belief that the proposal neglects the native Arbitrum projects that could gain from further investment and backing. A number of DAO members contend that investing in protocols outside of Arbitrum could squander resources on things not likely to pay off in the long term. They see such investments as a step toward dulling the network’s competitive edge in the Layer 2 race—an edge that’s necessary if Arbitrum’s going to grow and thrive. The proposal has its defenders in the Arbitrum community, who make the case that relationships with other leading DeFi protocols—Lido, Aave, and the like—are worth pursuing. Doing so could yield “cross-network integrations” that provide more services and better ones to Arbitrum users; could bring “significantly more liquidity,” in the words of one community member; and could, overall, enhance “system functionality,” which should be the main focus of any blockchain community. Looking Ahead: Layer 2’s Role in Ethereum’s Future The Ethereum ecosystem’s ongoing development and growth signal a bright and promising future for this ever-expanding ecosystem. Layer 2 (L2) solutions have emerged almost alongside Ethereum itself, offering a way to overcome the challenges posed by using the Ethereum mainnet as it currently exists. When we look at the L2 landscape, we see an almost unending array of choices. The L2 world delivers a well-developed, steadily increasing set of options. The debate over Arbitrum’s investment proposal underscores a more profound, emerging discussion about Layer 2 governance and funding. As Arbitrum and other Layer 2 networks compete for users and builders, they face a fundamental choice: to invest in external projects that might yield high returns (but then again, maybe not), or to focus on internal developments that strengthen their own ecosystems? There are compelling arguments on both sides. It is evident that scalability is going to be a critical theme in the years ahead, especially with the advent of Ethereum’s proof-of-stake system and the ongoing development of Layer 2 technologies. These networks will not only grow and mature but also become quite consequential in terms of the overall blockchain ecosystem—much more so, I venture to say, than with their predecessor systems. The push toward decentralized finance and permissionless blockchain applications will take place largely on Ethereum and impact the broader blockchain economy.

ETF Speculation Heats Up,https://coingape.com/markets/litecoin-price-set-to-pump-or-dump-etf-speculation-heats-up/,"Litecoin price remains under pressure, hovering below the $120 support level as speculation over a potential exchange-traded fund (ETF) intensifies. The LTC price has seen increased volatility, with discussions on its ETF approval getting traction. Crypto Market analysts highlight signals, raising uncertainty about Litecoin’s short-term outlook. Will the Litecoin price recover or see more crashes ahead? let’s uncover. Litecoin Price Ready to Pump? ETF Approval Speculation Grows Litecoin price is forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern, signaling a potential breakout. The analyst shows a clear right shoulder formation, with price action testing the support zone near $115. A strong bounce from this level could confirm the pattern, setting up a move toward the neckline resistance at $140. If Litecoin breaks above this resistance, the price may rally toward the $200 target. Traders are closely monitoring this setup as speculation around Litecoin ETF approvals fuels momentum. Litecoin ETF Approval Odds Rise To 76% According to Polymarket, the probability of a Litecoin ETF gaining approval in the year 2025 has surged to 77%. This marks a 27% increase, reflecting growing optimism among market participants. The trading volume for this prediction market has reached $27,253, indicating strong interest in the potential regulatory decision. The data reveals that sentiment has strengthened since early Jan 2025, with sharp upward movements in mid month. However, recent market corrections show some uncertainty, with prices dipping slightly. The trend suggests continued speculation on whether Litecoin will follow Bitcoin’s ETF path this year. Source- Polymarket What Lies Ahead for LTC Price? As of Tuesday, the LTC price hovered at $112, making a 3% crash in the past 24 hours. This follows other crypto market decreases after a huge decrease over the past day. The Bitcoin price has fallen below $90,000 while the Ethereum price dropped below $2,500 Mark. Litecoin price has been moving down and broke the rejection at $120, support standing at $100. The Litecoin price forecast needs to break above the previous level of $120 to shift momentum toward $130 and $150. A move past these resistance levels could open the door to $160 and $170 ahead of LTC ETF. On the lower side, a break below the $100 critical support level may trigger further losses, with $80 emerging as the next key support. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 28, indicating the oversold zone. Additionally, The MACD indicator on the 4-hour chart remains in negative territory. The MACD line is above the signal line, confirming ongoing bearish momentum. The histogram also indicates strengthening selling pressure, hinting at further downside risks.

Memecoin’s major hub, Solana, has lost roughly $50 billion in market value in the past month. Trump’s economic policies fuel uncertainty in financial markets The crypto market is in turmoil due to rising economic uncertainties under Trump’s administration despite his promise to endorse the crypto industry. Trump’s latest economic moves involved imposing tariffs on Canada and Mexico and new restrictions on Chinese stakes in important sectors. Trump’s economic uncertainties have triggered a widespread risk-off market sentiment, leading investors to avoid risky assets and investment vehicles like crypto. As a result, U.S.-approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have also witnessed major outflows this month. According to data from ETF tracker SoSoValue, the ETFs have witnessed outflows worth $516.41M as of February 24th. The outflows marked a 4-day streak of negative flows that began on Feb 18th. U.S. Bitcoin ETFs still hold a significant amount of Bitcoin, valued at around $109.26 billion. The value represents 5.86% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization.

Fresh data from Glassnode shows that exchange inflow volumes have dropped sharply, which is usually a sign that on-chain activity is also dropping. Lower on-chain activity generally means lower network utilization, and it seems like the network is being utilized less and less these days. This shift in demand could denote a shift in investor sentiment toward Bitcoin. If it does, then this could have significant implications for how we price the asset going forward. Bitcoin Apparent Demand has dropped negative for the first time since September 2024. pic.twitter.com/MR6I5DGuOg — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 24, 2025 The volume of Bitcoin flowing into exchanges—which is a prime indicator of demand—has been decreasing. This signals that there is now a lower number of people sending Bitcoin to exchanges in order to buy or sell it. Generally, when people are not sending their Bitcoin to exchanges, there is not much buying or selling happening on said exchanges. And if there is not much happening on the exchanges, that is usually not a good sign for the overall cryptocurrency market. Strategy’s $2 Billion Bitcoin Purchase Amid Declining Demand In spite of these worrisome trends, one leading player is defying the market’s overall mood. Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has made a splash by reporting another large Bitcoin buy this week. The firm told us that it acquired an additional 20,365 BTC for around $2 billion, expanding its already record-setting Bitcoin treasury. With this latest buy, Strategy has more Bitcoin than just about any country on Earth, an astounding feat that really cements its place as one of the largest institutional holders of the cryptocurrency. #Bitcoin $BTC exchange inflow volume is shrinking, signaling lower on-chain activity, reduced investor interest, and declining network utilization. pic.twitter.com/51rFICly2A — Ali (@ali_charts) February 24, 2025 This $2 billion acquisition announcement came on Monday and has raised a few eyebrows in the crypto and financial communities. Where other investors might be pulling back and reevaluating their positions because of demand that seems to have cooled, Strategy seems to be plowing ahead. With the company’s eye fixed on the long-term—toward what Bitcoin’s prospects may well be half a decade from now—their bullishness seems to be, at worst, an outlier and, at best, a reason to think that maybe all is not as dire as some in the media have suggested. Indeed, the Strategy’s unyielding Bitcoin accumulation is part of a larger trend that has seen the firm add many thousands of BTC to its balance sheet in recent years. Presently, the company holds over 500,000 BTC, with an average cost basis of around $30,000 per Bitcoin. This strategy, which sees the organization purchase Bitcoin at various price points, underscores a belief that Bitcoin’s function as a valuable store of wealth will only intensify as inflation and global economic tumult show no signs of abating. Bitcoin Spot ETF Faces Significant Outflows Although Strategy’s acquisition is a clear sign that institutions are betting on Bitcoin, other corners of the market are starting to express concerns. The Bitcoin spot ETF experienced a net outflow of $559 million last week—from February 18 to February 21 (US Eastern Time). That was the second largest outflow in the Bitcoin spot ETF’s history. Unsurprisingly, the outflows from the ETF suggest that retail and institutional investors are pulling back from Bitcoin exposure. As the ongoing volatility in cryptocurrency markets continues to shake investor confidence, the outflows from the ETF could be interpreted as a shift toward diversification into other assets. Last week (February 18 to February 21, US Eastern Time), the Bitcoin spot ETF had a net outflow of US$559 million, and the Ethereum spot ETF had a net inflow of US$1.61 million. https://t.co/Tvs2oCS03I — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 24, 2025 The on-chain activity, exchange inflows, and Bitcoin-linked supply from large-scale financial products like ETFs have all been declining lately. Does this mean Bitcoin demand is falling, too? Despite the downward indicators taken together, I believe the opposite is true. I believe Bitcoin demand is only strengthening. And I believe the guys at Strategy, who are long Bitcoin, are correct when they say the fundamentals driving that demand are as strong as they’ve ever been. Long-Term Outlook for Bitcoin Amid Market Challenges The immediate market prospects for Bitcoin are unclear. Investor sentiment may remain fragile as concerns about inflation, regulatory scrutiny, and a potential tightening of monetary policy hover in the background. But some analysts believe that the recent decline in demand could simply be a market correction, with more speculative investors stepping back while the long-term, conviction-driven players that populate our base case continue to accumulate. To sum up, even if Bitcoin’s demand seems to be declining for now, with ETF outflows in particular suggesting that the market isn’t very active at the moment, Strategy’s $2 billion Bitcoin purchase that they just made last month is helping to highlight a serious divide between what sentiment appears to be in the short term and what very confident institutions seem to be betting on in the long term. And the only fact that this purchase is emphasizing is how intensely divisive opinions on Bitcoin seem to be right now. Some people think it’s a “digital gold” type of bet. Other people think it’s a risky way to lose a bunch of money. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The crypto market is full of surprises, and Solana has had its fair share of ups and downs. But instead of waiting around for Solana's growth, I found something even more exciting: Dawgz AI . ""I hopped into the Dawgz AI presale, and let’s just say… watching those AI trading bots do their thing is way more fun than waiting on SOL to move!"" - Jake F. Solana Price Overview: Where Are We Now? Solana has been through wild price shifts, and traders are keeping a close eye on its next move. With the current price still far from its all-time high, many are wondering if it can rally back to $300. Let's break down where SOL stands today and what factors are shaping its future. Current Solana Price & Market Trends The current price of SOL is fluctuating as the market reacts to shifting sentiment. While some believe in SOL’s growth, others are skeptical due to past network issues. The Solana market has seen a strong push from Solana NFTs and DeFi projects, but will that be enough? Analysts use the Solana prediction table to track price prediction trends, but nobody can say for sure if it will take off soon. Solana traders are closely watching the market capitalization and price shifts, waiting for a clear signal. Key Factors Affecting Solana's Price Blockchain adoption is rising, but competition is tough. The price of Solana depends on demand from Solana memecoins and DeFi projects. Solana’s price moves with overall market sentiment. The Solana network needs to maintain stability to support growth. Solana’s trading volume influences short-term price prediction trends. SOL Price History: The Highs, The Lows, and Everything in Between Solana has seen big growth, insane rallies, and brutal crashes. If you've been around the market long enough, you know how fast things change. Let’s take a quick trip down memory lane. Solana's Rise to the Top Back in its early days, SOL's growth was fueled by hype around its fast transactions and low fees. The price of Solana shot up as projects launched on the Solana blockchain, and traders poured in. At its peak, Solana (SOL) hit an all-time high near $260, making headlines and drawing comparisons to Ethereum. The Crash & Road to Recovery After the hype, the crash came hard. Network outages, FTX’s collapse, and the overall bear market sent the SOL price tumbling. The current Solana sentiment is mixed, with some hopeful for a rebound while others remain cautious. Meanwhile, Dawgz AI is grabbing attention with real utility and AI-powered trading, proving there's a better way to win in crypto. Solana Price Forecast: What Experts Are Saying The Solana price forecast is a mixed bag, with some predicting a strong rally and others staying cautious. Let’s break down the expert opinions. Some analysts believe the Solana price prediction looks promising, with SOL having the potential to hit $300 in the next rally. The market is watching SOL's growth, with more projects launching on the Solana blockchain. A surge in Solana NFTs and DeFi adoption could drive the price of Solana higher. On the flip side, traders remain wary due to past network issues and unpredictable price movements. The market cap of SOL has taken hits before, making a full recovery uncertain. The current sentiment is mixed as investors weigh risk versus reward. Forget Waiting - Dawgz AI is Where the Real Gains Are While people are stuck debating the next Solana price prediction, others are already making moves with Dawgz AI. This isn’t just another speculative token - it’s built for profits, with staking rewards, AI-powered trading, and a real roadmap. Let’s break down why $DAGZ is the smarter choice over waiting on SOL. Dawgz AI Staking: Earn While You Hold Instead of waiting for the price of Solana to recover, you could be earning passive income with Dawgz AI staking. ETH holders can lock in rewards with a competitive APY, meaning your investment grows automatically while you wait for the next bull run. Unlike the SOL network, where staking rewards fluctuate, $DAGZ makes it easy to stack up gains. Staking with Dawgz AI offers a consistent return, unlike SOL’s price movements. The market is unpredictable, but Dawgz AI staking locks in profits. With market capitalization increasing, staking rewards could become even more valuable. High-Frequency Trading: AI That Works 24/7 The Solana blockchain might be fast, but Dawgz AI runs even faster. High-frequency AI trading bots work 24/7, executing profitable trades while you sit back. SOL investors rely on price shifts, but with $DAGZ, you don’t have to wait for pumps - you profit no matter what. Dawgz AI bots analyze the market in real-time, buying low and selling high. Unlike SOL trading, which depends on current sentiment, these bots never miss opportunities. Whether the current price goes up or down, the AI keeps winning. Dawgz AI is Built for the Future While people speculate about the SOL price prediction, Dawgz AI is already delivering results. With a solid tokenomics structure, a growing community, and real utility, this isn’t just another meme coin - it’s designed for success. The market depends on adoption, but Dawgz AI is already generating returns. Unlike other meme coins, which rely on hype, $DAGZ has a working product. The prediction table might be uncertain, but Dawgz AI’s future is clear. Conclusion The Solana price prediction is uncertain, and while some believe in a SOL prediction of $300, others remain doubtful. The average trading price of SOL depends on the crypto market, but Dawgz AI is already delivering real gains. With staking rewards, AI-powered trading, and a strong community, why wait on SOL when $DAGZ is the better move? Frequently Asked Questions How much will Solana be in 2025? The Solana price prediction for 2025 varies, but analysts suggest Solana’s cost could land anywhere between $200 and $600, depending on price shifts and market trends. The market will play a huge role in determining the average price of SOL. If SOL's growth continues, the price prediction for Solana could trend higher, but nothing is guaranteed. Can SOL reach $1000? While some believe the Solana price could eventually hit $1000, it’s a long shot. The average price is far from that level, and SOL Solana would need significant growth in adoption and market capitalization to get there. The Solana blockchain is expanding, but it’s unclear if that’s enough to push SOL this high. Can Solana reach $500? A SOL price prediction of $500 is more realistic, but it still depends on strong momentum in the Solana market. The price of Solana could rise if demand for NFTs and DeFi projects increases. However, traders remain cautious due to previous crashes and price shifts. How high could Solana go? No one knows for sure, but the prediction table suggests SOL could rise significantly if conditions align. The SOL network needs continued growth and stability, and if that happens, the Solana (SOL) price could climb. However, instead of waiting, Dawgz AI offers a way to earn profits now without relying on speculation. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Analyst Spots A Crucial Setup For A Major Rally,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/34-xrp-analyst-spots-a-crucial-setup-for-a-major-rally/,"XRP is establishing new trading patterns against Bitcoin, and traders are closely monitoring a potential shift in market dynamics. XRP has exhibited remarkable strength over a lengthier timeframe, with a 31% gain against Bitcoin during the past month, despite a 15% decline in the past week. Analysts are in disagreement as to what may occur next, as the altcoin’s short-term weakness and long-term strength show opposing figures. Related Reading: Chainlink Activity Spikes—2,300 Fresh Addresses In Last 7 Weeks Unprecedented Consolidation Pattern Emerges EGRAG, a market analyst, has identified a previously unseen development in the relationship between XRP and Bitcoin. The current pattern indicates consolidation at historically elevated levels, in contrast to previous market cycles in which XRP would surge beyond key resistance levels before retracing into bear territory. The consolidation zone between 0.00003 BTC and 0.000023 BTC is uncharted territory for XRP. According to the most recent data, the altcoin is currently trading at 0.00002580 BTC, representing a 3.70% decline for the day. EGRAG suggests that this phase of foundation-building could ultimately facilitate a more sustainable rally than previous market cycles. #XRP – You’re Not #Bullish Enough!

I also warned you that buying… pic.twitter.com/kEzj4NgvZv — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) February 24, 2025 Critical Price Levels To Watch The continuing existence of particular price thresholds in its Bitcoin pairing is necessary for XRP’s position to remain stable. Even if a monthly closing below 0.000023 BTC would elicit negative sentiment, a comeback is still possible. However, things would significantly worsen if XRP dropped below 0.000016 BTC. A “bullish foundation” would form if the price of Bitcoin closed higher than 0.000024 BTC. EGRAG stands for this. To sustain the bullish argument, XRP must remain above this level until the end of February, even if it is already trading above it. As has happened in the past, a stronger rise above 0.000034 BTC and a monthly close above this level could indicate that a breach is imminent. Projected Price Targets Based On Bitcoin Pairing Based on the relationship between XRP and Bitcoin, a number of important price goals will become clear if the expected breakout happens. When Bitcoin stays at or near $95,125, the first important level would be 0.000046 BTC, which is equal to about $4.37 per XRP. XRP could potentially reach 0.000136 BTC, which is equivalent to $12.93 per token, if a sustained rally persists. According to EGRAG’s most optimistic scenario, the value of each XRP could be approximately $34 if it were to reach 0.00036 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $13 Million?

Unlike past cycles, where almost all altcoins are pumped together, Ju believes this bull run will favor projects with strong projects with real-world use cases. Redefining ""Altseason"" pic.twitter.com/wVIeUu0eoF — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) February 21, 2025 The Key to Success: ETFs, Hype, and Revenue Ju highlights three main factors that will determine which altcoins survive. First, altcoins with ETF narratives, like XRP, Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Hedera (HBAR), could see major institutional inflows, similar to Bitcoin’s ETF -driven rally. Recently, Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predicted a 90% chance of approval for a Litecoin ETF , 75% for Dogecoin, 70% for Solana, and 65% for XRP. While Ju sees a good chance for these coins to rally in this “selective altcoin season” others may miss the train. Moreover, Trump’s pro-crypto governance is creating a bullish vibe for the next batch of ETF approvals. Rising the ETF bar-o-meter, Franklin Templeton filed for spot Solana ETF showing rising institutional interest. Meanwhile, Brazil is gearing up for the world’s first spot XRP ETF , now listed as pre-operational. But Ju says apart from ETFs sustainability is the key. Many meme coins rise and fall quickly, but projects with ongoing developer activity, strong communities, and investor confidence will maintain their relevance. We have seen such pump-dump shows with TRUMP and LIBRA. Finally, revenue-generating projects with solid business models and real-world utility will stand out. Tokens that rely solely on speculation will struggle, while those with solid revenue streams will survive. The Era of “Everything Pumping” is Over Ju warns that broad altcoin rallies are a thing of the past. While Bitcoin is hitting new highs, many altcoins are still far from their previous peaks. This suggests that only select tokens will benefit from this cycle, making it crucial for investors to be strategic in their choices. Recent data backs up Ju’s argument. Last week, Bitcoin saw massive outflows of $571 million, while some altcoins, like XRP, saw inflows of $38.3 million. This suggests that investors are being more selective, favoring established altcoins over risky bets. Ethereum and Solana have also shown strength, indicating that only a few major altcoins will benefit from market shifts. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Sell-off : Why is Bitcoin Going Down? , Ju further picks up the current liquidity struggles in crypto. He describes the market as a “PvP fight,” meaning that instead of new money entering, existing capital is simply being shuffled around between assets. This highlights how the market has matured, with institutional players taking control and favoring stability over past retail-driven altcoin booms. In short, this altcoin season is different and many altcoins will not top and only established coins will gain the investor’s faith.

40812183,https://nulltx.com/?p=145795,1740477736,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Ethereum Gaining Ground on Bitcoin: Taker Buy-Sell Ratio and Cost Basis Trends Point to Stronger Sentiment,https://nulltx.com/ethereum-gaining-ground-on-bitcoin-taker-buy-sell-ratio-and-cost-basis-trends-point-to-stronger-sentiment/,"Current market trends indicate that Ethereum ($ETH) is experiencing a surge in investor interest as sentiment pivots away from Bitcoin ($BTC) in the near term. Primary metrics like the taker buy-sell ratio and cost basis distribution (CBD) are now painting a more favorable picture for Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. These developments are not going unnoticed by analysts and investors, especially because Ethereum’s price itself is undergoing what looks like a period of bullish buildup, even as Bitcoin continues to contend with waning demand. Traditionally, when the taker buy-sell ratio for Bitcoin starts to decline while Ethereum’s rises, this indicates a trend reversal in which Ethereum starts to outperform Bitcoin. And that is precisely what we are witnessing now in the crypto market. Bitcoin’s buy-sell ratio has been dropping for some time, and this, of course, reflects diminishing buying momentum and a forecast that is less rosy in the short run for Bitcoin. At the same time, Ethereum’s ratio is rising, which points to quite the opposite scenario for Ethereum—that is, it is enjoying a nice upsurge in buying interest and investor sentiment. This shifting market dynamic indicates that an increasing number of investors are turning to Ethereum, probably because of the recent updates to the network and its rising popularity in areas like DeFi, non-fungible tokens, and layer-2 solutions. With Bitcoin’s supremacy in the market starting to wane, Ethereum is definitely the next contender to capture the spotlight, especially as institutional appetite for blockchain alternative assets continues to swell. Accumulation Zones Indicate Long-Term Conviction in Ethereum This burgeoning Ethereum momentum is most evident in the cost basis distribution (CBD) for Ethereum. The CBD for Ethereum is trending down across multiple cost bases, signaling that investors have been stocking up on Ethereum as its price has dipped. This accumulation behavior is even more remarkable when you consider that most of the time, when we’re seeing price decreases, those decreases are accompanied by an increase in trading volume. And volume is usually associated with price discovery or some discernible reason for buyers or sellers to be trading. Ethereum’s main support area is roughly around $2,632, which is where about 786,660 ETH is stashed. That’s an important price level that has become a sort of threshold for Ethereum, where you’re seeing buyers come in and trying to step it up. Conversely, the primary resistance level is at about $3,149, where roughly 1.22 million ETH is held. Accumulation and resistance zones at those price points are pretty much dictating the Ethereum price with say a 90 to 95 percent chance of hitting one of those thresholds when you’re looking at short to medium price action. $ETH Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) shows multiple cost bases have been moving lower, indicating investors have been accumulating on the way down. Accumulation zones show key support at $2,632 (786.66K #ETH ) and resistance at $3,149 (1.22M #ETH ): https://t.co/ARq7wTmIpy pic.twitter.com/SwJaWn0u8L — glassnode (@glassnode) February 24, 2025 Accumulating at lower prices is a trend we’ve seen with other assets, like Maker ($MKR), where investors have displayed countermarket behavior by lowering their cost basis and holding through dips. For Ethereum, this is a similar play. If Ethereum investors were to behave in a countermarket fashion, that would mean they are accumulating at lower prices. If we see these same investors holding through dips and not panicking, then what we have here is a strong long-term play with a potentially not-so-volatility-prone asset. Ethereum’s Spot ETF Inflows Signal Positive Market Sentiment Shows that Ethereum is moving on a path toward significant global adoption. Performance in the ETF space is just one of many signaling mechanisms moving Ethereum this way. This ETF space performance, meanwhile, is in stark contrast to what’s happening with the Bitcoin ETF. Inflows to the Bitcoin ETF space have really dried up; they’re down about 36% over the past month. So, while something seems to be going on with the Bitcoin ETF in terms of maybe senderial performance, the Ethereum ETF is not just outpacing it at this point. Both are obviously still kind of small in the grand scheme, but Ethereum ETF inflows are up; Bitcoin ETF inflows are down. Last week (February 18 to February 21, US Eastern Time), the Bitcoin spot ETF had a net outflow of US$559 million, and the Ethereum spot ETF had a net inflow of US$1.61 million. https://t.co/Tvs2oCS03I — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 24, 2025 The inflows from the Ethereum spot ETF are not only a sign of growing interest from institutions but also point toward a broader trend of Ethereum being seen as an investment vehicle. More and more capital is flowing into Ethereum-based financial products, which is further solidifying the idea that the Ethereum market is confident in the potential of the protocol and the assets that are based on it. The Altseason Dilemma: Ethereum’s Critical Support Level Yet, as analyst Ali Martinez sounds the alarm, the market could take a hit if Ethereum can’t hold its necessary support at $2,600. Martinez predicts that a dip under this level would call into question the long-awaited “Altseason” that has certain alternative cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, doing well enough to make many people think they’ll outperform Bitcoin. That makes any retreating altcoin right now sound especially ominous when you consider Ethereum’s plummeting price could lead to a significantly larger retreat throughout the altcoin market. Altseason will be canceled if #Ethereum $ETH fails to hold $2,600! pic.twitter.com/7A37QsrIUU — Ali (@ali_charts) February 24, 2025 As Altseason risks being interrupted, the attention is focused on Ethereum to keep its price above the $2,600 level. The $2,600 level is a key point for Ethereum’s price action and will probably play a large role in deciding if the altcoin market extends its rise or if it hits the brakes. Ethereum’s Potential to Outperform Bitcoin in the Short Term Even though Bitcoin is presently in a cooling-off phase, Ethereum is showing a surge of bullish energy that could take it past Bitcoin in short-term performance. Part of this is coming from the bullishness indicators, like rising taker buy-sell ratios, that we were discussing before. But there’s a lot more to it. Bitcoin is still finding it hard to maintain reasonable buy-sell ratios and is losing investor interest, while Ethereum is attracting more and more attention and appearing as a viable investment option. Bitcoin’s taker buy-sell ratio is dropping, while Ethereum’s is climbing—a setup that historically favors ETH outperforming $BTC in the short term. Looks like buying momentum is shifting toward $ETH , signaling stronger bullish sentiment for Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. Let’s… pic.twitter.com/3yJ3eNgCvz — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) February 24, 2025 Currently, Ethereum has a strong support base around $2,632, and almost every day, it seems to be attracting even more institutional interest. I say it’s appearing as a viable option because in the short to medium term, Ethereum looks like it could keep pushing upward. So, is this a potential bull run for Ethereum? To sum up, although the overall market is uncertain, Ethereum is not. Ethereum has a growing accumulation trend and a surging investor class that seems confident in its potential. At the same time, however, we must acknowledge that a downleg in the broader crypto market would not be good for Ethereum and could cut short its rally. At present, Ethereum has a critical level of support; if it holds here, we think the next obvious target for the ether-Bitcoin price ratio is at least a lower-high in the near term, if not a breakout to levels not seen since mid-2022.

How Will the Price Be Affected?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-eth-warning-from-analyst-death-cross-is-coming-how-will-the-price-be-affected/,"Bitcoin (BTC) fell to its lowest level in nearly 3 months with a sharp decline in the last 24 hours. The largest altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), took its share of the decline, falling 11.8 percent in the last 24 hours to $2,375. The picture is not encouraging for other altcoins either. Solana (SOL) fell 15.6 percent; XRP 13.7 percent; BNB 6 percent and AVAX 13 percent. As the decline deepens, a death cross alert has sounded for Ethereum. Market analyst Omkar Godbole said that a death cross is approaching for ETH. Accordingly, when looking at the Ethereum chart, a death cross will occur when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crosses the 200-day SMA and falls below it. Looking at the Ethereum chart, it can be seen that the 50-day moving average is preparing to cross the 200-day moving average from top to bottom. What is Death Cross? Death Cross: A crossover where the short-term moving average crosses the longer-term moving average from top to bottom. This crossing is considered significant as a sign of major weakness. So this pattern occurs when a shorter-term moving average, such as the 50-week, crosses below a longer-term moving average, such as the 200-week. When this model is looked at technically, it is interpreted that the price will remain below the long-term average in the short term and that it could potentially experience another major decline. A death cross is often seen as a warning for investors to be careful as it could lead to a significant price drop. Only time will tell whether Ethereum will experience a death cross and trigger a drop. What are the reasons behind the decline? It is stated that this decline is due to Nasdaq futures indicating continued losses in technology stocks and the strengthening of the Japanese yen, and it is stated that the strengthening of the yen creates fears of risk aversion similar to the one in August. Market analyst Omkar Godbole said that the Bank of Japan's interest rate hike talks and the yen's strengthening were reminiscent of last July and triggered the decline. Because after the Japanese central bank increased interest rates in July, the yen rose and led to a broad-based risk aversion trend. Bitcoin experienced a sharp drop from around $65,000 to $50,000 in a few days after the BOJ decision. Analysts also noted that the crash occurred immediately after US President Donald Trump's statements on trade policies. Accordingly, Trump announced that tariffs on Canada and Mexico were proceeding as planned. This statement increased uncertainty in the markets and caused Bitcoin and altcoins to lose value rapidly. *This is not investment advice.

The altcoins have performed even worse over the same period, with massive double-digit price declines from ETH, XRP, DOGE, ADA, LINK, AVAX, and many others. BTC to Multi-Month Low It was just a few days ago, on Friday, when the primary cryptocurrency had not only recovered from the Tuesday dip to $93,500 but also managed to gain some traction and challenge the coveted $100,000 line. However, the hack against Bybit quickly stopped its ascent , and the landscape has only worsened since then. Following a calm weekend, in which the asset spent around $96,500, BTC dropped to $94,000 on Monday despite Strategy’s latest multi-billion dollar purchase . That was just the beginning of a violent correction, though, as bitcoin slumped even harder on Tuesday morning to just under $88,000 (on Bitstamp). This became its lowest price point since November 15 – or just 10 days after the US elections. As of now, BTC struggles to reclaim the $88,000 level after a rejection at $90,000 minutes ago. Its market capitalization has plunged by $150 billion daily and is down to $1.750 trillion on CG. The silver lining is the growing dominance over the alts, as the metric has increased to 58.8%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Freefall The growing BTC dominance in times of deep correction means only one thing – the alts have dumped hard. In fact, double-digit price losses are evident from most. Such examples come from Ethereum, which has tumbled below $2,400 after an 11% daily drop. XRP, DOGE, ADA, SOL, LINK, XLM, AVAX, LTC, SUI, and many, many others have recorded price drops of more than 10% in the past day. BNB and TRX are among the few with single-digit declines. The cumulative market capitalization of all crypto assets has shed more than $300 billion in a single day as the metric is now below $3 trillion on CG for the first time in over three months.

The market sentiments have plunged to 25 and reached levels they remained at during the FTX crash. Besides this, the price has reached the neckline of a huge bearish pattern, which hints towards a more bearish outlook for the star token. The daily chart of BTC shows the price has dropped below the neckline of a massive ‘m-shaped’ or a double-top pattern. Moreover, the Gaussian channel has also turned bearish after remaining bullish since October 2024. Besides, the RSI has reached the lower threshold and displays the possibility of entering the oversold levels. The daily RSI has never dropped within the oversold levels since August 2023 and if the panic selling continues, the BTC price is feared to drop to support close to $80,000. Is the Bitcoin Bull Run Over? In the longer time frame, the Bitcoin price displays some possibly strong rebound but the rally is expected to remain under bearish influence. Besides, the token is reciprocating a previous pattern, which displays a strong rebound is fast approaching. However, the price is required to enter the demand zone, which is 3% to 4% lower than the current levels. In the long term, the BTC price is yet again trading within a descending parallel channel as it did in the first few weeks of 2024. The price maintained its volatility within the pattern and marked the interim lows below $54,000, which triggered a huge upswing to a new ATH above $109K. A similar pattern is seen currently where the price is heading towards the support of the channel which is just below $85,000. The RSI is deflating and could drop to support at 44.39, while the weekly MACD suggests a rise in the selling pressure. As the MACD remains within a positive range, a quick rebound is expected, which could ease the selling pressure. With this, the RSI is also expected to defend the support and trigger a rebound, which could initiate a recovery phase. However, a breakout beyond the channel may only trigger a strong bull run, which may pave the way for a new Bitcoin (BTC) price ATH probably above $112,000.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 10:09:21

With the crypto space constantly evolving, one under-the-radar altcoin priced below $1 is quietly gaining momentum. RCO Finance (RCOF) is emerging as a standout contender, blending cutting-edge AI technology with a community-focused ecosystem. As the market shifts, this token’s presale success and innovative platform signal it could dominate next year’s investment landscape. RCO Finance (RCOF): The Under $1 Altcoin Gaining Ground Priced at just $0.10 in its fifth presale stage, RCO Finance (RCOF) is quickly establishing itself as the best crypto to buy for investors seeking massive gains. This altcoin powers an advanced financial platform designed to democratize sophisticated investment strategies through artificial intelligence and machine learning. Unlike traditional platforms that demand expert knowledge or intermediaries, RCO Finance offers a fully automated, no-code experience, appealing to novices and seasoned traders alike. Its AI-powered Robo Advisor stands out, analyzing vast real-time market data to deliver personalized strategies. This helps users catch trending opportunities like the Zenqira (ZENQ) altcoin, which has seen a whopping 3,191% price surge in a week while avoiding losses. The RCO Finance team recently launched its beta platform , which has already attracted over 10,000 users. The team is now refining an alpha version with enhanced capabilities that will soon debut. Beyond its technology, RCO Finance offers unparalleled asset diversity, boasting over 120,000 tradable assets across 12,500 classes, from stocks and bonds to cryptocurrencies and tokenized real estate. This variety allows users to build robust, diversified portfolios, a rare advantage in the crypto space. Adding to that is that RCO Finance operates KYC-free, prioritizing privacy and seamless access to DeFi, and it’s clear why RCO Finance is resonating with privacy-conscious investors. In addition, the platform’s smart contract has already been audited by SolidProof ensuring investors’ funds will remain safe in an era where crypto hacks have become so rampant. These strengths position RCO Finance as more than just another altcoin; it’s a gateway to the future of finance, making it the best crypto to buy for those looking to capitalize on 2025’s potential. Why RCOF Is Emerging As The Best Crypto To Buy For 2025 The RCO Finance presale is a testament to its rising star status, already surging 684% from its initial $0.01275 price to $0.10 in stage five. With the next stage pushing the price to $0.13 and a final presale target of $0.2142, early investors are eyeing remarkable returns. But the real excitement lies ahead: upon listing on exchanges, RCOF is projected to hit the market between $0.4 and $0.6 with projections of shattering the $1 barrier shortly after the listing. Post-listing, the alpha platform launch is expected to ignite even greater demand. Analysts predict a staggering 10,000% price explosion within weeks of the post-alpha platform launch milestone, driven by the platform’s enhanced features, including the Robo Advisor’s monitoring capabilities currently in internal testing. The combination of real-time portfolio adjustments, tokenized real-world assets like commodities, and up to 1000x leverage positions RCO Finance (RCOF) to outperform competitors. Community governance via $RCOF tokens also adds long-term value, empowering holders to shape the platform’s future while the deflationary token model burning unsold tokens fuels growth by ensuring scarcity and value appreciation. For investors hunting the best crypto to buy, RCOF’s presale-to-listing journey offers a rare chance to multiply investments exponentially in 2025.

The new webpage has listed over 2,200 terminated contracts and various cost-saving measures and claims to have cut down $65 billion in wasteful expenditure. According to DOGE’s efficiency leaderboard, the Department of Education (ED) ranks highest in government-wide savings, followed by the General Services Administration (GSA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Labor (DOL), and Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Introducing the Agency Efficiency Leaderboard. The competition is on! Also did another contract upload, with more than 2,200 contract terminations now listed on the site. Working on the best way to provide grant termination receipts. https://t.co/zDqhK8Vm3h — Department of Government Efficiency (@DOGE) February 25, 2025 At the lower end of the rankings, agencies with the least total savings include the Department of Commerce (DOC), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of Transportation (DOT), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and lastly, the Department of State. DOGE contract and real estate cuts The DOGE official website , which went live on January 21, details a variety of terminated or reduced federal contracts, including two training programs within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) each valued at nearly $10 million. DOGE’s list included several news publications the US government had reportedly subscribed to, with payments paid through the CFPB. They included Politico, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, CQ RollCall, and Bloomberg, accounting for about $1.63 million in contractual cuts. On the federal real estate downsizing front, the Department of State reported office space reductions in Miami, and the Department of Justice cut space in Cincinnati and Kansas City. The General Services Administration halted leases on federal property in multiple states, including Illinois and Ohio. “Lease terminations are the clear priority at this time,” denoted a senior GSA manager in a memo dated January 29, obtained by Associated Press. Calculations show that Musk and his team have “hacked down” about 2.5 million square feet of real estate. Still, these cuts remain modest compared to the federal government’s overall property portfolio. Some of the savings figures still unaccounted for According to DOGE’s website, the office claims to have made $65 billion in total savings, but naysayers argue that it has not provided documentation for approximately $38 billion, nearly 75% of its claim. One discrepancy involves an alleged $8 billion in savings from canceling a tech support contract for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). As reported by Cryptopolitan, records show the contract’s actual value was only $8 million, which means that DOGE has made a clerical error of over $7.9 billion. DOGE has stated that its savings website will be updated twice a week, and it remains to be seen if the corrections will be made by then. Economists believe the budgetary cuts will not have any impact now because the reported total accounts for less than 1% of the government’s $7 trillion annual budget. Last year’s US budget deficit reached $1.8 trillion, so these reductions could be too meager to impact the national debt meaningfully. Still, DOGE continues to receive strong support from Republican lawmakers and President Donald Trump himself, who recently said, “Musk is doing a good job.” President Donald J. Trump and Elon Musk. Source: X “ I think American voters like the intensity and focus that they’ve seen from 30-some days of this administration, going about doing the things they told voters they were going to do ,” said Ohio Representative Jim Jordan on FOX News. Speaking to ABC News, Representative Mike Lawler coined DOGE’s efforts as a “comprehensive forensic audit of every department and agency in the federal government.” “ When you’re staring down $36 trillion in debt and counting, obviously something has to give. I think that’s what we’re seeing right now, ” Lawler reckoned. The Trump administration insists that some agency closures, such as the US Agency for International Aid (USAID), were politically feasible. But liberals assert that spending in areas like defense or Social Security should remain untouched. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The SEC’s appeal in the Ripple lawsuit is still ongoing and retail investors are getting nervous despite the ETF progress. Meanwhile, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) – the hot new utility meme coin – is getting all the attention. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game Yeti Go and solid tokenomics have given early investors 100% returns during the presale and are becoming more attractive by the day to new investors. XRP ETF Launch In Brazil Fuels Rally Towards $2.70 Brazil’s CVM has approved the Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Index Fund, the world’s first spot XRP ETF. This will trade on Brazil’s B3 exchange, as the country is growing in the global crypto market. This triggered an immediate price surge for XRP. On Feb 19, 2025, XRP price went up to $2.72 , just shy of its all-time high. Since then it’s cooled down and is trading at $2.68 after a few days of sideways trading. Brazil is moving as the US SEC is still deliberating on multiple spot XRP ETF applications from asset managers like Grayscale, 21Shares, and CoinShares. The SEC has acknowledged the applications but uncertainty remains as they navigate leadership changes and the Ripple lawsuit. SEC vs Ripple: A Legal Battle With Market Implications The SEC has had a lot of leadership changes. After Gary Gensler left, Mark Uyeda and Hester Pierce took key roles, both are pro-crypto. This is giving hope to XRP investors but regulatory ambiguity remains. The SEC and Binance filed a joint motion for a 60-day stay pending Paul Atkin’s appointment as SEC Chair. Although the XRP ETF has been approved, the SEC has up to 240 days to make a final decision, extending the market uncertainty. Ripple transferred $1 billion worth of XRP to an anonymous wallet, causing a ripple effect among holders. Technically, XRP hovers near the Bollinger band’s midline at $2.6452, indicating moderate volatility. XRP/USD daily chart.Source: TradingView The MACD and RSI indicators show bearish trends, with the RSI at 43.18. To shift to bullish territory, XRP must surpass resistance levels at $2.6538 and challenge its all-time high of $3.5505. Yeti Ouro (YETIO) Captures Market Enthusiasm With P2E Innovation While XRP navigates regulatory hurdles, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is winning over investors with its solid roadmap and thriving Play-to-Earn (P2E) ecosystem. Built on the Ethereum blockchain and audited by SOLIDProof , Yeti Ouro is changing the meme coin game with real use cases. Yeti Ouro just closed its Stage 2 presale, selling around 200 million $YETIO tokens. Now in Stage 3, the token is $0.024, 100% ROI for early investors, with projections of even more gains when the coin launches. Notably, Yeti Ouro deployed strategic bonus incentives, including a 10% bonus on all purchases. With 50% of the 1 billion token supply allocated to presale and 5% reserved for token burns, the project is creating scarcity-driven demand. Yeti Go: The Game Behind Yeti Ouro’s Success Yeti Ouro’s market momentum is driven by its flagship game, Yeti Go—a high-octane Play-to-Earn racing game built on Unreal Engine 5. Players can earn Yeti Ouro tokens by racing, staking, and in-game trading, so it’s more than just a game—it’s a way to earn. The game features destructible tracks and adaptive AI, so the racing is real. Developed by industry vets behind Call of Duty, Spider-Man, Dead Space and The Witcher, Yeti Go also has an immersive audio experience crafted by artists who have worked with renowned artists such as Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid. Players can maximize their earnings by staking YETIO tokens in liquidity pools. The team have just released a demo for an unreleased level which shows off the graphics and terrain and the gaming community is loving it. With a hard-capped 1 billion token supply and deflationary model, the final presale stages are getting big attention. The presale allocation is carefully designed, 50% to the community, 15% to P2E rewards, and 15% to ecosystem development, so Yeti Ouro is a solid investment with growth and real use cases.

Trump Tariff Impact, Bitcoin Sell-Off & Pi Network Price Fluctuations",https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-crash-today-feb-26th-ripple-news-bitcoin-price-sbf-tweet-trump-un-resolution/,"The post Crypto Crash Today: Feb 25 – Will Crypto Recover? Trump Tariff Impact, Bitcoin Sell-Off & Pi Network Price Fluctuations appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News February 25, 2025 09:55:31 UTC Bitcoin Crash $90K Amid Tariff Fallout and Institutional Saturation Bitcoin broke out of its range, falling below $90K for the first time in a month and now hovering just under that level. This decline comes amid market pressure following Trump’s tariffs on Canada and Mexico and efforts to curb Chinese investment. Institutional demand, primarily from players like MicroStrategy using equity-linked note issuances, has supported BTC, though that financing avenue appears to be nearing saturation. February 25, 2025 08:13:46 UTC Bybit Repays $104M ETH Loan to Bitget Amid $1.4B Hack Recovery Crypto exchange Bybit, hit by a $1.4 billion hack on Feb. 21 allegedly by North Korea’s Lazarus Group, borrowed 40,000 ETH (about $104 million) from Bitget to manage customer withdrawals. On Feb. 25, Bybit repaid the full amount—a loan provided without interest or collateral, as confirmed by Bitget CEO Gracy Chen. This repayment is part of Bybit’s broader effort to restore its reserves, having recovered nearly 88% of the stolen funds through loans, whale deposits, and asset purchases. February 25, 2025 08:10:42 UTC South Korea’s FSS Suspends Dunamu, Parent of Upbit, for 3 Months South Korea’s Financial Services Commission suspended some operations of Dunamu, the parent company of Upbit, for three months due to rule violations. Dunamu processed transactions with unreported virtual asset operators, failed to meet customer verification requirements, and neglected to report suspicious transactions. As part of the measures, transfers of virtual assets by new customers will be restricted from March 7 until June 6 to strengthen compliance and restore market integrity. February 25, 2025 08:07:49 UTC Peter Schiff Predicts MSTR Discount Will Widen Until Bankruptcy Forces a Sale According to Schiff, CEO Michael Saylor could sell some Bitcoin and use the proceeds to repurchase shares, thereby narrowing the discount. However, Schiff argued that such a maneuver would likely trigger a sharp decline in both Bitcoin and MSTR’s share price, making it an unattractive option. As a result, he suggested the discount will continue to widen until bankruptcy forces a sale. February 25, 2025 08:05:25 UTC Bitcoin Dominance Soars 60% Off Blue Zone Bitcoin dominance has surged over 60% from a key blue zone identified last year, fueling claims of an endless BTC rally and no alt season. Yet, these extreme views often emerge at market peaks. When dominance eventually reverses and falls below 40%, it could signal the start of a major alt season. Trends are cyclical—what rises must eventually come down. February 25, 2025 07:53:33 UTC Crypto Tanking : Traders Liquidated for $1.34B in 24 Hours In the past 24 hours, 366,734 traders were liquidated, resulting in a staggering total of $1.34 billion in losses. Notably, one whale trader was liquidated for $20.80 million, underscoring the intense market volatility and the risks associated with leveraged positions in today’s turbulent crypto market. February 25, 2025 07:53:33 UTC BTC Crash : Will Crypto Recover? Market fear is at record levels as Bitcoin’s trading volume has steadily declined since November. Despite the price drop, exchange volume hasn’t increased, indicating that the next breakout may occur on a bullish bounce. This technical pattern suggests a market bottom could be imminent, setting the stage for an upward reversal. Investors should monitor for the volume surge that signals the bottom soon. This surge could trigger a rapid recovery. February 25, 2025 07:50:25 UTC Bitcoin Price Crash Below $90K Bitcoin plunged to just over $90,000—the lowest since January 13—erasing more than $9,000 from Friday’s high. Liquidated positions surged past $1 billion, driven mainly by long positions. Bitcoin must fully capture available liquidity to trigger an upward rotation. Analysts suggest that an ultimate bottom range of $83,000 to $87,000 could be reached before the market stabilizes, setting the stage for a renewed upward trajectory. February 25, 2025 07:26:06 UTC Whale Unstakes 96K SOL, Securing ~$4.5M Profit and Depositing to Binance A whale unstaked 96,155 SOL—currently valued at $13.49M and peaking at $25M—2 hours ago and deposited it to Binance. The same whale had withdrawn 88,493 SOL a year ago at an average price of $101 and staked it. This maneuver nets approximately $4.5M in profit, reflecting a significant strategic move amid changing market conditions. February 25, 2025 06:34:51 UTC Whales Fuel $HYPE Surge with Massive USDC Deposits Whale investors are aggressively buying $HYPE, signaling a significant bullish sentiment. In the past day, a large address (0x9f70…DB0D) deposited 5M USDC into Hyperliquid to acquire $HYPE 15 hours ago. Another whale (0x8AD6…f23D) added 2.07M USDC within the last 24 hours, while a third (0x48F1…359c) injected 1.35M USDC just 8 hours ago. This surge in USDC deposits underscores growing institutional interest in $HYPE. Investors remain strongly optimistic about its future. February 25, 2025 06:12:04 UTC Ethereum’s Pectra Upgrade Now Live Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade went live on the Holesky testnet at 21:55 UTC but failed to finalize as expected. Developers are investigating the delay on Discord, echoing a similar issue from the Dencun upgrade on Goerli last January. Pectra bundles 11 key EIPs—including EIP-7702 and EIP-7251—to enhance wallet functionality and staking. The next test is set for Sepolia, with mainnet activation pending. February 25, 2025 06:09:00 UTC Crypto Market Crash Today Crypto majors slid up to 14% over the past 24 hours as a prolonged sell-off extended into Tuesday amid a lack of catalysts and growing macroeconomic concerns. Bitcoin fell below $92,000 for the first time since November, while SOL, DOGE, XRP, and ETH also saw significant losses. Despite bearish sentiment, some traders expect recovery if economic conditions improve and the Fed adjusts its policy stance. February 25, 2025 06:03:09 UTC El Salvador Buys 7 Bitcoins El Salvador resumed Bitcoin purchases following a rare seven-day pause from February 18 to 24, 2025—one of its longest interruptions. The country acquired an additional 7 BTC, raising its total holdings to 6,088 BTC valued at about $562.9 million. This move demonstrates continued government confidence in digital assets amid intermittent buying halts, as El Salvador diversifies its portfolio and reinforces its commitment to cryptocurrency as a strategic economic asset overall. February 25, 2025 06:03:09 UTC Chainflip Blocks Illicit Funds from the Bybit Hack Chainflip has announced its decision to block the illegal movement of funds linked to the Bybit hack. The protocol team, community, liquidity providers, primary interfaces, and validator providers were consulted before this move. Most of the necessary code has been written and is undergoing testing. The upgraded version is expected to be deployed within the next 24 to 72 hours, reinforcing the platform’s commitment to secure operations for improved trust. February 25, 2025 05:31:34 UTC Crypto Liquidations Fuel $950M Sell-Off After Tariff Announcement Bitcoin fell to a multi-week low, triggering $950 million in liquidations after President Trump announced a return to 25% tariffs on over $900 billion in Canadian and Mexican imports, raising inflation fears. The announcement sent Bitcoin below $95,000, Ethereum to $2,500, and dragged altcoins into losses. Meanwhile, proposals for Bitcoin reserve bills failed in Montana, North Dakota, Wyoming, and South Dakota, stalling state efforts to invest public funds in crypto.",News|Crypto Live News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|ALTCOIN|ETH|FIAT|EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|ZRX|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 11:52:00

Even though the sentiment around SUI and ADA is improving, the volatility is still here. That’s why SUI and Cardano investors are looking for more stable crypto assets. And they’ve found what they need in FXGuys ($FXG). FXGuys is a new crypto trading platform that offers huge profit potential, and it performed really well even during the crash. As such, smart investors see FXGuys as the best investment opportunity right now to recover the losses. Read on for more details! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE SUI is Still Suffering From Volatility The SUI price has been struggling for days. Right now, it’s 11% higher than it was last week. However, SUI is still battling with massive volatility. This can be seen from the movements on its price chart. At the moment, sentiment around SUI is getting better. But experts say that this might not last. Namely, they say that SUI is experiencing positive sentiment right now just because of its short-term price rise. So, if SUI’s price dips again, the sentiment will also shift. With all this in mind, experts aren’t able to predict SUI’s future moves. They say that SUI is too risky right now and that its price can go both ways. Because of this, many SUI investors are looking for a more stable and promising alternative. That’s why they’re investing heavily in FXGuys. This new crypto trading platform isn’t suffering from volatility and presents a great long-term investment option. So, FXGuys is much more stable than SUI is at the moment! Cardano’s ADA Can’t Find Solid Ground Amid Market Volatility Cardano is in a similar position as SUI. Namely, ever since the crash, Cardano has been dealing with high volatility. This volatility took the ADA price to a low of $0.56. However, the ADA price now stands at $0.80 . But ADA didn’t have a smooth road to recovery at all. Namely, the ADA price went up and down constantly until it reached its current price, and the volatility still persists. And because of this, Cardano’s support and resistance levels are constantly changing. Nevertheless, ADA’s high timeframes remain bearish. And since Cardano’s token price is constantly going up and down, experts aren’t sure what will happen next. Because of that, they see ADA as a very risky investment option right now. So, it’s no surprise that ADA holders are looking for more stable investments like FXGuys. This new crypto trading platform has emerged as a very promising alternative to risky alts like ADA and SUI! FXGuys: The New Crypto Trading Platform With Incredible Profit Potential The recent market crash and current volatility showed just how strong FXGuys is. During the crash, FXGuys saw even more demand, jumping from Stage 2 to Stage 3 of its public presale in days. Now, this new crypto trading platform is seeing even more demand, especially with its BETA trading platform now live. The free trial allows investors to explore the FXGuys BETA trading platform before they invest. This has solidified investor confidence in FXGuys even more. Also, users who have tried the FX Guys BETA trading platform loved it and are excited about the official launch. But this new crypto trading platform also comes with great perks. This is yet another reason why investors are so confident in it. For one, the FXGuys crypto trading platform comes with same-day payouts. This, combined with its unlimited withdrawals, gives traders the security they’ve been looking for. So, with this new crypto trading platform, traders can now take out and receive their money within 24 hours. Funded traders will also get a lot out of this new crypto trading platform. For one, they’ll get an 80/20 profit split. Also, they’ll be able to trade with up to $500,000 in funding. This means that one FXGuys account can bring them maximum profits. Rewards are also included for all FXGuys users. First, there’s the FX Guys Trade2Earn program, which lets traders earn $FXG by making trades. Second, there’s the FXGuys staking rewards program. This lets traders stake their $FXG tokens in return for a share of the FXGuys crypto trading fees and volume! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Join the $FXG Public Presale Before the Next Market Surge! As explained, FXGuys brings huge utility that can ensure profitability in all market conditions. As such, $FXG is an extremely promising investment option, one that you can get into before the high price targets are hit.

This allows you to get in before $FXG starts trading on exchanges and catch all the gains it’ll provide in the months and years to come. And according to experts, those gains will be huge. Their primary target for $FXG is a 100x price rise, one they expect to be reached by Q2 of 2025. After that, they foresee $FXG’s price rising even more, fueled by its amazing features and perks.

A careful examination of WIF shows that the coins remain below important resistance areas indicating it may fall further. Meanwhile, a new memecoin, #Pepeto ( PEPETO ), has been gaining attention, with many in the crypto community speculating that it could be the next 100x memecoin. Pepeto has already raised over $4.8 million in its presale and is preparing for its official launch. Pepeto Introduces New Features for Memecoin Investors Developers of #Pepeto continue to push its success in the crypto market by presenting it as the upcoming evolution of memecoins. Past memecoins lack the long-term sustainability of Pepeto because it uses a staking model and cross-chain exchange technology as well as its independent trading platform. Staking investors can collect passive rewards by using the bridge system to connect Pepeto with other crypto assets easily. The team behind Pepeto has emphasized that the project is intended to provide real utility. The developers stated that they are integrating Technology and Optimization to establish a genuinely sustainable memecoin. They also mentioned that the launch of PepetoSwap, a dedicated exchange for memecoins, is expected to strengthen the project’s ecosystem by offering a secure and efficient trading platform. Dogwifhat Faces Continued Downtrend WIF remains in a bearish trend, trading far below the Ichimoku Cloud, which indicates strong resistance ahead. WIF is trading at $0.625076 , with a market cap of $624,351,490. The token has dropped from its previous highs near $3.00 and has shown no clear signs of a reversal. With an RSI of 34.54, WIF is approaching oversold conditions, suggesting a potential short-term bounce. However, the MACD remains bearish, and traders are closely watching for a possible crossover that could indicate a shift in momentum. Source: TradingView The derivative trading market for WIF showed reduced activity because open interest fell 6.54% along with a 19.06% decline in trading volume. During the past 24 hours liquidations reached $2.15 million while long traders suffered most of the losses. The long/short ratio on Binance alongside OKX shows a bullish stance because traders seem to anticipate an upward trend despite recent downward activity. Rates of key support stand at $0.60 and resistance maintains a position at $1.00. Pepeto’s Strong Presale Performance and Major Listings Ahead During its presale phase, #Pepeto has gathered more than $4.8 million from investors who have shown great interest. The token costs $0.000000112 per unit while the total token supply reaches 420 trillion. The project divides its total supply into three sections with presale receiving 30% while 30% goes to staking rewards and 20% supports marketing. Development and liquidity reserves receive the remaining tokens among the total supply. The team has confirmed that #Pepeto will be listed on five major exchanges at launch, ensuring liquidity and accessibility for investors. The planned listings are expected to drive early adoption and create opportunities for price appreciation. Pepeto’s marketing strategy includes influencer partnerships and social media campaigns to attract a wider audience. Community Anticipates Pepeto’s Launch The #Pepeto community is actively following the project’s development, with many excited about its upcoming milestones. The project’s lead developer recently shared a message, reinforcing the team’s commitment to the roadmap. He hinted at a major announcement soon, fueling speculation about potential partnerships or additional platform features. https://twitter.com/Pepetocoin/status/1874260504891240897 Pepeto’s introduction has already caught the attention of major players in the memecoin space. The project has positioned itself as a strong contender against established names, with its unique features setting it apart. As the launch approaches, investors are watching closely to see if Pepeto can deliver on its promises and achieve its projected growth. Tap, https://pepeto.io/, to join.

Many investors want to know what the price of DOGE will be when February 2025 arrives. One Dogecoin is selling at $0.2593; if technical data is to be taken at face value, it might drop over the next weeks. Changelly thinks the price will fall by -2.82% to reach that level by February 9th, 2025, if experts project an average trade price of $0.236. Dogecoin’s predicted February price range runs from a low of $0.216 to a high of $0.255. With 71% of indicators showing a negative view and the Dread & Greed Index scoring 44, suggesting general investor dread, the market attitude seems pessimistic. Dogecoin has seen 40% positive trading days over the past 30 days; nevertheless, its 50-day moving average is still declining, indicating temporary weakness. Furthermore, the 200-day moving average has declined since early February, underlining a long-term trend. These elements make Dogecoin’s possibility of a significant February surge doubtful, forcing investors to look for other cheap cryptocurrencies that match its prior performance.

The project’s outstanding presale performance points to RXS becoming crypto’s next big success story. With some estimates showing RXS hitting $20 in the next few years, analysts say the token might see a rally similar to the fabled spike of over 10,000%. Several elements help to explain RXS’s positive projection. Innovative elements in the token’s unique ecosystem—the Rexas Token Builder, Rexas Launchpad, Rexas Estate, QuickMint Bot, and Rexas GenAI—all have practical uses that distinguish it from other cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, Certik has conducted a successful audit of Rexas Finance (RXS), strengthening investor confidence and security inside the ecosystem. Click Here To Buy Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale While Dogecoin has typically depended on community-driven excitement and celebrity endorsements for price spikes, Rexas Finance (RXS) offers a compelling use case that fits the rising trend of real-world asset tokenizing. Utility-driven initiatives like RXS will likely be more popular as the crypto market develops than meme-driven assets like DOGE. Moreover, the market is becoming increasingly hungry for creative crypto ideas as investors hunt initiatives with real value. Rexas Finance (RXS) is a great candidate for the 2025 version of DOGE, but only with a more stable basis and long-term growth potential since it is positioned to profit from this need. Conclusion: RXS Poised to Dominate 2025 Although Dogecoin is still a major participant in the crypto scene, its short-term February 2025 projection shows a downturn. Rexas Finance (RXS) is fast rising as the best option under $1, thanks to its presale success, practical value, and strong investor support, paving the foundation for a huge gain. As RXS keeps becoming popular, it might become the breakout token of 2025, providing investors with a special chance to ride the next wave of explosive crypto expansion.

The development marks the start of a potential turning point for the XRP cryptocurrency in the market. Meanwhile, the ChowWow presale cryptocurrency ICO funding has reached a milestone of $181,000 due to the high purchasing volume in the market. This underscores the influx of investors who identify the ChowWow token as the next meme coin set for 100x rallies in the coming weeks. Increased Probability for XRP ETF as SEC Posts Proposal to Federal Register The XRP token has recorded a significant increase in institutional interest over the past months, with multiple crypto asset management firms filing for ETF approval from the SEC. In the latest development, Cointelegraph reports that one of the ETF filings by Grayscale has been posted to the Federal Register. This means that the official review has started and the SEC will reach its conclusion on approval within 21 days after the publication of the filing in the Federal Register. In the same vein, WisdomTree , another crypto asset management company, has recently had its XRP ETF filing acknowledged by the SEC. All these point toward an increasingly bullish sentiment of XRP among corporate institutions. With the chances of XRP ETF approval increasing to 80% on Polymarket , the crypto asset is likely to be the latest token to be approved by the SEC after Bitcoin and Ethereum. This could further increase the overall value and market adoption of XRP in the near future. As such, the XRP price might be heading to $10 in 2025. ChowWow Hits Milestone as Presale Momentum Grows The ChowWow meme coin project is having a high-flying presale campaign as thousands of investors join the gem project. The latest presale report reveals that ChowWow has raised $181,000 so far in its presale, a testament to the token’s clear use cases, massive growth potential, and increasing market adoption. For context, ChowWow is a dog-themed meme coin project inspired by the Chinese Chow Chow dog breed. Built on the Solana blockchain, ChowWow’s ecosystem is driven by its multiple use cases, which include the play-to-earn feature where members are rewarded with prizes that can be converted to real-world value. Also, the stake-to-earn feature will generate an APY of up to 15% for investors who stake their $CHOW tokens. ChowWow represents a revolutionary upgrade from meme coins with zero utility to meme coins that harbor real-world value. That is why the project is on course to break into the top 200 crypto assets in the industry within 2025. Meanwhile, the ChowWow token is primed to generate up to 260% within its presale phase, rewarding early investors with significant ROIs before launch. Sold for just $0.01, ChowWow represents one of the best crypto assets to invest in 2025. Investing in the project now positions one to ride the potential exponential growth in the coming weeks. Investors can take advantage of the ongoing bonus offer, which gives them over 5% discount on $250 token purchases and above to accumulate the CHOW token. As it is well known, early investment in top cryptos like CHOW is where significant gains are made. Top Crypto Assets to Invest in 2025 The XRP token and ChowWow represent some of the top-rated crypto investment options. Given XRP’s continued ETF progress from multiple asset management firms, the future looks bullish. Similarly, ChowWow exponential growth potential and utility offerings put it ahead of its meme coin peers in the crypto industry. Overall, ChowWow’s low entry advantage and bigger percentage growth potential make it one of the best altcoins to invest in 2025.

Arthur Hayes Announces the Low He Expects!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/how-far-can-bitcoin-btc-price-fall-arthur-hayes-announces-the-low-he-expects/,"The decline in Bitcoin over the last 24 hours continues. While BTC fell below $89,000, the decline in altcoins is also deepening. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who has made a name for himself with his predictions and posts, claimed that Bitcoin could fall to $70,000. Hayes said that the expectation of a decline in Bitcoin is based on the increased selling of large hedge funds. Hayes said that large hedge funds that own ETFs have started to close their positions, adding that this situation has created more selling pressure on Bitcoin. Arthur Hayes noted that many IBIT holders are hedge funds, and they earn higher returns on short-term U.S. Treasury bonds by going long on ETFs and short on CME futures. According to the famous name, if the difference between ETF prices and futures narrows along with a decrease in the BTC price, these funds will sell their IBITs and buy back CME futures. “Bitcoin bear market is coming, Bitcoin could fall to $70,000. Most of BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF holders are hedge funds that go long the ETF, short CME futures to get higher returns than where they fund short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. Hedge funds that hold IBIT are shorting Bitcoin futures in the futures market while simultaneously buying the ETF because they can profit from this strategy. However, when the price difference between Bitcoin ETFs and futures narrows, hedge funds will sell their ETFs and buy back CME futures. If funds continue to take profits through position liquidations, Bitcoin could fall to $70,000.” Bitcoin continues to trade at $88,500 at the time of writing. #Bitcoin goblin town incoming: Lots of $IBIT holders are hedge funds that went long ETF short CME future to earn a yield greater than where they fund, short term US treasuries.

The market has been waiting to see utility-based tokens rather than the numerous cryptocurrency fads. The market experienced numerous fad projects that promised major results but mainly failed to deliver expectations. The Ozak AI platform represents a project that differs from other industry standards. Ozak AI established itself as the market-defining AI-driven disruptive system through its disruptive AI-driven ecosystem. Ozak AI’s Game-Changing Potential Ozak AI stands above regular token projects in the market because it offers unprecedented potential. It operates as a top innovation center. Using advanced artificial intelligence technology, Ozak AI aims to modify the finance, health, and logistics sectors while building an ecosystem that includes predictive models, automation, and analytic data tools powered by artificial intelligence. These utilities form the very basis of the token’s value. You have premium access to AI tools and staking rewards as a holder. This creates an environment where the token is no longer simply regarded as a gamble but an enabler of advanced AI capabilities. Ozak AI bridges the two most disruptive technologies of the time: blockchain and AI. The Resounding Success of the Ozak AI Presale The market is transparent: investors rush to Ozak AI, and numbers don’t lie. The $OZ presale has been a massive success, raising a whopping $900,000 in a few days. This overwhelming response has highlighted the level of trust and excitement surrounding the project instead of hype, and investors are looking for a token with real value. The token is in presale phase 3 and is valued at $0.003 per token. The price will increase to $0.005 in the next stage. Even though experts predict that the $OZ token will rise higher to $1 by 2025 with its listing price of $0.05. Ozak AI’s quick price rise demonstrates that investors strongly believe in its capacity to deliver successful products. Early investors are now cashing in on handsome gains, and the momentum does not appear to be letting up. What Distinguishes Ozak AI Ozak AI’s ongoing presale success is more than just its technology. It is also about timing and vision. The project is emerging at a moment of great significance for the intersection with other new technologies that led to this innovation. This whole new combination by Ozak AI introduces innovation in the next wave. With decades of experience on their backs, its team of professionals assures that the project is built on solid foundations in AI, blockchain, and business. Furthermore, Ozak AI stands for transparency and community engagement. The project distinguishes itself through standard updates and transparent investment roadmaps while actively engaging with investors. Because such tokens are valuable and useful, Ozak AI will remain relevant even as the market evolves. Investors who missed early opportunities in Bitcoin and Ethereum are now offered a chance to invest at the ground level. Ozak AI represents the next generation of crypto projects: utility-focused, innovation-driven, and positively impacting the world. Conclusion Ozak AI is the token everyone has anticipated. It is not a speculative asset but a ticket into the future of AI and blockchain. With its game-changing prospects, substantial presale success, and apparent utility enhancement, Ozak AI is now paving a new way into the crypto world. Do not miss this life-changing opportunity.

According to him, Bitcoin could fall to $70,000 if large hedge funds exit their positions in US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The leading crypto coin has slid below $90K. Arthur Hayes said that big hedge funds that are playing the ETF arbitrage game are starting to get out of their positions. This is putting more selling pressure on Bitcoin. He explained that a lot of the people who own IBIT are hedge funds that bought ETFs and sold CME futures to get a higher yield with less risk than short-term US Treasuries. #Bitcoin goblin town incoming: Lots of $IBIT holders are hedge funds that went long ETF short CME future to earn a yield greater than where they fund, short term US treasuries.

These… pic.twitter.com/3PskTxrBPR — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) February 24, 2025 To that end, he posited that there could be large outflows from spot BTC ETFs such as the BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). He said, “If that basis drops as $BTC falls, then these funds will sell $IBIT and buy back CME futures.” The funds are currently in profit. Arthur said that given that the basis spread is close to Treasury yields, “they will unwind during US hours and realize their profit,” plunging BTC back to $70,000. When this happens on a large scale, the planned unwind causes many spot ETFs to be sold off, and futures prices go up. This pressure to sell makes Bitcoin’s price drop to present market lows. This could lead to a feedback loop where more funds rush to get out of their positions. US Bitcoin ETFs see their second-biggest outflows of the year On-chain data shows that $516.4 million left US spot-listed BTC ETFs on Monday. This was the second-biggest outflow of the year. The ninth net outflow in 10 days shows that people are becoming less confident in the biggest crypto coin, whose price has been stuck between $94,000 and $100,000 for most of the month. To be more exact, a lot of money left a few Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Fidelity’s FBTC had a net weekly outflow of $165.51 million. Ark 21 Shares’ ARKB lost a total of $107 million, and Bitwise saw its assets drop by $105 million. Grayscale’s GBTC and BTC funds lost a total of $93.6 million and $61.1 million, respectively, each week. During these bad times, Vaneck’s HODL stood out as one of the few bright spots, bringing in a net of $4.31 million. In the same light, Bitcoin CME’s yearly basis has dropped to 4%. This is the difference between the spot price and the futures price. This is the lowest it has been since ETFs began selling in January 2024. At the current level, the basis trade is less than the ‘risk-free rate’, the 5% yield on the US 10-year Treasury. Because of the difference, investors may decide to close their investments in favor of a bigger return. On the other hand, Ether ETFs showed some hope with a small net weekly inflow of $1.6 million. This showed that investors were only slightly interested in ether-based assets. Bitcoin slides below 90K Bitcoin is still trading in the red. It hit a low of $88,200 early today. This was the lowest level since mid-November. Yesterday, it fell 4.89%. This drop in price caused a wave of selling in the crypto market that lost $1.34 billion and 367,500 buyers in the last 24 hours. The largest single liquidation order happened on Binance – BTC/USDT, worth $20.80 million. Also, since it was recently hacked, Bybit has lost about $2 billion in Bitcoin from its funds. Currently, the most valuable crypto has shown weakness. However, it was able to stay above $90K on the day that the Trump administration said it would start imposing tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods that had been put off for a while. Bitcoin price dips below $90,000 on the daily chart. Source: CoinMarketCap In the past 30 days, the price of Bitcoin has dropped by almost 15%. This is happening at a time when the economy is unstable, and people are looking for safe-haven assets like gold. Gold hit eleven record highs in 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin sits at $89,040.

Coinbase (COIN) crashed by 6%, while Strategy (MSTR) stock, formerly Microstrategy, was down by 7%, meaning that they have fallen by 40% and 51% from their 2024 highs. What’s causing crypto stocks to collapse so severely? Let’s explore. COIN and MSTR Stock Price Fall in the Pre-Market Most crypto stocks, including Bitcoin miners, dropped in the premarket session after Bitcoin and most altcoins crashed. Bitcoin price dropped to $88,000 , while Ethereum slipped to below $2,400. The market cap of all cryptocurrencies tracked by CoinMarkeCap dropped by almost 10% and moved below $3 trillion. These stocks also retreated as part of the ongoing sell-off in American equities. Futures tied to the S&P 500 index retreated by 10 points, while those linked to the Dow Jones and Nasdaq 100 indices fell by 0.10% and 0.36%. Coinbase and MicroStrategy are highly exposed to the crypto industry. COIN is the biggest crypto exchange in the US and the seventh-biggest Bitcoin holder with 9,480 coins. Therefore, the falling crypto prices mean that its transaction volume will continue falling. Data shows that the volume of crypto traded in January was lower than that in December, and this month may worse. CEX Monthly Volume MicroStrategy is the biggest Bitcoin holder. It revealed that it bought 20,356 more Bitcoins in a nearly $2 billion deal. It now holds 478,740 coins valued at $42 billion and Michael Saylor has hinted the acquisition will continue. Bitcoin Price to Determine Fate of Coinbase and MicroStrategy Stocks The performance of the COIN and MSTR stock price will depend on whether Bitcoin bounces back and retests its all-time high. The daily chart points that the Bitcoin price has more downside in the near term. That’s because it has dropped below the crucial support level at $89,210, the lowest swing in January and the neckline of the double-top pattern at $108,200. A double-top is a bearish pattern comprised of a twin peaks and a neckline, and a breakdown is confirmed when it crashes below the latter. There is no major support now that it has moved below the neckline. The next one is at $73,730, the highest point in March last year, which is about 16.8% below the current level. Such a move would lead to more COIN and MSTR stock sell-offs. Bitcoin Price Chart Two potential catalysts may provide a catalyst for the Bitcoin price rebound: strong NVIDIA earnings and withdrawal or postponement of tariffs. Such catalysts would push investors to buy the dip. Another catalyst is if the ongoing Bitcoin price crash is part of a false breakdown. Such a breakdown would trigger a Bitcoin rebound and push BTC, COIN, and MSTR stocks higher.

With the bull market in full swing, speculations arise on how XRP might reach astonishing heights. Excitement also surrounds a promising new player, Codename:Pepe, with its unique approach and potential for massive gains. XRP dreams of price explosions, while Codename:Pepe offers intriguing chances for investors. As the world of digital currency heats up, these cryptos, supported by community-driven strategies, stand in the spotlight. Investors keen on maximizing profits find themselves drawn to the potential of Codename:Pepe, which is set to take the crypto space by storm with its novel AI-powered strategies. Codename:Pepe Unleashes True Intelligence for Maximum Profits The crypto underworld is infested with fake AI agents —shady operators promising “next-gen intelligence” while barely outsmarting a toaster. This nonsense ends today. Codename:Pepe has come to denounce fake AI agents. This ultimate undercover agent does not pretend, it is actually doing something useful: helping you make money in the chaotic meme coin jungle. Codename:Pepe is on a mission of mass hilarity (and, naturally, ridiculous gains). Classified Intel: The True Identity of Codename:Pepe Keep this under wraps: Codename:Pepe is a Pepe in disguise. Modeled after the legendary PEPE coin, which skyrocketed nearly 22,000%, this covert operative has the same ambition. Will it succeed? That depends on its community. Your Directive: Secure Your Position in the Codename:Pepe Mission Unlike VC-backed rug pulls, Codename:Pepe is powered by the people. The bigger the support, the higher it moonwalks. That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Codename:Pepe Mission Explained Codename:Pepe plans to use the power of artificial intelligence to hunt down the juiciest meme coins, predict market trends, and deliver exclusive AI-powered trading signals before the FOMO kicks in. Beyond smart analysis, this genius agent will also trade for you with its fully automated AI-trader, turning those signals into sweet gains. Every great agent needs an elite organization backing them. That’s where $AGNT comes in. Holding $AGNT unlocks membership in a top-secret DAO, where operatives (investors) gain access to classified strategies, insider analytics, and the ability to vote on high-stakes missions. Holding $AGNT will unlock: Membership in a top-secret DAO Access to classified strategies Insider analytics Ability to vote on high-stakes missions Profits from the mutual DAO fund will be allocated to those who stake their $AGNT, ensuring the spoils of the trade go to the most loyal agents. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Codename:Pepe isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGN T Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy $AGNT Early for a Bigger Discount Ripple (XRP): A Tool for Quick Transactions Ripple is a decentralized network for money transfers, primarily catering to financial services. It supports fast, cost-effective transactions between different currencies, including both fiat and cryptocurrencies. Its native currency, XRP, helps in making transactions secure and quick using a unique consensus protocol. Ripple’s system can handle up to 1,500 transactions each second, making it scalable for extensive use. XRP faced challenges due to a legal case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which affected its price. Although the decision in 2024 led to a fine of $125 million against Ripple Labs, XRP’s price saw a 26% rise post-ruling. Indicating a steady adoption rate, Ripple has formed partnerships with various financial institutions, pointing towards wider integration into mainstream systems. Despite the legal hurdles, XRP’s technology remains focused on providing fast and low-cost global transactions, showcasing its potential in the financial market. Conclusion Established coins like XRP may offer steady growth, but their short-term potential seems limited compared to new contenders. The market is currently favoring projects that can deliver significant returns quickly. Codename:Pepe emerges as a standout with its unique use of genuine artificial intelligence to maximize profits. By combining advanced AI strategies with a community-driven approach, it presents an opportunity for investors to capitalize on the current bullish momentum in the crypto space.

Solana Shows Signs of Reversal Amid Oversold Conditions Solana (SOL) is trading between $156.08 and $184.87, experiencing a recent decline with a 1-week price change of -15.28% and a 1-month change of -36.95%. Despite the bearish trend, technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index at 26.79 and the Stochastic at 25.85 suggest that the asset is oversold and may be poised for a bullish reversal. The current price is hovering around the 10-day Simple Moving Average of $162.26, below the 100-day SMA of $171.39, indicating potential for upward movement. If bullish momentum returns, Solana could target the nearest resistance level at $201. Breaking through this level might open the path to the second resistance at $230, which would represent an increase of about 30% from current prices. On the downside, if the bearish trend persists, the nearest support level is at $144.12, with a further drop potentially leading to the second support at $115.33. As many anticipate a forthcoming altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, Solana’s price action is closely watched for signs of recovery and growth. Conclusion Though SOL and others have shown promise, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely blends sports and meme culture, aiming for remarkable growth and community success in 2025.

40816327,https://coingape.com/?p=240843,1740485436,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Here’s Why Crypto Market Faces $325 Bln Loss,https://coingape.com/heres-why-crypto-market-faces-325-bln-loss/,"The crypto market is in turmoil, with its total market cap plunging by $325 billion since last Friday. Bitcoin’s price took a sharp 8% hit, dropping to the $87,000 mark. Leading altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana saw losses exceeding 12%. So, here we take a quick look at the potential reasons that may have dampened the investors’ sentiment. Why Is Crypto Market Falling? A flurry of factors might have contributed to the recent crypto market collapse. A combination of liquidity issues, macroeconomic trends, and technical sell-offs appears to be behind the latest downturn. According to The Kobeissi Letter , a leading global capital markets commentary platform, crypto markets erased $100 billion in just one hour today without any major headlines. The platform pointed out that around $150 billion in liquidations occurred in 24 hours, dragging almost all cryptocurrencies down. Even the meme coin sector, which had been booming, saw a steep decline. Notably, CoinGlass data showed that $1.49 billion has been liquidated in the last 24 hours amid the broader digital assets market crash . As of writing, the global crypto market cap stood at $2.9 trillion. Source: The Kobeissi Letter, X Solana’s Downfall Triggered Selling Pressure Solana was one of the key players in the recent crypto frenzy, especially with meme coins driving its rapid surge. However, as memecoin hype started fading, Solana price suffered a drop of around 20% in a week. Initially, this decline remained isolated from Bitcoin, but it later spread across the market. Source: The Kobeissi Letter, X Adding to the market-wide sell-off, the S&P 500 also began losing ground on Friday. Bitcoin, often correlated with broader financial markets, followed suit. Once Bitcoin broke below the $98,000 support level, panic selling intensified. As of writing, BTC price was down about 8% and hovered near the $87K mark. Source: The Kobeissi Letter, X Citadel’s Crypto Pivot and the Bybit Hack Impact Interestingly, the sharp decline came just hours after a report that the $65 billion financial giant Citadel Securities is exploring the crypto space as a liquidity provider. However, instead of boosting market sentiment, the news triggered a “sell-the-news” reaction. Another major blow came from the Bybit hack , which cybersecurity firm Arkham Intelligence described as the “largest financial heist in history.” The hack exceeded $1 billion in stolen assets, more than doubling the infamous $611 million PolyNetwork breach in 2021. Such security incidents erode investor confidence, leading to more panic-driven exits from the market. Crypto Market Pullback: Normal Correction or Bull Run End? Ethereum’s weakness has added more strain to the broader crypto market. The recent wave of selling appears to be a mix of technical pullbacks and declining liquidity. However, analysts suggest that such corrections are part of a healthy market cycle. For context, in a recent X post, popular market expert “il Capo Of Crypto” hints at a “strong bounce” in the market. These comments indicate that despite the short-term selloff, the crypto market is likely to witness a strong comeback in the coming days.

Crypto expert warns XRP headed for massive crash,https://finbold.com/sell-alert-crypto-expert-warns-xrp-headed-for-massive-crash/,"Prices have been moving fast in the cryptocurrency market on February 25, with hundreds of millions of dollars erased in a bloodbath that has taken Bitcoin ( BTC ) below $89,000 for the first time since November and Ethereum ( ETH ) below $2,400 for the first time since October. XRP , one of the most prominent tokens in the world, in no small part thanks to Ripple Labs’ long legal battle with the SEC, has not been spared either and has plunged a total of 18.50% in the last 7 days to its press time price of $2.11. XRP 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold Furthermore, having lost its previous and critical support level near $2.30, XRP now appears poised for an even greater crash, and a prominent on-chain analyst, Ali Martinez, is now predicting a fall to lows not seen since the early days of the Donald Trump re-election rally. Is XRP set for a massive crash? Specifically, in an X post posted in the small hours of February 25, Martinez explained that XRP is breaking out of its previously established ascending parallel channel . According to the expert, the token is now targeting $1.65, meaning that a further 22% downside is likely ahead. $XRP is breaking out of an ascending parallel channel, targeting $1.65! pic.twitter.com/7WhTmy7mLf — Ali (@ali_charts) February 25, 2025 Though the core reason for the downside appears not to be related to XRP itself, it is likely to have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency’s performance in the foreseeable future. The token’s previous bullish setup — a setup that had the potential to take it back above $3 and possibly to new highs — was highly dependent on the now-lost $2.30 support level, as Finbold reported on February 24. Still, there remains a chance that the XRP plunge will not be as severe as the token still has support near $2.08 and near $1.85, meaning there remains a possibility it will not reach its bearish target of $1.65. Why the crypto market is crashing Simultaneously, it is difficult to gauge just how low XRP could collapse, given the strength of the bearish momentum affecting the entire cryptocurrency market. For example, by press time on February 25, the total digital assets’ market capitalization collapsed approximately $100 billion within just 24 hours. Cryptocurrency market capitalization 24-hour chart. Source: TradingView Additionally, a lack of a clear reason behind the bloodbath also makes gauging its eventual impact difficult, though it appears likely the causes were, once again, external. Specifically, the start of the downturn coincided with President Donald Trump’s confirmation that his planned tariffs against Mexico and Canada would be implemented after the postponement period elapses. The situation is akin to other recent examples of digital assets having a violent reaction to seemingly unrelated events. The cryptocurrency market experienced a major wipe during the Silicon Valley plunge in the wake of DeepSeek artificial intelligence’s ( AI ) release in late January. Similarly, Operation True Promise 2 , Iran’s October missile attack against Israel, triggered a strong Bitcoin price drop . Still, the fact external and seemingly unrelated events have an outsized impact on cryptocurrencies is, perhaps, not surprising. Historically, digital assets have had positive reactions to, equally apparently, unconnected happenings. The great rally of 2024 and 2025 was, after all, driven primarily by Donald Trump’s re-election. Featured image via Shutterstock The post Sell alert!

There are several catalysts for the swoon, including risk-off sentiment in traditional markets and influence from memecoins, especially the recent trading in TRUMP and LIBRA. As we discussed Monday , market makers attending the Consensus Hong Kong conference last week were worried the memecoin frenzy had sucked liquidity from the productive crypto sub-sectors, leaving the broad market vulnerable. Another reason is President Donald Trump's inaction. Although he made significant promises in the lead-up to the elections, concrete action has been scarce. The anticipated strategic BTC reserve remains absent, and even state-level reserves are proving challenging to implement. ""The industry is still waiting for this to manifest in a tangible way in the form of measures such as a mooted Bitcoin Strategic Reserve,"" Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO at Mercuryo told CoinDesk. ""In the meantime, sentiment has been hit hard by the biggest ever hack at the Bybit exchange, leaking 401,000 ETH, and a memecoin sector plagued with high-profile pump and dump schemes."" Lastly, renewed concerns about the U.S. economy are zapping demand for riskier assets. ""There is also some concern about the slowdown in U.S. growth since last week's U.S. Services PMI release, the lowest in 22 months and consistent with GDP growth tracking at 0.6% only,"" Nansen's principal research analyst Aurelie Barthere said. ""Our Nansen Risk Barometer also just turned Risk-off from Neutral today."" Together, they sent BTC diving out of its two-month-long range play between $90,000 and $110,000. Technical analysis theory suggests it could drop to $70,000, though the maximum open interest in BTC put options listed on Deribit sits at the $80,000 strike, indicating that this level could provide some support. What could stabilize prices? Perhaps an announcement from Trump regarding a strategic reserve or a sharp reversal by the Nasdaq 100. However, that index has fallen below its 50-day SMA, while the yen, a risk-aversion signal, continues to strengthen against G7 currencies, including the dollar. The next major catalysts for risk assets are Nvidia's earnings on Feb. 26 and core PCE inflation on Feb. 28. Stay alert!

The scam started with the account “Comune Guardiagrele,” a small Italian city with a verified grey checkmark indicating it’s an official government or organization account, based on web results on identity verification. Scammers probably hijacked or bought the account and changed the name to “@SBF_Doge"" mimicking Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the disgraced crypto mogul jailed for the FTX fraud. The account then launched a memecoin, likely tricking unsuspecting traders or bots into thinking it was legitimate due to the verification badge. The memecoin’s market capitalization rose to $10 million before its creators pulled liquidity, crashing it to a $100,000 capitalization and pocketing fees and proceeds gained from the sale.

The SEC’s shifting approach has caught the crypto industry’s attention, bringing speculation about what could come next – we’ll explore the details below. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might also draw attention as a hybrid Layer-2 protocol designed to potentially upgrade Bitcoin’s functionality. We’ll break down all the important details below. Solana Price Prediction: SEC Opens Public Comment on Four Solana ETFs – Is This the Start of a New SOL Surge? The SEC’s willingness to review Solana ETF proposals shows a shift from its previous stance. Just a year ago, the regulator was reluctant to approve crypto-based investment products. However, the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024 set a new precedent, making Solana a logical next candidate for institutional investment. Chris Chung, founder of Solana swap platform Titan, called the SEC’s change in stance a “big about-turn,” saying that it could pave the way for Solana’s mass adoption. He pointed out, “The SEC has done a big about-turn on the Solana ETF from refusing to even entertain such an investment product to acknowledging Grayscale’s amended SOL ETF application” (source: Decrypt). The SEC typically takes 21 days to review such filings, during which it can approve, deny, or extend the decision. Many analysts believe Solana ETFs could be approved within the year, though the exact timeline remains unclear. If given the green light, it would be a major milestone for Solana, similar to Bitcoin’s ETF approvals. The growing push for crypto ETFs has gained momentum under the current U.S. administration, with the SEC forming a dedicated crypto task force. Sheldon the Sniper predicts that Solana is on the verge of a breakout, potentially reaching new all-time highs with price targets ranging between $500 and $600 in the next rally. PlutoChain Has the Potential to Transform Bitcoin Through Hybrid Layer-2 Technology and Smart Contracts PlutoChain might address Bitcoin’s core challenge – slow transaction speeds and high fees that limit its use for everyday payments. With a hybrid Layer-2 solution, PlutoChain could process transactions off Bitcoin’s main chain while maintaining security and decentralization. A crucial feature is EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatibility, which could allow developers to port existing Ethereum applications directly to Bitcoin’s ecosystem. This includes DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces, and AI tools, potentially making Bitcoin more attractive for innovation without requiring complete rebuilds of existing projects. The key technical advantage is speed – PlutoChain’s 2-second block time dramatically outpaces Bitcoin’s 10-minute blocks. In testing, it has demonstrated capacity for over 43,200 daily transactions, far exceeding Bitcoin’s current throughput. The platform emphasizes both technical security and community governance. Security measures include regular audits by firms like SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi, continuous internal code reviews, stress testing, and adherence to global blockchain security standards. For governance, PlutoChain takes a community-driven approach through Discord, enabling users to influence technical upgrades and strategic decisions. This represents a shift from traditional top-down blockchain governance. If successful, PlutoChain could help transform Bitcoin from primarily a store of value into a practical payment system while maintaining its core strengths in security and decentralization. The Bottom Line New SEC developments could be a positive sign for Solana spot ETFs. In the next few weeks, there will be more reports that could confirm this release. In the meantime, PlutoChain could generate serious buzz with its hybrid Layer-2 platform which could activate new features in Bitcoin’s ecosystem. The mainnet launch is coming soon, so it might be worth keeping the project on your radar. —— This article is not financial advice.

Much of the growing discourse is focused on market volatility and governance changes within the crypto ecosystem. The Top 3 Trending Tokens Santiment’s February 25 report reveals that BTC is getting attention due to a recent acquisition from Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). The firm purchased 20,356 BTC for approximately $1.99 billion, increasing its total holdings to 499,096 BTC bought for around $33.1 billion. This investment, alongside a yield of 6.9% YTD 2025, has been widely discussed within the crypto market, particularly regarding its impact on the asset’s price fluctuations. RAY is trending following a recent 29% decline in a day and a 50% slump since Friday that was caused by rumors of a competing platform launching its own automated market maker (AMM). This speculation has raised concerns over liquidity shifts within the Solana ecosystem, leading to increased investor attention toward the token. Pump.fun is reportedly testing an AMM that, if implemented, could reduce the platform’s reliance on Raydium. The decentralized exchange currently facilitates trading for tokens launched on the Solana meme coin maker. FRAX has also been a focal point in conversations, with debates surrounding tokenomics, governance, and inflation. Various proposals have been introduced regarding changes to the coin’s emissions, branding, and incentive mechanisms. Ongoing discussions are centered on the token’s inflationary nature and relationship with FXTL and the potential impact these changes could have on its value and utility within the market. Other Trending Cryptocurrencies on Santiment’s List The blockchain analytic firm also highlights Ethereum (ETH), Frax Shares (FXS), and Kendu Inu (KENDU) as trending digital assets. ETH has seen increased discussions following its association with GrokAI3.0, a new project focused on advancements in AI technology and its potential financial implications. FXS, which is linked to FRAX, has also been widely mentioned, with many raising concerns about its potential dilution and implications for liquidity and value. On its part, KENDU has gained attention as part of a growing community-driven approach to digital assets. According to Santiment, talks around it largely highlight the importance of strong group bonds and collective effort over speculative trading. The token has been compared to cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE), with enthusiasts emphasizing its long-term potential as the market evolves. Some believe it represents a shift toward community-focused investments rather than gambling and pump-and-dump schemes.

The best coins to buy this month are Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin, and Yeti Ouro (YETIO) . While Doge, SHIB, and PEPE are popular names in the meme coin market, YETIO is in its presale phase and has tremendous potential. Let us check out more about them: Dogecoin Price Prediction Dogecoin is obviously the biggest meme coin out there by market cap. Its prices have seen a downward trend in the past month, and the movement continues in a similar fashion this week, too. However, 2025 has been great for DOGE because of several external factors that can bring a rise in its adoption. Firstly, there are strong rumors about DOGE’s integration into X (formerly Twitter) for payments. Then, of course, there is the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust that is due for approval. If things go right for the token, a significant rise in demand can be seen by Q2 of 2025. However, with its infinite supply, DOGE always remains a risky option. Dogecoin price is currently at $0.2451 . Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis Next up, we have another Dog-themed meme coin named Shiba Inu. The coin is just behind DOGE when it comes to market cap value. SHIB was once criticized because of its lack of utility, but its recent initiatives have focused on creating an ecosystem based on functionalities. Its layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium, now has processed about a billion transactions. Moreover, SHIB’s recent burn rate and upcoming metaverse projects could tighten supply, potentially pushing its price. For investors, SHIB offers raw meme coin volatility with an effective ecosystem in the making. That being said, SHIB is also a risky bet and is prone to sudden ups and downs. For instance, very recently, when transactions on its platform went down, SHIB’s prices dipped by over 4.5% in a week. Pepe Coin (PEPE) News Pepe Coin, a meme coin based on a frog, is also a pretty well-known name in the meme coin industry. While lacking utility, its cult-like community keeps it trending. February’s meme season could see PEPE growth, making it a short-term trader’s pick. Pepe Coin price is currently at $0.000009514 . However, its complete lack of utility and a massive supply of 420 Trillion makes it a risky option for gains in the long run. Yeti Ouro (YETIO) YETIO is February’s dark horse. YETIO focuses on offering utility features, unlike other meme coins like PEPE, Doge, and SHIB. This makes YETIO set for long-term growth as it generates its demand from value creation for the users. Credits: Yetio Website YETIO’s main product that has impressed one and all is its Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming model. The game Yeti Go lets players earn YETIO tokens through races and challenges backed by advanced Unreal Engine 5 graphics. The game is being developed in collaboration with the studio behind hit games like Call of Duty, Spider-Man, Dead Space, and The Witcher. Its audio composition is crafted by Grammy-nominated producers who have worked with renowned artists such as Major Lazer, Vybz Kartel, and Kabaka Pyramid. The dev team recently shared an electrifying video of the game demo. This is the reason why the YETIO presale has already sold around 200 million tokens, offering early buyers an amazing first-mover advantage. The price per YETIO token in the current Stage 3 of its presale is $0.024. This figure has shown early bird investors a 100% ROI. Key Features of YETIO: Limited Supply: 1 billion $YETIO tokens only, with 5% burned to create scarcity. Audit Security: To ensure safety and transparency, YETIO smart contracts are audited by SOLIDProof to minimize risks.Why DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, And YETIO? Well, DOGE and SHIB leverage strong communities and use cases, while PEPE mainly functions on speculative hype. At the same time, YETIO stands apart with its gaming ecosystem and presale success. Diversifying across these tokens balances risks associated with meme coins. So, while DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE rely on market sentiment, YETIO’s presale offers a calculated entry point for gamers and investors. YETIO’s presale is currently active, and users get a 10% bonus on every deposit.

Now, all eyes are turning to the next potential contender for a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) – Solana. But when BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, was directly asked about a Solana ETF , their response was… silence. Let’s dive into what this intriguing non-answer means and what it signals for the future of crypto investments. Decoding BlackRock’s Crypto ETF Strategy: Beyond Bitcoin Rachel Aguirre, BlackRock’s U.S. iShares product head, recently shed some light on the company’s approach to launching spot crypto ETFs . In a Bloomberg TV interview, she outlined three core principles guiding BlackRock’s foray into this exciting, yet complex, asset class. These principles offer a valuable window into how BlackRock views the crypto ETF landscape and what they prioritize when considering new products: Meeting Customer Needs: First and foremost, BlackRock emphasizes aligning their ETF offerings with what their clients are actually demanding. This suggests a market-driven approach, where the voice of investors plays a crucial role in shaping their product roadmap. Are investors clamoring for broader crypto exposure beyond Bitcoin? The answer to this question likely dictates BlackRock’s next moves. Defining a Clear Investment Logic: Beyond just demand, BlackRock stresses the importance of a sound investment rationale. Any potential crypto ETF must have a clear and understandable investment thesis. This implies rigorous analysis and a well-defined strategy behind each ETF they launch. It’s not just about jumping on the bandwagon; it’s about providing investors with a credible and logical investment vehicle. Assessing ETF Suitability: Liquidity, Transparency, and Derivative Strategies: Aguirre highlighted crucial factors for ETF suitability, including liquidity, transparency, and the potential for derivative strategies. These are fundamental aspects that ensure an ETF can function efficiently and provide investors with a reliable and accessible investment product. Let’s break down why these are so important: Liquidity: Ensures that the ETF can be easily bought and sold on exchanges without significant price slippage. This is vital for investor confidence and smooth trading. Transparency: Refers to the clarity of the ETF’s holdings and how it operates. Investors need to understand what they are investing in and how the ETF is managed. Support for Derivative Strategies: This hints at the sophistication BlackRock aims for in its crypto ETF offerings. Derivatives can be used for hedging, enhancing returns, or managing risk, adding another layer of complexity and potential value for investors. These principles, articulated by Rachel Aguirre , provide a framework for understanding BlackRock’s cautious yet strategic approach to the crypto ETF market. They aren’t just blindly launching products; they are carefully considering market demand, investment rationale, and the fundamental characteristics that make an ETF a sound investment vehicle. The Solana ETF Question: Why the Silence? Despite outlining these principles, Rachel Aguirre notably dodged a direct question about whether BlackRock is considering launching a spot Solana ETF . This silence speaks volumes in the world of crypto speculation. Why might BlackRock be tight-lipped about a potential Solana ETF ? Strategic Ambiguity: In the competitive world of asset management, revealing future product plans prematurely can give competitors an edge. BlackRock might be strategically keeping their cards close to their chest to avoid tipping off rivals or creating unnecessary market hype before they are ready. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving rapidly. While spot Bitcoin ETFs have been approved, the path for other cryptocurrencies like Solana might not be as clear-cut. BlackRock might be waiting for more regulatory clarity before publicly committing to a Solana ETF . Assessment Phase: Aguirre’s principles suggest a thorough assessment process. BlackRock might be actively evaluating Solana’s suitability for an ETF based on their criteria – customer demand, investment logic, liquidity, transparency, and derivative potential. The silence could simply mean they are still in the assessment phase and haven’t reached a definitive decision. Market Timing: Even if BlackRock is considering a Solana ETF , they might be waiting for the opportune moment to launch. Market conditions, investor sentiment, and the overall crypto climate can all influence the timing of such a product launch. The lack of a direct answer from Rachel Aguirre doesn’t necessarily mean BlackRock isn’t interested in a Solana ETF . It could simply indicate a cautious and strategic approach, typical of a firm of BlackRock’s stature. Their silence fuels speculation and keeps the crypto community guessing, which in itself can be a powerful market dynamic. Solana’s Potential as an ETF Asset: Weighing the Pros and Cons Let’s analyze Solana’s merits as a potential underlying asset for a spot ETF, considering BlackRock’s stated principles: Pros of a Solana ETF: Growing Ecosystem and Adoption: Solana boasts a vibrant and rapidly expanding ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi projects, and NFTs. Its high transaction speeds and low fees have attracted developers and users, making it a significant player in the crypto space. This growing adoption signals potential long-term value and investor interest. Technological Advantages: Solana’s unique Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism enables faster transaction processing compared to some other blockchains. This technological edge is a key selling point and could attract investors seeking exposure to innovative blockchain technology. Community Support: Solana has a strong and active community that is passionate about its growth and development. This community support can be a significant driver of network effects and long-term sustainability. Diversification Beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum: A Solana ETF would offer investors a way to diversify their crypto holdings beyond the two dominant cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum. This diversification is crucial for portfolio risk management and capturing potential growth in alternative crypto assets. Challenges and Considerations for a Solana ETF: Regulatory Scrutiny: Altcoins like Solana often face greater regulatory scrutiny compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. The regulatory landscape for crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin is still uncertain, and this could be a hurdle for a Solana ETF approval. Volatility: Solana, like many altcoins, can be more volatile than established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This volatility could make a Solana ETF a riskier investment compared to a Bitcoin ETF, requiring careful consideration of risk management. Centralization Concerns: While Solana is decentralized, there have been some discussions around the level of decentralization compared to more established blockchains. These concerns, although debated, could be a factor in BlackRock’s assessment of its suitability for an ETF. Relatively Shorter Track Record: Compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana has a shorter history. While its growth has been impressive, its long-term resilience and stability are still being established. This shorter track record might require more due diligence and risk assessment. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? BlackRock’s cautious stance on a Solana ETF , while not a rejection, underscores the evolving nature of the crypto ETF market. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors: Monitor BlackRock’s Actions: Keep a close eye on BlackRock’s future statements and filings related to crypto ETFs . Any hints or signals from the world’s largest asset manager can provide valuable clues about the direction of the market. Diversify Your Crypto Portfolio: Whether or not a Solana ETF materializes soon, diversification remains a key principle in crypto investing. Consider exploring different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to manage risk and capture potential opportunities. Stay Informed About Regulatory Developments: The regulatory landscape will significantly impact the future of crypto ETFs . Stay updated on regulatory news and pronouncements from agencies like the SEC to understand the evolving rules of the game. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing in any cryptocurrency or crypto ETF , conduct thorough research. Understand the underlying technology, market dynamics, and risk factors involved. Don’t rely solely on speculation or hype; make informed decisions based on your own due diligence. The Future of Solana ETFs: A Waiting Game? BlackRock’s silence on a Solana ETF leaves the crypto community in a state of anticipation. While Rachel Aguirre provided valuable insights into BlackRock’s crypto ETF strategy, the specific question about Solana remains unanswered. Whether a Solana ETF will eventually emerge remains to be seen. It hinges on a complex interplay of factors – customer demand, regulatory clarity, Solana’s continued growth, and BlackRock’s strategic decisions. For now, it’s a waiting game, but one filled with intriguing possibilities for the future of crypto investments.

Durov’s arrest triggered a rippling downtrend that took the TON price to new lows, and now, a broader market selloff has weighed in. But despite falling 55% from its ATH, analysts’ near-term prediction of $4.68 has sparked optimism. A deeper look shows disillusioned investors are already jumping ship for more promising opportunities, and the new Panshibi meme coin emerged as an excellent alternative. This innovation-focused meme project is changing the paradigm around meme culture, and experts project a 12,000% surge on Binance’s listing. This article will critically look at the latest Toncoin price prediction and why Panshibi is in the spotlight. Toncoin Price Prediction: TON Holder Book Profit Amid Declining TVL And User Activities Toncoin had a stellar 2024 until Telegram CEO Durov’s arrest turned the tide, and TON lost its bullish momentum. Since then, the altcoin has been struggling to break past crucial resistance levels. Recent on-chain data suggest long-term holders are fleeing from the bloodbath. Age Consumed metrics that signaled massive movement of previously dormant tokens have soared to a five-month peak. This aligns with the profit-taking and panic-selling pressure that pushed TON’s price to a 26% loss MoM. Toncoin’s declining network activity also compounded the bearish outlook. Its pioneering tap-to-earn ecosystem has seen an exponential decline, with Hamster Kombat, Catizen, DOGS and others dropping at least 70% from their all-time high. The gloomy outlook forced Tapswap to choose BNB Chain over Toncoin for its airdrop, underscoring the network’s struggles in attracting key ecosystem players. Moreover, monthly active wallets have plummeted from 12 million to a disappointing 4 million this month, further highlighting waning user engagement. However, analysts’ Toncoin price prediction suggests a move above the crucial resistance to $4.68. Analyst Ali Martinez corroborated the outlook after identifying a Bollinger Bands squeeze that could result in a decisive surge in the near term. Panshibi Price Prediction: New Meme Token Projected To Soar 12,000% On Binance Listing The new Panshibi presale and explosive potential have brought much-needed relief to Toncoin’s bearish price action. Meme coins have been dominating the market, but Panshibi represents a paradigm shift from speculative hype. The project skillfully blends meme culture with value-driven utility and the lovable Panda touch a model that had analysts predict an eye-popping 12,000% growth on Binance’s listing. The predictions are no mere chatter! Panshibi raised over a massive $1.1M within the first month of its presale after selling out three stages with lightning speed. By the time it officially lists, the price would have gone up to $0.026, a whopping 1200% in just 60 days. But what’s fueling the projections? Panshibi’s multifaceted approach to meme culture and value-driven utility attracted investors. Its community-first approach, which focuses on incentivized participation, long-term growth and unique utility, struck a chord with disillusioned TON investors. At the heart of this revolution are AI-powered social-fi elements that foster community interaction and rewarding activities. Its passive income stream is another lure. Token holders earn a 1200% stake to earn APY alongside unique utilities like NFT collectibles and VIP access to exclusive content. While Toncoin fizzles, Panshibi’s mix of fun and purpose makes it an excellent alternative to bank on. Its ongoing presale has been trending on social media and mainstream news outlets as an exciting opportunity to get in on the next biggest meme rally. Conclusion Panshibi is emerging as a game-changer in the meme coin space, offering both excitement and real utility. While Toncoin struggles with declining user activity and bearish sentiment, Panshibi’s innovative model and explosive growth potential have captured investors’ attention. With a presale selling out at record speed and analysts projecting a staggering 12,000% surge post-Binance listing, this could be the breakout opportunity of the year. The presale is still on, selling at just $0.005 in stage 4. As disillusioned Toncoin holders look for fresh prospects, Panshibi stands out as the next big thing in crypto.

Here is the Latest Data",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-investors-are-buying-the-dip-according-to-kraken-reports-here-is-the-latest-data/,"Crypto traders are taking advantage of Bitcoin’s recent price drop, buying the dip as BTC falls to a three-month low, according to Kraken’s Head of Derivatives Alexia Theodorou. Bitcoin Investors Are ‘Buying the Dip’ as BTC Drops Below $88K, According to Kraken Reports Bitcoin briefly fell below $88,000 on Tuesday as Nasdaq futures signaled continued risk aversion, while the Japanese yen, generally considered a safe haven, held firm against the U.S. dollar. The decline came after a $1 billion increase in open futures positions on Binance, with many traders shorting BTC in anticipation of further declines. Kraken Investors Expect a Recovery Despite the decline, bullish traders on Kraken are loading up on long positions, pushing the perpetual-term long-to-short ratio to a record high of 0.8. “Despite Bitcoin’s price falling below $90,000, Kraken has seen an increase in traders opening long positions in the BTC perpetual market,” Theodorou said. “The long/short ratio has climbed to a record high of 0.8, while the number of open interests has also reached its highest level in four weeks. This suggests that investors are anticipating a recovery and are effectively ‘buying the dip.’” While dip buying signals positive sentiment, the long-short ratio remains below 1, meaning short positions are still greater than long positions. “While this ratio signals underlying optimism, liquidations remain at relatively normal levels, suggesting that excessive leverage still exists,” Theodorou added. “This could leave the market vulnerable to further downside, possibly in the form of a prolonged squeeze in the near term.” Bitcoin’s price action in the coming days will determine whether this dip-buying strategy will work or if the bearish momentum will continue to pull BTC lower. *This is not investment advice.

From ChatGPT composing college essays to algorithms diagnosing diseases, tech is remaking our world faster than we can agree on its regulation. But here’s the paradox that no one seems to want to talk about enough: we’re constructing a future in which AI development outstrips accountability. Nothing captures that sentiment better than the NTT DATA report , ‘The AI Responsibility Gap: Why Leadership Is the Missing Link.’ In this study, 71% of executives acknowledged that their companies lack clear leadership on how to balance innovation with ethics. Translation? We’re barreling toward a cliff driverless! Excerpts from the NTT DATA report, ‘The AI Responsibility Gap: Why Leadership Is the Missing Link.’ Source: NTT DATA This leadership gap bodes ill for AI Ignoring responsible AI leadership can have weighty implications on platform security. This conclusion meshes with the study’s findings that 89% of CISO executives highly dread AI-related risks, but many companies don’t have effective risk-management plans. This unpreparedness leaves organizations vulnerable to cyber-attacks, data breaches, and inadvertent algorithmic discrimination — all of which can erode consumer trust and invite regulatory scrutiny. Likewise, the Sustainability vs. AI tug-of-war is concerning. That’s because technology devours tons of energy to power the data centers that are central to its functioning. In addition to this, there is a demand for immense computing power to train its models, and you can see how much it strains the available resources while increasing its carbon footprint . This reality has led tech giants like Google and Microsoft to build energy-efficient systems using renewable energy sources. AI leadership failures are not limited to issues of security and sustainability. They cover the whole range of societal challenges that affect nearly every aspect of our lives, from employment to misinformation. Therefore, the level of the public’s trust in the technology is defined by the organizational ability to innovate AI ethically. The AI sector is calling for strong leadership These problems will persist with the dearth of leadership in the AI space, dealing a body blow to the technology’s hope for greater acceptance. Therein lies the challenge for CEOs in this sector: providing it with robust leadership, but what does that entail? First, it requires adherence to the principle of “responsible by design”—ethical concerns integrated into the AI development process from the beginning. These leaders cannot afford to incorporate transparency, fairness, and security as an afterthought after completing the development process. Again, companies need a robust governance framework beyond the minimum regulation requirements. They must set up internal guidelines to ensure accountability, review AI policies on a routine basis, and create a culture of responsibility equal to innovation. Any company that’s proactive toward AI ethics will protect its reputation and guarantee its competitiveness in the market. One may ask, what about the workforce? We must reform employee training, integrating technical knowledge with ethics. For instance, AI education initiatives should include real-world use case studies, scenario-based learning, and iterated discussion on bias, security, and accountability. This helps teams stay current and properly positioned to unpack AI’s ethical complexities as the technology continues to evolve. Given AI’s wide-reaching impact, leaders need to cooperate across borders to establish uniform guidelines and policies that guarantee its responsible usage. Proposals such as the EU’s AI Act and the Hiroshima G7 AI Process are important precedents, but they underscore the need for aligning differing approaches to AI policy and oversight. Hence, to shape AI’s future, future CEOs and industry leaders should participate in these conversations responsibly. CEOs must step up now In conclusion, we should remember that demanding ethics in AI leadership isn’t about stifling innovation. Instead, it’s a means of steering innovation in a way that AI enhances humans, not overpowers them. As indicated earlier, a company that fails to build responsibility into its AI strategy sacrifices its security, brand reputation, and business’s long-term viability. Excerpts from the NTT DATA report, ‘The AI Responsibility Gap: Why Leadership Is the Missing Link.’ Source: NTT DATA Without firm leadership, AI’s risks could outweigh its advantages. Therefore, business leaders have to acknowledge their part in determining its trajectory. Their decisions today dictate whether the technology will drive sustainable progress or be a source of unintended challenges tomorrow. The reality is we are on the cusp of an AI-powered future. So, we must ask ourselves whether we are building that future on ethics or leaving it to chance. CEOs actively embedding responsibility across their AI strategies, fostering collaboration, and prioritizing governance are forerunners to a future where AI is a force for good. It’s time to provide leadership in responsibility.",OP-ED|DeepSeek|Meta|Microsoft|OpenAI,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-25 13:20:13

In a recent post, he stated, “$XRP is going to tokenize BITCOIN on the XRPL & that’s the answer to the BTC people.” This assertion has sparked discussions on the potential implications of such a development, including its impact on market dynamics and XRP’s valuation. $XRP is going to tokenize BITCOIN on the XRPL & that’s the answer to the BTC people . Like I said YEARS ago before people caught on YEARS LATER. — KINGVALEX (@VALELORDX) February 23, 2025 Understanding the Concept of Bitcoin Tokenization on XRPL Tokenization involves representing a real-world or digital asset on a blockchain, allowing it to be transacted more efficiently. In this context, if Bitcoin were tokenized on the XRPL, it would mean a version of BTC operating within the XRPL ecosystem. This could bring Bitcoin’s liquidity and store-of-value properties into an environment known for fast and low-cost transactions. The XRPL is designed for speed, scalability, and efficiency. These make it a compelling alternative to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mechanism, which is often criticized for slow transaction speeds and high fees. By integrating Bitcoin into the XRPL, users could transact with a Bitcoin-backed asset while benefiting from the ledger’s efficiency. Community Reactions and Market Speculations The claim by KingValex has led to a broader discussion within the XRP community, with some users questioning whether this development could finally impact XRP’s price. One user, @BThomasBThomas, asked whether Bitcoin’s tokenization would result in XRP breaking free from what many perceive as long-term price suppression. He asked, “Is there any possibility that even with this BTC tokenization on the XRPL, the price of XRP keeps being dirty cheap?! Or that manipulation sooner or later will end!?” This concern reflects a common sentiment in the XRP community—despite its adoption and technological advantages, XRP has historically struggled to maintain sustained price increases. According to some analysts, market forces, regulatory uncertainties, and broader crypto market trends have helped keep XRP’s price in check. Another user, Zak Khan, pointed out historical price movements, suggesting that XRP tends to move in rapid upward surges followed by extended consolidation periods. He stated , “XRP’s price moves just like how it did from 60 cents to new ATH. Very fast. Then it’s long sideways and a little down here and there. It’s always been like that.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Meanwhile, Justin Tomlin emphasized that an increased demand, driven by Bitcoin’s potential tokenization on XRPL, would necessitate a price reevaluation. He remarked , “The price will need to be reevaluated to match the demand, based on the utility and because BTC doesn’t do [anything] other than be expensive and slow.” Evaluating the Feasibility and Potential Impact While the claim of Bitcoin tokenization on XRPL is intriguing, its feasibility remains uncertain. There has been no official confirmation from Ripple or XRPL developers regarding such an initiative. However, given that XRPL already supports the tokenization of assets through its built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), a tokenized version of Bitcoin is technically possible. If implemented, this could enhance interoperability between Bitcoin and XRPL, increasing liquidity and possibly driving more adoption. However, whether this would directly influence XRP’s price is debatable. Market trends suggest utility does not always correlate with immediate price appreciation, as seen with several blockchain projects that have achieved technological advancements without substantial price gains.

As traders evaluate whether Cardano can overcome significant barrier levels, demand for Panshibi (SHIBI) , a new challenger, is skyrocketing. Panshibi has raised more than $1.15 million in presale fundraising thanks to its security-focused strategy and meme-driven appeal, raising hopes that it might emerge as a significant competitor should Binance approvals come to pass. Cardano Price Prediction: Can ADA Rally Past Resistance? The price of Cardano may soon make a significant move, according to technical indications. With a crucial resistance zone close to $0.82, ADA is currently trading at about $0.74 . Bulls may burst out toward $0.85 if they can regain this level. Nonetheless, momentum metrics like the RSI, which is positioned below 50, indicate that purchasing pressure is still mild. A move above $0.85 would spark fresh interest, but if buying pressure doesn't hold, ADA might retest support at $0.55 or below. Due to the shifting market mood, traders are still hesitant to make big wagers on a sudden breakout. Nonetheless, some experts believe ADA is facing selling pressure as it struggles under bearish control, tumbling below $0.75. Cardano's increasing use of DeFi apps and impending network upgrades are other factors affecting Cardano's price predictions. ADA may see substantial growth if these factors coincide with more general positive sentiment. However, the price can stay range-bound soon if there are no significant bullish triggers. Panshibi (SHIBI) Presale Sees Explosive Growth Amid Binance Speculation Panshibi (SHIBI) is attracting attention with its quick presale rise. Panshibi, which is priced at $0.005, has raised more than $1.15 million so far, indicating that investors are very interested in meme-based tokens with solid security foundations. A two-year team token lockup that boosts investor confidence, locked liquidity for stability, and a security audit that guarantees transparency are what drive SHIBI's demand. These elements lower risks and draw in long-term investors by establishing SHIBI as a legitimate initiative. Beyond its popularity as a meme, Panshibi incorporates a social-fi system that incentivizes user participation through quests, staking, and interactive community involvement. With the addition of genuine utility that might foster long-term growth, this model frames it as more than just a standard meme token. The possibility of a Binance listing, which would significantly boost Panshibi's exposure and liquidity, is also generating speculation. The $0.005 presale price may represent a small portion of SHIBI's post-listing valuation if it is approved by major exchanges. According to historical trends, early-stage meme tokens with solid foundations frequently see multi-fold returns upon listing on large exchanges. Will Panshibi Outshine Cardano? Panshibi's quick rise indicates that investors are increasingly searching for high-upside prospects, even while Cardano's price prediction still depends on network advances and general market conditions. SHIBI may see a significant increase if Binance approvals come to pass, drawing focus away from well-known altcoins like Cardano. Nevertheless, Cardano is a wise long-term investment due to its robust foundation and expanding ecosystem. For risk-tolerant investors, Panshibi's presale success and speculative appeal may, nevertheless, result in better returns soon. Conclusion The Cardano price forecast is still neutral to slightly bullish; a significant breakout would require ADA to regain $0.60–$0.62. As this is going on, Panshibi (SHIBI) is gaining traction, having raised over $1.15 million in presale capital and stoking rumors of possible Binance approvals. Panshibi may experience more increases if the meme coin story holds up, giving it a good substitute for traders who are looking for altcoins that aren't as conventional. Both assets demonstrate the constantly shifting dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, regardless of whether Cardano makes a splash or Panshibi emerges as the next popular token.

With this, the crypto-verse is now valued at $3.01 Trillion. Notably, the market has wiped out over $110 billion in 24 hours, making it the worst-performing day of the year. Considering the ongoing market statistics, is this a good time to invest in Bitcoin? Moreover, investors are storming the internet with questions like “Why is BTC crashing?” In this article, we have uncovered the market sentiments and possible short-term Bitcoin price analysis just for you. BTC Price Breaks Below Its Crucial Support Of $90,000! The price of Bitcoin has lost 7.16% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $74.79 billion, a change of +206.03%. Furthermore, it has dropped ~8% in 7 days and ~15% in the last 30 days. With a YTD return of -4.68%, its dominance has increased to 61.1079%. The EMA 50-day constantly acts as a resistance to the Bitcoin price chart in the daily time frame with its EMA 200-day on the verge of experiencing a negative crossover. This highlights an increase in the selling-over-buying pressure for the largest crypto token. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) records a sharp plunge toward the oversold range in the 1D time frame. Moreover, the average trendline displays a similar price trend, suggesting a negative outlook for the BTC price this week. How Low Will Bitcoin Price Go? If the bears maintain the negative momentum, the Bitcoin price could retest its support level of $85k. Maintaining the price below that level could set the stage for it to plunge toward its lower support price of $81,000 in the upcoming time. However, if the bulls outrun the bears, the BTC price may retest its immediate resistance level of $90,000. Moreover, if the bulls dominate the market, this could result in the largest crypto token heading toward its upper resistance level of $92,000.

These statistics suggest a growing panic in the crypto market, which is currently fueling a sell-off. However, while almost all the crypto coins have been affected, more pressure seems to be mounting on the Shiba Inu and Solana prices. The current Solana price reflects a heightened fear factor as the price continues to fall. Similarly, the Shiba Inu price has been undergoing a drastic drop following the recent report of the 98% drop in the shibarium trading activity. This has caused a significant fall in the price, which hit a low of $0.00001444 today. However, the rise in the market fear factor is causing further panic as more people continue selling the Shiba Inu coin. However, as the price drops continue to create panic, more investors are favoring an investment in the Remittix token . A major factor fueling this surge in interest is its high ROI, which has continued to grow in the token presale rounds. What Is Causing Panic With The Solana Price and Is A Recovery At Sight? The Solana price started the year on a note that it could surge up to $500. This follows its multi-week rise, which saw it at $294 as of mid-January. However, in a move that defies all logic, the price has continued to fall, wiping off the early profit and hitting a new weekly low this year. However, the repeated daily price drop has continued to fuel a high panic. The daily chart shows the Solana price trading below the 7-day SMA in a recent candle formation, which is now treating the 7-day SMA as resistance. This formation indicates that the Solana price might be heading downward, which could see it at $120 soon. What Does The Shibarium 98% Drop In Trading Activity Mean For Shiba Inu Price? There are no two ways to say it; the recent drop in the Shiba inu trading activity could only suggest a drop in interest in the coin price. While Shiba Inu has enjoyed many years at the top as a top meme coin, the recent rise in meme coins creates opportunities to have a new favorite. This is the genesis of the Shiba inu drop. However, the latest Shibarium announcement shows the Shiba coin might be heading towards a new multi-month low as it continues losing its market influence. No nearby support has yet been identified on the Shiba Inu chart but a bird’s-eye view of the monthly chart shows a possible move toward $0.00000698. This Is Why Remittix Is The Best Option For Investors Looking For A Portfolio Boost This Year One thing that makes Remittix stand out is the value it provides, which is projected to revolutionize the crypto market. The Remittix project is a crypto solution that helps crypto users pay FIAT currencies directly into bank accounts using crypto assets. Remittix allows users to use a crypto asset like Dogecoin to pay fiat currency such as the US Dollar directly into a bank account. However, the transaction is completed securely without notifying the receiver that the transaction started as a crypto transaction, instead it appears as a regular bank transfer. The utility of the Remittix token is set to keep it pumping even after the presale, with a surge projection of up to 50x. Other investors are already buying into the Remittix presale, so don’t be left out. Check the links below to start today.

40818960,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133931,1740489944,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Nasdaq Listing: Grayscale Polkadot Trust to Unlock New Crypto Investment Horizons,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/grayscale-polkadot-trust-nasdaq-listing/,"Get ready for a potential game-changer in the world of cryptocurrency investments! Whispers from BWEnews on Telegram suggest that Grayscale Investments is making a bold move to list its Polkadot Trust on Nasdaq. This exciting development could open up new avenues for investors seeking exposure to Polkadot (DOT) through traditional financial markets. Let’s dive into what this groundbreaking news means for the crypto sphere and you. What is the Buzz About the Grayscale Polkadot Trust and Nasdaq Listing? The core of the excitement revolves around a proposed rule change filing submitted to Nasdaq. This filing, under Nasdaq Rule 5711(D), signals Grayscale’s intent to list and trade shares of its Polkadot Trust on the Nasdaq exchange. For those unfamiliar, Grayscale Investments is a titan in the digital asset management space, renowned for its crypto trusts that allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies in the form of publicly traded securities. Their Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is perhaps the most well-known example. Now, they’re setting their sights on Polkadot (DOT), a highly regarded blockchain platform known for its interoperability and scalability. Listing the Grayscale Polkadot Trust on Nasdaq would be a significant step, potentially making DOT more accessible to a broader range of investors, including institutional players who may prefer the regulated environment of a traditional stock exchange. Why is a Nasdaq Listing a Big Deal for the Polkadot Trust? Listing on Nasdaq isn’t just a formality; it’s a powerful validation and offers numerous benefits: Increased Accessibility: Currently, investing in the Grayscale Polkadot Trust might involve navigating specific platforms or custodial solutions. A Nasdaq listing would simplify access, allowing investors to buy and sell shares through their regular brokerage accounts, just like any other stock or ETF. Enhanced Liquidity: Being traded on a major exchange like Nasdaq typically leads to greater trading volume and tighter bid-ask spreads, making it easier for investors to enter and exit positions in the Polkadot Trust . Institutional Adoption: Many institutional investors have mandates or preferences for investing in securities listed on recognized exchanges. A Nasdaq listing could pave the way for increased institutional capital to flow into Polkadot through the Grayscale Trust. Legitimacy and Trust: Listing on Nasdaq adds a layer of regulatory oversight and legitimacy, which can boost investor confidence in the digital assets represented by the Trust. It signals a level of maturity and acceptance within mainstream finance. Wider Investor Base: Beyond institutions, a Nasdaq listing opens the door to retail investors who may be more comfortable investing in familiar exchange-traded products rather than directly holding DOT or navigating the complexities of cryptocurrency exchanges. Benefits of Investing in Digital Assets through a Trust Structure Grayscale’s trust structure offers a unique approach to crypto investment . Here’s why it’s appealing to many investors: Benefit Description Simplified Exposure Investors gain exposure to Polkadot without needing to directly purchase, store, or manage DOT tokens themselves. Grayscale handles the custody and security. Tax Advantages (Potentially) Depending on jurisdiction and individual circumstances, investing through a trust structure can offer certain tax efficiencies compared to direct crypto ownership. Consult with a tax advisor for personalized guidance. Familiar Investment Vehicle Trusts are a well-established investment structure, familiar to many investors comfortable with traditional financial products. This can lower the barrier to entry for those hesitant about the complexities of crypto wallets and exchanges. Regulated Environment While cryptocurrencies themselves are often subject to evolving regulations, Grayscale Trusts operate within a more regulated framework, providing a degree of investor protection and transparency. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of a Grayscale Polkadot Trust listing on Nasdaq is exciting, it’s essential to consider potential challenges and points to keep in mind: Regulatory Approval: The proposed rule change needs to be approved by the relevant regulatory bodies. While there’s optimism, regulatory processes can be unpredictable. Premium/Discount: Grayscale Trusts have historically traded at premiums or discounts to the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the underlying cryptocurrency holdings. Market demand and supply dynamics can influence this, potentially impacting investor returns. Fees: Grayscale charges management fees for its Trusts, which investors should factor into their investment decisions. These fees are for the convenience and management provided by Grayscale. Market Volatility: Polkadot, like all cryptocurrencies, is subject to significant price volatility. Investing in the Grayscale Polkadot Trust still exposes investors to this inherent market risk. Tracking Error: The Trust’s performance may not perfectly mirror the price movements of DOT due to factors like fees, operational costs, and the premium/discount dynamics. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should you do with this information? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from Grayscale and Nasdaq regarding the rule change filing and any updates on the listing process. Reputable crypto news sources will provide ongoing coverage. Do Your Research on Polkadot (DOT): If you’re considering investing in the Polkadot Trust , deepen your understanding of Polkadot’s technology, ecosystem, use cases, and long-term potential. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Evaluate your own risk appetite and investment goals before allocating capital to the Grayscale Polkadot Trust or any other crypto asset. Consult a Financial Advisor: If you’re unsure whether this investment is right for you, seek professional advice from a qualified financial advisor who can assess your individual circumstances and provide personalized guidance. Consider Diversification: Never put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification across different asset classes and cryptocurrencies is a prudent investment strategy to mitigate risk. The Future of Crypto Investment and Nasdaq Grayscale’s move to list the Polkadot Trust on Nasdaq is a powerful indicator of the growing convergence between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world. It signifies increasing acceptance and demand for digital assets within mainstream investment channels. If successful, this listing could pave the way for more crypto-based investment products to find their way onto major exchanges like Nasdaq, further bridging the gap between the old and new financial paradigms. This development underscores the transformative potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. As regulatory frameworks evolve and institutional adoption accelerates, we can expect to see even more innovative and accessible ways for investors to participate in the exciting world of crypto investment . Conclusion: A Groundbreaking Step for Polkadot and Crypto The potential Nasdaq listing of the Grayscale Polkadot Trust is undoubtedly groundbreaking news for both Polkadot and the broader cryptocurrency market. It represents a significant step towards mainstream acceptance, increased accessibility, and greater institutional participation in the digital asset space. While challenges and considerations remain, the overall outlook is optimistic. This move could unlock new opportunities for investors and further solidify Polkadot’s position as a leading blockchain platform.

While XRP price values struggle below $3, DTX Exchange, an emerging hybrid platform surges to $0.18 in its bonus presale phase. With regulatory shifts looming, could tax exemptions yield double-digit gains for these divergent projects? DTX Exchange Soars to $0.18 In Bonus Stage A new DeFi project, DTX Exchange , has surged to $0.18 in its final bonus presale stage, marking an 800% gain from its initial $0.02 offering. With over $15 million raised and 700,000 holders, the hybrid trading platform could emerge as a top crypto to invest in for 2025. Its unique value proposition could grant traders exposure to 120,000+ assets, including stocks, forex, and cryptocurrencies. Its no KYC model and 1000x leverage options could position it as a good altcoin investment ahead of its Q2 2025 launch. The platform’s growth contrasts with sluggish performances from the XRP price and Hedera, highlighting the demand for projects blending traditional finance with blockchain efficiency. DTX Exchange’s capped supply of 475 million tokens could create scarcity-driven appeal, with specialists noting that matching even 1% of XRP’s market cap could push its price toward $10. Features like copy trading and institutional-grade tools could further differentiate it from legacy tokens struggling with regulatory headwinds. As the best new crypto to invest in this quarter, DTX offers early participants a chance to secure tokens before exchange listings at $0.36. Its upcoming launch on decentralized and tier-1 platforms could ignite a rally, particularly if tax exemptions amplify interest in U.S.-aligned projects. For investors seeking top altcoins with exponential upside, DTX’s presale represents a strategic entry point ahead of anticipated mainstream adoption. XRP Price Dips Below $3 As Tax Rumors Persist The XRP Price has dropped below $3, trading at $2.59 following speculation about delayed tax exemptions for U.S.-based cryptocurrencies. Over the past week, Ripple’s token fell 6.4%, extending its monthly loss to 18% as investors weigh regulatory uncertainties against potential policy changes. Market sentiment remains divided, with some viewing the dip as a buying opportunity while others await clarity on how tax reforms might impact projects like Ripple. Source: XRP Price, Monthly Chart, CoinMarketCap Recent announcements from policymakers have fueled debates about whether XRP will qualify for exemptions under proposed legislation. Though rumors suggest Ripple could benefit from reduced capital gains taxes, the lack of official confirmation has pressured prices. Experts note that the XRP Price historically reacts sharply to regulatory developments, making short-term forecasts challenging. A recent tweet from crypto strategist Dark Defender highlights this tension: “XRP’s technical patterns hint at a breakout, but newer tokens like DTX are stealing the spotlight with real-world utility. Diversification could define 2025.” Despite its $149 billion market cap, Ripple faces competition from emerging platforms like DTX Exchange that could offer clearer regulatory alignment. The XRP Price decline contrasts with bullish projections earlier this year, underscoring how policy delays can overshadow long-term potential. For now, traders remain cautious, balancing Ripple’s established presence against newer assets positioned to capitalize on expanding tax frameworks. HBAR Falls to $0.21 Due to Tax Exemption Uncertainties Hedera’s token has slid to $0.21, down 33.95% this month, as uncertainty grows over its inclusion in proposed tax exemptions. While U.S.-focused projects like Ripple dominate discussions, Hedera’s recent underperformance reflects doubts about its eligibility under current legislative drafts. The token’s 24-hour trading volume has dipped 3.30%, suggesting diminished short-term confidence despite its enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure. Source: HBAR Price, Monthly Chart, CoinMarketCap Certain opinions highlight that Hedera could still benefit indirectly if exemptions accelerate the institutional adoption of compliant networks. However, its $9 billion market cap trails far behind Ripple, raising questions about its ability to attract capital if tax policies favor domestic projects. Unlike XRP, which maintains strong liquidity, Hedera’s niche use cases may limit its appeal to mainstream traders seeking immediate tax advantages. Market observers argue that Hedera's current valuation underestimates its long-term potential in sectors like healthcare and supply chain management. Still, the token’s trajectory will likely depend on regulatory clarity and whether Hedera can position itself as a go-to network for U.S. enterprises. For now, investors appear hesitant to trust heavily in HBAR until tax guidelines solidify. Conclusion Regulatory clarity could redefine opportunities for U.S.-aligned tokens like XRP and Hedera, but DTX Exchange’s hybrid platform could stand out with its presale momentum and 120,000+ asset access. As traditional and crypto markets converge, early participation in rising projects may prove strategic.

These events come amid the launch of the first Bitcoin Secured Network (BSN), the Babylon Genesis, which will enhance, secure, and provide liquidity to the broader blockchain ecosystem. With a recent announcement, the web3 project has opened a registration window and revealed the Babylon airdrop details. Let’s see the key details and the possible BABY token price at launch. Babylon Airdrop Details Out: Who’s Eligible? After much anticipation and the Babylon Off-Phase 2 launch in the previous month, the airdrop details are out. According to the Babylon Foundation announcement, this token distribution event is primarily aimed at the early adopter and contributors to the network. Additionally, there are particular eligibility criteria, where each category has different terms and conditions. For example, the Phase 1 stakers who staked during Phase 1 (up to BTC block height 875087) are eligible. In the Pioneer Pass NFT holders, the early stakers who hold the Pioneer Pass NFTs and staked during Phase 1 are also eligible. In addition, Phase 1 Finality providers (Babylon Github registered users + delegations during Phase 1), developers who contributed to the open source project, and social media contributors (who engaged before February 18, 2025) are included. Interestingly, other special airdrops from them exist, such as Binance Earn participants and wallet-specific captains. Interested candidates can check more details on the official Babylon Foundation page. How to Register for the Babylon Airdrop? The Babylon airdrop window opened from February 25, 2025, at 8:00 AM UTC until March 15, 2025, at 8:00 AM UTC. During this time, the user will create their BABY address and cryptographically link it to their significant BTC wallet, which they can use for stalking, airdrop receiving, and other tasks. The BABY token airdrop registration process requires Web users to create the BABY address and visit the airdrop.babylon.foundation. Once the address is created, users must provide their BTC address (for staking), Polygon address (for NFTs), and/or GitHub account. The last is signing the required cryptographic proofs of possession to complete registration. Similarly, CLI users must refer to the CLI guide and generate cryptographic proof, such as their BTC public key, Polygon address, and finality provider public key. The last step is to submit the registration using the Babylon API. As excitement builds around the airdrop, the question arises of what the BABY token’s price will be at launch and how it will perform. BABY Token Price at Launch: Market Expectations Speculation about the BABY token’s value began growing after the February 25, 2025, TGE announcement. According to the Uniswap pre-trading market, investors’ excitement pumped the BABY/ BTC trading pair. Its trading volume surged 5% within 15 minutes of the announcement. Interestingly, the impact was also visible in the Babylon token price, which surged 3%. Similarly, Binance trading activity surged, and the BABY/ USDT price increased by 2.5%. With that, investors’ expectations for this token’s launch are higher. However, the BABY token’s launch price is uncertain due to missing tokenomics and other relevant details. Investors must await further information on the subject before anticipating anything. What’s In There For You? The new updates confirm that the Babylon TGE and one of the biggest crypto airdrops is just around the corner. The web3 project airdrop registration has begun today and will continue until March 15, 2025. Once this is over, the must-awaited Baby token launch will take place, with rewards for early stakers, finality providers, NFT holders, GitHub contributors, and social campaign registration. However, the BABY token price at launch is uncertain. Investors must await further updates.

Currently in presale, this fast-rising altcoin has already raised over $1.3 million, with phase 2 underway at $0.015. More than 2,560 investors have jumped in, looking to position themselves before a 33.33% price jump in the next phase. Investors participating in this phase are set for a 300% ROI when Mutuum Finance launches at $0.06 after the presale. In addition, the token is set to skyrocket past $1 during the upcoming bull run with a 100x price surge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): The DeFi Disruptor Gaining Unstoppable Traction Mutuum Finance ’s presale is moving fast, currently in Phase 2 with tokens available at just $0.015. Investors have a limited window to buy in before the price jumps 33.33% to $0.02 in the next phase. Early adopters are positioned for a massive 300% ROI before public trading even begins with a confirmed launch price of $0.06. Over $1.3 million raised and 2,560+ holders showcase the growing demand for this groundbreaking DeFi project. Mutuum Finance is transforming the lending market with an advanced dual-lending system, which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model lets users deposit stablecoins like USDT into smart contract-managed liquidity pools, earning passive income while borrowers access funds seamlessly. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model removes middlemen, enabling borrowers and lenders to negotiate loan terms directly. This hybrid lending approach boosts security, decentralization, and capital efficiency, making MUTM a major disruptor in DeFi lending. A Stable and Secure Ecosystem To maintain stability and security, Mutuum Finance is launching a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. Unlike volatile algorithmic stablecoins, this approach requires borrowers to over-collateralize their loans, creating a secure buffer that protects both lenders and the platform’s long-term sustainability. This mechanism helps prevent liquidation risks while ensuring consistent value stability. Investor incentives are a top priority, with a $100,000 giveaway set to reward 10 lucky winners with $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. Additionally, an exclusive referral program encourages organic community expansion by rewarding users who bring in new investors. Mutuum Finance’s smart tokenomics strategy minimizes inflation while maintaining liquidity pools, security reserves, and strategic partnerships. With a carefully structured presale and a controlled token release, the project is built for long-term value appreciation. Moreover, staking rewards will further incentivize holders, ensuring consistent yield opportunities and reinforcing community engagement. Why Mutuum Finance Is a Game-Changer Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be one of 2025’s most promising DeFi projects with a strong development roadmap, a fast-growing user base and a revolutionary lending model. As the presale continues, momentum is building, with early investors set to gain significantly as the project scales to new heights. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is setting a new standard in DeFi lending, combining innovation, security, and strong tokenomics to create a sustainable and profitable ecosystem. With its dual-lending model, a rapidly expanding community, and a presale that is gaining massive traction, the project is on track to become a major force in decentralized finance. As the price continues to rise with each presale phase, early investors have a limited window to secure their position at the $0.015 price. Mutuum Finance is positioned for exponential growth, with a solid development roadmap, strategic partnerships, and a revolutionary lending approach. Join the project now while it is still undervalued at $0.015. An early entry guarantees you a 4x return at launch and up to 100x gains during the upcoming bull run.

40819068,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133912,1740490173,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Danger Signals: Market Caution Grips Crypto as Trump’s Tariff Threats Loom,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/market-caution-tariff-threats-crypto/,"Cryptocurrency markets, often seen as detached from traditional finance, are feeling the chill of global economic winds. As former President Trump reiterates his stance on tariffs, a wave of market caution is sweeping across asset classes, and digital currencies are no exception. Are we on the brink of another trade war, and what does it mean for your crypto portfolio? Let’s dive into the unfolding situation and understand the potential ripple effects. Why is Market Caution Gripping Global Assets Amid Tariff Threats? The mere mention of tariffs can send shivers down the spines of investors. Why? Because tariffs – taxes on imported goods – are more than just trade policy; they’re economic disruptors. When a major economy like the United States threatens to impose or increase tariffs, it sets off a chain reaction: Increased Costs for Businesses: Tariffs directly raise the price of imported components and goods. This squeezes profit margins for companies that rely on international supply chains, forcing them to either absorb costs or pass them on to consumers through higher prices, fueling inflation. Retaliatory Tariffs: Trade is a two-way street. When one country imposes tariffs, affected nations often retaliate with their own tariffs. This tit-for-tat escalation can lead to a full-blown trade war, disrupting global trade flows and hurting businesses on all sides. Economic Uncertainty: Tariff threats inject significant economic uncertainty into the market. Businesses become hesitant to invest and expand, fearing unpredictable cost increases and reduced consumer demand. This uncertainty can stifle economic growth and lead to market volatility. Impact on Global Growth: Global trade is a significant engine of economic growth. Trade wars and tariff barriers can significantly slow down this engine, impacting global GDP growth and creating a less favorable environment for investments across the board, including in nascent markets like cryptocurrencies. For the cryptocurrency market, which often seeks to position itself as an alternative to traditional finance, this global market caution can manifest in complex ways. While some might see crypto as a safe haven during economic turmoil, others become risk-averse and pull back from all volatile assets. The Specter of Trade War: A Looming Danger for Crypto? The term “trade war” itself evokes images of economic conflict and instability. Is this an overreaction? Perhaps not. Here’s why the renewed discussion around tariff threats is being taken so seriously: Historical Context: The previous US administration under Donald Trump saw a period of aggressive tariff imposition, primarily targeting China. This period was marked by increased market volatility and anxieties about global economic slowdown. The current resurgence of similar rhetoric brings back those memories and fears. Geopolitical Tensions: Tariff threats are often intertwined with broader geopolitical strategies. They can be used as leverage in negotiations, or as a tool to reshape global power dynamics. This adds another layer of complexity and unpredictability, making markets even more jittery. Impact on Supply Chains: Years after the initial disruptions caused by the pandemic, global supply chains are still in a state of flux. New tariffs could further complicate these chains, leading to bottlenecks, delays, and increased costs. This can have a cascading effect across industries and economies. How Does Market Caution Translate to Crypto Markets? While the direct link between tariff threats and cryptocurrency prices might not always be immediately apparent, the underlying mechanisms are quite real: Risk-Off Sentiment: When traditional markets exhibit market caution due to geopolitical or economic uncertainty, a “risk-off” sentiment often prevails. Investors tend to move away from perceived riskier assets towards safer havens like government bonds or cash. Cryptocurrencies, still considered a higher-risk asset class by many, can experience outflows during these periods. Correlation with Traditional Markets: The correlation between cryptocurrency markets and traditional markets, particularly equities, has been observed to increase during times of stress. If stock markets decline due to tariff threats and broader economic anxieties, crypto markets can follow suit, at least in the short term. Impact on Institutional Investment: Institutional investors, who are increasingly important players in the crypto space, are highly sensitive to macroeconomic factors and global economic uncertainty . Heightened tariff tensions and trade war fears could make them more hesitant to allocate capital to crypto, or even lead to a reduction in existing allocations. Currency Fluctuations: Tariffs and trade disputes can trigger fluctuations in currency exchange rates. While some might argue that cryptocurrencies offer a hedge against currency devaluation, periods of intense market volatility can lead to unpredictable price swings in both fiat and crypto markets. Navigating the Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do amidst this climate of market caution fueled by tariff threats ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments related to trade policy and global economic indicators. Reliable news sources and economic analysis can help you understand the evolving situation and its potential impact on markets. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is a fundamental principle of risk management. Ensure your crypto portfolio is well-diversified across different types of cryptocurrencies and asset classes. Consider holding a mix of established cryptocurrencies, promising altcoins, and potentially even some traditional assets to mitigate risk. Manage Your Risk Exposure: Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio accordingly. If you are risk-averse, consider reducing your exposure to more volatile assets, including cryptocurrencies, during periods of heightened uncertainty. Focus on Long-Term Fundamentals: While short-term market fluctuations can be unsettling, remember to focus on the long-term fundamentals of the cryptocurrency market. The underlying technology, adoption trends, and use cases of cryptocurrencies remain compelling. Market downturns can sometimes present opportunities to accumulate fundamentally strong assets at discounted prices. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): In volatile markets, DCA can be a prudent strategy. Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals. This can help to smooth out your entry price and reduce the risk of buying high. The Global Market Puzzle: Tariffs and Beyond It’s crucial to remember that tariff threats are just one piece of the complex global economic puzzle. Other factors are also at play, including: Factor Potential Impact Inflation and Interest Rates Persistent inflation and rising interest rates can dampen economic growth and increase borrowing costs, impacting all asset classes. Geopolitical Instability Conflicts and geopolitical tensions in various regions can create market volatility and uncertainty. Technological Disruption Rapid technological advancements, particularly in areas like AI and blockchain, can reshape industries and create both opportunities and risks. Regulatory Landscape for Crypto Evolving regulations for cryptocurrencies around the world can significantly impact market sentiment and adoption. Understanding these interconnected factors is essential for navigating the current market environment and making informed investment decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the Cautious Currents The resurgence of tariff threats has injected a dose of market caution into global financial markets, and cryptocurrencies are not immune. While the long-term trajectory of the crypto market remains promising, short-term volatility and uncertainty are likely to persist. By staying informed, managing risk, and focusing on long-term fundamentals, crypto investors can navigate these cautious currents and position themselves for future opportunities. The key is to approach the market with awareness and resilience, understanding that in the world of global finance, ripples from trade policy can reach even the digital shores of cryptocurrency.

The charts look like they’re bleeding with the numbers of downward-pointing arrows. This has affected many established tokens. SHIB and MATIC are not left out from this general wave. Meanwhile, investors believe fresh energy is needed to propel the market. In this short review, we’ll talk about the recent prices of SHIB and MATIC. We’ll also tip how 1Fuel’s ongoing presale at $0.018/token is gaining momentum and how investors can position themselves for massive gains. Why do experts think this new token will surge 100X this year? Read on to find out why. Market Uncertainty Pushes Shiba Inu (Shib) And Polygon (Matic) Holders Toward 1fuel SHIB has a solid reputation in the crypto community as one of the top meme coins. This token has seen its fair share of volatility, which is influenced by social media trends and speculative interest. Shiba Inu price has constantly declined over the past 3 months. Just between last week and the time of writing, we saw a -7.90% Shiba Inu price decline. Shiba Inu has managed to maintain a significant market presence despite this. One market analyst even predicted a new stellar price peak for the token to claim and bank on. They say the token is brewing a major price milestone that could turn into a mega event in the market. In all this, SHIB holders still think about diversifying their portfolio with assets 1Fuel. On the other hand, Polygon, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum that focuses on improving transaction speeds and reducing gas fees, has amassed widespread adoption of the token among blockchain developers and users. However, MATIC’s price isn’t immune to declines as we’ve seen a systemic price drop over the last couple of months and lately, a -12.66% decline in the past 7 days. In addition to this, the competition in the layer-2 space is intensifying with other projects vying for market share. Analysts believe MATIC must maintain its technological edge to stay relevant. Besides, the token’s holders are considering 1Fuel as the next best crypto to invest in. Join the presale now . 1Fuel’s Strategic Entry: Catalyzing New Growth Phases This is a project that has been quietly building momentum for months now. 1Fuel’s current presale which began at $0.01 is now at $0.018 with over 219 million tokens sold. 1Fuel was built with a one-click cross-chain transaction feature that could potentially change how we view swaps in the crypto market. With that one innovation, we could see an end to ridiculously high gas fees and slow processing times. 1Fuel’s launch on the open market will trigger a suite of platform features and perks including a crypto wallet with cross-chain swap, p2p, and staking functionality, crypto cards for real-world fiat payment and AI integrations for optimized trading. Early indicators suggest that 1Fuel’s approach could have a multiplier effect on other cryptocurrencies, including SHIB and MATIC. 1Fuel, with its cross-chain transfers, could double down on the utility provided by SHIB. For a token like MATIC, 1Fuel is most likely going to complement its scaling solutions to further enhance its value proposition. Conclusion Crypto prices are generally influenced by a complex interplay of factors like market sentiments and tech advancements. So a new player like 1Fuel in the game could shake things up drastically, especially with existing networks like SHIB and MATIC; a synergy that could potentially drive demand across the board.

Developers are scrambling to harness its power, creating apps that promise to make generative AI practical and impactful across industries. Investors are equally eager, pouring funds into the most promising ventures. In a powerful example of this trend, Perfect AI, an Israeli startup focused on transforming recruitment, has just secured a significant $23 million in seed funding. This isn’t just another funding round; it’s a clear signal that the future of hiring is being rewritten by AI. Perfect AI aims to be the ultimate co-pilot for recruitment teams, streamlining everything from crafting compelling job descriptions to pinpointing the perfect candidates from a flood of applications. They’re not just playing in the same field as established players like Indeed, Recruiter, and LinkedIn; they’re aiming to redefine it. Imagine recruiters reclaiming up to 25 hours each week – that’s the kind of impact Perfect AI is promising. In just a year since its quiet launch, Perfect AI has expanded its reach from a mere 20 to an impressive 200 businesses, including names like Fiverr, eToro, McCann, and Coralogix. This rapid growth underscores the urgent need for innovation in the often-cumbersome world of recruitment. What Makes Perfect AI the Perfect Solution for Recruitment AI? Perfect AI’s origin story is as intriguing as its mission. Founded by Eylon Etshtein, known for his controversial facial recognition startup Anyvision, Perfect AI emerged from Etshtein’s firsthand experience with the pain points of scaling recruitment. At Anyvision, Etshtein was deeply involved in hiring, quickly realizing that traditional methods simply wouldn’t scale. His background in AI, particularly in “needle-in-a-haystack” problem-solving, sparked the vision for a platform that could intelligently identify ideal candidates. This vision took shape as Perfect AI, born from the challenges Etshtein faced while building Anyvision. Stepping back from his day-to-day role at Anyvision, Etshtein channeled his expertise into creating a solution for a problem he knew intimately: the inefficiencies of recruitment. While the market is brimming with AI-powered HR startups, Perfect AI and its investors are confident in its unique approach. What sets Perfect AI apart in the competitive landscape of AI Recruitment ? Built from the Ground Up: Unlike many competitors leveraging third-party Large Language Models (LLMs), Perfect AI has constructed its platform from scratch. This includes developing its own vector data set and training it with meticulously curated data from third-party providers. Pre-ChatGPT Vision: Etshtein emphasizes that Perfect AI’s development predates the ChatGPT boom. Their focus was on creating a sophisticated “career trajectory algorithm” capable of understanding a candidate’s past, present, and future potential – a capability that wasn’t readily available with off-the-shelf LLMs at the time. Handling Large Payloads Efficiently: Perfect AI is designed to excel where LLMs falter – in processing large “payloads” of data. In recruitment terms, this translates to analyzing up to 50 data points per candidate, annotated and organized to generate meaningful insights. This deep dive into candidate data is crucial for accurate and effective matching. Proprietary Data Advantage: Perfect AI relies on proprietary, annotated data to ensure the accuracy of its results. Etshtein explains that they source data from major recruitment businesses, meticulously “clean” it, and then repurpose it to train their algorithms. This focus on data quality is a cornerstone of their platform’s effectiveness. Funding Fuels the Future of Agentic AI in Hiring The $23 million funding isn’t just a single injection; it’s structured in two phases. Perfect AI secured an initial equity investment of approximately $12 million a year ago from prominent investors including Target Global, RTP Global, and Pitango. More recently, they received a SAFE note (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) from Hanaco Ventures, Joule Ventures, and Young Sohn, former president of Samsung and Arm board member. This structure highlights the sustained confidence in Perfect AI’s vision and execution. Lior Prosor, a partner at Hanaco Ventures, underscores the industry’s need for genuine innovation, stating, “In an industry desperate for true innovation… Perfect is utilizing proprietary data sets, and integrating into industry-specific workflows to completely transform how recruitment operates.” This investment validates Perfect AI’s approach and its potential to revolutionize how businesses find and hire talent through Agentic AI . Addressing the Core Flaws in Traditional Recruitment with AI Job Search The recruitment sector is ripe for disruption. It’s plagued by inefficiencies that impact both recruiters and job seekers. Consider these common challenges that AI Job Search platforms like Perfect AI are designed to solve: Challenge Description Perfect AI’s Solution Applicant Overload Popular jobs or companies can receive an overwhelming number of applications, making it difficult to identify qualified candidates. Perfect AI helps recruiters sift through applications, identifying the most relevant candidates efficiently. Finding Niche Talent For specialized roles or less popular companies, attracting a sufficient pool of qualified applicants can be a major hurdle. Perfect AI expands the reach of job postings and proactively identifies potential candidates who might not actively be applying. Time-Consuming Manual Processes Traditional recruitment involves numerous manual tasks, from writing job descriptions to screening resumes, consuming valuable recruiter time. Perfect AI automates many of these tasks, freeing up recruiters to focus on strategic initiatives and candidate engagement. Bias in Hiring Unintentional biases can creep into manual screening processes, leading to unfair or non-optimal hiring decisions. AI, when properly trained and monitored, can help mitigate certain biases and promote more objective candidate evaluation. Perfect AI isn’t alone in the quest to transform recruitment. The landscape includes established giants like LinkedIn, which has integrated AI tools into its platform, as well as innovative startups like HiBob, Workable, Maki, Mercor, Tezi, and SeekOut. However, Perfect AI’s focus on proprietary technology and a ground-up approach positions it as a distinct player in this dynamic market. The next phase for Perfect AI involves enhancing its suite of tools for recruiters. Significantly, they are also planning to launch a free tool for job seekers, empowering candidates to refine their AI Job Search strategies. This dual focus on both recruiters and candidates could provide Perfect AI with a valuable competitive edge and a rich source of data for future innovations in Recruitment AI .

Given Musk’s history with the crypto markets after Tesla’s Bitcoin adoption and Dogecoin endorsements, crypto investors are wondering if XRP could be next. Let us explore the likelihood and the impact this adoption could have on XRP price. Here’s Why XRP Price Could Hit $1,000 if Elon Musk Taps Ripple XRP price could potentially record a massive rally if Musk were to integrate the Ripple network within the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). While this adoption remains highly speculative, let us look at three main reasons why it might happen. Musk’s Call for Government Efficiency Earlier this month, Musk responded to a tweet by crypto analyst Mario Nawfal regarding whether the US Treasury should run on blockchain to curb wastage. In his response, Musk agreed with a possible adoption as it aligns with DOGE’s aim to improve government efficiency. X The Ripple network has a global reach and rivals SWIFT and VISA in payments, making it a major contender to bring efficiency to the department. If this happens, it could bode well for the XRP price and stir a potential rally to $100. Pro-Crypto US Government Trump has taken a pro-crypto stance since being elected as President. He has fulfilled some of his campaign promises such as revamping the SEC’s leadership and setting up a crypto task force. Therefore, if Musk were to propose integrating blockchain in key government institutions, he is likely to get a nod from the administration. XRP price could soar to new highs and aim for $1,000 if both Musk and Trump were to agree to use the Ripple network. Ripple’s CEO Meeting with Trump The other reason why Ripple could be tapped by Musk and trigger a surge in XRP price is due to Brad Garlinghouse’s meeting with Trump. As Coingape reported, the Ripple executive met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in January 2025. Trump also recently endorsed Ripple . Speculation was rife over whether the meeting touched on XRP. If the discussion leads to Ripple blockchain being a frontrunner in government adoption, the XRP price could rally to $100 in the coming years. Can XRP Price Realistically Reach $1,000? XRP price cannot realistically rally to $1,000 because of its vast circulating supply of 57.88B tokens. If the price reached $1,000 with this supply, its market capitalization would be a staggering $58 trillion, which is over two times the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, if Ripple received unprecedented levels of adoption, the realistic price target for XRP would be between $10 and $20, with a market cap of between $600 billion and $1.5 trillion. If XRP extends such a rally and flips Bitcoin’s market capitalization, it could stir a significant shift in investor sentiment, leading to a parabolic rally past $100. Ripple Price Analysis XRP price today stands at $2.23 after crashing by 10% in 24 hours causing $64M in liquidations per Coinglass . The altcoin is now approaching a monthly low as the bearish sentiment across the global crypto market pulls the price down. The downtrend has pushed the XRP price below its 100-day EMA of $2.28, a sign that sellers have overpowered buyers. Traders should closely watch for the support level of the 200-day EMA of $1.78. If XRP falls below this level, it could spark an even steeper downtrend. Ripple’s RSI is also at a multi-month low of 33, showing strong bearish momentum and oversold conditions. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart Despite the current sentiment being bearish, the XRP long-term price outlook remains bullish as the community awaits the possible adoption of the Ripple network by Musk and the Trump administration.

Crypto Rover showed his followers an Ethereum chart that showed that ETH has formed a bullish flag and might break out in a bullish direction anytime. Even though the crypto market has been bearish for most of Q1 2025, ETH was stable in mid-February. For context, ETH traded at $2,630 on February 12. A week later, ETH had gained over 3% and sold for $2,723 on the best crypto exchanges. If Crypto Rover’s prediction comes true, Ethereum’s ETH will record a 450% price increase. Interestingly, $FXG is set to outperform ETH in 2025 with a 100x price leap.

Musk responds,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/did-justice-moraes-move-his-money-out-of-us/,"Reports circulating on social media claim that Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes has moved all his assets out of the United States. The allegations follow comments from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) co-founder Elon Musk asking if Moraes, currently facing two lawsuits in the US, owned property within the country’s jurisdiction. On Wednesday, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), which owns Truth Social, filed a lawsuit against Moraes in a US federal court in Tampa, Florida. The suit accuses the Brazilian justice of unlawfully censoring right-wing voices alongside the video-sharing social platform Rumble. The legal action could force the Brazilian Supreme Court minister to appear physically in court. Owing to his ongoing feud with President Trump’s “First Buddy,” Elon Musk, netizens are now speculating that Moraes transferred his assets for fear of being penalized if found guilty. “ Sounds like he’s trying to hide his assets ,” Musk shared on X. Musk complains of censorship, Moraes cries fascism On February 20, the Brazilian justice system ordered Musk’s social media platform X to pay 8.1 million reais ($1.42 million) for failing to comply with judicial orders. The fine stemmed from a legal case in which X was directed to remove one account accused of “spreading misinformation.” Elon Musk shut down X’s Brazilian office in late August after firing all the social platform’s staff in the country, but X is still up and running in the country. At the time, he called the decision “difficult” but ridiculed Moraes’ orders as an abuse of power. Moraes had previously demanded the removal of dozens of accounts accused of spreading hate speech, which Musk viewed as violating free speech principles. Shortly after X’s closure in Brazil, Moraes escalated the standoff by ordering a nationwide block on the platform. This led to a surge in demand for VPNs as users sought to bypass restrictions, while some migrated to alternative social media platforms like Bluesky. X began complying with court orders by September, which forced the hand of the Brazilian Court to lift the country-wide ban it had imposed on X. According to local news publication Folha, Justice Moraes accused tech companies and social media platforms of using algorithms to spread a “fascist ideology,” manipulate political discourse, and amass wealth by focusing more “on engagements than truth.” 🇧🇷 ALEXANDRE DE MORAES: BIG TECH ARE A ‘FASCIST MACHINE’ FOR POWER AND PROFIT Brazil’s Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes claims tech giants are using algorithms to push a “fascist ideology,” influence politics, and rake in massive profits. He says they amplify outrage… https://t.co/NLGukbxnlw pic.twitter.com/Xkyv69LZaT — Mario Nawfal (@MarioNawfal) February 25, 2025 Still, his critics assert that social media platforms are not manufacturing discontent; Brazilians use these platforms to voice genuine frustration with the government and Supreme Court decisions. Lawsuits pile on Moraes According to Folha, Trump Media and Rumble are challenging Moraes’ orders, which demanded the latter shut down the account of right-wing commentator Allan dos Santos and hand over all of his user data. The plaintiffs argue that these orders violate US sovereignty, constitution, and American law. Moraes had allegedly issued the orders in secret and capped Rumble from disclosing their contents. The video platform previously left Brazil in December 2023, citing what it described as unjust censorship demands from Moraes. These included orders to ban multiple content creators, including elected members of Brazil’s Congress. In January 2023, leaked documents revealed that Moraes had issued directives to multiple social platforms, including Rumble, giving them only two hours to comply or face substantial fines. In response, Rumble opted to suspend its operations in Brazil rather than comply. Pressure from the Trump administration and Elon Musk, who both vowed to shield American technology companies from foreign censorship, forced Moraes to reverse an order against one account belonging to podcaster Monark. However, almost immediately, Moraes reportedly made new directives to Rumble’s former lawyers in Brazil, instructing them to represent the company again so they could receive more judicial orders on its behalf. Attorneys representing the company affiliated with President Trump argue that restricting Rumble’s operations in Brazil also impacts its business, as the platform provides services necessary for maintaining the data servers of the Truth Social network.

US Government Might Include XRP in Strategic Reserve While StratoVM Gets Whale Attention,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/stratovm-gets-whale-attention/,"The post 40$ XRP? US Government Might Include XRP in Strategic Reserve While StratoVM Gets Whale Attention appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Big news is circulating about XRP—there’s talk that the U.S. government might add it to its strategic reserves. If true, this could be an update for Ripple that pushes XRP’s price higher – we’ll break it all down below. On the other hand, Bitcoin’s DeFi scene is still small, but StratoVM could change that. Whale might take notice of this new Layer-2 solution that could bring fast, low-cost DeFi to Bitcoin while keeping it secure. Let’s take a closer look at both projects. XRP Price Prediction: Could U.S. Government Adoption Trigger a Massive Rally? Rumors are swirling that the U.S. government might add XRP to its strategic reserves, which could send its price higher. This buzz started after Donald Trump shared an article about Ripple’s increasing influence in the U.S. At the same time, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has hinted at more partnerships and hiring, which means that the government may be warming up to crypto. There are hurdles though—regulatory uncertainty, Ripple’s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC, and the fact that the government usually prefers assets like gold and U.S. Treasuries. Many also believe Bitcoin or stablecoins like USDT and USDC are more likely choices for a government-backed reserve. STEPH IS CRYPTO believes XRP’s breakout could send its price soaring to $59, a massive 24x jump from where it is now. StratoVM Is a Next-Level Layer-2 Solution That Could Bring Scalable DeFi to Bitcoin Without Sacrificing Security StratoVM is a Bitcoin Layer 2 blockchain that supports smart contracts, memecoins, AI, and DeFi applications natively on Bitcoin. Currently, it’s trading at $0.01436 reflecting a 426% increase from its price last week, according to CoinGecko . This surge highlights its resilience amid market swings, driven by its promise to solve Bitcoin’s scalability limitations. SVM 7-day chart, Source: CoinGecko StratoVM is gearing up for its mainnet launch, a significant milestone in its development. Compared to other Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions like CoreDAO, which has a fully diluted valuation of $990M, StratoVM remains relatively low at around $3M. A successful mainnet launch could be a highly bullish event, potentially positioning StratoVM as undervalued at its current level. According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked in BTCFi protocols has skyrocketed from $307 million in January 2024 to $6.6 billion in February 2025. With its innovative approach, StratoVM could capitalize on this rapid growth. Moreover, SVM’s listing on UniSwap adds to its credibility, making it a project worth keeping a close watch on. StratoVM has cultivated a strong ecosystem, supported by 50+ strategic partners driving innovation and growth. Rumors of an upcoming CEX listing are circulating, which could be a bullish catalyst for the project. The community is also taking notice, with nearly 100,000 followers across its official X, Telegram, and Discord channels. As Bitcoin’s utility expands beyond just “digital gold,” StratoVM’s scalability and security could position it as a key player in BTCFi, tapping into a rapidly growing market. With the mainnet launch on the horizon and these developments in place, a CEX listing following its debut wouldn’t be surprising. The Takeaway If the U.S. seriously considers XRP for its strategic reserves, it could be a huge turning point for the token—possibly pushing its price much higher. Meanwhile, StratoVM might catch interest as a Layer-2 solution that could bring faster, more scalable DeFi to Bitcoin without sacrificing security. ———– Please keep in mind that this article is not financial advice.

Bitcoin experienced a sharp decline, falling below $89,000, while Ethereum also fell by more than 10%. At this point, while the Death Cross alarm was given, indicating a further decline for Ethereum, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju made a post that would please investors. CryptoQuant CEO X shared on his account that there are four reasons to maintain the bullish expectation for Ethereum and listed them as follows: “1. Despite the Bybit hack, Ethereum has not faced major selling pressure. While on-chain and market data remain stable, exchange sell-offs take time and over-the-counter (OTC) transactions have little impact on price. 2. ETH still leads the stablecoin market, accounting for 56% of the total market cap. With US President Donald Trump rolling back crypto regulations, more businesses could turn to ETH-based stablecoins and smart contracts in 2025. 3. Spot ETH ETF already approved. Regulatory tailwinds could revive ETH this year and trigger a “Large-Cap ETF altseason.” 4. Whales are accumulating Etheruem. Data shows that wallets holding 10,000-100,000 ETH have increased their balances by 24% in the past year, mostly from wallets under 1K ETH.

Fetch.ai , one of the best known and longest-standing blockchain projects developing artificial intelligence solutions, has unveiled ASI-1 Mini – and it has the potential to do for web3 what ChatGPT’s o3-mini has done for centralized AI. ASI-1 Mini is the world’s first web3-native large language model (LLM) tailored for agentic workflows – yes, AI agents capable of autonomous decision-making and task execution. Unlike traditional LLMs that require hefty computational resources, it’s claimed tat ASI-1 Mini delivers top-tier performance with a lean footprint, running on just two GPUs compared to competitors like DeepSeek, which requires up to 16 H100s. Agents. Agents Everywhere The ASI in ASI-1 Mini stands for Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, the group that Fetch.ai is a founder member of. It's a sort of web3 superheroes club that features other major players operating at the intersection of blockchain and AI in the form of SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol, and CUDOS. Powered by the ASI: initiative, which is focused on large language models and generalized intelligence, ASI-1 Mini allows web3 users to train and own AI models. It’s an attempt to put daylight between the centralized control that dominates the current AI landscape and the alternative framework that web3 promises. Its architecture formed from a blend of Mixture of Models (MoM) and Mixture of Agents (MoA) like a fine whisky, ASI-1 Mini boasts adaptive reasoning, enabling it to tackle everything from multi-step problem-solving to concise insights. According to Humayun Sheikh, CEO of Fetch.ai and ASI Alliance chairman, “ASI-1 Mini is just the start. Over the coming days, we will be rolling out advanced agentic tool-calling, expanded multi-modal capabilities and deeper web3 integrations. With these enhancements, ASI-1 Mini will drive agentic automation while ensuring that AI’s value creation remains in the hands of those who fuel its growth.” In other words, Sheikh is advocating a scenario where AI’s value isn’t hoarded by a few tech giants but shared across a collaborative network. Mini Flexes Its Muscles ASI-1 Mini’s MoM framework dynamically selects from specialized models based on task demands, while the MoA layer coordinates autonomous agents to handle complex workflows. This three-tiered system – comprising a foundational LLM, a specialization layer of task-specific models, and an action layer of agents – mirrors the modularity of web3 itself. It’s a departure from the monolithic structures of traditional LLMs, offering scalability and precision without the computational bloat. For instance, where industry leaders might falter under resource-heavy demands, ASI-1 Mini promises an 8x boost in hardware efficiency, making enterprise-grade AI viable for smaller players. It also scores well on Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmarks, competing with or even surpassing established models in fields like medicine and business analytics. Its four reasoning modes – Multi-Step, Complete, Optimized, and Short – allow it to tailor responses to context, balancing depth with speed. Upping the Ante in the AI Arms Race ASI-1 Mini arrives at a pivotal moment. The AI arms race, dominated by centralized players like OpenAI and Nvidia, has raised concerns about gatekeeping and resource inequity. Fetch.ai’s approach challenges that model, offering a lean, powerful alternative that doesn’t demand billion-dollar budgets or proprietary hardware. Its performance, matching industry leaders while slashing costs, suggests that decentralization can compete on merit, not just ideology. Zooming out, ASI-1 Mini is a proof of concept for the ASI Alliance’s grander ambitions to push toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and beyond. For now, ASI-1 Mini’s freemium tier, tied to $FET holdings, invites early adopters to test its promise. Upcoming upgrades, including a context window expanding to up to 10 million $FET tokens for premium features, will further enhance its capacity to process vast datasets, from legal records to financial ledgers. In the here and now, ASI-1 Mini is a statement of intent from Fetch.ai, which is betting that decentralization is the key to a future where intelligence is distributed as widely as the networks it runs on.

The model, powered by the FET token through ASI wallet integration, marks the beginning of the ASI: initiative set to democratize access to foundational artificial intelligence ( AI ) technologies and allow users to invest in, train, and ultimately own their own models. As part of a tiered freemium model, the AI model is immediately accessible to FET holders. ASI-1 Mini Featuring four dynamic reasoning modes — Multi-Step, Complete, Optimized, and Short Reasoning — ASI-1 Mini promises advanced adaptive reasoning and context-aware decision-making. According to Humayun Sheikh, chief executive officer (CEO) of Fetch.ai and chairman of the ASI Alliance, ASI-1 Mini will lay the foundation for a new decentralized ecosystem: ASI-1 Mini is the first major product from the ASI Alliance’s innovation stack, marking the beginning of the ASI: rollout and a new era of community-owned AI. … ASI-1 Mini is just the start — over the coming days, we will be rolling out advanced agentic tool-calling, expanded multi-modal capabilities, and deeper Web3 integrations. Instead of relying on a more traditional monolithic approach, ASI-1 Mini dynamically selects specialized AI models optimized for specific tasks. With this system, comprising a foundational intelligence layer (i.e., ASI-1 Mini itself), a specialized model marketplace (MoM Marketplace), and a network of action-driven agents, the model enhances execution capabilities across a wide range of unique applications. High GPU-efficiency ASI-1 Mini is designed to deliver enterprise-grade AI performance while operating on just two graphical processing units ( GPUs ). The benchmark results of the approach include greater hardware efficiency (up to x8), lower infrastructure costs, and increased scalability. On the Massive Multitask Language Understanding benchmark, ASI-1 Mini was also able to match or outperform leading AI models in domains such as medical sciences, history, and business analytics. Soon, the model will be expanded with an extended context window, allowing it to process larger amounts of information (up to ten million tokens as opposed to the initially supported one million). Addressing the black-box problem In addition to tackling performance issues, ASI-1 Mini will also help address the black-box problem in AI. Unlike traditional models, which generate responses without explaining how they came up with them, ASI-1 relies on multi-step reasoning, allowing for real-time self-correction and improved decision-making transparency. This is crucial in industries such as healthcare , where precision and clarity are of utmost importance. The ASI: initiative As mentioned, ASI-1 Mini plays a central role in the ASI: initiative set to empower the Web3 community and encourage end-users to participate in AI development directly. Through a decentralized compute network, users can stake, train, and own their own AI models so that the financial rewards of AI advancements can be distributed more fairly. ASI-1 Minialso promises real-time execution, autonomous workflows, scalable deployment with minimal computational overhead, and enhanced knowledge representation. Users will, therefore, soon be able to deploy AI agents capable of executing real-world tasks ranging from accommodation booking to managing more intricate financial transactions.

The market experiences sharp declines, triggering ADA’s downturn. Investors witness consolidation following bearish momentum. Cardano’s decline follows the broader trend, raising concerns about future movement. Experts assess whether ADA will stabilize or extend its losses amid ongoing volatility amid ADA ETF speculations. Long-Term Holders Face Losses as Cardano Price Crashes 10% The Cardano price is facing downward pressure as the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio for 365 days drops to -4.71%. This metric, which measures the average profit or loss of ADA holders, has fallen into the negative zone, indicating that long-term holders are now at a loss. A negative MVRV values signal a potential accumulation zone, as investors may see an opportunity to enter at lower prices. However, if selling pressure continues, ADA could see further declines. A declining MVRV suggests capitulation among holders who purchased ADA at higher prices. This aligns with the recent drop in ADA’s market price. The metric’s movement reflects broader market sentiment, with negative values often signaling a bottoming phase. Source: Santiment If the trend reverses, ADA could stabilize as buying activity increases. However, if losses deepen, sellers may continue to drive prices lower in the short term. SEC Acknowledges Cardano (ADA) ETF Proposal The crypto market faces widespread selling pressure today, which has caused Cardano to experience a sharp price dip. The US SEC approved NYSE Arca’s application to list Grayscale’s Cardano ETF , although this development failed to lift the Cardano price. Cardano is among the top contenders for a crypto ETF in 2025, alongside Litecoin, XRP, and Solana. The US SEC recently acknowledged a proposal from NYSE Arca on behalf of Grayscale for a spot in Cardano ETF. A decision on the approval or rejection of the ETF is expected in the coming months. The acknowledgment follows a surge in crypto ETF applications under the SEC’s new leadership. According to polymarket data, there is an estimation of a 68% chance of approval in 2025. Will This lead to a recovery for the ADA price? Source: Polymarket Will ADA Price Rebound or Extend Losses? The ADA price continues downward, trading at $0.6589, a 10% decline in the past 24 hours. The top altcoin struggles to hold above key support levels as selling pressure increases with also crypto market seeing a strong crash. The daily chart shows resistance at $0.8, while ADA nears crucial support between $0.60 and $0.5. Market data shows that the Relative Strength Index stands at 23 while in an oversold condition. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator maintains a bearish position because its signal line interacts with the MACD line from below. A break below $0.65 could lead to further losses toward $0.60 and $0.5. However, If the Cardano price prediction bounces above $0.65, it may target $0.80 before testing the $1.00 critical resistance level if the ETF is approved.

Pi Network ( PI ), which launched its mainnet last week, surged to $1.60, up over 158% from its lowest point on Friday. According to CoinMarketCap, its self-reported market capitalization jumped to $10.7 billion, making it the 11th-largest cryptocurrency. Pi’s rally stood out as most cryptocurrencies suffered double-digit losses, while 24-hour liquidations soared 477% to $1.57 billion. The total crypto market cap declined by 6%.

Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, is conducting a poll on whether to list Pi, with most users voting in favor. A Binance listing would be significant, given the platform’s 200 million users worldwide. In addition to spot trading, Binance may also introduce Pi to its futures market. Binance would join other major exchanges that have already listed Pi Network, including OKX, HTX, Bitget, and Gate.io. A listing on Binance could pressure other tier-1 exchanges like Coinbase, Upbit, and Kraken to offer it. Pi Network’s price is also climbing ahead of the upcoming Know Your Customer grace period deadline. The final phase of the grace period will end on Feb. 28. After that, pioneers will only be able to migrate Pi coins mined in the past six months to the mainnet.

This diagonal support forms part of an ascending triangle pattern, a popular bullish continuation signal. Pi Network’s price has also moved above the 25-period moving average, indicating that bulls remain in control. A breakout above the $1.67 resistance level would confirm the bullish outlook and potentially push the price toward its all-time high of $2.20, marking a 36% increase from current levels.

PEPE’s price has been moving unpredictably, making traders question whether now is the right time to invest or if waiting is the better option. Recently, the meme coin erased a zero from its price following a broader crypto market rebound. However, PEPE‘s volatility has been declining, and some analysts warn that a 20% drop could be on the horizon. While some anticipate further gains, others highlight concerning signals in market trends. Selling pressure has increased, hinting at a possible retracement in March. If sellers gain control, PEPE’s price could struggle to maintain its recent momentum, pushing it lower in the short term. The overall market sentiment plays a crucial role, as shifts in Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have historically influenced PEPE’s direction. Investors watching PEPE’s price movements closely must weigh the risks. While a short-term correction seems likely, long-term holders banking on another breakout may still see opportunities similar to December 2024. Conclusion The PEPE price prediction is clouded with possibilities of further downturn. Meanwhile, Rollblock’s presale is gaining traction, driven by its decentralized iGaming model and passive income opportunities. In the meantime, there's still an opportunity to join the presale and purchase RBLK tokens for just $0.06. What makes this even more exciting?

With the huge drop in the S&P 500, the crypto markets also slashed , wiping out over $200 billion. The major tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana faced huge pullbacks, forming fresh bottoms. In the times when these prices continue to flash bearish signals, memecoins have begun to rebound as prices of Shiba Inu (SHIB) & BOOK OF MEME (BOME) are experiencing a notable upswing. Here’s what to expect ahead of the monthly close. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis Shiba Inu price is trying to validate a rebound before reaching the February low close, which has instigated the bullish momentum. The bulls are offering great support as the pressure piles up from the bottom. With this, the SHIB price is now believed to reclaim the pivotal support-turned-resistance at $0.000015, which could revive a strong recovery to the upper targets. The SHIB price has rebounded but continues to trade within a falling wedge, forming constant lower highs and lows. However, the price appears to have reached the edge of the consolidation and one fine upswing to the resistance, which collides with a crucial barrier around $0.000016, may revamp a strong ascending trend towards the immediate target at $0.00002. The CMF has displayed a bullish divergence, while the RSI is stuck below the descending trend line. As volume is low, the price is believed to maintain a sluggish upswing and consume more time to reach the resistance. BOOK OF MEME (BOME) Price Analysis The BOME price in the short term maintained a horizontal consolidation within a predetermined range. The sluggish behaviour drained out the bullish strength, resulting in a price drain below the support. Meanwhile, the token triggered a strong rebound after fighting the bearish heat, resulting in a notable rise from the local bottoms. The price is yet to enter the bullish range, which is believed to attract some buying pressure, much required for an ascending continuation. The short-term price action of BOME suggests the price has marked the local bottom and is preparing for a strong recovery. The stochastic RSI has triggered a bullish divergence while the MACD shows a drop in the selling volume. Moreover, the levels are about to undergo a bullish crossover, which could validate a rise above the bearish influence. Therefore, the BOME price is believed to enter the horizontal consolidation and reclaim the lost levels around $0.0021.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SHIB|MARKET|BOME|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 15:44:25

The BNB token is eyeing the $800 mark but faces market resistance. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange, a new ERC-20 token, has raised over $15 million in its bonus presale, with its price currently at $0.18. With strong investor interest and a growing ecosystem, DTX could show immense potential. The big question is: Can DTX hit $10 before BNB reaches $800? Let’s find out. DTX Exchange: The New ERC-20 Token in the Crypto Town DTX Exchange is a new trading platform that aims to combine the best of centralized and decentralized trading. The platform’s ERC-20 token, DTX, has gained significant attention and raised over $15 million in its bonus presale. The current price is $0.18. The platform could offer access to over 120,000 assets, including stocks, forex, commodities, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies which could make it an attractive choice for traders seeking to diversify their portfolio. Moreover, DTX is built on the VulcanX blockchain which can handle over 200,000 transactions per second to enable fast and smooth trading. One of its standout features is the Phoenix Wallet, a secure, non-custodial solution that could enable users to store and trade their assets without relying on third parties. This means users could have full ownership of their funds which would reduce the risk of exchange hacks or frozen accounts. Another key offering is crypto loans which would allow users to borrow against their assets without selling them. With different loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, such as 50% for Bitcoin and Ethereum and 60% for stablecoins, users could borrow safely while the system reduces liquidation risks. The upcoming NFT marketplace by DTX Exchange will make buying, selling, and minting NFTs easier. Built using ERC-721 and ERC-1155 smart contracts, it will support single and batch NFTs while ensuring fair royalty distribution to creators. Could DTX Hit $10 Before Binance Coin Reaches $800? DTX Exchange has gained traction with its strong presale performance and innovative features. If adoption continues at this pace, hitting $10 might not be unrealistic. DTX's total token supply is 475M. If DTX reaches just 5% of the BNB token’s market cap, its price could hit around $9.79, very close to the $10 mark. With such a low token supply, DTX could require less capital inflow to see significant percentage gains compared to the BNB token. Meanwhile, Binance Coin, despite its strong fundamentals, faces resistance at key price levels and requires much larger buying pressure to reach $800. If DTX maintains strong demand, continues building its ecosystem, and attracts more investors, it could potentially hit $10 before the BNB token reaches $800. Can Binance Coin Hit $800? Strong Growth Signals but Hurdles Remain Binance Coin is currently priced at around $655, showing both stability and some ups and downs. The BNB token has dropped around 4% since last month. The upcoming Pascal hard fork, scheduled for mid-March 2025, could boost the Binance Coin’s value by improving Ethereum ecosystem compatibility. This could help developers build on the BNB Chain and attract more users. Source: CoinMarketCap The BNB token has also seen a huge rise in trading activity, surpassing Ethereum in decentralized exchange volume which shows growing trust and adoption. While the network upgrades and adoption are positive signs, Binance Coin still faces strong resistance levels in price charts which means it needs more buying pressure to break past key levels. Reaching $800 is possible, but it will require sustained demand and a broader bullish trend to support its growth. Meanwhile, investors wary of the market uncertainties, look for stable projects such as DTX Exchange, an upcoming ERC-20 token with immense potential. Conclusion Binance Coin and DTX could exhibit strong growth potential. However, the DTX token's limited supply and rapid adoption could give it an edge to reach $10 before the BNB token could hit $800. With its innovative features and expanding ecosystem, DTX could be on the verge of a price surge. But time is running out. This is the bonus phase of the presale, and now is the last chance for early investors to capitalize before prices rise.

WIN historical price sentiment WINkLink price history The WINkLink blockchain ecosystem was launched in August 2019, at a price of 0.00046. In 2020, the token saw a swift descent as it observed its all-time low of $0.000041 on March 13. 2021 was a good year for WIN as it clocked its all-time high of $0.002894 on April 05, 2021, following its acquisition of Justlink.io, after which it became the first comprehensive Oracle in the Tron ecosystem. The token traded near $0.00131 till May 2021, while it traded at a higher than average price of $0.000689 till November. Strong corrections followed throughout 2022, as the token remained on a downward spiral till June and consolidated near $0.000091 till December. In 2023, WINkLink (WIN) was trading in a range of $0.000067 to $0.000106 and could not make a breakthrough as the cryptocurrency market remained bearish. Bullish markets of 2024 proved favorable for the token on a limited basis as it touched a high of only $0.0002 in March and corrected down to the previous range of $0.000077 before flashing at $0.00017 in December. The WIN token started 2025 with a correction, reaching $0.000093 by the end of January and $0.000071 in February.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|ICO|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|WALLET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-25 15:49:13

Crypto market sentiment has fallen into “extreme fear” as Bitcoin slumped to as low as $86,887, its lowest since mid-November. Broadly, the crypto market has dropped by over 10% over the last day, with some leading coins like Solana, Ripple’s XRP, and Dogecoin nursing much larger losses during the same span. Crypto Trader Sentiment Drops To ‘Extreme Fear’ The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a multifactorial measure of crypto market sentiment, hit a score of 25 on Feb. 25, showing “extreme fear. Tuesday’s 24-point drop from the day prior that pinned sentiment at “neutral” signals one of the sharpest drops since September. The quick drop signifies a rapid dip toward overly bearish sentiment. Reasons for the panic include the Monday crypto market sell-off extending into Tuesday and the heavy outflows from US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Bitcoin is down 7.8% to trade hands at $87,939, while Ethereum plummeted 11.3% to $2,377, CoinGecko data shows. Ripple’s XRP remains the biggest loser in the top 10 coins, with its decline deepening since earlier Monday. It’s down 15.6% over the last day and 19.7% on the week to a current price of around $2.08. Other top coins are faring almost as badly as XRP, with Solana’s SOL down roughly 13.7% at $135.52, top meme coin Dogecoin falling circa 13% to $0.1997, and Cardano also down 13% at a current price of $0.6345. $1.5 Billion Crypto Liquidation Storm Amid Tuesday’s across-the-board price carnage, liquidations have surged to $1.48 billion over the last 24 hours, per data from CoinGlass , with Ethereum and Bitcoin leading the charge at about $641 million and $302 million, respectively. Most of the liquidations are for those betting on a price rise. The current pullback mirrors the 2017 market formation when Bitcoin saw a 28% correction five times, each lasting two to three months, Global Macro Investor founder and CEO Raoul Pal, observed in a Feb. 25 post on the X platform. The crypto market drawdown followed another wave of selling in US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, with around $516 million in investor cash exiting the funds on Feb. 24 alone. The BTC ETFs have now witnessed six straight days of outflows, data from Farside Investors shows. Moreover, the crypto industry was recently rocked by the largest hack in crypto history on Feb. 21, when Bybit lost nearly $1.5 billion .",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Doge|Dogecoin|Ethereum News|Ripple|SOL|Solana|XRP News,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|SOL|DOGE|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-25 15:51:16

""It Closed All Doors!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/european-central-bank-advisor-talks-about-bitcoin-btc-it-closed-all-doors/,"While the US has a positive approach towards Bitcoin and is discussing the issue of a national Bitcoin reserve, the European Union has a more negative stance towards BTC. At this point, an advisor to the European Central Bank (ECB) reiterated the bank's negative stance towards Bitcoin. Describing Bitcoin as a risky and speculative asset, Jürgen Schaaf rejected the idea of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, citing its volatility, lack of economic necessity, and its vulnerability to manipulation. Schaaf argued that it makes sense to hold reserves of energy resources like oil or gas, but not Bitcoin. He said that “countries have no real economic need for Bitcoin,” adding that Bitcoin has no core economic use and will fuel speculation rather than stabilize economies. Jürgen Schaaf also opposed the idea that the ECB should add BTC to its reserves, stating that multiple digital assets would only increase risk and volatility. “Adding Bitcoin to ECB reserves will not stabilize the currency. Adding multiple cryptocurrencies to reserves will only increase speculation, exacerbate problems, increase volatility and increase exposure to speculative assets that often have no fundamental economic benefit.” *This is not investment advice.

Major Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has reinforced its position as one of the largest Bitcoin holders globally with its latest acquisition. The company successfully completed a $2 billion stock offering, using the proceeds to purchase 20,356 BTC at an average price of $97,514 per Bitcoin. The announcement was made by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor , who confirmed that the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 499,096 BTC, acquired for approximately $33.1 billion at an average price of $66,357 per Bitcoin. Strategic Expansion Under the ‘21/21’ Plan The move aligns with Strategy’s previously stated ‘21/21’ initiative, which aims to raise $42 billion over the next three years to increase Bitcoin reserves. The company’s aggressive accumulation strategy has pushed its holdings to nearly 2.4% of the total Bitcoin supply, far exceeding any of its publicly traded competitors. Saylor, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, has previously forecasted that Bitcoin could reach as high as $13 million per unit. He once stated, ""Every Bitcoin you don’t buy is gonna cost you $13 million."" His commitment to acquiring more Bitcoin remains firm, with Strategy continuously leveraging stock sales to fund its purchases. Market Impact and Stock Performance Despite the substantial investment, Strategy’s stock (MSTR) has struggled, experiencing a 2.37% decline on Monday and extending its monthly losses to 17%, with shares trading at $292.06. The company’s financing method—relying on multibillion-dollar stock sales—has raised concerns among investors, contributing to stock underperformance. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself has also seen a dip, declining 0.8% in the last 24 hours to $94,702. This places the asset’s current market price at approximately $3,000 lower than the company’s latest purchase price. Prolonged weakness in Bitcoin’s value could potentially impact Strategy’s overall financial standing. Saylor’s Vision for Bitcoin and National Policy Saylor has suggested that the U.S. should consider acquiring up to 20% of Bitcoin’s total supply, arguing that owning between 4 to 6 million BTC could help the country pay off its national debt. While such a move remains speculative, Strategy remains committed to its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, with Saylor reiterating his long-term confidence in the asset. He previously stated that he would be ""buying the top forever,"" drawing comparisons between Bitcoin and Manhattan real estate in terms of value appreciation. As Strategy continues its Bitcoin acquisition spree, the firm’s approach raises questions about the long-term sustainability of its financing model and its impact on shareholder confidence.

Metaplanet Purchases Another 135 BTC Metaplanet, which trades on the Tokyo stock exchange, said it had acquired Bitcoin at an average price of ¥14,360,449 ($96,185) per coin. The company’s latest purchase brings its total Bitcoin stockpile to 2,225 Bitcoin — valued at approximately $196 million at current prices. This BTC buy happened right before Bitcoin’s price plunged to as low as $87,115 on Tuesday — its lowest level since mid-November. The crypto king is trading for about $88,929 as of publication time, according to CoinGecko. Metaplanet’s treasury stash places it 14th among publicly traded companies, according to Bitcoin Treasuries. So far this year, Metaplanet has achieved a “BTC yield” of 23.2%. According to its latest disclosure, the Tokyo-based company acquired all its Bitcoin for 12,441,856 yen at an average price of $81,195 per BTC. Metaplanet has been on a Bitcoin buying spree in recent months after announcing in May 2024 that it had adopted the apex crypto as its strategic treasury reserve asset. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor-led Strategy, remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, boasting nearly 500,000 BTC in total holdings . Notably, Strategy pioneered the BTC Yield indicator — a fundamental performance metric that calculates the percentage change over time in the ratio of the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to its assumed diluted outstanding shares. Metaplanet Already Owns 0.01% Of Total Bitcoin Supply Metaplanet’s aggressive accumulation follows its announcement in January that it was looking to boost its Bitcoin holdings by 470% within the year, to hold 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026. According to the company’s Director of Bitcoin Strategy Dylan Le Clair, the company has since completed 5.54% of its previously announced “21 Million Plan,” raising approximately $47 million through the exercise of stock acquisition rights to stack even more BTC.

Cardano is in for a big year, and with its imminent upgrade, the ADA price should rocket. We’ll give our Cardano price prediction for the cycle peak, and we’ll also take a look at a hot new crypto, Rollblock, as investors continue to push up the price of this brand new GambleFi platform. Hot New Crypto Rollblock Continues to Soar This year, Rollblock (RBLK) stands out as one of the success stories despite the waning market momentum. Since its initial presale offering at $0.015, RBLK has seen its price surge to $0.06, marking a huge 400% increase. This growth trajectory is driven by retail investors and big-money institutional players drawn to Rollblock's disruptive technology within the gambling and DeFi sectors. The Rollblock platform offers over 7,000 gaming options and a sports betting book that can rival any legacy platform. It’s all designed with transparency and fairness, integrating blockchain technology to create a potent disruptor to the $540 billion online gambling industry. There’s also a robust revenue-sharing model, which distributes a percentage of the platform’s earnings to RBLK token holders. Investors wanting to build a passive income stream can also partake in Rollblock’s staking mechanism and earn a generous 30% APY. Rollblock boasts a proactive token supply management approach with its buyback and burn strategy. This is used to pay staking rewards, and whatever is left over will be burned from existence, effectively reducing the circulating supply and enhancing the token's scarcity and value appreciation over time. Rollblock is still in its presale, but the price has rocketed, and as more investors recognize the potential of Rollblock to disrupt online gambling, the investment is expected to ramp up. This financial backing will likely accelerate the development within the platform, possibly leading to further growth for RBLK. And best of all, this hot new crypto will never be this cheap again. With major exchange listings on the horizon, stage 10 tokens are selling out fast at $0.06. Investors can also capitalize on a 50% limited-time bonus for all RBLK purchases this week. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Upgrade to Trigger Bull Run The upcoming Chang Hard Fork in March is set to be a game-changer, and so our Cardano price prediction is going to reflect that. It’s a major upgrade that aims to enhance the speed and efficiency of the Cardano network. A key focus of the Chang Hard Fork is the substantial improvements to smart contracts. This will allow developers to create more sophisticated and functional dApps, especially in the DeFi sector, allowing Cardano to finally compete with Ethereum and Solana. With these enhancements, we see the ADA price potentially skyrocketing to $3.85, a fivefold increase by the peak of this bull run. This optimistic Cardano price prediction is driven by expectations that the upgrade will attract more developers, which will likely drive investment into the ecosystem. Conclusion The market is slowly turning bullish again and the biggest gains lay ahead as the cycle peak is expected in Q4. Our 5X Cardano price prediction is about to take off, but the most significant ROI is likely to be found in a hot new crypto, and the Rollblock presale is showing all signs that it could be one of the best this cycle.

Hemi , a modular blockchain network powered by Bitcoin and Ethereum, today announced that it will launch its mainnet on March 12, 2025. Key Facts Launching its mainnet on March 12, Hemi is a modular blockchain network designed for superior scaling, security, and interoperability, unifying Bitcoin and Ethereum as a single supernetwork. Over fifty protocols will be deployed on Hemi, including decentralized exchanges (e.g., Sushi, DODO, Izumi), lending protocols (e.g., LayerBank, ZeroLend), vaults (e.g., Nucleus, Concrete, VaultCraft), top LSTs and LRTs (e.g., Kelp, pumpBTC, StakeStone), oracles (e.g., RedStone, Pyth, Stork), and key dApps (e.g., LayerZero, Pell, BitFi). Hemi has already attracted more than $300 million of Total Value Locked (TVL) and announced a $15 million seed round in September 2024, led by Binance Labs, Breyer Capital, and Big Brain Holdings. Hemi was founded by renowned early Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik and blockchain security pioneer Max Sanchez. The transition from testnet to mainnet is a major milestone for Hemi, which has already attracted more than $300 million in total value locked (TVL) and rapidly built an ecosystem of dozens of protocols. This positions Hemi as a vital infrastructure layer for decentralized finance across Bitcoin and Ethereum, enabling innovation and scalability across the blockchain space. Through the protocols offered by Hemi’s early Day One ecosystem collaborators, users will be able to: build applications that are both Bitcoin- and Ethereum-aware; participate in lending and DEX liquidity provision, or allocate funds into specialized vault products; trade perpetuals; stake and restake popular BTC and ETH tokens; borrow, and swap tokens; and create synthetic assets. In particular, Hemi’s DeFi ecosystem has a strong focus on providing liquidity and yield opportunities for many of the most popular liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) from the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems. “Just over six months after introducing our incentivized testnet, Hemi has demonstrated its resilience and capability as a powerful network for advancing blockchain applications across Bitcoin and Ethereum,” said Jeff Garzik, co-founder of Hemi. “The Hemi team has a clear and compelling vision for unlocking the programmability, portability, and potential of Web3,” said Ted Breyer, partner at Breyer Capital. “With a distinguished track record, they are uniquely positioned to deliver.” A Layer-2 from a Different Point of View Attempts to integrate and scale Bitcoin and Ethereum have tended to address the problem within their respective communities, resulting in a fractured ecosystem. Hemi instead approaches Bitcoin and Ethereum as components of a larger supernetwork. This surfaces the key capabilities of both networks and, in turn, enables a new class of previously unattainable blockchain applications. Hemi’s benefits include: Unifying Bitcoin and Ethereum — The Hemi Virtual Machine (hVM) integrates a full Bitcoin node within an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), enabling developers to harness the power of both Bitcoin and Ethereum using familiar and proven development tools. Bitcoin Programmability — Building with the Hemi Bitcoin Kit (hBK) provides developers direct access to highly granular views of Bitcoin’s state, unlocking new applications that were previously impractical or impossible to execute in a truly trustless, secure, and efficient way. Superfinality — Through its PoP consensus protocol, Hemi inherits Bitcoin’s full security in a truly decentralized and permissionless manner, exceeding Bitcoin-level finality (“superfinality”) in just a few hours. Trustless Cross-Chain Portability — With Tunnels, Hemi offers a Bitcoin-secured method for moving assets between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Asset Programmability — Hemi’s additional asset-programmability features include on-chain routing, time-lock, and password-protect. Gasless transfer enables asset movement without requiring a web3 wallet. “The Hemi team can be described in one word: ambitious. Everything we learned during our testnet has been embedded into the mainnet release and we are excited for our users and developers to build and use applications across Bitcoin and Ethereum,” said co-founder and CTO Max Sanchez. About Hemi Labs Hemi Labs is the creator of the Hemi Network (“Hemi”), a modular Layer-2 network for superior scaling, security, and interoperability, powered by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Instead of approaching Bitcoin and Ethereum as siloed ecosystems, Hemi views them as components of a single supernetwork, unlocking new levels of programmability, portability, and potential. Hemi Labs envisions a new, converged Internet ecosystem that is secure, interoperable, and ready for the many challenges of a Web3 that is imminently colliding with the Internet at large.

The layer-3 app-chain, called Nums, is built off of the “SN Stack,” a customizable toolkit that lets developers create layer-3 blockchains based off of Starknet’s technology. Nums itself is an on-chain game that lets players try to sequence a series of 20 generated numbers. Users will be able to earn $NUMS tokens by playing the game, with the tokens issued via Starknet. StarkWare, the main developer firm behind Starknet, originally shared in July 2023 that it was building the SN Stack. The announcement followed similar releases from several of StarkWare's competitors, like Arbtirum’s Orbit Stack and Optimism’s OP Stack , which came out in 2023. This past January, StarkWare’s SN Stack went live . Despite various layer-2 stacks already live and layer-3 games existing on those chains , the team behind Nums claim that their decision to build with Starknet’s technology is because it allows for more “computationally complex and more ambitious” applications, said Tarrence van As, the CEO of Cartridge, the main developer firm behind Nums, in an interview with CoinDesk. Starknet, which uses Cairo as its programming language, is “much easier to express these types of applications,” van As added. (Ethereum uses Solidity, a different type of programming language, to build its applications. Most layer-2s use Solidity as well.) Cartridge is one of the core developer teams building on Starknet, known for releasing its Dojo framework , a tool engine that lets developers build games and applications on the network.

The project has attracted over $1.3M in investments and 2,560+ holders in its recently launched presale. Phase 2 of the presale is live at $0.015, giving investors a prime chance to buy in before the price jumps 33.33% to $0.02 in the next phase. Those who get in now are set for a 4x return when Mutuum Finance launches at $0.06 and a 67x gain if MUTM hits $1 in the next bull run. Unlike other DeFi projects, Mutuum Finance’s innovative lending model ensures sustainable yield, making it the best altcoin for 2025. Does XRP Still Have Big Gains Ahead? XRP has long been a key player in crypto, backed by Ripple Labs and known for its cross-border payment solutions. While its recent climb to $2.58 signals renewed market optimism, growth has been slower than anticipated due to regulatory battles and rising competition in the blockchain payment market. Despite securing major partnerships and scoring partial legal wins, uncertainty still looms over XRP’s long-term trajectory. Many investors are now questioning whether XRP can still deliver explosive gains. Hence, eyeing Mutuum Finance offers a better upside as the broader crypto market expands. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Skyrockets Mutuum Finance is rapidly gaining momentum, offering early investors a rare chance to get in before mainstream adoption. Investors are flooding in to secure their shares before the price jumps, with phase 2 of the presale live at just $0.015. So far, over $1,314,515 has been raised, with more than 2,560 investors already on board. As demand intensifies, the window to buy before the 33.33% increase to $0.02 is closing fast. Early backers are poised for 300% ROI with the price set to climb to $0.06 at launch, and if MUTM hits $1 in the coming months, that’s an almost 67x return. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Innovative Model Mutuum Finance is transforming decentralized finance (DeFi) lending with its cutting-edge non-custodial liquidity protocol, allowing users full control over their assets. Lenders earn passive income while borrowers access instant liquidity through overcollateralized loans. A dynamic interest rate model ensures capital efficiency, creating a sustainable and fair financial ecosystem. Mutuum’s dual-lending system introduces two powerful lending mechanisms: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Automated smart contracts manage lending pools, optimizing interest rates based on market conditions for stable returns and secure borrowing. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Eliminating intermediaries, this model allows direct negotiations between borrowers and lenders, ideal for high-volatility assets and enhanced flexibility. Security and transparency remain top priorities, with upcoming third-party audits and open-source smart contracts reinforcing trust in the ecosystem. MUTM holders can also stake tokens for passive income, with a strategic buyback mechanism designed for long-term value growth. As the platform scales, multi-chain support will integrate both EVM and non-EVM blockchains, boosting liquidity, scalability, and accessibility, solidifying Mutuum Finance as a dominant performer in DeFi. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Rewards To drive adoption, Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway, with 10 winners each set to receive $10,000 in MUTM tokens. In addition, a referral program rewards users who bring in new investors, fostering organic community growth. These initiatives will accelerate adoption and strengthen Mutuum Finance’s position as a leader in the DeFi market. Mutuum Finance is quickly gaining traction as a top DeFi investment, attracting XRP investors seeking higher returns. It stands out as a leading altcoin for 2025 with its innovative lending model, strong presale momentum, and strategic incentives. As Phase 2 approaches its close and the price prepares to rise, now is the ideal moment to get in early. Secure your MUTM tokens today and take advantage of this high-growth opportunity before the next big surge.

Hemi , a modular blockchain network powered by Bitcoin and Ethereum, today announced that it will launch its mainnet on March 12, 2025. Key Facts Launching its mainnet on March 12, Hemi is a modular blockchain network designed for superior scaling, security, and interoperability, unifying Bitcoin and Ethereum as a single supernetwork. Over fifty protocols will be deployed on Hemi, including decentralized exchanges (e.g., Sushi, DODO, Izumi), lending protocols (e.g., LayerBank, ZeroLend), vaults (e.g., Nucleus, Concrete, VaultCraft), top LSTs and LRTs (e.g., Kelp, pumpBTC, StakeStone), oracles (e.g., RedStone, Pyth, Stork), and key dApps (e.g., LayerZero, Pell, BitFi). Hemi has already attracted more than $300 million of Total Value Locked (TVL) and announced a $15 million seed round in September 2024, led by Binance Labs, Breyer Capital, and Big Brain Holdings. Hemi was founded by renowned early Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik and blockchain security pioneer Max Sanchez. The transition from testnet to mainnet is a major milestone for Hemi, which has already attracted more than $300 million in total value locked (TVL) and rapidly built an ecosystem of dozens of protocols. This positions Hemi as a vital infrastructure layer for decentralized finance across Bitcoin and Ethereum, enabling innovation and scalability across the blockchain space. Through the protocols offered by Hemi’s early Day One ecosystem collaborators, users will be able to: build applications that are both Bitcoin- and Ethereum-aware; participate in lending and DEX liquidity provision, or allocate funds into specialized vault products; trade perpetuals; stake and restake popular BTC and ETH tokens; borrow, and swap tokens; and create synthetic assets. In particular, Hemi’s DeFi ecosystem has a strong focus on providing liquidity and yield opportunities for many of the most popular liquid staking tokens (LSTs) and liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) from the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems. “Just over six months after introducing our incentivized testnet, Hemi has demonstrated its resilience and capability as a powerful network for advancing blockchain applications across Bitcoin and Ethereum,” said Jeff Garzik, co-founder of Hemi. “The Hemi team has a clear and compelling vision for unlocking the programmability, portability, and potential of Web3,” said Ted Breyer, partner at Breyer Capital. “With a distinguished track record, they are uniquely positioned to deliver.” A Layer-2 from a Different Point of View Attempts to integrate and scale Bitcoin and Ethereum have tended to address the problem within their respective communities, resulting in a fractured ecosystem.

Bitcoin Hash Rate Decline Sparks Mining Concerns,https://cryptopotato.com/april-2024-flashback-bitcoin-hash-rate-decline-sparks-mining-concerns/,"A sudden dip in Bitcoin’s hash rate has sparked discussions within the crypto community. Though fluctuations are not uncommon, the scale of this decline draws comparisons to past major disruptions. What does this mean for miners and network stability in the near term? Mining Slowdown? The Bitcoin network’s hash rate has experienced a significant short-term drop, currently at 807.26M TH/s (30DMA), down from its 30-day high of 997.4M TH/s. This decline suggests that miners are shutting down machines, a trend similar to past major disruptions like the China Mining Ban back in May 2021 as well as the April 2024 drop. Despite this, network difficulty remains at all-time highs and will take time to adjust, as per popular crypto analyst Maartunn’s latest findings . A lower hash rate slows block production, triggering a difficulty adjustment after 2,016 blocks (approximately two weeks). While short-term fluctuations impact mining conditions, the broader trend remains stable, with Bitcoin’s self-correcting mechanism ensuring long-term network security and efficiency. The latest drop in hash rate comes as Bitcoin fell below the $87,000 threshold for the first time since November 2024, which has sparked concerns about a potential further downturn. In the past 24 hours, the leading cryptocurrency plunged over 10%, hitting a low of $86,300 before a slight recovery. This dip, in turn, has resulted in approximately 12% of all Bitcoin addresses holding at a loss, according to the data shared by IntoTheBlock, and marks the highest percentage of unrealized losses since October 2024. It essentially means that many investors who bought near recent highs are now in negative territory. Institutional Bitcoin Demand at Risk Additionally, the ongoing sell-offs in US spot Bitcoin ETFs have intensified, with February 24th alone recording over $516 million in net outflows and marking the sixth consecutive day of selling pressure. Experts suggest that the primary driver behind these liquidations is the escalating trade tensions between the US and China. A similar sentiment was echoed by QCP Capital which highlighted that market sentiment remains under strain due to Trump’s recent tariff policies on Canada and Mexico, along with measures to restrict Chinese investment. These macroeconomic factors have contributed to increased uncertainty, prompting investors to offload Bitcoin ETF holdings, which has further pressured the market. Despite previous concerns over broader market weakness, equities, fixed income, and gold have largely stabilized, while Bitcoin remains flat. BTC’s dominance continues to rise, with altcoins sliding, indicating that bullish traders may already be fully invested, leaving little room for new capital inflows outside of Bitcoin. QCP Capital said that it remains cautious in its latest update , noting that recent Bitcoin demand has been institution-driven, particularly through firms like Strategy (previously known as MicroStrategy), which has relied on equity-linked note issuances for funding. Over the past 14 months, crypto-related issuances accounted for 19% of total issuance, hinting that the market for such financing may be reaching a saturation point. If Bitcoin’s price remains stagnant, this could dampen further institutional demand and potentially limit upside momentum. The post April 2024 Flashback?

It's often called the ""silver to Bitcoin's gold."" Litecoin has been through countless market ups and downs, giving traders a reliable, though sometimes slow, investment. But recently? Litecoin just isn’t cutting it. LTC started strong this year but has hit roadblocks, failing to break key resistance levels. Traders who once backed Litecoin are losing patience. And in this game, when a coin stalls, people start looking for the next hot opportunity. Right now, SUI and DTX Exchange are grabbing that attention. Why? Because traders believe these two could deliver the big 10x returns LTC hasn’t been able to. So, what's really going on with Litecoin, and why is everyone shifting focus to SUI and DTX Exchange? Let’s dive in. Litecoin (LTC) Stuck in Neutral While Market Moves On Let’s talk numbers. Litecoin (LTC) saw a decent price rally earlier this year, climbing over 50% in February. A lot of this was driven by excitement over the potential approval of a Litecoin ETF. Traders were buzzing, especially when Canary Capital’s proposed LTC ETF appeared on the DTCC website—a big deal in the finance world. But here’s the problem: Litecoin couldn’t maintain that momentum. After peaking around $135, LTC hit a wall at the $141 resistance level. Since then, it’s been sliding backward, leaving traders wondering whether Litecoin still has what it takes. Some analysts are even predicting a possible 25% drop if LTC can’t find new support soon. The thing is, Litecoin still has strong fundamentals. It’s fast, cheap to use, and has a dedicated community. But in a market where traders are hungry for explosive gains, LTC’s slow and steady approach just isn’t cutting it right now. That’s why many are cashing out and moving their funds into more aggressive plays like SUI and DTX Exchange. SUI - The Rising Star In The Altcoin Market Let’s dive into SUI, an altcoin that’s been gaining serious attention. It’s built on its own Layer-1 blockchain and uses the Move programming language, which makes it super fast and scalable for dApps. Traders love the fresh and innovative edge it brings. But it hasn’t been all smooth sailing. SUI recently dipped to $3.36 after some big investors—whales—cashed out, leading to price swings that made some people uneasy. Still, for seasoned traders, this kind of volatility often screams opportunity. Source: CoinMarketCap SUI is still growing, and more developers are building on its network every day. Many believe it’s set for a strong rebound and could even outperform Litecoin in returns. We’ve all seen how quickly an underdog can become a market leader in crypto. For traders who found LTC too slow, SUI offers that high-risk, high-reward setup they’re after. And with an expanding ecosystem, it’s becoming harder to ignore. DTX Exchange Becomes the Top Pick for 10x Gains While SUI is turning heads, DTX Exchange is the project quietly building massive momentum under the radar. DTX Exchange is shaking things up with its hybrid trading platform. It blends the best of centralized and decentralized finance, letting traders access over 120,000 assets—crypto, stocks, ETFs, and forex—all from one place. Think of it as your go-to trading hub, combining the ease of a regular brokerage with the power of DeFi. What’s more impressive? DTX Exchange recently saw its token price soar to $0.36, marking an insane 1700% gain from its presale price of $0.02. And analysts are bullish, projecting that DTX could hit $2.40 once it lands on tier-1 exchanges. That’s the 10x potential Litecoin (LTC) traders have been chasing. With over 700,000 users and $15 million raised in its presale, DTX Exchange is proving it's more than just hype. It’s offering real value in a market that wants both utility and big gains. That’s a strong combo for any serious trader. Time to Move On from Litecoin? Litecoin (LTC) has been a solid player for years, but let’s face it—traders are in this game for the gains. And right now, LTC just isn’t delivering the explosive returns investors want. That’s why eyes are shifting toward SUI and DTX Exchange . Both projects offer something Litecoin doesn’t right now—momentum and the potential for those 10x gains that make headlines. If you’re still holding LTC, it might be time to ask yourself: is it worth waiting around, or should you pivot to something with more upside? Because in crypto, the next big move is always just around the corner.

The application, filed through Nasdaq, seeks approval to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Polkadot Trust. The proposed ETF will function as a Commodity-Based Trust, with shares representing a proportional interest in the trust’s assets.Grayscale’s Proposal and Key PlayersAccording to the filing , Grayscale Operating and Grayscale Investments Sponsors, both subsidiaries of Digital Currency Group, will oversee the trust’s operations. The custodian for the trust is Coinbase Custody Trust Company, while CSC Delaware Trust Company will act as trustee. Notably, the trust, formed in January 2021, will not actively manage assets but will hold DOT and track its value through the index price. The market price of its shares is expected to fluctuate with DOT’s market movements. Over time, the amount of DOT represented by each share will decrease as assets cover the trust’s expenses.Function and Market ImpactThe trust’s activities will include issuing shares in exchange for DOT deposits and selling DOT to cover operational costs. It may also redeem shares for DOT, pending regulatory approval. The trust will not attempt to maximize profits or minimize losses but will provide investors with direct exposure to Polkadot. Unlike direct crypto purchases, the ETF aims to simplify acquiring and holding DOT while minimizing associated security risks.Notably, Polkadot’s price stands at $4.43 during this press, reflecting a 6.17% decline over 24 hours and a 7.81% decrease over the past week. The trust’s performance will closely follow DOT’s market price, making it essential for investors to monitor Polkadot’s fluctuations.Grayscale Expansion to Other Crypto ETFsGrayscale is also pursuing ETFs for multiple digital assets. In a recent development, the SEC acknowledged a rule change application for a Grayscale Cardano ETF, increasing its chances of approval. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca filed for a Grayscale Cardano Trust conversion on February 10, with the SEC recognizing the application on February 13.Additionally, Grayscale is advancing its XRP ETF application. Last week, the SEC officially started reviewing the 19b-4 filing for the proposed ETF, placing the decision deadline at October 18, 2025. If approved, the fund will convert the Grayscale XRP Trust into a spot-based ETF, allowing direct investment exposure to XRP.Besides Polkadot, Cardano, and XRP, Grayscale aims to introduce ETFs for Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC).",Market|Grayscale Crypto News Today,EN,0,0,DOT|MARKET|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-02-25 16:11:27

While the meme market struggles, experts are bullish on Rollblock , a leading ETH-based presale disrupting Web3 gaming and wagering. With $10.6 million raised in its ongoing ICO, Rollblock is emerging as a top contender for massive 2025 returns. Rollblock (RBLK): The Web3 Gaming Powerhouse Redefining Fair Play Rollblock (RBLK) is quickly becoming a dominant force in Web3 gaming, tackling one of the industry’s biggest challenges: bet manipulation. As security concerns mount after the Bybit hack, which stole 401,346 Ethereum ($1.4 billion), investors are flocking to Rollblock’s transparent blockchain ecosystem, which ensures fair play and verifiable gaming integrity. With over 7,000 games and an expanding sports prediction league, Rollblock is set to disrupt the $500 billion online gaming industry. Its commitment to blockchain transparency has fueled a 600% surge in users in December alone, with $1.75 million in bids placed on the platform. To enhance accessibility, Rollblock now supports fiat deposits via Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Mastercard, streamlining onboarding for new users and increasing mainstream adoption. At the heart of RBLK’s success is its deflationary revenue-sharing model. 30% of platform revenue funds weekly buybacks, 60% of tokens are burned to reduce supply, and 40% is allocated to staking rewards. This model offers up to 30% APY, one of the highest yields in the industry. Rollblock incentivizes long-term holding and helps mitigate selling pressure over time. With over $10.6 million raised, Rollblock’s presale is gaining major traction. Investors are rushing to secure RBLK at $0.06 in stage 10, ahead of the next price increase, positioning it as one of the most promising gaming cryptos of 2025. With major exchange listings on the horizon, stage 10 tokens are selling out fast at $0.06. Investors can also capitalize on a 50% limited-time bonus for all RBLK purchases this week. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Sees Whale Accumulation Amid Price Surge Shiba Inu trades at $0.000014 following a 5.3% intraday fall in price, showing a slight downward trend. However, the meme coin sector remains volatile, and Shiba Inu has seen significant whale activity. Reports claim that 613 trillion SHIB tokens are now amassed in only 10 wallets, with sudden price swings potentially signaling market manipulation. Any of these whales dumping their holdings could cause fairly dramatic moves in the price, affecting Shiba Inu's short-term performance. All the same, Shiba Inu draws retail and institutional investors' attention, and speculation about its long-term potential is growing. Analysts say Shiba Inu could reach $0.5 by the end of the year, but that will only happen with increased institutional adoption and broader market sentiment. While Shiba Inu battles whale dominance, its price trajectory is watched closely on the meme coin market. Dogecoin (DOGE) Adoption Rises as On-Chain Activity Surges Dogecoin (DOGE) is seeing a steady increase in on-chain activity, with active addresses jumping 34% over the past month, reaching 6.57 million. The 30-day high hit 6.58 million active addresses, while the low reached 6.57 million, signaling consistent Dogecoin adoption. Despite major cryptocurrencies trading in the green, Dogecoin remains below key support levels. However, the rising on-chain engagement indicates growing investor faith in DOGE's longer-term potential. Dogecoin is trading at $0.2297, and analysts expect the meme coin to double its value by the end of February and break resistance levels. As adoption expands and on-chain metrics improve, traders closely watch whether DOGE can sustain this momentum and reclaim higher price levels in the coming weeks. Why Rollblock is the Future of the Crypto Industry Rollblock is revolutionizing Web3 gaming and decentralized trading, offering unmatched transparency, security, and real utility. With blockchain-powered fairness, 7,000+ games, and a deflationary revenue model, it redefines crypto’s gaming and wagering role. As adoption grows, Rollblock is positioned to lead the next era of blockchain innovation and finance. Discover the exciting opportunities for the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale today!

40826419,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133789,1740504185,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Bitcoin ETF Outflows: U.S. Spot ETFs See Massive $516M Dip,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-outflows-massive-dip/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs market is experiencing a notable shift. After weeks of positive momentum and inflows, we’re now seeing a concerning trend of net outflows. February 24th marked the fifth consecutive day of withdrawals, with a significant $516.4 million leaving these investment vehicles. What’s behind this sudden change of heart, and what does it mean for the future of Bitcoin and crypto investments? Let’s dive into the details. Why are Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows Surging? For weeks, the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States was hailed as a landmark moment, opening up Bitcoin investment to a broader range of investors. However, the tide seems to be turning, at least for now. According to data from Farside Investors, February 24th saw a hefty $516.4 million in net ETF outflows . This marks a continuation of a trend that began earlier in the week, raising questions about investor sentiment and market dynamics. Let’s break down the ETFs that experienced the most significant Bitcoin ETF outflows : Fidelity’s FBTC : Leading the pack with a substantial outflow of $247 million. BlackRock’s IBIT : Following closely behind with $158.6 million in outflows. Grayscale’s GBTC : Continuing its outflow trend with $59.5 million withdrawn. Invesco’s BTCO : Recorded $15 million in outflows. WisdomTree’s BTCW : Experienced $12.5 million in outflows. Bitwise’s BITB : Saw $10.3 million in outflows. VanEck’s HODL : Reported $7.3 million in outflows. Grayscale’s BTC Mini Trust : Experienced $6.2 million in outflows. The table below provides a clearer picture of the Bitcoin ETF outflows on February 24th: ETF Net Outflow (USD Million) Fidelity (FBTC) $247.0 BlackRock (IBIT) $158.6 Grayscale (GBTC) $59.5 Invesco (BTCO) $15.0 WisdomTree (BTCW) $12.5 Bitwise (BITB) $10.3 VanEck (HODL) $7.3 Grayscale Mini Trust $6.2 Total Net Outflow $516.4 Grayscale GBTC’s Persistent Outflows: A Key Factor? It’s important to note that Grayscale GBTC has been consistently experiencing outflows since the conversion of its Bitcoin trust into an ETF. This is partly attributed to investors taking profits after the conversion and the ETF’s higher fee structure compared to newer entrants. While the $59.5 million outflow from GBTC is significant, the substantial outflows from newer ETFs like FBTC and IBIT are more concerning, suggesting a broader shift in investor sentiment rather than just profit-taking from GBTC. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Temporary Dip or Start of a Trend? Are these ETF outflows a temporary blip, or do they signal a more sustained trend? It’s still too early to definitively say. Several factors could be at play: Profit Taking : After the initial excitement and price surge following the ETF approvals, some investors might be taking profits off the table. Market Correction : The broader cryptocurrency market can be volatile. Bitcoin’s price fluctuations might be influencing investor decisions regarding ETF holdings. Macroeconomic Factors : Global economic conditions, interest rates, and inflation concerns can impact investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Rotation into Other Assets : Investors might be reallocating capital to other asset classes, including other cryptocurrencies or traditional markets. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs and the Crypto Market? The performance of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the coming days and weeks will be crucial in determining whether this is a short-term correction or a more prolonged period of outflows. Keep an eye on: Daily Flow Data : Monitor daily reports from firms like Farside Investors to track the direction of ETF flows. Bitcoin Price Action : Bitcoin’s price movements will likely be correlated with ETF activity. Market Sentiment : Pay attention to overall market sentiment and news surrounding the crypto space. While five consecutive days of net outflows is undoubtedly noteworthy, it’s essential to maintain a balanced perspective. The Spot Bitcoin ETFs are still relatively new products, and market fluctuations are inherent in the crypto world. This period of outflows could present a buying opportunity for some, while others may prefer to wait and see how the situation unfolds. Regardless, understanding these market dynamics is vital for anyone involved in or considering cryptocurrency investments. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what can you take away from these Bitcoin ETF outflows ? Stay Informed : Keep up-to-date with the daily ETF flow data and broader market news. Diversify Your Portfolio : Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification is key in volatile markets. Assess Your Risk Tolerance : Understand your own risk appetite and invest accordingly. Crypto investments can be highly volatile. Long-Term Perspective : Consider your long-term investment goals. Short-term market fluctuations are common. Do Your Own Research (DYOR) : Never rely solely on news headlines. Conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions. Conclusion: Navigating the Bitcoin ETF Landscape The recent Bitcoin ETF outflows serve as a reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. While the initial enthusiasm surrounding Spot Bitcoin ETFs was palpable, market sentiment can shift rapidly. Understanding the factors driving these outflows and staying informed about market developments is crucial for navigating the evolving crypto investment landscape. Whether this is a temporary dip or a sign of a more significant shift remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the world of crypto continues to keep us on our toes.

The crypto lost over 8% in value within a single day, triggering widespread concern among investors. However, Eric Trump, the son of U.S. President Donald Trump, took to X to encourage investors to capitalize on the crypto market selloff. Eric Trump Encourages Investors to Buy the Dip In a recent post on X , the son of U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on the crypto market selloff, urging investors to “Buy the dips!” His message resonated with those who view corrections as a chance to accumulate Bitcoin at lower prices. Eric Trump’s statement sparked reactions across the crypto community, with some seeing it as a show of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy, also responded to the crypto market decline. He referred to the price drop as a “Bitcoin sale,” hinting that his company may take advantage of the lower prices. Saylor has consistently supported Bitcoin and led Strategy to accumulate significant holdings over the years. Reacting to Eric Trump’s tweet, the CEO of Strategy added, “The best advice, volatility is a gift to the faithful.” Despite optimism from some, skepticism remained among other financial experts. Gold advocate Peter Schiff dismissed the idea of buying the dip, warning that further declines could follow. Schiff has long criticized Bitcoin, arguing that it remains a speculative asset prone to severe price swings. MicroStrategy Continues Expanding Its Bitcoin Holdings Amid the crypto market selloff, Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, confirmed another major Bitcoin acquisition . The firm announced a $2 billion purchase, securing 20,365 BTC at an average price of $97,514 per coin. This addition aligns with the company’s long-term accumulation strategy, which aims to hold $42 billion worth of Bitcoin over the next three years. Following its latest purchase, Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings have grown to approximately 499,096 BTC, valued at around $47 billion based on current prices. This represents nearly 2.4% of Bitcoin’s total supply, positioning the company as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder. The company has continued its buying strategy despite fluctuations in Bitcoin price. While some view this as a commitment to long-term investment, others caution that the strategy carries risks given the volatile crypto market. A Buying Opportunity or Further Declines? The broader crypto market also experienced losses, with Ethereum (ETH) dropping 9% to $2,405 and Solana (SOL) falling 7% to $143. Bitcoin’s market capitalization fell to $1.76 trillion, reflecting increased selling pressure across digital assets. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered’s head of crypto research, Geoff Kendrick, suggested that Bitcoin could see further declines. He predicted an additional 10% drop, potentially bringing prices down to the early $80,000 range. Kendrick pointed to ongoing outflows from U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs as a key factor that could contribute to extended losses.

According to Binance’s preliminary investigation, the incident was likely the result of the affected user’s device being compromised by malware or plugins. Binance said in a statement that the hacker was able to steal the user's email, Google Authenticator, Binance account credentials, and other sensitive information. The attacker successfully bypassed security measures by simulating the victim's commonly used devices and IP environment and accessed the funds through the red packet feature. The exchange noted that sending red packets on Binance requires multiple security verifications, such as payment PINs, biometric authentication, or email confirmations. However, these security measures were bypassed because the hacker had already accessed the user’s personal information. Related News: BREAKING: Coinbase Decides to List Three Surprise Altcoins on Futures Binance has advised the affected user to report the incident to law enforcement. The exchange’s security team has pledged to fully cooperate by providing all available information to assist in the investigation. Additionally, Binance urges users to remain vigilant, increase their cybersecurity awareness, and ensure their devices are free of malware to prevent similar attacks. *This is not investment advice.

40826538,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133788,1740504385,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unwavering Bullishness: CryptoQuant CEO’s 4 Strong Reasons for Ethereum (ETH) Surge,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-bullish-outlook-cryptoquant-ceo/,"In the ever-turbulent world of cryptocurrency, maintaining a clear perspective can be challenging. Amidst market fluctuations and unforeseen events, it’s crucial to discern genuine signals from fleeting noise. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju recently shared a powerful dose of optimism for Ethereum (ETH), outlining four compelling reasons to remain bullish on its future. Let’s dive into these insights and understand why, according to a leading industry expert, Ethereum’s trajectory still points decidedly upward. Why Remain Bullish on Ethereum? CryptoQuant CEO Explains Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, a renowned on-chain data analytics platform, recently took to X to articulate his steadfastly bullish stance on Ethereum. His analysis isn’t based on mere speculation but rather on concrete data points and market observations. Let’s break down each of the four reasons he presented, offering a comprehensive understanding of the factors underpinning his optimistic outlook. 1. Bybit Hack Resilience: Ethereum’s Impressive Stability Recent events, such as the Bybit hack, often send ripples of fear and uncertainty through the crypto market. However, Ki Young Ju points out a crucial observation: despite this security breach, Ethereum (ETH) has demonstrated remarkable resilience. Limited Sell Pressure: On-chain data reveals that ETH hasn’t experienced significant sell pressure in the aftermath of the hack. This suggests a robust underlying market sentiment and a lack of panic selling. Stable Market Data: Key market indicators remain stable, indicating that the hack’s impact on Ethereum’s overall market health has been minimal. Exchange Dynamics: Exchange selling, typically a major driver of price volatility, is a gradual process. Furthermore, Over-the-Counter (OTC) trades, which are less visible to the public market, have a limited impact on immediate price fluctuations. This stability in the face of adversity underscores Ethereum’s maturity and the strong conviction of its holders. It highlights that short-term negative events don’t necessarily derail the long-term trajectory of a fundamentally sound asset like Ethereum . 2. Stablecoin King: Ethereum’s Dominance in the Stablecoin Market Ethereum ‘s dominance extends beyond just its native token. It reigns supreme in the stablecoin market, a critical component of the crypto ecosystem. Ki Young Ju highlights this leadership as another key reason for his bullish outlook. Market Share Leader: Ethereum commands a staggering 56% of the total stablecoin market capitalization. This signifies that a majority of stablecoins, which are crucial for trading, lending, and various DeFi activities, are built upon the Ethereum network. Potential Regulatory Tailwinds: The evolving regulatory landscape in the United States, particularly with figures like former U.S. President Donald Trump advocating for a rollback of crypto regulations, could be a significant catalyst. Business Adoption in 2025: A more favorable regulatory environment could pave the way for increased business adoption of ETH-based stablecoins and smart contracts in 2025. Businesses seek stability and reliability, and Ethereum’s robust infrastructure combined with regulatory clarity could make it the platform of choice. Ethereum’s stronghold in the stablecoin market positions it as a foundational layer for the broader crypto economy. As stablecoins become increasingly integrated into mainstream finance, Ethereum stands to benefit immensely. 3. Spot ETH ETF Reality: Is a Large Cap Altcoin Season Imminent? The approval of the spot Ethereum ETF is no longer a distant dream – it’s a reality. This monumental achievement marks a significant step towards mainstream adoption and institutional investment in ETH. Ki Young Ju believes this development could trigger a “Large Cap ETF altseason.” Regulatory Momentum: The green light for a spot ETH ETF signifies growing regulatory acceptance of Ethereum and the broader crypto asset class. This momentum is crucial for attracting institutional capital. “Large Cap ETF Altseason” Potential: With the regulatory barriers lowered, a “Large Cap ETF altseason” could be on the horizon. This implies that other established cryptocurrencies, particularly large-cap altcoins, could follow in Ethereum’s footsteps and gain further institutional exposure through ETFs. Price Catalysis: The influx of institutional capital via spot ETFs could act as a significant catalyst, propelling the price of Ethereum higher throughout the year. ETFs provide a convenient and regulated avenue for traditional investors to gain exposure to ETH. The spot ETH ETF is a game-changer. It validates Ethereum as a legitimate asset class in the eyes of traditional finance and opens the floodgates for substantial institutional investment, potentially ushering in a new era of growth for ETH and other large-cap altcoins. 4. Whale Accumulation: Smart Money Loading Up on ETH Following the “smart money” can often provide valuable insights into market trends. Ki Young Ju points to whale accumulation as the fourth pillar of his bullish thesis on Ethereum . Whale Wallet Growth: Wallets holding substantial amounts of ETH (between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH) have significantly increased their holdings. Over the past year, their balances have grown by an impressive 24%. Supply Absorption: This whale accumulation is primarily driven by absorbing supply from smaller wallets, indicating a consolidation of ETH in the hands of larger, presumably more informed and long-term oriented investors. Cost Basis Proximity: Ethereum’s current price is now nearing the cost basis of these accumulating addresses. This suggests that whales are strategically accumulating ETH at levels close to their average purchase price, reinforcing their conviction in its future potential. Whale accumulation is a strong signal of confidence. Large investors, with their access to superior information and analytical resources, are strategically increasing their ETH holdings, suggesting they anticipate significant future price appreciation. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Ethereum Landscape Ki Young Ju’s analysis provides valuable actionable insights for anyone navigating the Ethereum landscape: Consider Long-Term Potential: Focus on the fundamental strengths of Ethereum, such as its stablecoin dominance, ETF approval, and whale accumulation, rather than being swayed by short-term market noise. Monitor On-Chain Data: Pay attention to on-chain metrics like exchange flows, whale activity, and stablecoin market share to gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics. Platforms like CryptoQuant offer valuable tools for this. Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: Keep abreast of regulatory changes, particularly in key jurisdictions like the United States, as they can significantly impact the crypto market and Ethereum’s adoption trajectory. Conclusion: Ethereum’s Bright Future CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju’s four reasons paint a compelling picture of Ethereum ‘s enduring strength and bullish potential. From its resilience in the face of market events to its dominance in the stablecoin market, the landmark spot ETF approval, and the strategic accumulation by whales, Ethereum exhibits all the hallmarks of a leading crypto asset poised for continued growth. While the crypto market inherently involves volatility, the underlying fundamentals and positive catalysts highlighted by Ki Young Ju suggest a bright future for Ethereum. For those looking at the long-term horizon, the signals remain decidedly optimistic.

This comes amid the US SEC’s acknowledgment of Grayscale’s Cardano ETF filing, providing a bullish outlook for the crypto. How The Cardano Price May Never Drop Below $0.8 Again In a TradingView post, CobraVanguard noted that the Cardano price continues to move well within the wedge. The analyst claimed that if this wedge is broken, then market participants will no longer see ADA below $0.80. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that a break above could see Cardano reclaim the $1 psychological price level. Related Reading: Cardano Price Eyes Breakout To $6 After Bouncing From 43% Drawdown This bullish outlook for the Cardano price comes as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged Grayscale’s Cardano ETF filing. An ETF is bullish for the ADA price as it will attract institutional investors and drive more inflows into the coin’s ecosystem, which could spark a rally to new highs. However, in the meantime, the Cardano price looks to be in bearish territory, as it has declined alongside the broader crypto market. ADA is currently below the $0.8 price level, which could represent a great buying opportunity, especially if the crypto eventually never sees this price level again, as CobraVanguard predicted. Regarding the short-term bearish outlook for the Cardano price, crypto analyst CryptoBusy also noted that ADA is barely clinging to its 0.5 Fibonacci support level. The analyst added that a breakdown below this Fib support could lead to a straight drop to the $0.618 price level. CryptoBusy suggested that this breakdown will likely happen as ADA is facing significant selling pressure. A Mega Bounce Is Coming For ADA In an X post, crypto analyst Sebastian told market participants to get ready for a mega bounce for the Cardano price after this market downtrend. In another post, he remarked that the worst time to sell is right now. He added that in a month, market participants will wish they had bought more. According to him, the market is a game of emotions and the more people capitulate, the higher prices will go eventually. Related Reading: Possible Deep Correction Could Push Cardano Price To $0.43, Here’s How Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently noted that the most critical support zone for the Cardano price is between $0.67 and $0.80. He remarked that as long as this level holds, ADA’s bull run remains intact. His accompanying chart showed that ADA could still reach its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.10 and possibly surpass this price level in this market cycle. At the time of writing, the Cardano price is trading at around $0.65, down over 12% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

While Ethereum is usually the gold standard for altcoins and its pump fuels surges in the overall altcoin category as well, this time the narrative of a frontrunner altcoin seems to have been shared between Ethereum and Solana. Solana’s prices have also suffered severely thanks to the recent price dump—but this doesn’t seem to have stopped institutional interest or buying. In fact, a huge chunk of SOL investors seem heavily bullish on the token and its growing potential. But while there is positive sentiment toward Solana, investors also seem to realize its limited growth potential due to the large-cap status that Solana boasts right now. This has led many to consider smaller, high-potential options that could eventually become sizeable initiatives, potentially earning them 10x or more in returns. Top 3 Tokens To buy Noe For Massive Returns Ondo (ONDO) One of the biggest trends gaining traction in 2024 is the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). With the financial sector slowly adopting blockchain technology, projects that can successfully bring real-world investments on-chain are in a position to disrupt multi-trillion-dollar markets. Ondo Finance is leading this movement by offering a platform where investors can gain exposure to stable, yield-generating assets without relying on traditional banks. What sets Ondo apart from the typical DeFi project is its focus on bringing institutional-grade financial instruments to the blockchain. It offers tokenized versions of US Treasury-backed assets, allowing users to earn stable yields without dealing with the volatility of typical crypto investments. It was one of the few cryptos to make it to Donald Trump’s WLF portfolio as well. All these developments make Ondo particularly attractive to both retail and institutional investors looking for secure, regulated opportunities in the crypto space. Source: CoinMarketCsp After reaching its all-time high of more than $2 towards the end of 2024, the token has since maintained its price within the $1.4 range, which has now dumped to the $0.92 range, making ONDO a token that one may want to stock up on soon. If tokenized assets become the next major trend in crypto, Ondo could become one of the biggest names in the space, making ONDO a strong contender for long-term accumulation. Aureal One (DLUME) Metaverse and gaming projects have always held massive potential, but many of them have struggled with high fees, slow transactions, and scalability issues. Aureal One is stepping in to solve these problems by integrating Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups), a technology that allows for ultra-fast transactions with zero gas fees. This instantly gives it an edge over older gaming and metaverse projects that are still struggling with Ethereum’s high costs or Solana’s occasional network issues. At the center of Aureal One’s ecosystem is DLUME, a token designed to power its gaming economy and support future metaverse integrations. Unlike some blockchain gaming tokens that lack real utility, DLUME already has strong foundations with two major projects in development. #ExploreDarklume Step into the future, where cities of the metaverse come to life. Explore, connect, and shape a new world beyond imagination. Know more here: https://t.co/M5bGGsUeEO #AurealOne #Darklume #VirtualReality #3Dplanet #innovation #metaverse #digitalecosystem pic.twitter.com/WX8m7BUy0k — Aureal One (@Aureal_One) December 18, 2024 DarkLume Metaverse is the first, being built as a fully decentralized virtual world where players can buy, sell, and trade assets, creating their own experiences while maintaining full ownership of digital properties. Meanwhile, Clash of Tiles is a strategy game that introduces a unique twist—gameplay is directly influenced by real-world financial markets, blending investment strategies with competitive gaming in a way that’s never been done before. Momentum for Aureal One has been growing, with the project already raising over $3.2 million in its presale. Right now, DLUME is priced at just $0.0013, with a listing target of $0.005, meaning early adopters could potentially see a 300% gain right out of the gate. Given how blockchain gaming and metaverse projects are expected to explode in popularity in the coming years, Aureal One could establish itself as a major player in the space. Cronos (CRO) Layer 1 blockchains have always been at the center of the crypto market, but while Ethereum and Solana dominate the conversation, Cronos (CRO) has been quietly expanding its presence, building what could soon become one of the strongest blockchain ecosystems in the space. What makes Cronos unique is its direct connection to Crypto.com, one of the largest exchanges in the world. This partnership gives it a massive built-in user base, ensuring adoption and liquidity that many other blockchains lack. Despite being a highly scalable and low-cost Layer 1, it remains undervalued compared to Solana, BNB Chain, and other competitors. Beyond its exchange integration, Cronos has been aggressively expanding its DeFi and NFT ecosystems. The network is home to a range of staking, lending, and yield farming platforms, drawing in users looking for alternative ways to earn in the bear market. Meanwhile, its NFT and GameFi sectors have been seeing increased adoption, positioning it as a blockchain that can cater to multiple segments of the market simultaneously. Source: CoinMarketCap The CRO token itself has been slowly gaining strength, and as Crypto.com continues to expand its global presence, demand for CRO is expected to rise. Priced at a low range of $0.072 right now, CRO may be in an excellent buying phase as one of the few Layer 1 tokens that still offer significant growth potential despite already being a well-established name. Conclusion If the Solana ecosystem sees a jump in the next couple of days, then it may be likely for projects built on Solana or associated with the blockchain to also see a surge in demand naturally. However, the projects mentioned here—while not exactly affiliated with Solana—could also pump, thanks to their strong utilities and usual comparison with other large-cap projects, like SOL itself.

Today, February 25, 2025, a blockchain-based transaction tracker, Crypto Beast, made a post on X (formerly Twitter), stating, “Binance is selling all their Solana holdings.” Current Price Momentum This post on X went viral, gaining significant attention from crypto enthusiasts and causing a price drop of over 8% in the past 24 hours. With this substantial decline, SOL is currently trading near $143, while its trading volume during the same period has soared by 130%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors. https://twitter.com/cryptobeastreal/status/1894290466612412870 The jump in trading volume doesn’t necessarily indicate a bullish or bearish signal. It typically occurs when an asset experiences significant movement in either direction or undergoes a breakout or breakdown, prompting traders and investors to take action. However, in this case, the sentiment is negative—whales are offloading, prices are falling significantly, and this has led to millions of dollars in liquidations. Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis and Price Prediction Apart from Binance selling off its Solana holdings, another factor contributing to SOL’s bearish trend is the upcoming unlock of $1.7 billion worth of SOL tokens, scheduled for March 1, 2025. With these developments in the crypto market, SOL has already lost 45% of its value in the past 30 days and is approaching a crucial support level at $130, which has a strong history of buying pressure and price reversals. Source: Trading View According to expert technical analysis, if SOL fails to hold this support level and closes a daily candle below $120, there is a strong possibility that it could drop by 35%, reaching another support level at $75 in the future. $200 Million Worth of SOL Outflow Despite this bearish outlook, investors and long-term holders appear to be accumulating the asset, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of nearly $200 million worth of SOL in the past 48 hours. Source: Coinglass Such a significant outflow from exchanges suggests potential accumulation and could lead to buying pressure and an upside rally.

The news comes as the nonprofit goes through a leadership shake-up and as Ethereum has become less popular for new builders in recent months, with some even blaming Miyaguchi’s leadership as for why the blockchain’s token price is lagging behind other cryptocurrencies. “This new opportunity will allow me to continue supporting EF’s institutional relationships, and to expand the reach of our vision and culture more broadly,” Miyaguchi wrote in a blog post . The Ethereum Foundation is a nonprofit that supports the development of the Ethereum blockchain. Founded in 2014, Miyaguchi joined in 2018 and has been the executive sirector ever since. CoinDesk reached out to a spokesperson at the EF to find out who would fill the executive director position, but did not hear back in time for publication.

Riot's core operating income remains negative, and high SG&A costs and rising mining expenses raise questions about its long-term sustainability without an appreciation in the Bitcoin price. The company's heavy reliance on stock-based compensation and equity dilution raises concerns about shareholder value. Given its subjectively poor performance, it is unclear why stock compensation is so high. I am bearish on RIOT due to rising costs, reliance on Bitcoin's volatile price, and equity dilution. Since RIOT's price is likely to close to its tangible book value per share, it is not worth short-selling. Although it may not be overvalued on a short-term basis, it should bleed value without significant operational changes. On Monday, Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) reported its Q4 results . Its revenue beat estimates at $376M vs. a $372M consensus, up dramatically from $281M last year due to the sharp rise in Bitcoin's price. That said, the company produced less Bitcoin at ~4.83K in 2024 vs. ~6.63K in 2023, with mining costs surging to ~$32.2K. The firm also finished the year with 17.7K unencumbered Bitcoin, worth approximately $1.57B at today's $88.8K price. The market reacted mixed to the result, which was generally aligned with estimates. RIOT initially rose a half percent but opened around 10% lower Tuesday morning, coming off a 4.5% loss on Monday. The relatively neutral report was heavily offset by a sharp 7% crash in Bitcoin's value, or about 11% since last Friday. Markets broadly fell overnight as Trump confirmed upcoming tariffs on Canada and Mexico following the month-long delay. The Federal Reserve has also confirmed a hawkish pivot due to reemerging inflation concerns. In other words, there is no Bitcoin-specific negative news but generally bearish market news. Since Bitcoin is reacting so heavily to this news, its status as a speculative risk asset and not a hedge against inflation is, to me, confirmed. I have had a bearish outlook on Riot Platforms from late 2021 due to my view that the company's cost of production was excessive. I update my view last July in "" Riot Platforms: A Cash-Burning Machine, Even In The Crypto Bull Market ."" I had a bearish outlook on RIOT, again due to inconsistent profitability, reliance on dilutive equity sales, and regulatory risk due to its immense power needs in light of ERCOT's power shortages. I also maintained my view that Bitcoin lacks real-world value and is essentially a sink for excess market liquidity. As of Tuesday morning, RIOT's price has remained about unchanged since I last covered it. However, Bitcoin has risen by nearly 50% over the same period. This reiterates my point that Riot has poor exposure to Bitcoin, given its ongoing failure to rebound despite powerful Bitcoin price fundamentals. What will happen in a Bitcoin bear market if RIOT's value fails to improve during ideal conditions? Looking at the technical trend in Bitcoin today and general market liquidity fundamentals, I suspect we may see that answer throughout 2025. Riot's Core Operating Income is Still Negative In 2024, Riot generated $321M from Bitcoin mining revenue and $376M in total revenue. Its direct cost of Bitcoin mining was $189M, while its total gross costs were about $263M, including engineering and other categories. Its gross income was, therefore, around $113M. However, its general sales and administrative costs were $267M, while its depreciation was $212M. So, excluding more volatile income sources like power curtailment ($45M), acquisition costs, changes in equipment value, and changes in Bitcoin fair values and derivatives ($457M and $45M), its core operating income, excluding depreciation was around -$154M, and -$366M if depreciation is included. In other words, if it were not for immense increases in the fair value of its Bitcoin assets, which were mined at much lower costs or purchased, the company would not have positive income in 2024. In Q4, the cost of mining Bitcoin was $42K, up from $35K in Q3 due primarily to higher power costs. Halving also increased costs, with costs jumping from $25K to $35K from Q2 to Q3. This figure includes power costs, miner depreciation, and power curtailment credits. Realistically, the depreciation rate may not translate to actual changes in asset fair values. That said, with the rate at which mining chip technology is improving, natural declines in chip efficiency over time give Riot high ongoing CapEx needs. Still, let's discount the depreciation level by half; assuming asset fair value changes are slower than the depreciation schedule (which is often true), the ""adjusted"" Q4 mining cost should be about $32K. However, Riot also has an immense SG&A cost of ~$267M, or about $55.3K per coin, given its 4,828 total BTC produced. In other words, Riot's SG&A is staggeringly high. Adding that figure to the adjusted Bitcoin net cost figure, I estimate Riot's effective cost per Bitcoin is about $87K, which is just about where Bitcoin is currently trading. We're also seeing a significant and consistent increase in Riot's SG&A, which was only $67M in 2022. Its net cost of mining Bitcoin was also only $11K in 2022. It only produced a few hundred BTC in 2022, but still, it had much lower costs in 2023, yet produced over 6.6K BTC, much more than in 2024. Technically, the lower production level is primarily the result of BTC's halving last April; however, that still creates a flaw in Riot's business because it's becoming systemically more challenging to produce Bitcoin at cost and scale. Riot's costs, mainly costs for employees, are rising disproportionately to improvements in production (which there are none). We're also seeing a strong upward trend in direct Bitcoin mining costs. Thus, we can estimate that its costs will continue to rise in this trend in 2025, while Bitcoin's price may not continue higher. It is also worth noting that Riot's SG&A is primarily made up of stock-based compensation, totaling $125M in 2024 vs. $32M in 2023. Some analysts and investors write off stock-based compensation as a non-issue because those costs do not hamper cash flows. Although equity compensation may lower liquidity and solvency risks, they're still a direct cost to investors. Further, RIOT's stock price has generally declined while its stock-based compensation has risen, resulting in a sharp acceleration in its dilution rate. See below: Data by YCharts Note this figure is for TTM Q3, and we know its equity compensation was $125M based on its Q4 report . The bulk of its dilution is from direct equity sales to raise cash. Still, the fact is that most of its potential income (aside from the appreciation of inventory assets) is going to stock-based compensation. The dilution rate on that is about 3.7% of its current market capitalization, which is notable. In my view, though not extreme, it is far too high given the stock's poor performance and the company's inability to be consistently profitable. If this compensation is performance-based, I argue that Riot's apparent performance is entirely skewed by appreciation in BTC, which is beyond its manager's control. RIOT investors should know that its overall dilution rate is around 30-40%, primarily due to equity financing sales. Technically, those sales should essentially go toward capital growth assets, which add value to the stock. Even then, given that it cannot clearly profit from Bitcoin mining at current prices and costs, it is unclear if those capital investments are providing value to investors. The Bottom Line The reality is that RIOT's performance is essentially dependent on Bitcoin. Although it has an engineering segment, its costs were slightly higher than revenues ($38.5M in sales vs. $41.7M in costs) in 2024, which is still relatively small. It makes some money by not consuming power during higher power demand periods, but that is only around $33M and is a very volatile segment. On that note, Riot is fighting hard to hide the amount of energy it consumes from being published, but it is probably on the order of a few hundred thousand homes . No doubt, Riot faces some regulatory risk, given Texas' power grid has been prone to outages in recent years. That said, the company argues that it stabilizes the grid by consuming more power during low-demand periods, which may otherwise go unused. Thus, its voracious power needs may encourage electricity investments from Texas utilities. Still, as power storage technology improves , the need for power demand sinks like Riot will likely diminish. Further, there is a good argument that Bitcoin's value is primarily the result of excess market liquidity. In my opinion, Bitcoin's ascendance over the past decade is mainly due to the Fed's monetary easing and rampant asset speculation. However, I do not think Bitcoin fills a functional need, as its transaction efficiency is extremely low compared to fiat currency and most other cryptocurrencies. If we look at the data, we can see that Bitcoin's price will usually rise when speculators are borrowing more money via margin debt or when individual investors have higher (but falling) cash allocations in their accounts. See below: Data by YCharts For example, after the stimulus efforts of 2020, individual investors had high portfolio cash levels and low-margin debts. By 2022, they had deployed that cash and borrowed a tremendous amount via margin debt. The same was true from 2016 to 2018, though to a lesser degree. The same was also true around 2023, as cash allocations were high after the widespread sell-off caused by higher rates in 2022. Today, market participants generally have low cash allocations in their portfolios and high-margin debt. Theoretically, margin debts can continue to rise, and cash allocations may continue to fall, potentially pushing Bitcoin further. Still, the positioning is mainly similar to Bitcoin's peaks in early 2022, 2019, and early 2018. Large bear markets for Bitcoin followed those periods. In my opinion, Bitcoin's slight decline this year may indicate that this historically robust pattern is repeating due to insufficient excess liquidity in markets necessary to sustain the price of (to me) intangible speculative assets. I am bearish on RIOT due to the sharp and ongoing increase in its mining costs. If not for the appreciation in the value of Bitcoin it purchased and mined years ago (at far lower costs), the company's income would still have been quite negative in Q4, despite a sharp increase in Bitcoin's price. In my view, as the company dilutes equity for new investments and stock-based compensation, it will fail to recover those sales through higher-yielding assets. Of course, that depends entirely on the price of Bitcoin. Riot Platforms may be profitable if Bitcoin rebounds and rises to a new high. In my opinion, based on an investor's liquidity profile (high-margin debt and low cash), it is unlikely for Bitcoin to rise today. Bitcoin will also not halve again until 2028, though its impact on Riot is unclear because halving often pushes BTC's value up, making BTC mining twice as challenging. Still, I would not short RIOT because my outlook on it depends on BTC's price, and I'd generally prefer to short BTC outright today. Further, although I doubt Riot's assets have a market value comparable to their book value, that may be the case. RIOT's tangible book value was around $8 in Q3, likely higher in Q4 due to BTC price appreciation. Realistically, RIOT's fair value may be around its current price if it were to sell its assets today, so it is not necessarily overvalued on a short-term basis. Still, it may become overvalued if it continues to operate in a seemingly dilutive manner.",RIOT,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|MINING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-02-25 17:35:47

These claims have ignited debates about market manipulation, transparency, and the role of influential figures in the crypto space. Allegations of Asset Dumping The controversy began when crypto influencer Lara Queen tweeted accusations against Binance’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao (CZ). She claimed that Binance was “dumping $SOL, $ETH and other assets via Wintermute,” and expressed frustration after being blocked by CZ on social media. Lara’s tweets suggested that dissenting voices are being silenced, stating, “Say something and the head scammer CZ will insta block you.” She further insinuated potential legal repercussions for CZ, referencing his previous legal issues and predicting more severe consequences. Community Reactions The allegations have elicited a spectrum of reactions from the crypto community. Dippy.eth expressed astonishment, remarking, “Now this is crazy. Something is up.” In contrast, Nwokwu defended CZ, pointing out that he is no longer the CEO of Binance and questioning the approach of those directing their grievances towards him: “CZ is not even CEO but you went under his tweet to use vile words? Anyone would block you. Why not do that under Richard Teng’s tweet?” This highlights a potential disconnect between public perception and the current organizational structure of Binance. Meme Dream provided a broader market perspective, suggesting that the recent events could signal a shift in the crypto market’s trajectory: “I think crypto is going to get interesting here over the next month. Maybe with all the bad actors, the 2025 bull run is over. I hope not, but with inflation ticking up and people overreacting to these Trump tariffs, the bubble might have burst for most coins.” This viewpoint underscores the interconnectedness of macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and market sentiment in shaping the crypto landscape. Qubit offered a more critical take on the industry’s leadership, stating, “They’re all frauds. They just stay out of their exchanges & markets. You’re better off buying quarterly calls and puts on random stocks. They’re a bunch of communists trying to get your capital to invest in influence for their world views.” Such strong opinions reflect the deep-seated mistrust some community members harbor towards centralized exchanges and their executives. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Implications The alleged asset dumping has coincided with notable price movements in the crypto market. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at approximately $2,402.13, reflecting a decrease of 10% over the past 24 hours. Similarly, Solana (SOL) has experienced a decline, with its price now at $139.53, marking a 9% drop in the same timeframe. These downturns have raised concerns about the potential impact of large-scale asset movements by major exchanges on market stability and investor confidence. Calls for Transparency The situation underscores the ongoing debate about transparency and accountability within the cryptocurrency industry. As centralized exchanges wield significant influence over the market, their actions can have profound effects on asset prices and investor sentiment. The community’s diverse reactions highlight the need for open communication and clear policies from industry leaders to maintain trust and ensure the market’s integrity. In conclusion, the recent allegations against Binance and CZ have sparked a multifaceted discussion within the crypto community. As the situation develops, it serves as a reminder of the importance of transparency, ethical practices, and informed participation in the rapidly evolving world of digital assets.

BNB has experienced an uptick of over 58% since the end of February 2024, only falling short of Bitcoin’s 70% price uptrend in the same period. In a long X thread published on Tuesday, Zheng noted that since the launch of Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on January 11, 2024, BNB’s highest price rally took its price up by 161%, outperforming Bitcoin, which managed to garner a 133% uptick. Both cryptos have reached all-time high values in the last two months, of $788 and $108,780 respectively, but BNB gave investors more gains than BTC. BNB exudes resilience in bear and bull cycles Linda Zheng explained how BNB was resilient to selling pressures in recent bear and bull market cycles, as it could withstand market downturns compared to other coins, particularly Ethereum. “BNB, which has been at the forefront of the industry market value for many years, not only has a compound interest return that exceeds the return of Bitcoin, but also has a more resistant performance in the bull-bear transition cycle. If there is a myth in the crypto market that surpasses Bitcoin, then BNB must be one of the hidden winners in the myth,” she surmised. The market analyst shared data of the last bear market from 2021 to 2022, where BNB experienced a smaller maximum drawdown of 73.29%, while Bitcoin and Ethereum recorded deeper declines of 77.32% and 81.68%, respectively. BTC to BNB price rise comparison. Source: Coinmarketcap. Zheng mentioned that it only took 237 days for BNB’s price to stabilize its downward price momentum, shorter than Bitcoin’s 517-day recovery period. During 2024’s bull market cycle, BNB seemed to survive several market conditions that affected coins like Ethereum and Solana, including Grayscale’s GBTC sell-off in January, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance in March, and the anticipated Mt. Gox repayments in July, last year. She described the biggest bearish tests that occurred in August 2024, when a liquidity crisis pushed the crypto market into a state of high volatility. BNB experienced an 18.40% decline at the time, slightly more than Bitcoin’s 15.70% drop, but fared better than Ethereum, which is still counting losses as of today. Zheng concluded that while Bitcoin is often referred to as the “gold” of the crypto world, BNB has become more than just a transactional “fuel” the crypto community has coined it to be. “BNB is the only token with deflationary characteristics among the top ten mainstream digital assets in terms of market value. Its scarce value is better than Bitcoin.” Will the bullish trend continue? BNB’s price is currently consolidating after its rapid ascent, surviving the $590 price level drop that analysts had expected to happen by the start of this week. According to TradingView data , the token’s immediate resistance currently sits at $669, while strong support has formed at $625. The 9-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $653 acts as the coin’s short-term resistance, whereas the 200-day EMA at $625 provides a support base. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator shows bearish momentum on the daily chart, though lower timeframes could signal a possible reversal in the coming weeks. Short-term traders may prefer using the range scalping strategy of buying near $635 and selling near $655, with stop-loss levels set below $625. If volatility picks up, breakout strategies suggest going long above $670 with a target of $700, while a short position below $620 could aim for $600. Intraday traders might also watch the 9-day EMA for quick bounce trades. Looking ahead, the Binance coin remains in a “neutral but bullish” structure, though a decisive break below $625 could signal a shift in momentum toward the downside. On the upside, reclaiming the $670 level could open the door for further gains above $700. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

This big tennis tournament happens every year at Arena GNP Seguros in Mexico. With this partnership, Nexo boldly moves into sports while encouraging more people to use digital assets. Nexo Makes Strategic Move Into Sports As the event’s official sponsor, Nexo will have its brand all over the stadium during the tournament from February 24 to March 1, 2025. The Acapulco Tennis Open is in its 32nd edition and will feature top players like Alexander Zverev, Casper Ruud, and Tommy Paul. This partnership will give Nexo the platform to connect to audiences who appreciate strategy and long-term success. It is similar to how people invest in crypto with careful planning. Nexo’s sponsorship shows how Web3 and crypto firms are expanding into the sports industry through big sponsorship deals. From Formula 1 to soccer, the NFL, and basketball, digital assets are becoming more popular in sports. By partnering with ATP, the brokerage is not just sponsoring a tournament but bringing crypto closer to everyday sports lovers. Nexo’s 2025 Growth Strategy and Expansion This deal is part of Nexo’s 2025 growth strategy, especially in Latin America. Last year, the crypto-focused company resumed onboarding new clients in the UK . This came after successfully implementing a series of upgrades to meet compliance requirements set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). As crypto adoption increases globally, the firm was trying to position itself at the center of this growth. The company focuses on making its Dual-Mode Nexo Card more accessible, working on its platform to improve crypto-border payments. It also aims to launch AI-driven tools this year. Beyond expanding its services, Nexo is increasing the utility of its native token, NEXO. The company wants to increase the token’s usefulness and deliver strong returns to investors. The Resilient Nexo Growth Path Since its launch in 2018, Nexo has grown into a leading digital finance company. In 2022, the company faced financial challenges due to the crypto market downturn. These struggles influenced its decision to rebrand to become a full digital wealth platform. Now, the firm operates in 150 countries, managing over $11 billion in assets.

Bybit CEO Ben Zhou says the exchange has restored a 1:1 backing on all client assets after the record-setting hack. Zhou’s claims are echoed in a proof-of-reserves audit report published by the blockchain security auditor Hacken on Sunday. “The Hacken team’s Proof of Reserves audit, conducted on Sunday, February 23, 2025, demonstrates that Bybit maintains an in-scope reserve ratio of > 100 %. This finding signifies that Bybit possesses sufficient reserves to cover its in-scope liabilities, thereby bolstering trust and confidence among its users and stakeholders.” Source: Hacken The Bybit CEO said hackers manipulated an ETH transfer between one of the exchange’s cold wallets and warm wallets. Pseudonymous on-chain investigator ZachXBT linked the exploit to the Lazarus Group, an infamous North Korean cybercriminal outfit. The Dubai-based exchange announced a full restoration of services on Sunday despite a record-setting level of withdrawal requests following the hack. “Bybit has successfully processed the highest number of withdrawal requests in our history. Within the first 10 hours of the incident, we processed over 350,000 withdrawal requests, completing 99.9% of them by 1:45 AM UTC. As of now, all withdrawals across all tokens are fully operational, with our systems running smoothly and processing without delays. In total, over 580,000 withdrawal requests have been successfully completed.” Bybit also launched a recovery bounty program to recover the stolen funds, offering 10% of the retrieved amount.

Recent data reveals a noteworthy shift in the U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs landscape. Investors monitoring these instruments need to pay attention as we unpack the latest figures signaling a potential change in momentum. Let’s dive into the details of the recent outflows and understand what they might mean for the future of Ethereum and the broader crypto investment sphere. What’s Happening with Spot Ethereum ETFs? The buzz around spot Ethereum ETFs has been significant, especially following the initial excitement of their launch. However, recent data from Farside Investors paints a slightly different picture. On February 24th, these ETFs collectively experienced a net outflow of $78 million. This marks the third consecutive trading day of net outflows, suggesting a trend that investors should be aware of. To put it into perspective, let’s break down the performance of some key players: BlackRock’s ETHA: Led the outflows with a substantial $48.2 million. Grayscale’s ETHE: Followed with $15.4 million in outflows. Bitwise’s ETHW: Recorded $9.7 million in net outflows. Grayscale’s mini ETH: Saw $4.7 million leave the fund. Interestingly, other ETH ETFs reported no changes in their holdings on the same day. This concentrated outflow from specific funds raises questions about investor sentiment and portfolio adjustments within the Ethereum ETF space. Decoding the Ethereum ETF Outflows: Why the Shift? Understanding the ‘why’ behind these Ethereum ETF outflows is crucial. Several factors could be at play, and it’s likely a combination of these that’s influencing investor decisions: Profit Taking: After periods of market gains, some investors might be taking profits off the table. If Ethereum has seen a price appreciation leading up to these outflows, it’s a natural investor behavior to secure returns. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Periods of uncertainty or broader market corrections can trigger investors to reduce exposure to perceived riskier assets, including crypto ETFs. Alternative Investment Opportunities: Capital might be rotating into other asset classes or investment opportunities that appear more attractive at the moment. This could be within the crypto space itself, such as other cryptocurrencies or DeFi protocols, or even outside of crypto altogether. Fund-Specific Factors: Outflows from particular ETFs, like those from BlackRock and Grayscale, might be related to specific fund dynamics, management fees, or investor perception of these individual funds compared to others. It’s important to note that a few days of outflows do not necessarily indicate a long-term trend reversal. However, consistent outflows warrant attention and further analysis to understand the underlying market sentiment. Deep Dive into ETH ETF Performance: Examining the Numbers Let’s take a closer look at the performance of these ETH ETF products. While the recent outflows are noteworthy, it’s essential to consider the broader context. Here’s a table summarizing the net outflows on February 24th: ETF Name Net Outflow (USD) BlackRock’s ETHA $48.2 million Grayscale’s ETHE $15.4 million Bitwise’s ETHW $9.7 million Grayscale’s mini ETH $4.7 million Others $0 million Total $78 million As you can see, the majority of the outflows were concentrated in BlackRock’s and Grayscale’s funds. This concentration could indicate specific investor reactions to these larger, more established players in the ETF market. What Does This Mean for the Ethereum Market? The implications of these Ethereum ETF outflows for the broader Ethereum market are multifaceted. Here are a few key points to consider: Price Impact: Significant and sustained ETF outflows could exert downward pressure on the price of Ethereum. While ETF flows are not the only price determinant, they represent a substantial demand side factor. Investor Sentiment: These outflows could reflect a shift in short-term investor sentiment towards Ethereum. Monitoring these flows in the coming days and weeks will be crucial to gauge whether this is a temporary blip or a more persistent trend. Market Correction or Consolidation: Outflows could be part of a broader market correction or consolidation phase. After periods of rapid growth, markets often experience pullbacks as they seek a new equilibrium. Opportunity for Accumulation: Conversely, for long-term investors, periods of outflows and potential price dips could present opportunities to accumulate Ethereum at potentially more favorable prices. Navigating Ethereum ETF Investments: Actionable Insights For investors navigating the Ethereum ETF landscape, here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on ETF flow data from reputable sources like Farside Investors and monitor market news for any developments that could influence investor sentiment. Diversification: Diversification remains key. Avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Consider a diversified crypto portfolio and asset allocation strategy. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that cryptocurrency investments, including Ethereum ETFs, are generally considered long-term plays. Short-term fluctuations are inherent in the market. Focus on the long-term potential and your investment goals. Due Diligence: Before investing in any ETF, understand its structure, fees, and underlying holdings. Compare different ETF offerings to find one that aligns with your investment strategy. In conclusion, the recent $78 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on February 24th is a noteworthy development. While it marks the third consecutive day of outflows and warrants attention, it’s crucial to interpret this data within the broader market context. Whether this is a temporary dip or the start of a trend remains to be seen. Investors should stay informed, maintain a balanced perspective, and focus on their long-term investment strategies in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.

In 2028, XLM will range between $1.26 and $1.44, with an average price of $1.35. The token could reach as high as $2.34 in 2031. Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized cryptocurrency and payment protocol launched in July 2014 by Jed McCaleb and Joyce Kim. Developed by the non-profit Stellar Development Foundation, it aims to facilitate fast, low-cost cross-border transactions. Stellar operates on its blockchain, using the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) to validate transactions, which enhances security and efficiency. One of Stellar’s key features is its ability to enable currency exchange between different fiat and digital assets. The network charges a minimal transaction fee of 0.00001 XLM, making it an attractive option for users seeking affordable transaction solutions. Stellar is particularly focused on financial inclusion, targeting unbanked populations in developing regions by providing access to essential financial services. XLM, the native cryptocurrency of the Stellar network, is used for transaction fees and as a bridge currency in cross-asset transactions. Initially, there were 100 billion XLM, but in 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation burned approximately half of the total supply to enhance its value and utility. Today, around 30.6 billion XLM are in circulation, with the network gaining traction for its real-world applications in remittances and asset transfers. Is XLM a good investment? Will it go up?

According to more recent reports, the OPM will use AI to assess the employees’ responses. According to NBC News , Elon Musk’s DOGE is using AI to determine the usefulness of federal workers based on their weekly tasks. The responses will be fed into a large language model (LLM), an advanced AI system capable of understanding large textual data. Prior to sending the emails, Musk posted on X, “All federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they did last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.” Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump ’s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week. Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 22, 2025 The email asked employees to explain what they “accomplished last week” in 5 bullet points. It also mentioned not to “send any classified information, links, or attachments.” The email itself did not contain a warning of termination or resignation, but a deadline was set for Monday at 11:59 PM EST.

At a Monday event hosted by the advocacy group, ‘Americans for Prosperity,’ Mike Johnson said, “Elon has cracked the code. He is now inside the agencies. He’s created these algorithms that are constantly crawling through the data. And as he told me in his office, the data doesn’t lie. We’re going to be able to get the information. We’re going to be able to transform the way the federal government works at the end of this, and that is a very exciting prospect.” Speaker Mike Johnson talking about Musk’s efforts at an event on Monday.

Plaintiffs have argued in several lawsuits that DOGE is overlooking the laws and rules about data and privacy. OPM says a response is voluntary, but Musk stays adamant about termination On Monday, the Justice Department sent an email to its workforce to clarify the confusion surrounding terminations and resignations. It stated that during the meeting with the interagency Chief Human Capital Officers Council, OPM clarified that ignoring the email would not lead to automatic resignation despite Elon Musk’s warning on X. In another X post on Monday, Musk said that “so many failed even that inane test,” showing “incompetence and contempt for how your taxes are being spent,” even if the requirement was only to “type some words and press send.” In yet another post, he added, “Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance.” He again warned about termination in the case of no response.

Failure to respond a second time will result in termination. https://t.co/04xzgScXfj — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 25, 2025 Musk has faced backlash from workers, agencies, and unions over his threats of termination. Despite the backlash, in a Monday meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, President Donald Trump said “it was great” and appreciated Musk’s threat as a genius move.

Lawyer, Norm Eisen, shared a statement on behalf of the plaintiffs. He said, “The mass firings ordered by OPM are illegal and betray the trust of countless federal employees.” He called the recent email a “patronizing demand,” and he said that fed employees asked to justify themselves “by enumerating five accomplishments just adds insult to injury.” Eisen said that is against the law. Trump-supporting agencies have told their employees to ignore the email Musk intends to execute Trump’s directions to reduce the federal workforce by 10%. Some agencies headed by Trump’s supporters asked their employees to ignore the email. NBC reported that Justice Department employees were told on Monday that they don’t need to respond to the email given the “sensitive nature of the Department’s work.” For those who have already written back, “no further action is needed,” said Jolene Ann Lauria, Assistant Attorney General for Administration. Kash Patel , the FBI director, also told the employees to “pause any responses” to the email. He said the Federal Bureau would review the employees’ work independently. Moreover, the exact instructions for ignoring the email were shared with the employees of the State Department, the National Institutes of Health, the Defense Department, the National Security Agency, and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Kash Patel’s message to FBI personnel The employees of The Department of Agriculture also received an unsigned email stating the response is “voluntary and not required.” Northern District Illinois’s spokesperson shared that the court’s chief judge told employees, “We are judiciary employees, and our policies and procedures are governed by the Judicial Conference of the United States and our local court HR handbooks.” South District of New York’s workers were also told not to respond to the email. Some agencies are responding to the email with caution The Environmental Protection Agency shared samples for a response “as empathy for their staff,” according to an employee of the agency. While the Health and Human Services Department initially told its employees to respond to the email by the deadline, it later informed its employees about OPM’s new guidance and warned that the information they share would be “read by malign foreign actors.” The Department of Transportation allowed the employees to send their responses to the OPM email with five bullet points without any classified information.

The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has experienced a sharp decline, briefly dipping over 5% to $2,375 on February 25th. This dramatic price action isn’t just another blip on the radar; it’s a potential precursor to a significant bearish phase, as ETH edges closer to forming a dreaded “death cross”. Let’s delve into what this technical indicator means for Ethereum and the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the Ethereum Death Cross: A Bearish Omen? The term “death cross” might sound ominous, and in the world of technical analysis, it often is. It’s a chart pattern that occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average. In this case, we’re focusing on Ethereum’s 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and its 200-day SMA. Here’s a breakdown of why a death cross is considered a bearish signal: Trend Reversal Indicator: The death cross is typically interpreted as a sign that a bullish trend is reversing into a bearish one. It suggests that short-term momentum is weakening relative to the long-term trend. Psychological Impact: Beyond the technicals, the death cross can have a psychological impact on the market. It can trigger fear and uncertainty among investors, potentially leading to further selling pressure. Confirmation of Downtrend: While not always foolproof, a death cross is often seen as a confirmation that a downtrend is gaining strength. Traders and analysts watch for this pattern to make informed decisions about market direction. Currently, Ethereum’s 50-day SMA is rapidly approaching a crossover below the 200-day SMA. If this crossover materializes, it would officially confirm a death cross for ETH, potentially signaling a period of sustained bearish momentum. Is this a definitive sign of doom for Ethereum? Not necessarily, but it’s a crucial indicator that demands attention. Ethereum Price Analysis: Why the Sudden Drop to $2,375? The recent dip in Ethereum’s price to $2,375 can be attributed to a mix of factors influencing the broader crypto market. While pinpointing a single cause is difficult, several contributing elements are likely at play: Profit-Taking: After a period of gains in the crypto market earlier in the year, some investors might be taking profits, leading to selling pressure on assets like Ethereum. Market Sentiment Shift: Overall market sentiment can fluctuate rapidly. News events, regulatory concerns, or macroeconomic factors can quickly shift investor sentiment from bullish to bearish, impacting Ethereum’s price. Technical Correction: From a technical perspective, price corrections are a natural part of market cycles. Ethereum might be undergoing a necessary correction after a period of upward movement. Broader Crypto Market Weakness: Ethereum doesn’t exist in isolation. Weakness in Bitcoin or negative news impacting the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem can drag down ETH prices as well. Crypto Market Sentiment: Beyond Ethereum – A Sea of Red? Ethereum isn’t the only cryptocurrency experiencing downward pressure. The report highlights that several other major tokens are also trading below their 200-day SMAs. Let’s examine the broader crypto market sentiment and see which tokens are mirroring Ethereum’s bearish signals and which are bucking the trend. Tokens Below 200-day SMA (Bearish Signals): BNB: The token of the Binance ecosystem is facing similar headwinds, indicating potential weakness in the exchange token sector. SOL: Solana, a popular Layer-1 blockchain, is also under pressure, suggesting that the bearish sentiment extends beyond Ethereum to other smart contract platforms. DOGE: Dogecoin, the original meme coin, reflects the broader negative sentiment impacting even the more speculative corners of the crypto market. LINK: Chainlink, a key oracle network, also trading below its 200-day SMA, indicates that even fundamentally strong projects are not immune to the current market pressure. Tokens Above 200-day SMA (Relative Strength): BTC: Bitcoin, the market leader, is holding above its 200-day SMA, showcasing relative strength compared to Ethereum and many altcoins. XRP: XRP, often known for its independent price action, is also maintaining levels above this key moving average. TRON: TRON, a blockchain platform focused on entertainment, shows resilience by staying above the 200-day SMA. ADA: Cardano, another prominent smart contract platform, demonstrates underlying strength by trading above its 200-day SMA. XLM: Stellar Lumens, focused on payments, is also positioned above its 200-day SMA, suggesting pockets of strength in the market. This divergence in performance highlights a nuanced crypto market sentiment. While Ethereum and several altcoins are exhibiting bearish signals, Bitcoin and select others are showing resilience. This could indicate a rotation of capital or varying degrees of vulnerability to the current market pressures. Navigating Bearish Momentum in Ethereum: What’s Next for ETH Holders? The approaching death cross and recent price drop raise crucial questions for Ethereum holders. What should be the next steps? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on Ethereum’s price action and technical indicators. Monitor if the death cross materializes and how ETH reacts to it. Risk Management: Assess your risk tolerance and portfolio allocation. Consider adjusting your positions if you are uncomfortable with increased market volatility and potential further downside. Diversification: If your portfolio is heavily weighted in Ethereum, consider diversification into other cryptocurrencies or asset classes to mitigate risk. Fundamental Analysis: Beyond technicals, keep an eye on fundamental developments in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as network upgrades, adoption rates, and developer activity. Strong fundamentals can provide long-term support even during bearish phases. Avoid Panic Selling: Market corrections are a normal part of the crypto cycle. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term price fluctuations. Base your strategy on careful analysis and your long-term investment goals. Table: Crypto Performance Relative to 200-day SMA Cryptocurrency Above/Below 200-day SMA Sentiment Indicator Ethereum (ETH) Approaching Below Bearish BNB Below Bearish SOL Below Bearish DOGE Below Bearish LINK Below Bearish Bitcoin (BTC) Above Neutral to Bullish XRP Above Neutral to Bullish TRON Above Neutral to Bullish ADA Above Neutral to Bullish XLM Above Neutral to Bullish Conclusion: Is This the Start of a Deeper Downturn for Ethereum? Ethereum’s approach to a death cross is undoubtedly a significant development that warrants careful observation. While it doesn’t guarantee a prolonged bear market, it serves as a warning sign of potential increased bearish momentum. The divergence in performance across different cryptocurrencies suggests a complex market environment where selectivity and risk management are paramount. For Ethereum holders, staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a long-term perspective will be key to navigating these potentially turbulent waters. The crypto market is ever-evolving, and while technical indicators like the death cross provide valuable insights, they should be considered alongside fundamental analysis and broader market dynamics.

Table of Contents Why institutional investors are moving to Ethereum ETFs Lightchain AI: The altcoin gaining serious attention Is Lightchain AI the next big altcoin? As institutional investors adjust their portfolios, Bitcoin ETFs are becoming less appealing, while Ethereum ETFs are gaining significant traction. This shift signals a change in market sentiment, with Ethereum’s upgrades, scalability improvements, and real-world utility leading the charge. However, there’s another altcoin gaining attention — Lightchain AI. With its presale raising over $16.8 million, Lightchain AI is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about altcoins, drawing institutional interest for its solid fundamentals and potential for mass adoption in 2025 and beyond. Why institutional investors are moving to Ethereum ETFs Institutional investors are increasingly favoring Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) as a way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market. These ETFs provide a regulated investment vehicle that minimizes the complexities of direct cryptocurrency ownership. Through Ethereum ETFs , institutions can track Ethereum’s price movements without the need for managing digital wallets or dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs had a significant impact on Bitcoin’s price, propelling it to new all-time highs. Now, the focus is shifting to Ethereum. According to crypto analytics firm Kaiko, Ethereum’s price is expected to be “sensitive” to the inflows generated by the newly approved ETFs. The introduction of staking features in Ethereum ETFs is expected to further drive institutional interest. The potential for additional returns through staking is making these financial products even more attractive. Ongoing discussions with entities like Jito Labs and MultiCoin Capital regarding ETF staking reflect this growing trend.

Lightchain AI: The altcoin gaining serious attention As Ethereum ETFs dominate the conversation, Lightchain AI is quietly but steadily gaining traction with institutional investors and whales searching for high-growth altcoins with real-world applications. Lightchain AI offers blockchain solutions that extend beyond cryptocurrency, making it an appealing option for institutions seeking utility-driven investments. What sets Lightchain AI apart is its deflationary tokenomics model. A portion of transaction fees and payments for AI services are burned, reducing the total token supply and potentially driving long-term value through scarcity. By addressing real-world business needs across a range of industries, Lightchain AI is emerging as a promising option for investors looking for sustainable growth and practical blockchain applications. Is Lightchain AI the next big altcoin? As institutional investors shift from Bitcoin ETFs to Ethereum ETFs, Lightchain AI is quickly rising as one of the most promising altcoins of 2025. With its unique tokenomics, real-world utility, and early institutional support, Lightchain AI has the potential to reshape the blockchain landscape and gain widespread adoption. While there are no guarantees in the unpredictable cryptocurrency market, Lightchain AI’s strong fundamentals and increasing buzz make it an altcoin to watch in the coming years.

The MicroStrategy saga, a cornerstone of Bitcoin institutional adoption, just took an interesting turn. Remember when MicroStrategy’s stock was trading at a massive premium because of its Bitcoin holdings? Well, that premium has shrunk significantly, and crypto analyst Miles Deutscher is shedding light on what this could mean. Let’s dive into the details of this developing story and explore the potential ripple effects across the crypto market. Decoding the Bitcoin NAV Premium: What’s the Buzz About? First things first, let’s break down this term ‘ Bitcoin NAV Premium ‘. NAV stands for Net Asset Value. In MicroStrategy’s case, their primary asset, besides their actual business, is a massive hoard of Bitcoin. The NAV premium is essentially the ratio of MicroStrategy’s market capitalization (the total value of its outstanding shares) to the actual value of the Bitcoin they hold. Think of it like this: if MicroStrategy only held Bitcoin and nothing else, and the market valued the company exactly at the value of its Bitcoin, the NAV premium would be 1. However, for a long time, MicroStrategy traded at a premium *above* the value of its Bitcoin. This premium reflected several factors: Investor Sentiment: Many investors viewed MicroStrategy as a publicly traded proxy for Bitcoin exposure, especially before the advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. For those unable or unwilling to hold Bitcoin directly, MicroStrategy stock offered a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements within a traditional stock market framework. Michael Saylor Effect: The strong pro-Bitcoin stance and aggressive acquisition strategy of MicroStrategy’s former CEO, Michael Saylor, cultivated a loyal investor base who believed in his vision and Bitcoin’s long-term potential. This ‘Saylor premium’ contributed to the elevated stock price. Scarcity and Demand: For a period, publicly listed companies holding significant Bitcoin were relatively rare. This scarcity, coupled with investor demand for Bitcoin exposure, further inflated MicroStrategy’s premium. In essence, the Bitcoin NAV Premium was a measure of how much extra investors were willing to pay for MicroStrategy shares beyond the intrinsic value of their Bitcoin holdings. A high premium signaled strong bullish sentiment and demand for indirect Bitcoin exposure. The Plummeting Premium: From a Hefty 3.4 to a Modest 1.6 Now, here’s the crucial development. According to crypto analyst Miles Deutscher, as highlighted on X, MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin NAV Premium has experienced a significant decline. It has shrunk from a peak of 3.4 in November 2024 to approximately 1.6. That’s a dramatic decrease! To put it in perspective: Metric November 2024 Current (as per Deutscher’s report) Bitcoin NAV Premium 3.4 1.6 This sharp drop indicates a substantial shift in market perception and potentially investor appetite for MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin proxy. The ‘extra’ value investors were assigning to MicroStrategy beyond its Bitcoin holdings has significantly diminished. Crypto Analyst Miles Deutscher’s Insight: Decoding the Implications So, why does this matter, and what are the potential consequences? Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher offers a key insight: a lower Bitcoin NAV Premium could make it more challenging for MicroStrategy to raise capital for future BTC acquisitions . Let’s unpack this: Capital Raising Mechanism: MicroStrategy has historically funded its aggressive BTC acquisitions through various methods, including issuing debt and selling equity (stock). A significant part of the attractiveness of issuing equity was the high NAV premium. Dilution and Premium: When a company issues new shares, it dilutes existing shareholders’ ownership. However, if the company’s stock trades at a substantial premium, it can issue fewer shares to raise the same amount of capital. A high premium effectively made it cheaper for MicroStrategy to raise funds. Lower Premium, Higher Cost of Capital: With a reduced Bitcoin NAV Premium , MicroStrategy would need to issue more shares to raise the same amount of capital. This increases dilution for existing shareholders and makes capital raising less efficient and potentially less appealing. In essence, the shrinking premium could constrain MicroStrategy’s ability to continue its rapid accumulation of Bitcoin at the same pace as before. It raises questions about their future BTC acquisitions strategy and financial maneuvering. BTC Acquisitions and MicroStrategy’s Future: What’s Next? Does this mean MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying spree is over? Not necessarily, but it might need to adapt its approach. Here are some potential scenarios and considerations regarding future BTC acquisitions : Challenges: Reduced Capital Raising Power: As discussed, a lower premium makes equity-based capital raises less attractive and more dilutive. MicroStrategy might need to explore alternative funding sources or accept a slower pace of Bitcoin accumulation. Market Sentiment Shift: The premium drop could reflect a broader shift in market sentiment towards Bitcoin proxies, especially with the availability of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Investors now have more direct and potentially lower-cost avenues for Bitcoin exposure. Increased Scrutiny: A shrinking premium might lead to increased scrutiny from investors and analysts regarding MicroStrategy’s business model and reliance on Bitcoin price appreciation. Potential Adaptations and Opportunities: Focus on Operational Profitability: MicroStrategy could emphasize its core software business and demonstrate profitability beyond just Bitcoin holdings. This could make the company more attractive to a broader range of investors, even with a lower NAV premium. Alternative Funding: Explore debt financing, strategic partnerships, or other creative financial instruments to fund future BTC acquisitions , reducing reliance on equity issuance at potentially lower premiums. Long-Term Bitcoin Strategy: Reiterate and reinforce its long-term commitment to Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Emphasize the potential for future premium expansion as Bitcoin adoption grows and matures. Spot Bitcoin ETF Competition: While ETFs offer direct Bitcoin exposure, MicroStrategy still offers a unique publicly traded equity with significant Bitcoin holdings and a distinct corporate strategy. They might need to differentiate their value proposition in the ETF era. Is This a Cause for Alarm or a Market Correction? The decrease in MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin NAV Premium is undoubtedly a significant development. Whether it’s a cause for alarm or a healthy market correction is a matter of perspective and future developments. Here’s a balanced view: Potential Concerns: Reduced Buying Power: If the lower premium persists, it could genuinely limit MicroStrategy’s capacity for future aggressive Bitcoin purchases, which some viewed as a positive catalyst for Bitcoin adoption. Shifting Narrative: The narrative around MicroStrategy as *the* premier publicly traded Bitcoin proxy might weaken, potentially impacting investor sentiment and stock performance. Potential Positives and Perspective: Normalization of Valuation: A premium of 3.4 might have been considered unsustainably high. A drop to 1.6 could represent a more rational and sustainable valuation, aligning MicroStrategy’s stock price more closely with its underlying Bitcoin assets. Focus on Fundamentals: A lower premium might force MicroStrategy to focus more on its core business fundamentals and less on solely relying on Bitcoin price appreciation to drive stock value. This could be a positive long-term development. Market Evolution: The emergence of spot Bitcoin ETFs has fundamentally changed the landscape for Bitcoin investment. The reduced premium could simply reflect the market adapting to these new realities and more efficient avenues for Bitcoin exposure. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating the Evolving MicroStrategy and Bitcoin Landscape MicroStrategy’s shrinking Bitcoin NAV Premium is a compelling case study in the evolving dynamics of the crypto market and the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets. While it presents potential challenges for their aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, it also opens doors for strategic adaptation and a potentially more sustainable long-term business model. The insights from crypto analyst Miles Deutscher highlight the importance of understanding these nuanced market signals. As the crypto landscape matures and diversifies, companies like MicroStrategy will need to navigate these shifts strategically to maintain their position and continue to contribute to the broader Bitcoin ecosystem.

Bgin faces significant risks, including market price volatility, supplier concentration, and ongoing legal disputes over equipment seizures and contract breaches. The company's financials show sharply growing topline revenue, uneven gross profit, and high cash usage, with negative free cash flow of ($123.8 million) for the past year. The market opportunity is large but competitive, and Bgin's reliance on alternative cryptocurrencies with volatile crypto prices adds substantial risk to its operations. Bgin Is Growing Quickly In A Volatile Industry Bgin Blockchain Ltd ( BGIN ) has filed to raise $50 million in an IPO of its Class A ordinary shares, according to an SEC F-1 registration statement . Bgin provides cryptocurrency mining and related technologies and services. The company is growing rapidly, but has a significant risk profile across various aspects of its operations, including market price risk for the cryptocurrencies it mines and sells mining machines for. I’ll provide an update when we learn more about the IPO from management. What Does Bgin Do? Singapore-based Bgin Blockchain Limited was founded to design and sell mining machines as well as operate machines for in-house mining and mining pool purposes. Management is headed by co-founder and CEO Mr. Qingfeng Wu, who has been with the firm since 2018 and was previously manager of radio-frequency, hardware, and R&D at Comba Telecom System (Guangzhou). Bgin is focused on alternative cryptocurrency mining opportunities with the KAS, ALPH, NIM, and RXD coins, but has mined other coins. The company's subsidiaries owned 48,277 mining machines as of the date of the initial prospectus, of which 33,862 are in operation and 12,003 are stored in facilities in either Hong Kong or the US. The company sells its designed machines through its website and also provides various miner hosting services, mining pool services, and related operation and management services to customers. Bgin currently operates around 4,020 machines on behalf of its customers. All machines are hosted at locations in the United States. The company has supplier concentration risk, with three suppliers accounting for approximately 27% of its purchases in the six months ended June 30, 2024. Bgin has disclosed various related party transactions, more fully detailed here . The majority of Bgin’s revenue comes from the sales of machines (66%), with mining revenue accounting for about 8% in the most recent half-year reporting period. Market Overview For Bgin According to a 2022 market research report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market produced more than $3.3 billion in revenue in 2021 and is expected to reach $5.2 billion by 2030. This represents a forecast CAGR of 9.3% from 2022 to 2030. The primary reasons for this expected growth are continued growth in demand for mining equipment and related services as cryptocurrencies proliferate globally. Various competitive or other industry participants include the following: MARA Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ). Bitmain. Dragonball. Goldshell. Others. Also, the ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) market commanded the highest market share in 2021 and is expected to continue to dominate the industry in terms of demand. The breakdown of the crypto mining hardware market by region is shown here: Grand View Research I’ve prepared a thumbnail SWOT analysis for Bgin: Strengths Leading miner brand in the KAS crypto system, focusing on alternative cryptocurrencies.

The company has generated free cash flow for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, of negative ($123.8 million). IPO Details For Bgin Bgin intends to raise $50 million in gross proceeds from an IPO of its Class A ordinary shares, although the final amount may differ. No existing shareholders have shown a desire to acquire additional shares of the IPO. With a completed IPO, the firm’s market capitalization may be above $500 million. The company or any shareholders with greater than 1% of shares will adhere to a 180-day issuance or sale lock-up period from the effective date of the prospectus. Management disclosed it intends to apply the net proceeds from the IPO as follows: approximately 60.0%, [...] for the purchase and/or construction of mining farms, even though the Company has not entered into any definitive agreements or letters of intent in connection with such purchase or construction; approximately 32.0%, [...] for developing proprietary chips to be used in cryptocurrency mining machines; and approximately 8.0%, [...] for general corporate purposes. (Source - SEC.) The company's online roadshow is not available. Regarding outstanding legal proceedings, the company is subject to various investigations, redeliveries, and equipment seizures related to the alleged non-compliant shipment of various of its IceRiver machines to the US in the amount of approximately $14.4 million. The actions are ongoing and management said it is ""unable to estimate the investigation's timeline or the potential penalties or fines that we may be subject to as a result."" Also, the firm is subject to actions from a hosting service provider in the US, which has seized 5,325 mining machines owned by the company's US subsidiary and has sent a demand letter for an outstanding balance of approximately $28.6 million: ""Both companies have threatened legal action against the other for alleged breaches of contract, among other potential claims. BGIN Infrastructure US and the Provider are in settlement discussions. The Provider has represented to BGIN Infrastructure US that the mining machines are not operational and will not be returned until the dispute is resolved. There is no assurance that settlement discussions will be successful."" The listed bookrunners of the IPO are Chardan and The Benchmark Company. Bgin Is Growing Quickly In A Volatile Industry BGIN is seeking US public capital market investment to fund its hardware development and mining farm expansion plans. The company’s financials have shown quickly growing topline revenue as it has placed mining computers into service, variable gross profit and gross margin, uneven but impressive operating profit and high cash used in operations. Free cash flow for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, was negative ($123.8 million). The firm currently intends to pay dividends based on the discretion of the Board of Directors, available funds and the laws of the Cayman Islands. BGIN’s recent capital spending results show it has spent heavily on capital expenditures as it has ramped up the production of mining machines. The market opportunity for providing hardware and related mining services in the alternative cryptocurrency mining industry is moderately large but subject to intense competition from major firms such as Marathon. The company will have risks as a public entity, including its ""foreign private issuer"" and ""emerging growth company"" status, which allow management to produce substantially less information for shareholders. Many of these company stocks have performed poorly post-IPO and have been characterized by little communication from management to shareholders. BGIN holds a large amount of dollar stablecoin Tether USD ( USDT-USD ) on its balance sheet, and small amounts of the cryptos it mines, but no Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ). Management has not indicated if it plans to pursue a ""Bitcoin Treasury"" model similar to that of Strategy’s ( MSTR ), so it appears it is focused primarily on the pure mining model. Volatility remains a significant issue in the cryptocurrency world. The chart below shows the Kaspa ( KAS-USD ) coin's most recent one-month price drop of nearly 32%: Seeking Alpha This level of price volatility can hurt machine sales and revenue very quickly. While BGIN pursues other proof-of-work coins to mine in an attempt to spread out risk, frequency these alternative coins move in tandem as their market rallies or sells off. When we learn management’s pricing and valuation expectations, I’ll provide a final opinion.

40827801,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133903,1740506748,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Shocking Crypto Theft Unveiled: Bybit Exploiter Bridges 70,000 ETH to Bitcoin via THORChain",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bybit-exploiter-thorchain-bridge/,"In a startling turn of events in the crypto world, a significant movement of funds has caught the attention of blockchain security analysts. MistTrack, the renowned crypto tracking platform from cybersecurity experts SlowMist, has reported that the individual or group responsible for the Bybit Exchange exploit has successfully transferred a staggering 70,000 Ethereum (ETH) into the Bitcoin (BTC) network. This sophisticated maneuver was executed using THORChain, a decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol. Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing crypto heist and understand the implications for the digital asset landscape. Unpacking the Bybit Exploiter’s Trail: From ETH to BTC The initial exploit on Bybit Exchange sent ripples through the crypto community, raising concerns about exchange security and the ever-present threat of illicit activities. Now, the movement of the stolen funds further complicates the situation. MistTrack’s findings reveal that the Bybit Exploiter isn’t simply holding onto the pilfered Ethereum. Instead, they are actively seeking to obfuscate the funds’ origin and potentially cash out by bridging them to the Bitcoin network. This cross-chain transaction highlights the increasing sophistication of crypto criminals and their ability to leverage decentralized tools to their advantage. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: The Source: Funds originated from the Bybit Exchange exploit. The Amount: A massive 70,000 ETH has been moved. The Destination: Bitcoin Network. The Tool: THORChain Bridge was utilized for the cross-chain transfer. The Tracker: MistTrack, by SlowMist, is monitoring the fund movements. Why THORChain? Understanding the Bridge of Choice THORChain stands out as a decentralized cross-chain bridge, enabling the seamless exchange of assets between different blockchains without relying on intermediaries. For someone looking to move large amounts of cryptocurrency across chains discreetly, THORChain presents a compelling option. But why exactly is THORChain Bridge so appealing in this context? Advantages of using THORChain for the Bybit Exploiter: Decentralization: As a decentralized protocol, THORChain reduces reliance on centralized exchanges, making it harder to track and freeze transactions compared to traditional methods. Liquidity: THORChain boasts significant liquidity pools, allowing for large swaps of assets like ETH to BTC without causing massive slippage. Privacy: While not entirely anonymous, decentralized exchanges and bridges can offer a degree of privacy that centralized platforms often lack. Speed: Cross-chain swaps on THORChain are generally fast, allowing for quick movement of funds. Ethereum to Bitcoin: A Classic Crypto Crossover The move from Ethereum to Bitcoin is a significant one. While both are leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is often perceived as having stronger pseudonymity and being more challenging to trace than Ethereum. Converting ETH to BTC could be a strategic step by the exploiter to further distance themselves from the stolen funds and potentially complicate recovery efforts. This action underscores a few key aspects of the crypto landscape: Fungibility Concerns: The transfer raises questions about the fungibility of cryptocurrencies. Will exchanges and services treat ‘tainted’ Bitcoin differently? Regulatory Scrutiny: Such large-scale movements of illicit funds will undoubtedly attract increased regulatory attention to cross-chain bridges and DeFi protocols. Technological Challenges: Tracking funds across different blockchains presents significant technical hurdles for law enforcement and blockchain analysis firms. Crypto Security Under the Spotlight: Lessons from the Bybit Exploit This incident serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing challenges in Crypto Security . Despite advancements in blockchain technology and security protocols, exploits and thefts continue to occur. What can we learn from this situation, and what steps can be taken to bolster security in the future? Key takeaways for enhanced Crypto Security: Robust Exchange Security Measures: Exchanges must continuously upgrade their security infrastructure, including multi-signature wallets, cold storage solutions, and rigorous penetration testing. Proactive Monitoring and Threat Detection: Implementing sophisticated monitoring systems to detect unusual transaction patterns and potential exploits in real-time is crucial. Cross-Chain Tracking and Collaboration: Improved tools and collaboration between blockchain analysis firms, exchanges, and law enforcement are necessary to track illicit funds across different blockchains. User Education: Educating users about security best practices, such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and being wary of phishing attacks, is vital for overall ecosystem security. Protocol-Level Security Audits: DeFi protocols, especially bridges, should undergo regular and thorough security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities. Blockchain Theft: A Persistent Threat in the Digital Age Blockchain Theft remains a persistent threat in the cryptocurrency space. While blockchain technology offers transparency, it also presents unique challenges for law enforcement when dealing with illicit activities. The Bybit exploit and the subsequent movement of funds highlight the need for a multi-faceted approach to combat crypto crime. Strategies to Combat Blockchain Theft: Strategy Description Benefits Enhanced Regulation Clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies and exchanges. Increased accountability and legal recourse. Advanced Analytics Development of sophisticated blockchain analysis tools. Improved tracking and identification of illicit transactions. International Cooperation Collaboration between law enforcement agencies across borders. Effective pursuit of criminals operating globally. Technological Innovation Exploring new technologies like zero-knowledge proofs and privacy-enhancing tools. Balancing privacy with security and compliance. The case of the Bybit exploiter bridging 70,000 ETH to BTC via THORChain is a compelling example of the cat-and-mouse game between crypto criminals and security professionals. It underscores the dynamic nature of the crypto landscape and the constant need for vigilance, innovation, and collaboration to safeguard the integrity of the digital asset ecosystem.

The ever-volatile world of cryptocurrency has delivered another jolt. Bitcoin (BTC), the king of crypto, has experienced a significant shift in its global standing. For a long time, Bitcoin has been flexing its muscles among the titans of traditional finance. But recent data reveals a surprising turn of events in the crypto market . Bitcoin’s Market Cap Ranking: A Shocking Descent According to the latest data from Infinite Market Cap, Bitcoin’s market cap ranking has slipped from a respectable 7th position all the way down to 10th. This means BTC is now positioned below some heavyweight contenders in the global financial arena. Let’s break down who has overtaken the digital gold: Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI): This broad market ETF represents a vast portfolio of US stocks, showcasing the sheer scale of traditional equity markets. Silver (XAG): A precious metal with both industrial and investment demand, silver’s resurgence highlights the enduring appeal of tangible assets. Saudi Aramco (2222.SR): The oil behemoth, a symbol of traditional energy dominance, reminds us of the established powerhouses in the global economy. To put this into perspective, Bitcoin’s current market capitalization stands at approximately $1.75 trillion. While this is still a monumental figure, it represents a 7.58% decrease in the last 24 hours alone. This dip raises some crucial questions: What’s driving this change? And what does it mean for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market ? Why is Bitcoin’s Global Asset Ranking Slipping? Several factors could be contributing to Bitcoin’s recent ranking adjustment. Let’s explore some potential reasons: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its rollercoaster nature. Bitcoin, despite its maturity, is not immune to significant price swings. Recent market corrections and profit-taking could be impacting its market cap. Traditional Asset Performance: While Bitcoin has faced headwinds, traditional assets like equities (represented by ETFs like VTI) and precious metals like silver might be experiencing renewed investor interest or stability, boosting their relative rankings. Broader Economic Factors: Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation concerns, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical uncertainties, can influence investor sentiment and asset allocation decisions, potentially favoring or disfavoring different asset classes. ETF Competition: The emergence and growing popularity of Bitcoin ETFs, while generally positive for Bitcoin adoption, could also be subtly influencing its directly held market cap as some investment might shift towards these regulated products. It’s important to remember that market cap rankings are dynamic and fluctuate based on various factors. A short-term dip doesn’t necessarily indicate a fundamental shift in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects, but it’s definitely a noteworthy event to analyze. The Significance of Market Cap in Global Assets Market cap , or market capitalization, is a crucial metric for understanding the size and relative importance of an asset. It’s calculated by multiplying the total number of outstanding shares or coins by the current market price. In the context of global assets , market cap rankings provide a snapshot of how different asset classes stack up against each other in terms of total value. Why is this important? Here’s a quick rundown: Investor Perception: Market cap rankings often influence investor perception and sentiment. A higher ranking can attract more institutional and retail investment , while a lower ranking might raise concerns. Benchmarking: These rankings serve as benchmarks for comparing the growth and performance of different asset classes over time. Market Dominance: Tracking market cap helps understand the evolving landscape of global assets and identify which sectors or assets are gaining or losing dominance. Portfolio Allocation: Institutional investors and fund managers often use market cap data to inform their portfolio allocation strategies. While Bitcoin’s drop to 10th might seem concerning at first glance, it’s crucial to maintain perspective. The cryptocurrency market is still relatively young compared to traditional asset classes. Volatility and ranking fluctuations are part of its inherent nature. Bitcoin’s Journey: A Look at the Ranking History To truly understand the significance of this shift, let’s take a brief look at Bitcoin’s journey in global asset ranking . Bitcoin’s ascent has been nothing short of remarkable. From its humble beginnings as a niche digital currency, it has steadily climbed the ranks to become a recognized global asset . Here’s a simplified historical perspective: Era Bitcoin’s Ranking (Approximate) Key Characteristics Early Years (2009-2016) Outside Top 100 (or not tracked) Emerging technology, limited adoption, high volatility Breakout Phase (2017-2020) Top 50 – Top 20 Increased mainstream awareness, institutional interest, significant price surges Peak Ranking (2021-2022) Top 10 – Top 7 Widespread adoption, institutional investment , all-time high prices Current Phase (2023-Present) Around Top 10 Market correction, regulatory scrutiny, continued volatility, ongoing adoption As you can see, Bitcoin’s current 10th position is still a testament to its incredible growth over the past decade. The journey hasn’t been a straight line upwards, and temporary dips are expected in such a dynamic and evolving market. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Investors? For Bitcoin investors, this news might trigger a range of emotions, from concern to indifference. Here are a few actionable insights to consider: Don’t Panic Sell: Short-term market fluctuations are common. Reacting impulsively to ranking changes is often not a sound investment strategy. Zoom Out: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin. Has the underlying technology changed? Is adoption still growing? Are the long-term use cases still valid? Diversify (If Necessary): If you’re heavily concentrated in Bitcoin, consider whether a more diversified portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic trends that could impact the crypto market and Bitcoin specifically. Reassess Your Strategy: Use this as an opportunity to review your investment thesis for Bitcoin. Does it still hold true? Are there any adjustments needed? Ultimately, Bitcoin’s ranking is just one data point in a complex and ever-changing landscape. Smart investors focus on the bigger picture and make informed decisions based on thorough research and a long-term perspective. The Future Outlook: Will Bitcoin Reclaim Higher Ground? The question on everyone’s mind is: Will Bitcoin regain its higher global asset ranking ? The answer, as with most things in the crypto world, is uncertain. However, several factors suggest that Bitcoin remains a force to be reckoned with: Continued Adoption: Institutional adoption of Bitcoin is still growing, albeit at a potentially slower pace. As more institutions allocate capital to crypto, Bitcoin stands to benefit. Technological Developments: Ongoing development on the Bitcoin network, such as the Lightning Network and Taproot upgrades, aims to improve scalability and functionality, potentially enhancing its long-term value proposition. Store of Value Narrative: Bitcoin’s narrative as a store of value, particularly in times of economic uncertainty, remains compelling to many investors. Scarcity: Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins is a fundamental characteristic that differentiates it from fiat currencies and could become increasingly significant over time. While the crypto market is inherently unpredictable, Bitcoin’s history demonstrates resilience and a capacity for reinvention. Whether it will climb back to its previous ranking remains to be seen, but its position as a leading digital asset is unlikely to be easily challenged. Conclusion: Navigating the Dynamic World of Crypto Rankings Bitcoin’s slip to 10th in global asset ranking is a noteworthy event that underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. While it may raise eyebrows and spark discussions, it’s crucial to analyze this development within the broader context of market volatility, evolving investor sentiment, and the long-term potential of Bitcoin. The crypto market is constantly shifting, and rankings are just snapshots in time. For informed investors, this news serves as a reminder to stay vigilant, adapt to market changes, and focus on the fundamental principles that underpin their investment decisions. The journey of Bitcoin, and the entire crypto space, is far from over, and there will undoubtedly be more twists and turns ahead.

This massive decline has stirred interest among investors looking to buy the dip and capitalize on long-term profits. Below are the top 4 crypto tokens to buy today if you are looking for significant returns. Top 4 Crypto Tokens to Buy Today for Long-Term Profits Some altcoins tend to perform well even during bear markets by defying the broader market sentiment. Here are four crypto tokens to buy that can potentially deliver parabolic long-term profits despite the headwinds. Ripple (XRP) Ripple (XRP) price trades at $2.23 today after a 10% drop in 24 hours. Despite the drop, XRP has the potential to make a strong rebound due to institutional adoption. Per CoinShares , the altcoin had the $38M inflows last week, which was the highest across the market. Since November 2024, XRP has seen $819M inflows. Rising inflows suggest rising demand that could bode well for the price. However, in the near term, the altcoin still faces bearish pressure. XRP has breached the lower trendline of its ascending trendline, which increases the likelihood of a drop to $1.76. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart If XRP drops further from this support, a price rally to $1.35 is likely. Conversely, if traders buy the dip, it needs to break past the upper trendline to aim for $3.14. Solana (SOL) The other best crypto token to buy today for solid returns is Solana (SOL), which saw $9M inflows last week, and $30M inflows over the past month. Anticipation around the potential approval of a SOL ETF seems to be driving institutional adoption, making it a good choice for traders who want to buy the dip. Like many altcoins, Solana price forecast shows bearish trends after the altcoin season index fell to its lowest point since November. The Solana ecosystem is also experiencing lagging performance after the number of active users and core developers tanked. Despite these factors, Solana is still the best crypto to buy as it is still trading above its one-year support level of $119. If traders buy the dip, Solana price may recover to the 61.8% Fibonacci level of $186. This could pave the way for a rally towards $300. SOL/USDT: 1-Month Chart Ethereum (ETH) Despite the bearish pressure that faces the rest of the cryptocurrency market, Ethereum’s price has successfully defended a multi-month support level of $2,300 suggesting that buyers are actively buying the dip and accumulating at lower prices. At the same time, Ethereum whales holding between 10K and 100K ETH have increased their holdings by 24% over the past year. This suggests they have been buying despite the sluggish price performance. Ethereum whale addresses According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, the rising whale activity and other bullish catalysts like inflows from ETH ETFs and network usage bode well for Ethereum price prediction , making it the best crypto to buy during the dip. SUI (SUI) SUI price trades at $2.80 today after a 7% drop in 24 hours. The altcoin has year-to-date inflows of $37M per the CoinShares report, suggesting that investors anticipate that the altcoin may perform well in the near term. SUI’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily chart has fallen to 36, indicating that selling pressure may weaken. This could precede a potential recovery to resistance at $3.47. SUI/USDT: 1-day Chart As Coingape reported, analysts are also bullish that SUI price could rally 35% in the coming days. This further positions it as one of the top crypto tokens to buy during the dip. Final Thoughts – 4 Top Crypto Tokens to Buy The crypto market is a highly volatile space that witnesses rapid price swings. Following the recent crash, investors are looking for opportunities to buy the dip as they speculate that the prices may recover. However, given that crypto is a high-risk asset, investors should remain cautious before choosing the best crypto token to buy for long-term profits.

In a letter sent to GameStop Chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen on Feb. 24, Cole suggested that GameStop’s nearly $5 billion in cash reserves could be used to position the company as a leader in the gaming sector. “We believe GameStop has an incredible opportunity to transform its financial future by becoming the premier Bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector,” Cole wrote. Strive, co-founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, manages exchange-traded funds that hold GameStop stock, giving the firm what Cole describes as a fiduciary responsibility and vested interest in the company’s success. While he did not disclose the amount of GameStop stock held, Strive maintains exposure through three different ETFs.

The popular crypto exchange has once again made headlines with a significant **Ethereum** (ETH) acquisition, signaling a strong move in the digital asset space. Just when you thought the crypto market couldn’t get any more interesting, Bybit drops another bombshell – a huge **ETH OTC trade**! What’s the Buzz Around Bybit’s Latest Ethereum Grab? According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, Bybit has acquired a staggering 36,893 ETH, valued at approximately $87.5 million, through an over-the-counter (OTC) trade. This isn’t a one-off event; it’s part of a larger trend. Over the past three days alone, the **crypto exchange** giant has accumulated a whopping 212,101 ETH, worth around $574 million, all via OTC transactions. Let’s break down what this means and why it’s turning heads in the crypto world. This substantial accumulation raises several key questions: What exactly is an OTC trade, and why is Bybit using it? Why is Bybit specifically targeting Ethereum? What are the potential implications of such a large acquisition for the Ethereum market and the broader crypto landscape? Decoding the ETH OTC Trade: Why Over-the-Counter? Let’s first understand **ETH OTC trade**. Over-the-counter (OTC) trading is a method of trading securities or other financial instruments directly between two parties, without the supervision of an exchange. In the context of cryptocurrency, OTC trades are often used for large transactions to avoid impacting the open market price. When a **crypto exchange** like Bybit wants to acquire a significant amount of Ethereum, executing the purchase on a public exchange could lead to slippage , driving up the price and potentially making the acquisition more expensive. Benefits of OTC Trading for Large Crypto Acquisitions: Reduced Slippage: Bybit can secure a large amount of ETH at a pre-agreed price, minimizing the risk of price spikes during the purchase. Price Stability: OTC trades help maintain market stability by preventing sudden large buy orders from influencing the public exchange order books. Privacy and Discretion: Large institutions and exchanges often prefer OTC for privacy, keeping their large transactions away from public scrutiny until they are completed and reported. Customized Deals: OTC desks can offer more flexibility in terms of pricing, settlement, and transaction size, catering to the specific needs of large buyers like Bybit. However, OTC trades also come with challenges, such as counterparty risk and the need for trust between the transacting parties. For established exchanges like Bybit, these risks are typically managed through robust due diligence and established relationships with OTC desks. Why Ethereum? Bybit’s Bullish Stance on ETH The next logical question is: why **Ethereum**? Bybit’s massive accumulation of ETH suggests a strong bullish outlook on the second-largest cryptocurrency. There could be several reasons driving this strategic move: Anticipation of Ethereum’s Future Growth: Bybit might be betting on the long-term growth and adoption of the Ethereum ecosystem. With ongoing developments and upgrades, Ethereum remains a cornerstone of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and NFTs. Meeting Institutional Demand: As **institutional crypto** adoption grows, there’s an increasing demand for Ethereum. Bybit, as a leading exchange, might be positioning itself to cater to this rising institutional interest in ETH. Strategic Reserve for Exchange Operations: Exchanges need substantial crypto reserves to facilitate trading, withdrawals, and other operational activities. Increasing ETH holdings could be a strategic move to bolster Bybit’s reserves and ensure smooth operations. Potential for Staking and Yield Generation: While the content doesn’t explicitly mention staking, holding large amounts of ETH opens up opportunities for staking and generating yield, further enhancing Bybit’s revenue streams. Example: Institutional Interest in Ethereum The increasing interest of institutions in cryptocurrencies is undeniable. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have famously invested heavily in Bitcoin. Now, Ethereum is also gaining traction among institutional investors. Bybit’s **institutional crypto** focused OTC purchases could reflect this broader trend of institutions diversifying their crypto portfolios beyond Bitcoin and into Ethereum. The Broader Implications for the Crypto Exchange Market Bybit’s significant **ETH OTC trade** activity has broader implications for the **crypto exchange** market and the overall sentiment. Potential Market Impacts: Bullish Signal for Ethereum: Such a large accumulation by a major exchange can be interpreted as a strong bullish signal for Ethereum. It indicates confidence in ETH’s future value and potential. Increased Scarcity: Removing a substantial amount of ETH from the open market, even temporarily, can contribute to a sense of scarcity, potentially supporting price appreciation over time. Validation of OTC Markets: Bybit’s activity highlights the growing importance and legitimacy of OTC markets in the cryptocurrency space, especially for large-scale transactions. Competitive Pressure on Other Exchanges: Other crypto exchanges might take note of Bybit’s strategic ETH accumulation and consider similar moves to strengthen their positions and reserves. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts: Keep an Eye on Exchange Flows: Monitoring large exchange inflows and outflows, especially OTC transactions, can provide valuable insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. Diversify Your Portfolio: Bybit’s ETH move reinforces the importance of considering Ethereum as a key component of a diversified crypto portfolio, alongside Bitcoin and other promising assets. Stay Informed About Institutional Activity: Tracking institutional crypto adoption and investment trends can help you understand the broader market dynamics and make more informed investment decisions. Conclusion: Bybit’s Ethereum Power Play Bybit’s **massive** acquisition of Ethereum via OTC trades is more than just a news headline; it’s a strategic power play that underscores the exchange’s bullish outlook on ETH and the growing significance of OTC markets in crypto. This **institutional crypto** level accumulation could be a harbinger of further positive developments for Ethereum and the broader digital asset space. As Bybit continues to expand its ETH holdings, it will be fascinating to watch how this unfolds and impacts the market dynamics. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, staying informed about these large-scale movements is crucial to navigating the ever-evolving landscape of digital finance.

The capital will be used to expand its RWAs tokenization offerings. Plans to launch TGE ramp up as the network testnet is released. In an announcement this week, Mavryk Dynamics revealed it has secured over $5 million in funding for its brainchild, Mavryk Network , a Layer-1 blockchain designed to revolutionize and democratize asset ownership. The funding is scheduled to develop and expand its real-world asset (RWA) network economy and nurture the RWA community by building the tokenization of assets platform. According to the press release, the investment is set to simplify how individuals interact with RWAs and decentralized finance (DeFi). Mavryk Network is a standalone blockchain that leverages RWA tokenization, DeFi applications, and robust infrastructure, to transform how individuals interact with and leverage tokenized assets. The platform creates an interconnected network economy through the seamless integration of RWA with DeFi. Mavryk aims to create an accessible digital commonwealth for asset tokenization, and the L1 has already secured over $360 million in RWAs ready for tokenization. The latest funding round welcomed some of the top VCs in asset tokenization and Web 3, as they aim to propel the company to new heights. Some of the investors in the $5 million capital funding round, include Ghaf Capital, Big Brain, MetaVest Capital, Cluster Capital, Collective Ventures, and Atlas Fund, alongside commitments from Draper Gorne Holme, Blockchain Alpha, Wentworth Hall Family Office, AngelDAO, and Everest Ventures. One of the VCs, Aylon Morley from Wentworth Fall Family Office, believes the capital is indicative of the potential that Mavryk Network shows in revolutionizing asset tokenization. The platform aims to transform illiquid properties into tradable digital assets through DeFi-powered lending and fractionalized ownership on the secure network including assets such as real estate, bonds, debt, equities, commodities, Bitcoin miners and insurance-backed securities. “We chose to invest in Mavryk because we firmly believe in the transformative potential of RWA markets as a tangible and impactful use case,” explained Aylon Morley on why the company chose to invest in Mavryk. “Mavryk’s robust infrastructure and experienced team bring maturity and innovation to the table.” Notwithstanding, the platform combines traditional finance principles with DeFi innovation to create seamless access to global assets. The platform included several non-custodial features such as an on-chain protocol treasury, liquidity mining, bug bounties, and grants. Its innovative architecture is underpinned by strategic tokenomics that prioritize stakeholder prosperity and user security. “We’re creating a future where traditional, analogue assets seamlessly integrate into a digital network economy, unlocking investment opportunities that were once exclusive to a privileged few and making them accessible to investors around the globe,” said Alex Davis, founder of Mavryk. Additionally, Mavryk’s founders have extensive expertise in blockchain ecosystem development and pioneered open-source initiatives – including a new RWA token standard – as well as multiple RWA DEXs for non-custodial trading and lending/borrowing applications. Recently, the platform launched its testnet, with the mainnet launch ever inching closer. Following a successful testnet, the team will launch its token generation event (TGE), releasing the $MVRK token to the public. The token powers the ecosystem, securing the network through staking and validator nodes. It is built with automated fee burns and economic incentives to drive sustainable growth and value perseverance. The testnet provides a user-friendly blockchain-based environment for RWA tokenization and seamless DeFi integration, setting the scene for a thriving ecosystem that provides direct value to users. It mirrors the mainnet functionality, providing users with a risk-free environment to experiment with the network’s features, test decentralized applications (dApps), purchase fractional test shares of real-world investments, submit feedback, and earn testnet rewards.

40827920,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133940,1740507055,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tether CEO’s Strong Defense of USDT: A Beacon of Stability Amid Regulatory Storm,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-ceo-defends-usdt/,"In a bold move amidst escalating regulatory scrutiny, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino has stepped into the limelight to vehemently defend USDT, the world’s leading stablecoin. Ardoino’s assertive stance, broadcast across social media platform X, underscores Tether’s unwavering commitment to its mission and its critical role in the global financial landscape. But what exactly is driving this defiant defense, and what does it mean for the future of USDT and the broader crypto ecosystem? USDT’s Cornerstone Role in Financial Inclusion Ardoino passionately highlighted USDT’s pivotal role in bolstering U.S. dollar hegemony, particularly within emerging markets. He emphasized that USDT is not just another digital asset; it’s a crucial tool driving financial inclusion for millions globally. Let’s break down why this is so significant: Accessibility: In regions with unstable local currencies or limited banking infrastructure, USDT provides a stable and readily accessible alternative. Remittances: USDT facilitates faster and cheaper cross-border remittances, directly benefiting individuals and families relying on international money transfers. Economic Empowerment: By offering a stable store of value and a medium of exchange, USDT empowers individuals to participate in the digital economy and safeguard their assets. This focus on financial inclusion isn’t just rhetoric. It reflects a tangible impact in regions where traditional financial systems fall short. USDT, in this context, acts as a bridge, connecting underserved populations to the global financial network. Navigating the Murky Waters of Stablecoin Regulation The crypto industry is no stranger to regulatory headwinds, and stablecoins like USDT are increasingly finding themselves in the crosshairs. Proposed stablecoin regulation is becoming a hot topic globally, with lawmakers grappling to balance innovation with consumer protection and financial stability. Ardoino’s defense comes at a crucial juncture, addressing growing concerns and preempting potential restrictive measures. What are some of the key regulatory concerns surrounding stablecoins? Concern Description Systemic Risk The potential for stablecoins to trigger broader financial instability if not properly regulated, especially given their increasing market capitalization. Consumer Protection Ensuring users are protected from fraud, market manipulation, and lack of transparency in stablecoin operations. Money Laundering and Illicit Finance Preventing the use of stablecoins for illegal activities and ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. Reserve Transparency Demanding clear and verifiable information about the assets backing stablecoins to maintain their peg and ensure solvency. These are legitimate concerns, and Ardoino’s response isn’t to dismiss regulation entirely, but to advocate for a balanced and informed approach that doesn’t stifle innovation or hinder the benefits of stablecoins like USDT. Ardoino’s Accusation of “Lawfare” Against Tether In a fiery counter-offensive, Ardoino didn’t just defend USDT; he accused competitors of resorting to “lawfare” – using legal and regulatory avenues to attack Tether rather than focusing on building superior products. This accusation injects a layer of intrigue and rivalry into the narrative. According to Ardoino, instead of competing fairly in the market, some entities are attempting to dismantle Tether through regulatory pressure. This is a serious allegation, suggesting a cutthroat competitive landscape within the stablecoin arena. Is there merit to Ardoino’s claims? While concrete evidence of coordinated “lawfare” is difficult to ascertain publicly, the intense competition and high stakes in the stablecoin market make such tactics plausible. The regulatory landscape itself can become a battleground, and lobbying efforts, strategic complaints, and leveraging regulatory uncertainties can be used as competitive tools. USDT’s $115 Billion Treasury and the Dollar’s Dominance A cornerstone of Ardoino’s defense is the substantial $115 billion in U.S. Treasuries held by Tether. This massive holding isn’t just a figure; it’s a statement. It underscores USDT’s deep integration with the traditional financial system and its contribution to the strength of the U.S. dollar. By investing heavily in U.S. Treasuries, Tether argues it is not only ensuring the stability of USDT but also indirectly supporting the U.S. economy and reinforcing the dollar’s global cryptocurrency regulation dominance. This point is crucial in the context of regulatory discussions. Tether is positioning itself not as a rogue entity operating outside the system, but as a significant participant within it, contributing to the very financial instruments regulators are tasked with overseeing. This narrative aims to soften regulatory stances and highlight the potential unintended consequences of overly restrictive measures against USDT. Resisting Regulatory Attacks: A Vow for the Future Ardoino’s message is clear: Tether will not back down. He vowed to resist what he perceives as regulatory attacks, reiterating USDT’s crucial role in providing financial access and stability to millions worldwide. This isn’t just a defense; it’s a declaration of resilience. Tether is signaling its intent to fight for its position in the market and to advocate for regulatory frameworks that are both effective and conducive to innovation. This resistance is likely to manifest in several ways: Proactive Engagement: Increased dialogue with regulators globally to educate and address concerns. Legal Challenges: Preparedness to contest regulations deemed unfair or overly restrictive. Strategic Innovation: Exploring technological and operational adjustments to navigate evolving regulatory landscapes. Public Advocacy: Continuing to communicate USDT’s benefits and counter negative narratives through public platforms. Conclusion: USDT’s Defiant Stance and the Road Ahead Paolo Ardoino’s assertive defense of USDT is more than just a PR exercise; it’s a strategic move in the face of mounting regulatory pressure. By highlighting USDT’s role in financial inclusion, its substantial U.S. Treasury holdings, and accusing competitors of “lawfare,” Tether is actively shaping the narrative and pushing back against perceived threats. The coming months will be critical as regulatory frameworks for stablecoins continue to develop. Whether Tether’s defiant stance will successfully navigate these challenges remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: USDT is not going down without a fight, and its future trajectory will significantly impact the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.

In a market analysis note, Bernstein analysts suggested that a BTC price drop below $80,000 could provide an attractive entry point for investors looking to capitalize on the ongoing bull cycle. The firm remains confident in its bullish outlook and views the correction as temporary rather than a trend reversal. “If sentiment continues to weaken, we believe price levels below $80,000 will present an attractive risk-reward opportunity for investors looking to position for new cycle highs over the next 12-18 months,” Bernstein analysts wrote. The research note described the current price pullback as “another opportunity to participate in this cycle.” Related News: Binance CEO Richard Teng Talks About Bitcoin (BTC) and Altcoins' Drop! Bernstein analysts believe that BTC has yet to reach its cycle high, and predict a potential price level of $200,000 within the next 12 months. Their long-term thesis is based on Bitcoin developing as a “digital gold” asset class, along with increasing institutional and sovereign demand. Bitcoin has been range-bound in recent weeks, but has fallen sharply by over 7% in the past 24 hours, dropping below $87,000. Bernstein attributes the recent decline to several key factors, including the aftermath of the $1.5 billion hack of Bybit, one of the five largest offshore cryptocurrency exchanges. In addition, market volatility has been exacerbated by the controversy surrounding the Libra token, which has the backing of Argentine President Javier Milei. “However, we believe the BTC market is following broader equity risk-on sentiment driven by macro concerns about persistently high interest rates amid fears of the government turning deflationary with its DOGE program,” the analysts wrote. *This is not investment advice.

Recently, a significant player, known in the crypto circles as ‘7 Siblings,’ has made headlines by capitalizing on a recent market downturn. This anonymous Ethereum Whale has strategically accumulated a substantial amount of ETH, signaling strong confidence in the future of Ethereum and potentially influencing market sentiment. Let’s dive into the details of this noteworthy transaction and explore what it signifies for the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the Ethereum Whale’s Massive ETH Accumulation According to a recent report from the blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain, the entity ‘7 Siblings’ executed a significant ETH Accumulation strategy following a recent market decline. This whale, operating anonymously, purchased a staggering 12,070 ETH. Let’s break down this impressive transaction: Amount Purchased: 12,070 ETH Cost: $28.75 million DAI Average Price: $2,382 per ETH Platform: Purchased using DAI (Decentralized Stablecoin) Source: Data reported by Lookonchain on X (formerly Twitter) This strategic move has increased ‘7 Siblings’ already substantial holdings. Currently, this Ethereum Whale now commands a colossal 1.15 million ETH spread across two wallets. To put this into perspective, at current market valuations, this ETH hoard is worth approximately $2.8 billion. This level of holding firmly places ‘7 Siblings’ among the most influential individual entities in the Ethereum ecosystem. Why Do Smart Whales Engage in ETH Accumulation During Market Dips? The actions of ‘7 Siblings’ raise a crucial question: Why do these Smart Money investors actively buy during market downturns? The answer lies in a combination of strategic foresight and understanding market cycles. Here are a few key reasons: Buying Low: The fundamental principle of investing is to buy low and sell high. Market dips provide the perfect opportunity to acquire assets at a discounted price. When prices are down, the potential for future gains increases significantly. Long-Term Vision: Whales like ‘7 Siblings’ often operate with a long-term investment horizon. They are less concerned with short-term market fluctuations and more focused on the future potential of the asset. They likely believe in the long-term value and growth of Ethereum, making market dips ideal entry points. Market Confidence Signal: Large Whale Transactions like this can act as a signal to the broader market. When a whale makes a significant purchase during a dip, it can instill confidence in other investors, suggesting that ‘smart money’ sees value where others see fear. This can sometimes trigger a positive ripple effect, potentially contributing to market recovery. Averaging Down: For whales who already hold substantial amounts of ETH, buying during dips can be a strategy to ‘average down’ their overall purchase price. This reduces their average cost per ETH and increases their profitability when the market recovers. The Impact of Whale Transactions on the Crypto Market Dip Whale Transactions , especially those of this magnitude, can have a noticeable impact on the cryptocurrency market, particularly during periods of price correction or a Crypto Market Dip . Here’s how: Price Stabilization: Significant buy orders from whales can help to stabilize prices during a dip. By absorbing selling pressure, they can prevent further downward spirals and establish a potential price floor. Increased Demand: Large purchases naturally increase demand for the asset. This increased demand can contribute to price recovery and signal to the market that there is still strong buying interest, even during downturns. Market Sentiment Shift: As mentioned earlier, whale activity can influence market sentiment. When investors see Smart Money accumulating assets during a dip, it can shift the overall mood from fear and panic to optimism and opportunity. This psychological effect is crucial in volatile markets like crypto. Reduced Liquidity (Potentially): While large buy orders increase demand, they can also temporarily reduce the available liquidity, especially if the whale is buying from exchanges or open markets. This can, in some cases, lead to sharper price movements both upwards and downwards. Actionable Insights: What Can Retail Investors Learn from this Ethereum Whale? While most retail investors can’t deploy $28.75 million in a single Whale Transaction , there are valuable lessons to be learned from the strategic moves of entities like ‘7 Siblings’. Here are some actionable insights: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Emulate the whale’s long-term vision by employing a Dollar-Cost Averaging strategy. Instead of trying to time the market perfectly, invest a fixed amount at regular intervals. This approach helps to mitigate risk and capitalize on market dips over time. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Understand the fundamentals of the cryptocurrencies you invest in. Just as whales likely conduct thorough research before making large investments, retail investors should also educate themselves about the technology, use cases, and long-term potential of their chosen assets. Manage Risk: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Diversify your portfolio and allocate capital based on your risk tolerance and financial goals. Long-Term Perspective: Adopt a long-term investment mindset. Focus on the future potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies rather than being swayed by short-term market fluctuations. Market dips are a natural part of market cycles and can present buying opportunities for long-term holders.

The Satoshi Papers , published by BPI and edited by TBF executive director and BPI fellow Natalie Smolenski, draws inspiration from the eighteenth-century American debate between the Federalists and Anti-Federalists about the role of government in preserving the liberties of individuals and communities. The book features an open exchange of ideas among scholars about the relationship between money and state in a post-Bitcoin world. “ The Satoshi Papers brings together economists, historians, anthropologists, and other social scientists to think together about how a decentralized digital protocol can inspire the re-formation of existing political and economic institutions,” said Natalie Smolenski, founder and executive director of the Texas Bitcoin Foundation. Bitcoin Policy Institute, a DC-based policy think tank, launches its book publishing imprint with The Satoshi Papers . “Launching a publishing imprint represents a natural next step for BPI as we continue to advance the intellectual foundations of Bitcoin policy. And The Satoshi Papers is the perfect inaugural publication — it represents exactly the kind of rigorous academic discourse needed to bridge the gap between Bitcoin innovation and policy development,” said Grant McCarty, co-founder of BPI. The Satoshi Papers Symposium, which will be hosted on UATX campus on April 16, 2025, features presentations by authors of The Satoshi Papers who are also BPI fellows, including Avik Roy, Josh Hendrickson, Craig Warmke, and Natalie Smolenski. Faculty from the University of Austin will discuss the arguments the authors present in the book. “At the University of Austin, we are committed to the fearless pursuit of truth and rigorous debate about the ideas shaping our world,” said Chad Thevenot, SVP of Advancements and Communication at the University of Austin. “The Satoshi Papers Symposium is a perfect example of that commitment, bringing together scholars and students to explore the economic and political implications of Bitcoin. We are honored that UATX will be a convening platform for this critical conversation.” The Symposium uniquely encourages student participation. Thanks to a generous donation from Strive Asset Management, a financial services firm cofounded by Vivek Ramaswamy, all students in the UATX inaugural class will receive copies of The Satoshi Papers and invitations to join the discussion during the Symposium. Matt Cole, CEO of Strive, said, “Strive believes Bitcoin should be a core allocation in the portfolios of everyday Americans. In light of the inevitable volatility characterizing the early life of a rapidly monetizing new asset, deep education is essential for investors to build and maintain conviction in that allocation. The Satoshi Papers is a vital contribution to Bitcoin education, and we’re honored to partner in hosting the Symposium.” The Symposium is generously supported by Unchained, an Austin-native financial services firm for bitcoin. Joe Kelly, co-founder and CEO of Unchained and director of the Texas Bitcoin Foundation, said, “Bitcoin redefines the relationship between money and state, and education is key to that shift. The Satoshi Papers challenges us to think critically about financial sovereignty—something we make real at Unchained by ensuring individuals control their own bitcoin. We’re proud to support this symposium and the broader effort to secure financial freedom for generations to come.” Unchained will host a public reception, book sale and signing of The Satoshi Papers at the Bitcoin Commons on the evening of April 16th.

However, a dose of reality is being injected into the excitement, with analysts predicting a more tempered reception for these upcoming investment vehicles. Are we on the cusp of another crypto ETF revolution, or will Altcoin ETF Demand fall short of expectations? Analysts Temper Expectations for Altcoin ETF Demand While the crypto community eagerly awaits the green light for Altcoin ETFs , market analysts are adopting a cautious stance regarding their potential impact. Katalin Tischhauser from Sygnum Bank, for instance, estimates inflows for these new ETFs to range between $100 million and $1 billion. This figure, while substantial, pales in comparison to the staggering $100 billion that Bitcoin ETFs have attracted. This significant difference in projected inflows highlights a crucial point: the market dynamics for altcoins are distinct from those of Bitcoin. Several factors contribute to this more conservative outlook on ETF Demand for altcoins: Direct Ownership Preference: A significant portion of crypto investors, particularly those interested in altcoins, are already comfortable holding these assets directly. They may perceive less need for ETF wrappers, which are often favored by institutional investors or those less familiar with the intricacies of cryptocurrency custody and trading. Market Maturity and Recognition: Bitcoin enjoys first-mover advantage and significantly broader recognition as a store of value and a mature asset class within the crypto space. Altcoins, while gaining traction, are still considered more volatile and speculative by many, potentially limiting broader institutional interest in Crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for altcoins remains less defined compared to Bitcoin. This uncertainty can impact institutional investors’ comfort levels and willingness to allocate significant capital to Solana ETF , XRP ETF , and similar products. The Optimistic Counterpoint: Why Some Believe in Altcoin ETF Potential Despite the tempered expectations, optimism persists within certain segments of the financial industry. Firms like 21Shares, a well-known issuer of crypto exchange-traded products, maintain a positive outlook on the prospects of Altcoin ETFs . Their optimism is rooted in the inherent advantages that ETFs offer, regardless of the underlying asset. What are these advantages, and why might they still drive demand? Benefits of Altcoin ETFs: Institutional-Grade Pricing: ETFs provide access to institutional pricing and liquidity, potentially offering better execution and tighter spreads compared to direct altcoin purchases on some exchanges. This is a significant draw for larger investors seeking efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Simplified Custody Solutions: Custody remains a critical concern for institutional investors entering the crypto space. ETFs effectively outsource custody to regulated and experienced providers, removing a significant operational hurdle and security concern for investors. Regulatory Compliance and Familiarity: ETFs operate within established regulatory frameworks, offering a familiar and compliant investment structure for institutions accustomed to traditional financial products. This familiarity can ease the onboarding process and encourage adoption. Broader Market Access: ETFs can make altcoin exposure accessible to a wider range of investors, including those in traditional finance who may be hesitant to directly engage with cryptocurrency exchanges or manage digital wallets. JPMorgan’s Bold Projection: $14 Billion Demand? Adding another layer to the narrative, JPMorgan has presented a significantly more bullish forecast, projecting potential demand for Crypto ETFs , including altcoin products, to exceed $14 billion. This figure, reported by Cointelegraph, stands in stark contrast to the more conservative estimates and highlights the inherent uncertainty and varying perspectives within the market. JPMorgan’s projection suggests a belief in substantial pent-up demand from investors who have been waiting for regulated and easily accessible altcoin investment vehicles. Is this aggressive forecast wishful thinking, or does it reflect a hidden wave of institutional interest ready to flood into Solana ETF and XRP ETF products? Analyst/Firm ETF Type Demand Projection Sygnum Altcoin ETFs $100 Million – $1 Billion JPMorgan Crypto ETFs (including Altcoins) >$14 Billion 21Shares (Optimistic View) Altcoin ETFs Potentially Significant (Unquantified) Comparison of demand projections for Altcoin ETFs from different sources. Navigating the Altcoin ETF Landscape: Key Takeaways The path forward for Altcoin ETFs is paved with both opportunities and challenges. While replicating the explosive success of Bitcoin ETFs might be unrealistic in the short term, the potential for growth and adoption remains significant. Here are some key takeaways for investors and market observers: Realistic Expectations: Avoid unrealistic hype. ETF Demand for altcoins is likely to be more measured initially compared to Bitcoin. Focus on Long-Term Growth: Altcoin ETFs represent a maturing market. Long-term growth will depend on factors like regulatory clarity, institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, and the continued development of the altcoin ecosystem. Monitor Inflows and Adoption: Keep a close watch on the actual inflows into newly launched Solana ETF and XRP ETF products. These real-world metrics will provide a clearer picture of market appetite than analyst predictions alone. Consider ETF Benefits: For investors seeking regulated, custodially secure, and institutionally priced access to altcoins, ETFs offer compelling advantages. The Verdict on Altcoin ETF Demand The upcoming launch of Altcoin ETFs marks another significant step in the evolution of the cryptocurrency market. While analysts predict a more modest initial ETF Demand compared to Bitcoin ETFs, the long-term potential remains substantial. The inherent benefits of ETFs – institutional pricing, simplified custody, and regulatory compliance – could gradually attract significant capital into Crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin. Whether Solana ETF and XRP ETF products will ultimately mirror Bitcoin’s ETF success is still unfolding, but one thing is clear: the crypto investment landscape is becoming increasingly sophisticated and accessible. The future of altcoin investment is here, wrapped in an ETF, and ready for a potentially transformative, albeit measured, journey.

In a Tuesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Grayscale stated its intention to list its spot DOT ETF on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol “DOT.” Grayscale’s Polkadot ETF Application Grayscale seeks to provide institutional investors with a highly regulated avenue to gain exposure to Polkadot’s native token DOT. The Nasdaq Stock Market, on behalf of Grayscale, filed a 19b-4 proposal on Feb. 25 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to list and trade shares of the Grayscale Polkadot Trust. DOT is the 26th largest crypto by market capitalization, but its price performance has been lackluster in recent times. Over the past 12 months, its price has fallen 42.7%, and it’s down 30.3% in the last month, according to CoinGecko data. DOT’s market capitalization currently stands at $6.8 billion. Altcoin ETFs Are Coming At the moment, only crypto assets traded in markets regulated by the SEC or Commodity Futures Trading Commission — such as Bitcoin and Ethereum — are eligible to be traded on Wall Street through ETFs. As the Securities and Exchange Commission moves to provide crypto clarity under the new President Donald Trump administration, applications for spot crypto ETFs seem to be popping up every day — ranging from Dogecoin, the OG meme coin beloved by Elon Musk, to altcoins like Ripple’s XRP, Solana (SOL), Hedera’s HBAR token, and Litecoin. President Trump earlier nominated a pro-crypto SEC interim chair, Mark Uyeda . The Commission has also launched a crypto task force , led by crypto-friendly commissioner Hester Pierce. The SEC has already acknowledged a handful of spot XRP ETFs and Litecoin ETF applications in recent times. The tone shift — paired with the acknowledgments — has sparked hopes that the federal regulators could greenlight a slew of crypto-based investment vehicles this year. According to Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, ETFs based on Litecoin, often described as the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold,” have the highest odds of approval (90%) among the wave of spot altcoin ETFs, followed by Dogecoin (75% chance). They give Solana and XRP ETFs a 70% and 65% likelihood of approval, respectively. “Expecting more SEC acknowledgements on XRP & Litecoin ETFs today too.

Uniswap Labs, the creator of Ethereum’s most traded decentralized exchange, is no longer facing legal action from the Securities and Exchange Commission as the agency’s Crypto Task Force overhauled enforcement actions from previous leadership. Uniswap was previously accused of facilitating unregistered securities trading on its multi-chain decentralized exchange, acting as an unregistered broker-dealer, and operating an illegal clearinghouse according to a 2024 Wells notice and lawsuit from the agency. The decentralized finance startup denied the allegations, as did several other firms facing similar charges. “If forced to litigate, we will win,” said Uniswap chief legal officer Marvin Ammori in May. In April, the SEC issued a Wells notice claiming that Uniswap Labs operated as an unregistered broker, operated an exchange, and issued an unregistered security As of yesterday, that investigation has officially been closed, and the SEC is taking no enforcement action This is a… — Uniswap Labs 🦄 (@Uniswap) February 25, 2025 You might also like: Uniswap to SEC: “If forced to litigate, we will win” Uniswap is the latest cryptocurrency firm to be granted relief from Securities and Exchange Commission scrutiny in 2025. The agency, through its newly formed Crypto Task Force, has also dropped cases against Coinbase and Robinhood . Investigations into non-fungible token marketplace OpenSea concluded with no further action. “They went after us despite having no clear legal basis,” said Uniswap Labs founder and CEO Hayden Adams on X, adding that the Securities and Exchange Commission attempted “to force decentralized finance into a regulatory framework that doesn’t fit.” The decision strengthened the regulatory outlook for decentralized finance and underscored the need for clearer rules, but Adams noted the toll the investigation had taken. This investigation took over 3 years, forcing us to waste incredible amounts of time and millions of dollars. It also had a personal impact — federal investigations are violating and stressful to the point where there is a saying among lawyers that “the investigation IS the punishment.” That shouldn’t be the price of innovation in the US.

While USDT has a high turnover on the TRON network, it still requires a balance of TRX to transact. Tether (USDT) on TRON will be used without gas payments, no longer requiring users to keep a TRX balance for fees. USDT on TRON is among the most actively used stablecoins and among the big gas burners on the chain. Justin Sun, TRON’s founder, announced the gas feature would launch in the coming week. The technology to send USDT with no additional TRX payments has been in the works since 2024 and is expected by December, but it was finalized just as the market was experiencing a liquidity crunch. Tron's Gas Free feature supporting USDT gas payments without the need for TRX will launch within the next week. Teams and wallets wishing to support this feature, please contact support@justlend.org. Keep Building! — H.E. Justin Sun 🍌 (@justinsuntron) February 25, 2025 The feature integration will depend on individual wallets and apps wishing to support this version of USDT. The decision from TRON arrives after users complained about unpredictable stablecoin fees. At the end of 2024, BNB Chain also subsidized its gas fees for a small selection of wallets, leading to free transactions. TRON-based USDT also allows for native multi-sig storage, as Sun pointed out in a recent post . TRON requires complex calculations for stablecoin transfers TRON users wishing to cut their fees in half can signal to a bot that will provide a small amount of TRX. Fees for sending USDT are lower when moving funds to a non-empty wallet with a minimal amount of TRX. The USDT token is the leading smart contract on TRON, driving the chain’s engagement. Based on TRON data, more than 98% of all calls to contracts on the chain are linked to USDT. USDT is the most active smart contract, burning over 98% of TRON-based gas fees. | Source: Tronscan Despite the generally low fees for using the TRON chain, in some cases, using USDT has cost up to $9 per transaction. Despite the high capacity, energy on TRON is limited and may lead to temporary congestion conditions. One of the reasons for the USDT congestion is that TRON wallets have limited energy for daily transactions. Stablecoin transactions on TRON depend on the available energy for each wallet, and despite the network’s low fees, often USDT transactions can become overly expensive. TRON fees for stablecoins get ahead of other networks The TRON chain is currently expensive to transact in stablecoins. Despite the trend for small-scale payments, a USDT transaction may cost from $3.22 to $6.54. For Ethereum, due to favorable gas conditions, the fee is just $0.31, an unusually low value. USDT fees on TRON are complex and depend on the available energy in a new wallet. | Source: GasFeesNow TRON’s most common USDT transaction is for sums between $100 and $1,000. In the past few weeks, TRON is more rarely used for small-scale transfers under $10, again due to the unpredictable nature of fees. As of February 2025, the level of whale-sized transactions is higher for Ethereum-based USDT, with almost negligible movements on TRON. The supply of TRON-based USDT also expanded in the past weeks, up to 62.74B tokens. More wallets also added USDT, expanding the holders to 61.62M. Despite this, over 51.9M wallets hold under $100 in USDT value. The new TRC-20 minting expanded the total supply of Tether’s main stablecoin. In the past month, USDT added 4.9B new tokens to its supply. Stablecoins are becoming more important for both centralized trading and DEX activity as TRON aims to build its DeFi sector with more accessible liquidity. As of February, the supply of stablecoins increased to $227.1B, with Ethereum remaining the leading chain. TRON-based USDT was more often used for peer-to-peer markets and is one of the assets closely watched for scam usage. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Uncertainty looms over these popular cryptocurrencies. The market is buzzing with questions about their future performance. This article delves into the possible recovery paths for these digital assets. Discover which coins might bounce back stronger and what factors will drive their resurgence. XRP's Explosive Momentum: Navigating Price Trends for Maximum Profits Over the past six months, XRP has seen a remarkable increase, rising by 287.68%. This period of growth reflects a strong bullish sentiment after more recoverable cycles over the past month, where it showed a decline of 28.97%, and a significant 17% dip in the last week alone. These figures illustrate the volatile yet potentially lucrative nature of XRP as it gains traction in the crypto market. Currently, XRP is trading in a range between $2.28 and $3.60, showcasing a possible period of consolidation after recent declines. Despite the downturns, such as a 17% drop over the last week and almost 29% over the past month, the altcoin has maintained levels significantly above its previous lows, suggesting a solid support zone around $1.52. With a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 33.779, XRP is nearing oversold conditions, potentially attracting buying interest. Short-term traders could consider this an ideal time for accumulation, targeting resistance at $4.16 for moderate gains, while keeping a watchful eye on the $5.48 as an optimal exit point during short-lived rallies or bullish reversals. Cardano (ADA) Surges: Analyzing Price Movements & Trading Strategies In the past month, Cardano (ADA) has faced significant price volatility, with a substantial decrease of 32.86% in its value. This trend reflects a challenging period for the cryptocurrency, with short-term traders experiencing a downward shift in market sentiment. However, looking at a longer timeline, the past six months have painted a different picture, with ADA demonstrating a robust recovery and an overall increase of 86.89%, indicating a promising recovery trajectory for long-term investors . Currently, Cardano is trading between $0.796 and $1.126, showing attempts at stabilization after recent fluctuations. The present dynamics suggest a bearish phase with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 33.11, hinting at a potential oversold condition which might attract buying interest at lower levels. The nearest support and resistance are pegged at $0.65 and $1.31 respectively. For traders looking to capitalize on short-term movements, buying close to support levels around $0.65 could be strategic, aiming for short-term gains at resistance near $1.31. If ADA breaks below $0.65, a further downtrend towards the second support level at $0.32 could be on the cards, signalling a consolidation phase before any significant rebound. Conversely, a break above $1.31 may pave the way to the second resistance at $1.64, and holding until these levels could maximize returns for those playing the bullish scenario. Conclusion XRP and ADA are facing challenges, but their recent patterns suggest potential for recovery. XRP's significant decline brings it near oversold conditions, which might attract buyers. Short-term gains could be targeted at resistance levels with cautious monitoring. For ADA, its current bearish phase shows attempts to stabilize, and the oversold RSI implies possible buying opportunities at lower levels. Strategic buying near support can offer short-term gains. Both cryptocurrencies have shown resilience in the past and may present opportunities as the market recovers. Investors should remain attentive to key support and resistance levels to maximize potential returns. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, traders are still bullish, anticipating another breakout attempt. Despite the increasing selling pressure on its price chart, several on-chain metrics still show bullish signs. These indicators suggest that BNB could be poised for a robust recovery rally soon. BNB Relatively Performed Well During Recovery During the 2021 to 2022 bear market, BNB fared relatively well, experiencing a maximum drawdown of 73.3%, compared to deeper declines of 77.4% for Bitcoin and 81.7% for Ethereum. BNB’s recovery was notably quicker, stabilizing in just 237 days, whereas Bitcoin took 517 days to recover. In the bull market of 2024, BNB managed to face various market challenges that impacted other coins such as Ethereum and Solana. This stability was seen during key events like Grayscale’s GBTC sell-off in January, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish adjustments in March, and the expected Mt. Gox repayments in July of the previous year. Also read: Bitcoin, ETH, & XRP Price Prediction: Another Crypto Crash Incoming? Moreover, August 2024 presented significant bearish tests with a liquidity crisis inducing high volatility across the crypto market. At this time, BNB’s price dropped by 18.5%, which was slightly more than Bitcoin’s 15.5% decline. Nevertheless, BNB performed better than Ethereum, which continues to face losses up to the present. According to data from Coinglass, BNB has seen significant liquidations totaling nearly $6 million, with $5.8 million coming from long positions, indicating a surge in long liquidations. Moreover, the open interest in BNB has fallen by 4.6% to $742.8 million, showing reduced trading interest among traders. Despite this, the long/short ratio has been rising, currently standing at 1.3992. This increase suggests that the number of long positions is growing relative to short positions, with approximately 58% of positions now being long. This trend indicates that a majority of traders are now anticipating a recovery rally in BNB’s price. What’s Next for BNB Price? Binance Coin (BNB) experienced significant selling pressure, driving its price below the key $600 level. The price touched a low at around $586; however, buyers later rebounded the price. Meanwhile, sellers are testing the waters for a potential continuation of the downtrend. At present, BNB is priced at $611, reflecting a 3.5% decline over the past 24 hours. The BNB/USDT pair is poised to retest the $565 level, although it is likely to encounter robust resistance from buyers. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) nearing the oversold threshold at 34, there is a risk of intensified selling pressure on BNB. Should the price not sustain above $565, a further decrease toward $500 could occur. Conversely, if BNB maintains its position above $565 or bounces back from its current price, there’s potential for an upward movement towards $647. A successful push beyond $647 could propel the price to approximately $685.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BNB|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 19:29:07

Meanwhile, XRP’s price remains under watch as analysts assess its next move, and Ethereum (ETH) shows signs of a potential rebound with increasing on-chain activity. These three assets are standing out as key cryptos to watch this month. Ripple (XRP) XRP has shown stability this month, with analysts watching key resistance levels for a potential breakout. Institutional interest and increased on-chain activity have been noted as possible drivers of an upward move. However, XRP’s price movement remains tied to broader market conditions, particularly Bitcoin’s performance. While a rally is possible if resistance is cleared, ongoing market uncertainty could slow momentum, keeping traders cautious. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) has shown signs of recovery this month, with analysts anticipating a potential rebound. On-chain data indicates that exchange balances have declined, suggesting that investors are holding rather than selling. This accumulation phase could contribute to upward price movement in the coming weeks. Market analysts have pointed to key resistance levels that ETH needs to surpass for further gains. A break above $3,000 could trigger renewed buying interest, especially with increasing institutional inflows. However, macroeconomic factors and Bitcoin’s trend will likely influence Ethereum’s short-term trajectory. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance offers real financial applications through its decentralized lending platform. Users can earn passive income by supplying liquidity while borrowers access funds without selling their assets. Additionally, the project is developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, providing a secure borrowing option while maintaining decentralization. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining traction as its presale progresses, drawing interest from investors looking for high-growth potential. Now in its second presale phase at $0.015, the project has already sold over 140 million tokens and raised more than $1.4 million, highlighting strong demand. Analysts predict a surge of over 2,150% after its launch, driven by the platform’s growing adoption and upcoming exchange listings. Whales are turning their focus to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), aiming to secure tokens at the lowest possible price before its anticipated surge. With strong presale demand and growing investor interest, they are positioning themselves early to maximize potential gains. As analysts predict substantial growth after launch, large investors see MUTM as a high-potential opportunity in the DeFi sector. For example, an investor purchasing 100,000 MUTM tokens for $1,500 at the current presale price could see their holdings increase significantly. When MUTM reaches $0.30 post-launch, that investment would be worth $30,000, showcasing the strong potential returns for early participants. The team will implement a buy-and-distribute mechanism, where a portion of platform revenue is used to repurchase MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards, incentivizing long-term participation. This strategy not only encourages holding but also creates continuous buy pressure, increasing demand and supporting the token’s price growth over time.

Wall Street heavyweight Bernstein has dropped a bombshell Bitcoin price prediction that’s sending shockwaves through the market. Buckle up, because they’re forecasting Bitcoin to hit a staggering $200,000 within just 12 months! Is this just hype, or is there solid reasoning behind this audacious claim? Let’s dive deep into Bernstein’s analysis and explore what this could mean for your crypto portfolio. Why is Bernstein so Bullish on Bitcoin? Unpacking the $200K Price Target Bernstein, a well-respected research and brokerage firm, isn’t known for making outlandish claims. So, when they predict a monumental surge in Bitcoin price , it’s worth paying attention. Their recent note to The Block provides some key insights into their bullish outlook: Cycle Dynamics: Bernstein believes Bitcoin hasn’t yet peaked in its current market cycle. Past cycles have shown Bitcoin reaching new highs after significant periods of growth and consolidation. They suggest we’re still in the upward trajectory. Institutional Adoption: While not explicitly stated in the short content, firms like Bernstein often consider increasing institutional investment as a major driver for Bitcoin’s price. Large players entering the market can inject significant capital and boost demand. (This is implied context, which is good to elaborate on) Halving Effect: Historically, Bitcoin halvings (events that reduce the reward for mining new Bitcoin) have been followed by significant price increases. The reduced supply, coupled with consistent or increasing demand, can create upward price pressure. (Again, implied but relevant context) In essence, Bernstein is painting a picture of a perfect storm for Bitcoin: a market cycle with room to run, potential increased institutional interest, and the fundamental supply dynamics driven by halvings. This combination, they argue, could propel Bitcoin to unprecedented heights. Is $80,000 a ‘Steal’? Bernstein’s Crypto Investment Strategy Here’s where it gets even more interesting for potential crypto investment . Bernstein suggests that if market sentiment takes a turn for the worse and Bitcoin dips to $80,000, it would represent a highly attractive entry point. Let’s break down why they might view this as a golden opportunity: Discounted Price: Falling to $80,000 would be a significant correction from current levels (assuming current levels are above $80k when reading this). This ‘discount’ could entice investors who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential but are hesitant to buy at higher prices. Conviction in Long-Term Growth: Bernstein’s $200,000 prediction suggests they have strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future. An $80,000 entry point would significantly improve the potential return if their prediction holds true. Strategic Accumulation: Experienced investors often use market dips to accumulate assets they believe are undervalued. Bernstein’s note implies that they see an $80,000 Bitcoin as precisely that – undervalued in the context of its potential trajectory. However, it’s crucial to remember that even expert predictions are not guarantees. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and Bitcoin bull run can be followed by sharp corrections. Always conduct your own thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Navigating the Volatility: Key Considerations for Bitcoin Investors While Bernstein’s BTC price target of $200,000 is exhilarating, it’s vital to approach this information with a balanced perspective. The crypto market is a rollercoaster, and understanding the potential bumps along the way is just as important as focusing on the potential highs. Challenges and Risks to Consider: Challenge Description Market Volatility Bitcoin is known for its price swings. Significant corrections can occur even in bull markets. Regulatory Uncertainty Changes in regulations around the world can impact the crypto market negatively. Economic Factors Macroeconomic events, like inflation and interest rate hikes, can influence investor sentiment and risk appetite, affecting Bitcoin’s price. Competition from other Cryptocurrencies The crypto landscape is constantly evolving. New cryptocurrencies and technologies could potentially challenge Bitcoin’s dominance. Actionable Insights for Investors: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never rely solely on one prediction. Explore various analyses, understand the technology, and assess the market dynamics. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio and don’t put all your eggs in one basket (even if it’s a potentially golden Bitcoin basket!). Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin is a long-term game. Focus on the fundamental value proposition and avoid getting caught up in short-term price fluctuations. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with crypto news, market trends, and regulatory developments. Knowledge is power in the crypto world. Conclusion: Is the $200K Bitcoin Dream Within Reach? Bernstein’s audacious $200,000 Bitcoin price prediction has certainly ignited excitement and hope within the crypto community. Their analysis, grounded in market cycle dynamics and potential entry points, provides a compelling narrative for significant future growth. While the path to $200K may be volatile and uncertain, the underlying factors driving Bitcoin’s adoption and value proposition remain strong. Whether or not this specific prediction materializes within 12 months, it underscores the growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a transformative asset in the global financial landscape. As always, approach with informed optimism and a healthy dose of caution in the exhilarating world of cryptocurrency investing.

40830554,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134011,1740512124,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alarming Drop: Bitcoin Miners’ On-Chain Volume Hits Shockingly Low Levels,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-miners-on-chain-volume-low/,"Is something shifting in the Bitcoin mining landscape? Recent data reveals a potentially significant development: Bitcoin miners’ on-chain volume has tumbled to a concerning 2.4% of the total on-chain volume. This marks the lowest point since May 2023, raising eyebrows and sparking discussions across the crypto community. What does this dramatic decrease in Bitcoin miners ‘ on-chain activity actually mean, and what are the possible implications for the broader crypto market ? Let’s dive into the details. Why is Bitcoin Miners’ On-Chain Volume Plummeting? According to data from IntoTheBlock, a prominent blockchain analytics platform, the share of Bitcoin miners in the total on-chain transaction volume has shrunk to a mere 2.4% as of Sunday. This is a noteworthy dip, especially when compared to historical averages and peaks. To understand the significance, we need to consider what ‘on-chain volume’ represents in the context of miner activity . On-chain volume essentially reflects the amount of Bitcoin that miners are directly transacting on the blockchain. Miners generate Bitcoin through the process of mining, and they often need to move these Bitcoins for various reasons, including: Selling Bitcoin to cover operational costs: Mining operations incur significant expenses, such as electricity, hardware maintenance, and infrastructure. Miners often sell a portion of their mined Bitcoin to cover these costs. Transferring Bitcoin to exchanges: To sell Bitcoin on exchanges, miners need to transfer their holdings to exchange wallets. These transactions contribute to on-chain volume. Moving Bitcoin to cold storage: For security purposes, miners may move a portion of their mined Bitcoin to cold storage wallets, which are offline. A decrease in Bitcoin miners ‘ on-chain volume could suggest a few potential scenarios: Reduced selling pressure from miners: If miners are selling less Bitcoin on-chain, it could indicate a decrease in selling pressure in the market. This might be perceived as a positive sign, potentially reducing downward pressure on Bitcoin prices. Increased OTC (Over-the-Counter) deals: Miners might be increasingly opting for OTC deals to sell their Bitcoin. OTC trades are conducted privately, off exchanges, and are not reflected in on-chain volume. Larger miners might prefer OTC markets to avoid slippage and market impact from large on-exchange sales. Accumulation phase: It’s also possible that some miners are choosing to hold onto their mined Bitcoin, anticipating future price increases. This accumulation strategy would naturally lead to lower on-chain selling volume. Changes in mining profitability: Fluctuations in mining profitability can impact miner behavior. If mining profitability is under pressure, miners might be more strategic about when and how they sell their Bitcoin. Let’s break down these points further: Reduced Selling Pressure: A Bullish Signal? One interpretation of the declining on-chain volume from Bitcoin miners is that it signals reduced selling pressure. Miners are significant players in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and their selling activity can influence market dynamics. If they are selling less on-chain, it could mean less Bitcoin supply is entering the exchange order books directly from miners. This could be construed as a bullish indicator, as reduced supply often, though not always, can support price appreciation, especially if demand remains constant or increases. However, it’s crucial to remember that on-chain volume is just one piece of the puzzle. The overall market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and institutional flows also play significant roles in determining Bitcoin’s price trajectory. The Rise of OTC Deals in the Bitcoin Market The possibility of increased OTC deals is a compelling explanation for the drop in Bitcoin miners ‘ on-chain volume. OTC markets offer miners several advantages, especially when dealing with large quantities of Bitcoin. These advantages include: Price stability: OTC trades are negotiated privately, minimizing the risk of causing price slippage that can occur with large on-exchange orders. Discretion: OTC transactions are less transparent than on-exchange trades, allowing miners to sell large amounts without revealing their strategy to the broader market. Direct access to buyers: OTC desks connect miners directly with institutional buyers and high-net-worth individuals, streamlining the selling process. If a larger portion of miner selling activity is shifting to OTC markets, it would naturally lead to a decrease in reported on-chain volume. This shift doesn’t necessarily mean miners are selling less Bitcoin overall; it simply indicates a change in their preferred selling methods. Are Bitcoin Miners Entering an Accumulation Phase? Another intriguing possibility is that some Bitcoin miners are strategically accumulating Bitcoin. Miners are inherently long-term believers in Bitcoin’s value proposition. If they anticipate future price increases, it makes sense for them to hold onto a larger portion of their mined Bitcoin. This accumulation strategy could be driven by factors such as: Long-term bullish outlook: Miners may believe that Bitcoin’s long-term prospects are strong, and holding Bitcoin now will be more profitable in the future. Hedge against inflation: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation. Miners might be holding Bitcoin as a store of value to protect against inflationary pressures in traditional financial markets. Future operational expansion: Miners might be accumulating Bitcoin to fund future expansion plans, such as upgrading hardware or increasing mining capacity. If a significant number of miners are in an accumulation phase, it would contribute to lower on-chain selling volume and could be a positive signal for Bitcoin’s long-term price outlook. The Impact of Mining Profitability on Miner Activity Miner activity is directly linked to mining profitability. Factors that influence mining profitability include: Factor Impact on Mining Profitability Bitcoin Price Higher Bitcoin prices increase mining revenue and profitability. Mining Difficulty Increased mining difficulty reduces the amount of Bitcoin mined per unit of energy, lowering profitability. Transaction Fees Higher transaction fees increase miner revenue. Electricity Costs Lower electricity costs increase profitability. When mining profitability is under pressure, miners might become more cautious about their operations and selling strategies. They might optimize their energy consumption, upgrade to more efficient hardware, or strategically manage their Bitcoin holdings to maximize returns. Periods of lower profitability could lead to reduced on-chain selling if miners are trying to weather the storm and avoid selling at unfavorable prices. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? The decrease in Bitcoin miners ‘ on-chain volume is a multifaceted indicator that requires careful interpretation. It’s not necessarily a straightforward bearish or bullish signal. Instead, it points to a potential shift in miner activity and market dynamics. Here are some key takeaways for the crypto market : Reduced immediate selling pressure: Lower on-chain miner selling could alleviate some immediate downward pressure on Bitcoin prices. Potential shift to OTC markets: The data highlights the growing importance of OTC markets in the Bitcoin ecosystem, especially for large players like miners. Possible miner accumulation: It’s conceivable that some miners are accumulating Bitcoin, indicating long-term confidence in Bitcoin’s future. Complex market dynamics: On-chain volume is just one metric. A comprehensive understanding of the Bitcoin market requires analyzing various factors, including derivatives market activity, exchange flows, macroeconomic trends, and regulatory developments. Actionable Insights: What Should Crypto Enthusiasts Watch For? For those closely following the crypto market , the declining Bitcoin miners ‘ on-chain volume is a signal to dig deeper. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor miner balances: Track publicly available miner wallet balances to see if miners are indeed accumulating Bitcoin or if their overall holdings are decreasing. Follow OTC market trends: Keep an eye on reports and data related to OTC Bitcoin trading volumes to understand the extent of off-exchange activity. Analyze mining profitability metrics: Stay informed about Bitcoin price, mining difficulty, and electricity costs to assess the current state of mining profitability and its potential impact on miner behavior. Consider broader market context: Don’t isolate on-chain miner volume. Analyze it in conjunction with other market indicators and news events to form a holistic view of the crypto market . Conclusion: Decoding Miner Signals in the Bitcoin Landscape The drop in Bitcoin miners ‘ on-chain volume to 2.4% is a revealing data point that warrants attention. While it could indicate reduced selling pressure and potentially bullish scenarios like miner accumulation or a shift to OTC markets, it’s crucial to avoid simplistic interpretations. The Bitcoin market is complex and influenced by numerous factors. Understanding miner behavior is a valuable piece of the puzzle, but it must be analyzed within the broader context of the evolving crypto landscape. By monitoring key metrics, staying informed, and considering multiple perspectives, crypto enthusiasts can gain a more nuanced understanding of market dynamics and make more informed decisions.

The latest financial report from Bitcoin mining giant BitDeer has dropped, and it’s sending shockwaves through the digital currency world. Buckle up as we dissect BitDeer’s colossal net loss of $532 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. This isn’t just a minor setback; it’s a financial earthquake compared to the mere $5 million loss they reported during the same period in 2023. What exactly happened, and what does this mean for the future of Bitcoin mining company and the broader crypto landscape? Decoding BitDeer’s Massive Q4 2024 Net Loss: A Deep Dive Let’s get straight to the heart of the matter: BitDeer’s Q4 2024 financial results are undeniably grim. A staggering $532 million net loss is not something you brush under the rug. To put this into perspective, imagine going from a small puddle of a $5 million loss to a tsunami of $532 million in just one year. That’s the scale of the downturn BitDeer has experienced. But where did it all go wrong? According to reports, the primary culprit behind this financial hemorrhage is a significant drop in revenue. We’re talking about a 40% year-on-year decrease, plummeting to $69 million. This revenue slump is attributed to a trifecta of challenges: Decline in Own Mining Operations: BitDeer’s core business, Bitcoin mining , appears to have taken a hit. This could be due to various factors, including increased mining difficulty, fluctuations in Bitcoin prices during the period, or operational inefficiencies. Reduced Hosting Services: BitDeer also provides hosting services for mining equipment. A decrease in this segment suggests fewer clients are utilizing their hosting facilities, potentially due to market shifts or increased competition. Cloud Hash Rate Services Under Pressure: Cloud hash rate services, which allow users to rent computing power for mining, have also suffered. This could indicate a reduced demand for cloud mining services, possibly driven by individual miners opting for other strategies or market uncertainty. To illustrate the severity of the situation, let’s compare the key financial results : Metric Q4 2024 Q4 2023 Year-on-Year Change Net Loss $532 Million $5 Million Increase of $527 Million Revenue $69 Million $115 Million (estimated – based on 40% decrease) Decrease of 40% Why is the Bitcoin Mining Sector Facing Headwinds? BitDeer’s predicament isn’t happening in a vacuum. The entire Bitcoin mining company landscape is facing a complex mix of challenges. Understanding these broader industry pressures can shed light on BitDeer’s specific situation and what it signals for the future of crypto mining. Increased Mining Difficulty: As more miners join the Bitcoin network, the computational difficulty of mining new blocks increases. This means miners need more computing power and energy to earn the same amount of Bitcoin, driving up costs. Bitcoin Price Volatility: The price of Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. Sharp price drops can significantly impact the profitability of mining operations, especially for companies with high operational costs. While Bitcoin’s price has seen periods of growth, Q4 2024 might have presented challenges. Rising Energy Costs: Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive. Fluctuations and increases in global energy prices directly impact mining profitability. Geopolitical events and energy market dynamics can play a significant role. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Uncertainty or stricter regulations in key mining regions can disrupt operations and increase compliance costs. Competition in the Mining Space: The Bitcoin mining industry is becoming increasingly competitive. New players with advanced technologies and access to cheaper energy sources are constantly entering the market, putting pressure on established companies like BitDeer. What’s Next for BitDeer and the Crypto Mining Industry? The massive BitDeer net loss serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks and volatility within the cryptocurrency sector. For BitDeer, the immediate priority will likely be to address the operational inefficiencies and revenue shortfalls that led to this financial downturn. This could involve: Optimizing Mining Operations: Improving efficiency, upgrading hardware, and potentially relocating mining facilities to regions with lower energy costs could be on the agenda. Diversifying Revenue Streams: Relying solely on Bitcoin mining revenue can be risky. BitDeer might explore diversifying into other crypto-related services or even expanding into different blockchain technologies. Cost Reduction Measures: Implementing strict cost control measures across all operations will be crucial to stem the financial bleeding. Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with other companies in the crypto space could offer opportunities for resource sharing and expansion into new markets. For the broader crypto mining industry, BitDeer’s experience highlights the need for resilience and adaptability. Companies must be prepared to navigate market volatility, regulatory changes, and increasing competition. Efficient operations, sound financial management, and strategic diversification are no longer optional – they are essential for survival and success in this dynamic landscape. Navigating the Crypto Downturn: Lessons from BitDeer’s Financial Shock BitDeer’s crypto downturn and significant losses are a sobering lesson for investors and participants in the cryptocurrency market. It underscores the importance of due diligence and a realistic understanding of the risks involved. While the potential rewards in crypto can be substantial, the potential for significant losses is equally real. Here are some key takeaways: Volatility is Inherent: The crypto market is characterized by extreme volatility. Financial results can swing dramatically, as evidenced by BitDeer’s shift from a minor loss to a massive one in a single year. Risk Management is Crucial: For companies and investors alike, robust risk management strategies are paramount. This includes diversifying investments, hedging against price fluctuations, and maintaining sufficient financial reserves. Operational Efficiency Matters: In competitive sectors like Bitcoin mining, operational efficiency is a key differentiator. Companies that can optimize their operations, control costs, and adapt to changing market conditions are more likely to thrive. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The crypto landscape is constantly evolving. Staying informed about market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements is essential for making informed decisions and adapting to change. Conclusion: A Wake-Up Call for the Bitcoin Mining World BitDeer’s $532 million net loss in Q4 2024 is more than just a company-specific issue; it’s a powerful signal for the entire Bitcoin mining ecosystem. It serves as a potent reminder of the challenges and risks inherent in this volatile market. While the long-term potential of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency remains a topic of ongoing debate and optimism, the short-term realities can be harsh. Companies operating in this space must be prepared for turbulent times, prioritize efficiency and adaptability, and navigate the ever-changing landscape with caution and strategic foresight. The crypto world is full of promise, but it demands resilience and a keen understanding of its inherent financial shockwaves.

Furthermore, it highlights a trend of companies, both within and outside the crypto space, recognizing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset but as a legitimate store of value and a crucial component of modern financial strategy. This strategic accumulation by a publicly traded company like Bitcoin Depot adds another layer of validation to Bitcoin’s role in the global economy. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market? Bitcoin Depot’s move is more than just a company increasing its holdings; it’s a symbolic gesture that resonates throughout the crypto market. Here’s why this news is significant: Positive Market Sentiment: Such announcements from publicly listed companies can boost market confidence and attract further Bitcoin investment , both from institutional and retail investors. Institutional Adoption Signal: It reinforces the narrative of increasing institutional adoption of Bitcoin. When companies like Bitcoin Depot publicly commit to holding Bitcoin, it sends a positive message to other corporations considering similar strategies. Validation of Bitcoin’s Use Case: This action further validates Bitcoin’s utility as a store of value and a viable treasury asset, moving beyond its initial perception as solely a speculative investment.

The bill was sponsored by five Republicans: Representatives Logan Manhart, Aaron Aylward, Phil Jensen, Dylan Jordan, and Senators Carl Perry and Tom Pischke. The South Dakota bill would have allowed the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of the state’s investment portfolio for BTC. Ultimately, concerns about volatility may have shut the bill down. Montana state lawmakers made a similar decision yesterday when they shot down a bill that would have enabled the state government to invest in BTC as a reserve asset. The Montana bill, which passed a committee vote last week, would have created “a state special revenue account for investment in precious metals and digital assets,” with digital assets defined as “virtual currencies, cryptocurrencies, native electronic assets, including stablecoins and non-fungible tokens, and other digital-only assets that confer economic, proprietary, or access rights or powers.” BTC is trading for $87,140 at time of writing, down 18% in the last 30 days.

40830726,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134027,1740512548,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Action: Durbin’s Bold Bill to Combat Crypto ATM Scams and Protect Users,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/durbin-bill-combat-crypto-atm-fraud/,"The world of cryptocurrency, while brimming with innovation and opportunity, also presents its share of challenges, particularly in safeguarding users from illicit activities. A growing area of concern is the rise of fraud associated with cryptocurrency ATMs. Senator Dick Durbin is stepping into the fray with a new legislative proposal aimed at clamping down on these scams and bolstering consumer protection within the digital asset space. Let’s dive into the details of the Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act and understand what it means for the future of crypto ATMs and user safety. Why is Crypto ATM Fraud a Growing Concern? Cryptocurrency ATMs, designed to offer a convenient bridge between the traditional financial world and the digital currency realm, have unfortunately become a hotspot for fraudulent activities. These machines, allowing users to buy and sometimes sell cryptocurrencies using cash or debit cards, are increasingly being exploited by scammers. Reports from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs highlight a disturbing trend: a surge in illicit transactions and scams routed through these ATMs. Consider these points illustrating the escalating problem of crypto ATM fraud : Accessibility & Anonymity: Crypto ATMs often require less stringent KYC (Know Your Customer) verification compared to online exchanges, making them attractive for those seeking anonymity and potentially facilitating illicit activities. Scam Vulnerability: New users, less familiar with the intricacies of cryptocurrency, are particularly vulnerable to sophisticated scams orchestrated near or through these ATMs. Scammers often prey on this lack of understanding, guiding victims to use crypto ATMs for fraudulent transactions. Lack of Regulation: The relatively nascent regulatory framework surrounding crypto ATMs has created loopholes that bad actors exploit. This bill aims to address some of these regulatory gaps. The urgency of the situation is underscored by the increasing number of reported incidents, prompting lawmakers like Senator Durbin to take decisive action. What Does the Durbin Crypto Bill Propose to Tackle Crypto ATM Scams? Senator Durbin’s Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act is a multi-pronged approach designed to directly confront the rising tide of crypto ATM scams . The bill introduces several key measures aimed at protecting consumers and enhancing oversight of crypto ATM operations. Here’s a breakdown of the core components of the proposed legislation: Provision Description Benefit Daily Transaction Limits for New Users Imposes a $2,000 daily transaction limit for new users of crypto ATMs. Reduces the potential damage from scams targeting new users who might be persuaded to make large initial transactions. Mandatory Fraud Warnings Requires clear and conspicuous fraud warnings to be displayed at crypto ATMs. Educates users about common crypto scams and encourages caution before transacting. Full Refunds for Scams Mandates full refunds for scam victims who report incidents within 30 days of the fraudulent transaction. Provides a safety net for victims and incentivizes reporting of scams. Anti-Fraud Program Requirement Obliges crypto ATM operators to establish and implement comprehensive anti-fraud programs. Ensures operators take proactive steps to prevent and detect fraudulent activities. Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) Requires operators to appoint a dedicated Chief Compliance Officer to oversee the anti-fraud program. Assigns responsibility and accountability within the operator’s organization for compliance and fraud prevention. Reporting to FinCEN Mandates operators to report their anti-fraud policies and compliance efforts to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Enhances regulatory oversight and allows FinCEN to monitor and assess industry-wide fraud prevention measures. These provisions, working in concert, aim to create a more secure environment for crypto ATM users and deter fraudulent activities. What are the Potential Benefits of Stronger Cryptocurrency Regulation on ATMs? The Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act, if enacted, could bring about several positive changes to the cryptocurrency regulation landscape, specifically concerning ATMs. These benefits extend to both individual users and the broader crypto ecosystem. Enhanced Consumer Protection: The most immediate benefit is stronger protection for consumers, particularly those new to crypto. Transaction limits, fraud warnings, and refund policies act as vital safeguards. Reduced Scam Incidence: By making it harder for scammers to exploit crypto ATMs, the bill aims to decrease the overall incidence of crypto ATM scams and related financial losses for individuals. Increased Trust in Crypto ATMs: Improved security measures can foster greater trust and confidence in crypto ATMs as legitimate access points to the digital asset market. This could encourage wider adoption and usage, particularly among less tech-savvy individuals. Legitimization of the Crypto Industry: Proactive measures to combat fraud contribute to the overall legitimization of the cryptocurrency industry. Demonstrating a commitment to user safety and regulatory compliance is crucial for mainstream acceptance. Level Playing Field for Operators: Requiring all operators to adhere to anti-fraud standards creates a more level playing field and prevents unscrupulous operators from gaining an unfair advantage by neglecting security measures. By addressing the vulnerabilities of crypto ATMs, this bill could pave the way for a more secure and trustworthy environment for digital asset transactions. Challenges and Considerations for the Durbin Crypto Bill While the Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act is a commendable step towards addressing digital asset security concerns, its implementation and effectiveness may face certain challenges and require careful consideration. Some potential challenges include: Impact on Legitimate Users: Transaction limits, while aimed at preventing fraud, might inconvenience legitimate users who require larger transactions for valid purposes. Striking a balance between security and user accessibility is crucial. Enforcement Complexity: Monitoring and enforcing compliance across a potentially vast network of crypto ATM operators could be complex and resource-intensive for regulatory bodies like FinCEN. Evolving Scam Tactics: Scammers are known for their adaptability. As regulations tighten in one area, they may shift tactics or find new loopholes to exploit. Continuous monitoring and adaptive regulatory responses are essential. Technological Implementation: Implementing fraud warnings and refund mechanisms effectively across diverse ATM platforms and software systems might present technical challenges for operators. Industry Pushback: Crypto ATM operators might resist certain provisions of the bill, citing concerns about compliance costs or potential impacts on their business models. Open dialogue and collaboration between regulators and industry stakeholders are important. Addressing these challenges proactively will be vital to ensuring the bill’s success in effectively mitigating crypto ATM fraud without unduly hindering legitimate use and innovation in the crypto space. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Users and the Industry? For crypto users, the proposed legislation is a positive development signaling increased attention to consumer protection within the digital asset ecosystem. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Be aware of the rising risks of crypto ATM scams and educate yourself about common scam tactics. Exercise Caution: Approach crypto ATMs with caution, especially if you are a new user. Be wary of unsolicited advice or pressure to make quick transactions. Report Suspicious Activity: If you suspect you’ve been targeted by a scam or encountered fraudulent activity at a crypto ATM, report it to the operator and relevant authorities immediately. Support Responsible Regulation: Advocate for sensible regulations that protect users without stifling innovation in the crypto industry. For the crypto ATM industry, the bill underscores the need for proactive measures to enhance security and compliance. Operators should: Implement Robust Anti-Fraud Programs: Go beyond minimum requirements and develop comprehensive anti-fraud programs that are continuously updated to address evolving threats. Prioritize User Education: Invest in user education initiatives to help customers understand the risks and use crypto ATMs safely. Engage with Regulators: Maintain open communication and collaboration with regulatory bodies like FinCEN to ensure compliance and contribute to the development of effective regulatory frameworks. Conclusion: A Necessary Step Towards a Safer Crypto Future Senator Durbin’s Crypto ATM Fraud Prevention Act represents a significant and welcome step towards addressing the growing problem of fraud in the cryptocurrency ATM space. By introducing transaction limits, mandatory warnings, and operator accountability, the bill aims to create a safer and more trustworthy environment for users. While challenges to implementation and enforcement exist, the overarching goal of protecting consumers and fostering responsible growth in the digital asset industry is undeniably crucial. This legislation underscores the increasing recognition among policymakers of the need for thoughtful and effective cryptocurrency regulation to unlock the full potential of digital assets while mitigating their inherent risks. It’s a move that could instill greater confidence in the crypto market and pave the way for wider adoption as users feel more secure in their transactions.

While Ethereum (ETH) and XRP continue to dominate the altcoin space, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains one of the most talked-about meme coins. But as investors shift away from pure speculation, many are looking for early-stage opportunities with higher upside potential. One emerging altcoin is capturing attention: The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) . Unlike Ethereum, which has already cemented its role in DeFi, and Dogecoin, which relies on social media hype, TLD merges Web3 gaming with DeFi, making it a high-growth project with real adoption potential. Could $TLD outperform Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin in 2025? Let’s break it down. Ethereum (ETH) – The Smart Contract King Remains a Strong Investment Ethereum has maintained its position as the leading smart contract blockchain, powering the DeFi, NFT, and dApp ecosystem. With the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade enhancing scalability and reducing gas fees, ETH remains a top choice for long-term investors. However, Ethereum’s market cap exceeding $350 billion means its potential for exponential gains is limited compared to smaller, high-growth projects. While ETH is a solid long-term bet, investors seeking 100x opportunities are looking at smaller-cap altcoins with higher upside potential. XRP – Banking on Institutional Adoption XRP has been one of the most resilient cryptocurrencies, with a strong use case in cross-border payments. After winning a partial victory against the SEC, XRP has seen renewed investor confidence, making it a safer bet in the altcoin market. Despite this, XRP’s price movements have been relatively slow, and with institutional adoption still in progress, traders looking for faster gains are exploring newer projects with high-growth potential. Dogecoin (DOGE) – The Meme Coin Leader, but How Much Growth Is Left? Dogecoin remains the top meme coin, but its growth potential is uncertain. DOGE continues to be backed by Elon Musk’s influence, but its use case is limited, and investor interest tends to fluctuate based on social media trends. With meme coin hype cooling off, traders are turning toward altcoins with strong ecosystems and real-world utility—which is where $TLD enters the picture. The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) – The Crypto Investment Project that Changes The Game While Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin are established names, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) is positioning itself as one of the most promising new altcoins in 2025. TLD merges Web3 gaming with DeFi, allowing players to mine, stake, and earn tokens while accessing high-potential crypto projects through its Gamified Launchpad. This unique Play-to-Invest model gives $TLD a real use case beyond speculation, setting it apart from traditional altcoins. TLD is gaining momentum due to its rapidly growing user base. More than 300,000 users have already onboarded, ensuring strong early adoption. Its deep integration with the TON blockchain and Telegram provides access to over 900 million potential users, making mass adoption seamless. The project stands at the intersection of two of the fastest-growing blockchain sectors, Web3 gaming and DeFi, giving it a unique advantage over traditional altcoins. With a significantly lower market cap than ETH and XRP, its upside potential is much higher, attracting investors looking for the next major growth opportunity. Final Thoughts – Is The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) the Best Crypto to Buy Now? Ethereum and XRP are safe, long-term bets, while Dogecoin still holds meme coin dominance. However, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) offers the most upside potential due to its unique Web3 gaming model and rapidly expanding ecosystem. With $TLD’s presale nearly sold out, this is the last chance to buy at $0.0085 before the next price increase. Investors can also earn up to 300% APY through staking and receive 15% extra tokens through the Ref2Earn program. As analysts predict that the blockchain gaming industry could surpass $60 billion by 2028, $TLD could be one of the best-performing altcoins in 2025 .

40830850,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134028,1740512701,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionizing Customs: DocUnlock’s AI Platform Unlocks Supply Chain Efficiency,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-unlocks-customs-bottleneck/,"Frustrated by tedious import paperwork? Imagine a world where customs processes are streamlined, efficient, and less of a headache. That’s the vision driving DocUnlock, an innovative AI platform poised to revolutionize how goods enter the U.S. and potentially global markets. For anyone involved in cryptocurrency and global trade, understanding the movement of goods is crucial, and DocUnlock is stepping in to make that process significantly smoother using cutting-edge AI. The Painful Reality of Customs Bottlenecks Every product entering the United States, from your online clothing order to massive container ship cargo, requires customs declarations. This ensures importers pay the correct taxes and adhere to regulations. However, for commercial importers, the current system is far from seamless. The process is often: Manual: Relying heavily on manual data entry and paperwork. Tedious: Consuming countless hours filling out complex forms. Error-prone: Increased risk of mistakes due to manual handling of large datasets. Large importers have historically addressed this challenge in two primary ways: Building In-House Solutions: Developing proprietary software, which is costly and requires ongoing maintenance. Outsourcing to Customs Brokers: Hiring external brokers to manage the paperwork, adding an extra layer of cost. Both approaches have limitations. In-house solutions demand significant resources, while outsourcing adds expense. This is where DocUnlock steps in with a game-changing AI platform designed to transform the customs brokerage landscape. DocUnlock: An AI Platform for Customs Brokers DocUnlock is not aiming to replace customs brokers. Instead, it empowers them. This innovative platform serves as a powerful tool for customs brokers to dramatically improve their efficiency in handling import documentation. How does it work? Email Integration: DocUnlock seamlessly integrates with a customs broker’s existing email system. Automated Data Capture: The platform intelligently forwards relevant emails and attached documents to DocUnlock. AI-Powered Data Extraction: DocUnlock’s core strength lies in its sophisticated artificial intelligence . It automatically aggregates unstructured data from emails and documents. Form Population: The extracted data is then used to automatically populate the necessary customs forms. Broker Oversight: Crucially, customs brokers retain control. DocUnlock flags critical details, allowing brokers to leverage their expertise for compliance and accurate classification. Sepehr Fakour, co-founder of DocUnlock, emphasizes this collaborative approach: “We will flag certain important details to them and just really make their lives way easier and more efficient. They can focus on doing what they’re best at which is using their domain knowledge to make sure that everything is being done according to customs regulations and everything is classified correctly, etc., and not spending their time manually pushing copy and paste for eight hours a day.” Born from Frustration: Solving a Personal Pain Point The genesis of DocUnlock is rooted in firsthand experience. Ned Cartmell, Fakour’s co-founder, encountered the customs documentation bottleneck during his time at Flexport, a prominent player in the logistics and supply chain industry. Cartmell witnessed various attempts to solve this problem, ranging from bespoke software development to manual fixes and external solutions. Despite improvements at Flexport, Cartmell felt the core issue remained largely unresolved. “Ultimately, we made a big improvement in the way that worked for Flexport but didn’t come close to eliminating it the way that we thought we would be able to,” Cartmell explained to Bitcoin World. “So I kind of got obsessed with the problem.” The breakthrough came with the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence in 2022. Cartmell and Fakour recognized the potential of AI to tackle this persistent challenge. They engaged with numerous customs brokers to validate Cartmell’s experience and gauge industry-wide pain points. The response was overwhelmingly positive. Fakour recounted a particularly telling early interaction: “Even the very first one, the broker sitting across from us in the in the Zoom call, like, almost like grabbing hold of us and saying, ‘Please don’t leave us without doing something.’ That seemed like a pretty strong signal of validation.” Rapid Growth and Strong Validation Founded in 2023, DocUnlock quickly moved from concept to reality. Starting with a basic prototype, the company secured early customers, demonstrating the immediate need for their solution. This initial traction fueled further development and refinement of the AI platform . DocUnlock has experienced significant growth since its inception. While specific customer numbers remain undisclosed, the company boasts a 100% customer retention rate, a testament to the platform’s value. Word-of-mouth referrals are also driving substantial growth, indicating strong customer satisfaction. Recent financial backing further validates DocUnlock’s potential. The company secured $3 million in pre-seed funding from a mix of venture capital firms, including GTMFund and Barrel Ventures, and prominent angel investors. Notably, investors include Nicolas Dessaigne and Julien Lemoine, co-founders of Algolia (Fakour’s former employer), and early Flexport employees – individuals with deep understanding of both technology and the logistics industry. A Massive Market Ripe for Disruption The scale of the customs brokerage market is immense. In 2024 alone, over $4.1 trillion worth of goods were imported into the U.S. This staggering figure underscores the sheer volume of customs paperwork processed annually. The customs broker market itself is highly fragmented, comprising thousands of companies in the U.S. – from small, family-run businesses to large corporations – and countless more internationally. This fragmented and sprawling market presents a significant opportunity for DocUnlock. Their AI platform is designed to address a universal pain point across this diverse landscape. By automating the most tedious aspects of a customs broker’s job, DocUnlock allows them to refocus on their core expertise: navigating the complex and ever-evolving world of customs regulations. The Future of Customs: Efficiency and Expertise DocUnlock’s vision is clear: to transform the customs process from a cumbersome bottleneck into a streamlined, efficient operation. By leveraging artificial intelligence , they are not just automating tasks; they are empowering customs brokers to operate at a higher level, focusing on strategic decision-making and expert compliance management. Cartmell aptly summarizes the often-overlooked importance of customs processes: “It’s something that people really know nothing about. And, you know, sort of for good reason. It’s happening in the background, but it’s touching everything. Every time anything enters or leaves any country, there’s this process that happens.” DocUnlock is poised to bring this background process into the future, making it faster, more accurate, and ultimately, more efficient for everyone involved in global trade and supply chain management. This is a powerful step forward, unlocking potential improvements across the entire import ecosystem.

Forty Republicans and one Democrat in Montana’s House of Representatives voted for the bill, but 41 Democrats and 18 Republicans rejected it.

Montana isn’t the only state to mull crypto reserve legislation this year: Earlier this month, West Virginia Senator Chris Rose introduced a bill that would allow the state to invest up to 10% of public funds into the same types of assets. Legislators in Texas, Utah and Arizona are also considering similar proposals. Bitcoin is trading at $92,029 at time of writing.

Amazon is gearing up to host a highly anticipated Alexa-centric event this Wednesday in the bustling heart of New York City. For those in the crypto and tech world, this isn’t just another gadget launch; it’s a glimpse into the evolving landscape of AI and its integration into everyday life, much like the decentralized technologies we are passionate about. With the last major device showcase nearly two years behind us (September 2023), the tech giant is expected to make some significant waves. Bitcoin World will be on the ground, bringing you real-time updates as they unfold, because while the event won’t be live-streamed, the insights gained are too crucial to miss. What’s Buzzing at the Amazon Alexa Event? Under the leadership of Panos Panay, Amazon’s new devices and services chief and a former Microsoft Surface luminary, the event kicks off at 10 a.m. Eastern. The stakes are undeniably high. Amazon’s Alexa venture, despite its widespread presence in hundreds of millions of homes, has reportedly been a multi-billion dollar drain. CEO Andy Jassy has reportedly tasked the hardware division with a critical mission: to chart a course towards profitability, likely through innovative monetization strategies such as subscriptions, service fees, and value-added offerings. Wednesday could be the day we see the curtain lifted on one of these pivotal subscription models. The Dawn of Generative AI Alexa: A New Era of Smart Assistance Whispers within the industry suggest Amazon is poised to unveil a dramatically enhanced Generative AI Alexa experience, internally dubbed ‘Remarkable Alexa.’ The ambition? To make conversations with Alexa feel as fluid and intuitive as engaging with advanced AI models like ChatGPT. Imagine an Alexa that truly understands context, anticipates your needs, and responds with human-like nuance. This isn’t just about voice commands anymore; it’s about creating a genuine AI companion within your home. The rumored price point for this premium, upgraded Alexa experience is between $5 and $10 per month. But what will this subscription unlock? Multi-Command Mastery: Forget sequential requests. The new Alexa is said to handle multiple commands in a single breath, streamlining your interactions. Autonomous Actions: Imagine delegating tasks to Alexa and letting it proactively manage them, learning your preferences and routines over time. Contextual Awareness: Building on teasers from the 2023 event, this Alexa promises to leverage generative AI to grasp the context of your requests, leading to more personalized and relevant responses. Amazon hinted at these capabilities last year, promising backward compatibility with existing devices. The integration of generative AI is key to delivering this enhanced, personalized experience. Elevating the Smart Home Experience with Amazon Alexa Beyond just conversational AI, improved Smart Home capabilities are expected to be a central theme at the event. Reports indicate collaborations between Amazon and numerous companies, leveraging developer tools announced in 2023. Think deeper integrations and more intuitive control over your connected devices. Amazon’s previous announcements highlighted partnerships with brands like iRobot and Philips, focusing on features that simplify ‘scene controls’ and enable Alexa to better interpret user intent for their devices. For example, imagine saying “Alexa, goodnight,” and having it not only turn off the lights but also adjust the thermostat, lock the doors, and set your smart coffee maker for the morning – all based on learned routines and preferences. Navigating the Challenges of Generative AI in Amazon Alexa However, the integration of generative AI isn’t without its hurdles. A critical question looms: can this new, AI-infused Amazon Alexa overcome the inherent flaws of current generative AI technology? Reports from late last year painted a picture of an early iteration of the upgraded Alexa struggling with even basic commands, like toggling smart lights. Generative AI’s tendency to occasionally ‘hallucinate’ or provide inaccurate information raises concerns about reliability, especially when compared to the more predictable, rule-based systems that underpin today’s Alexa. The silver lining is that the delays in the upgraded Alexa’s launch have afforded Amazon valuable time to refine the technology and mitigate potential errors. Yet, the inherent unpredictability of generative AI means there’s always a degree of uncertainty. It’s a balancing act between pushing the boundaries of AI and ensuring a seamless, dependable user experience. Classic vs. Remarkable: Your Choice with Alexa Subscriptions In a user-friendly move, it appears the new Alexa Subscriptions and upgraded experience won’t be forced upon users. Reports suggest Amazon will offer the option to stick with the familiar ‘Classic Alexa’ experience. This provides users with control and flexibility, allowing them to adopt the new AI features at their own pace. However, the timeline for this choice remains somewhat unclear. Recent reports from The Washington Post indicate a delay in the upgraded Alexa’s rollout, initially planned for earlier this month. The culprit? Inaccurate answers during internal testing. Sources suggest the launch might be pushed back to late March or even later. This delay underscores the complexity of deploying cutting-edge AI at scale and Amazon’s commitment to delivering a polished, reliable product. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of AI at Home Amazon’s upcoming Alexa event is poised to be more than just a product showcase; it’s a potential window into the future of AI in our homes. The integration of generative AI into Alexa promises a more intuitive, personalized, and capable smart assistant. While challenges remain in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of this technology, the potential benefits for user experience and smart home automation are immense. For those in the cryptocurrency and decentralized technology space, this event highlights the broader trend of AI permeating various aspects of our lives, mirroring the transformative potential we see in blockchain and digital currencies.

This announcement is more than just adding a new token to a platform; it’s about accessibility and expansion within the cryptocurrency space, particularly for New York residents. New York, with its stringent regulatory environment, often sees delays in cryptocurrency service rollouts. Coinbase securing the green light to offer Marinade (MNDE) trading in New York signifies a positive step towards broader crypto adoption in a key financial hub. Let’s break down why this is such a significant move: Increased Access to DeFi for New Yorkers: Marinade is a prominent player in the Solana DeFi space, offering users opportunities for staking and yield generation. By listing MNDE for New York users, Coinbase is effectively lowering the barrier to entry for New Yorkers wanting to participate in Solana DeFi. Validation for Marinade (MNDE): Coinbase’s decision to support Marinade (MNDE) adds a layer of credibility and validation to the project. Coinbase is known for its rigorous listing process, and inclusion on this platform often signals a project’s maturity and potential. Enhanced Liquidity and Trading Opportunities: Listing on a major exchange like Coinbase typically leads to increased liquidity for the token.

Search for Marinade (MNDE): Once logged in, use the search function to find Marinade (MNDE) . It should now be listed as available for trading in New York. Review Trading Pair: Typically, MNDE will be paired with USD (MNDE-USD). Ensure you are selecting the correct trading pair. Place Your Order: You can choose between different order types like market orders (executed at the current market price) or limit orders (you set a specific price). Enter the amount of MNDE you wish to buy or sell. Confirm the Transaction: Review all the details of your order before confirming. Coinbase will show you the transaction fees and the final amount. Once you confirm, the trade will be executed. Secure Your MNDE: After purchasing MNDE , consider your storage options. You can keep it on Coinbase for ease of trading or withdraw it to a personal wallet for self-custody and potential participation in Marinade governance or DeFi activities. Are there any challenges or considerations for crypto trading MNDE in New York? While this is a positive development, it’s essential to be aware of potential challenges and considerations when trading cryptocurrency , particularly in a regulated environment like New York: Regulatory Scrutiny: New York’s regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. While Coinbase has secured approval for MNDE trading, future regulatory changes could impact the availability or conditions of trading. It’s crucial to stay informed about any updates. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Marinade (MNDE) , like other cryptocurrencies, can experience significant price swings.

With LIBRA’s influence and major investors shifting their funds to rival altcoins, Solana price could drop back to $120. While SOL remains a strong player in the blockchain industry, concerns over its short-term price fluctuations are growing. Meanwhile, new platforms like DTX Exchange are gaining traction in their presale and are currently in the bonus stage, offering tokens at $0.18. With $15.08 million already raised, this is the last opportunity to buy at this price before it gets listed. Will investors stick with Solana or explore new opportunities like DTX? Solana Price Growth And Market Strength Solana (SOL) is a fast and low-cost blockchain. It uses a unique system Proof-of-History (PoH), and handles up to 65,000 transactions per second. Because it is quick and efficient, many DeFi projects, NFTs, and big investors use it. Solana price recently hit $156.3, with a market value of $77.98 billion. SOL is currently ranked #6 among cryptocurrencies. This considerable growth shows how important Solana has become in the crypto market. Source: CoinMarketcap Weekly Chart: Solana Price Solana price recently hit $156.3, with a daily trading volume of $3.45 billion. Its highest price was $294.3 in January 2025, while its lowest was just $0.5 in May 2020. Many investors see it as a strong and reliable cryptocurrency. However, SOL prices still change a lot due to market conditions. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange is gaining attention with its advanced trading features and multi-asset investment options. With its launch approaching, more traders are looking at DTX as a new investment opportunity. Market Trends: Solana and DTX’s Growing Influence Solana (SOL) is still a big name in the crypto market because of its fast blockchain and strong use in DeFi and NFT projects. It can handle many transactions and has a market value of $77.98 billion, making it popular with developers and investors. However, recent Solana price changes have worried some people about its short-term stability. Many are watching to see if it can recover or drop further. Despite this, it remains one of the top cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange is becoming popular as a trading platform with a 475 million token supply. It lets users invest in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex and offers features like copy trading and automatic investment management. Its presale has raised $15.08 million, and with the launch coming soon, more investors are showing interest. Many believe it could become a strong competitor in the market. Its fast transactions and advanced features make it attractive to traders. DTX: A New Era for DeFi Trading A rapidly growing trading platform, DTX Exchange lets users invest in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex all in one place. It has quickly gained attention, raising $15.08 million in its presale. The token is currently priced at $0.18 in the bonus round, with a listing price of $0.36. DTX runs on the ERC-20 network and can process 200,000 transactions per second faster than many other exchanges. It uses VulcanX and offers features like trading small parts of different assets, copying trades, and an automatic investment manager. Investors can also use the Phoenix Wallet, which has been downloaded over 275,000 times, to store crypto and real-world assets safely.

40831228,https://coingape.com/?p=240963,1740513544,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Bitcoin Crash: Why BTC Price Suddenly Falling Today?,https://coingape.com/bitcoin-crash-why-btc-price-suddenly-falling-today/,"Bitcoin price has experienced a sharp decline, causing concern among investors. The BTC price has dropped to $86,586, down 8.71% in the last 24 hours. This sudden Bitcoin crash has led to massive liquidations in the cryptocurrency market, raising questions about what triggered this downturn. Trump’s Tariff Escalation Sparks Market Uncertainty One key factor behind the Bitcoin price crash is the recent escalation of tariff threats by former U.S. President Donald Trump. On February 24, Trump announced that sweeping tariffs on Canada and Mexico would take effect next week, ending a temporary pause. This follows his earlier executive order on February 1, imposing 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods and an additional 10% duty on Canadian energy. The re-escalation of trade tensions has contributed to uncertainty in global markets, affecting investor sentiment. As a result, Bitcoin, which is often seen as a risk-sensitive asset, has been impacted. The BTC price fell to $86,200 during Tuesday’s early European trading session, extending its losses from the previous day. The market reacted to the news with a series of liquidations totaling $1.34 billion, wiping out approximately 367,500 traders, according to Coinglass data. Bybit Hack Adds Pressure on Bitcoin Market The Bitcoin price crash was also influenced by last week’s security breach at the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange. Funds worth $1.4 billion were stolen, causing Bybit to lose around $2 billion in Bitcoin from its reserve, as reported by CryptoQuant. A total of 20,190 BTC was withdrawn from Bybit’s reserve from Friday to Tuesday, reaching levels last seen in early March 2024. The Bybit hack increased market anxiety, leading to more withdrawals as investors moved their assets to safer platforms. This contributed to the decline in BTC price, adding to the selling pressure already triggered by the tariff news. Despite assurances from Bitcoin proponents that the hack was linked to Ethereum’s vulnerabilities, the resulting market volatility affected Bitcoin as well. Massive Liquidations and Bearish Sentiment The Bitcoin price crash has caused a wave of liquidations across the cryptocurrency market. According to CoinGlass, nearly 390,000 traders were liquidated in the past 24 hours, resulting in a total loss of $1.59 billion. Most of these liquidations were from long positions, accounting for approximately 90% of the total. One of the largest liquidation orders occurred on the Justin Sun-affiliated exchange, HTX, where a single trader lost $39.62 million. This represented over 5% of all Bitcoin positions liquidated that day. As the BTC price dropped to $86,000, its lowest level since mid-November, analysts debated whether this was a temporary correction or a sign of a more extended downturn. Geoff Kendrick from Standard Chartered suggested that BTC price could fall to the low $80,000 range before a potential rebound. He noted, “Before buying the dip is attractive, I think we get a $1 billion ETF outflow day.” Meanwhile, market analyst Ali Martinez warned of a possible drop to $80,000 if Bitcoin price breaks below key support levels. Will Bitcoin Price Skyrocket $1M Despite the ongoing Bitcoin crash, some industry leaders remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term value. Binance’s co-founder, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), suggested that the current dip is just a step toward higher valuations, even predicting a future Bitcoin price of $1 million. He compared the situation to previous corrections, emphasizing that Bitcoin has historically rebounded after significant declines. Concurrently, Donald Trump’s son Eric Trump amid the Bitcoin crash has urged the holders to buy the BTC as the price plummets. However, on-chain data indicates a decline in Bitcoin network activity, with the number of new addresses dropping to 240,534 daily, the lowest since July 2024. This decrease in network adoption points to weakening demand, which has historically correlated with price declines. Currently, Bitcoin price is trading at $87,086 with a 24-hour trading volume of $89.1 billion. Analysts are closely watching the $86,000 support level and the potential for a relief rally if BTC price rebounds from the 1-day 200 EMA.

40831271,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=134037,1740513566,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Explosive Growth: Lovable, the AI App-Building Platform, Secures $16M Funding",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-app-building-platform-funding/,"In the fast-evolving world of technology, especially within the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the ability to rapidly prototype and deploy applications is paramount. Imagine a world where anyone, regardless of coding expertise, can build functional software. This vision is rapidly becoming a reality thanks to platforms like Lovable. This Swedish startup is making waves by democratizing software creation through its innovative AI app-building platform . After experiencing spectacular growth and capturing the attention of the tech community, Lovable has just announced a significant $16 million pre-Series A funding round, signaling a major leap forward for no-code app development . What Makes Lovable’s AI App-Building Platform Revolutionary? Traditional software development often requires specialized skills and significant resources. Lovable is changing the game by leveraging generative AI software to empower anyone to create applications simply by describing their needs. Unlike other AI coding tools primarily aimed at professional engineers, Lovable targets a broader audience, making app creation accessible to everyone. Here’s what sets Lovable apart: User-Friendly Approach: Lovable’s platform is designed for ease of use. Users don’t need to write a single line of code. Instead, they use natural language prompts to guide the AI in building their applications. Production-Ready Software: Lovable isn’t just about prototyping. Its GPT Engineer is capable of shipping fully functional web applications, meaning users can create and deploy real-world software solutions. Impressive Scale: The platform boasts a staggering 500,000 users who are collectively building over 25,000 new products every single day. This level of activity underscores the platform’s appeal and usability. Rapid Growth and Efficiency: Lovable has reached $17 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) with 30,000 paying customers, making it one of the fastest-growing startups in Europe. Remarkably, this milestone was achieved with only $2 million in capital expenditure after an initial €6.8 million pre-seed round. The Secret Sauce: Combining Powerful AI Models Founder Anton Osika emphasizes that Lovable stands out from competitors because it provides “the best way to get something that actually works.” This isn’t just marketing hype. Lovable achieves this reliability by intelligently combining the strengths of multiple leading AI models, including: OpenAI: Known for its powerful language models like GPT-3 and GPT-4, providing advanced text generation and understanding capabilities.

Lovable’s Journey: From Depict.ai to Revolutionizing App Creation Anton Osika’s journey to founding Lovable is rooted in a deep understanding of both AI and user needs. His previous venture, Depict.ai, a YC-backed company focused on applying machine learning to e-commerce, raised $20 million from prominent investors. This experience provided Osika with invaluable insights into the potential of AI and the challenges businesses face. Furthermore, Osika’s background is exceptionally diverse and impressive: Interface for Stephen Hawking’s Computer: He developed the user interface for the communication system used by the renowned physicist, demonstrating his early expertise in human-computer interaction. Wheelchair Technology with Ex-SpaceX Engineers: He collaborated on advanced wheelchair technology, showcasing his ability to work on complex engineering projects with cutting-edge teams. This rich background fueled Osika’s vision for Lovable. He recognized a massive opportunity to “give the 99% of the population who don’t know how to code access to a software engineer through AI.” This vision is at the heart of Lovable’s mission to democratize no-code app development . $16 Million Funding to Fuel Further Expansion The recent $16 million pre-Series A funding round, led by Creandum, is a testament to Lovable’s potential and early success. This funding will be crucial for several key areas: Expanding Third-Party Integrations: Lovable plans to integrate with more services like Supabase for databases and GitHub for code storage, enhancing the platform’s capabilities and developer workflow. Scaling Infrastructure: To support its rapidly growing user base and the increasing demand for its platform, Lovable will need to invest in robust infrastructure. Team Growth: Expanding the team will be essential to accelerate development, improve user support, and drive further innovation in the AI app-building platform space. Fredrik Cassel from Creandum drew a striking parallel, stating, “I haven’t seen this level of user love for a product since we invested in Spotify. It’s truly astounding. Lovable has the potential to become one of Europe’s next generational companies in this new era of AI.” The funding round also attracted notable angel investors, including figures from Meta, Hugging Face, and Modal, further validating Lovable’s vision and potential within the European AI startups ecosystem. The Future is No-Code: What Does Lovable Mean for the Tech World? Lovable’s rise is more than just a startup success story; it represents a significant shift in how software is created and accessed. Here’s why Lovable and the no-code app development movement are important: Democratization of Technology: By removing the coding barrier, Lovable empowers individuals and businesses who previously couldn’t participate in the app economy.

Accelerated Innovation: The speed and ease of app creation with Lovable can drastically reduce development cycles, allowing for faster experimentation and deployment of new ideas. Focus on Functionality, Not Just Code: Lovable allows users to focus on the core functionality and user experience of their applications, rather than getting bogged down in the technical complexities of coding. Potential for New Business Models: The accessibility of app creation can lead to the emergence of entirely new business models and digital services, driven by individuals and small teams. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain community, Lovable’s platform could be particularly transformative. Imagine quickly building decentralized applications (dApps) or tools to manage crypto assets without needing a team of blockchain developers. The possibilities are vast, and Lovable is at the forefront of making these possibilities a reality. The successful Lovable funding round is a clear indicator that investors and the tech community believe in this transformative potential.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP, DOGE, and SHIB face further declines, but Remittix (RTX) emerges as a potential lifeline for investors. Table of Contents Price action review of top altcoins in the last few weeks Why Remittix is favored to save crypto portfolios The recent change in direction from the early bullish outlook of top altcoins in 2025 has fueled panic in the market. However, while many investors continue to pull out of the market, some are moving to new, more rewarding assets to help mitigate the downturn. The recent crypto market overview suggests that many of the top altcoins are still set to undergo further decline, including coins such as XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). But as the panic continues, Remittix (RTX), a new altcoin in the crypto market, is opening up an opportunity that analysts believe could help investors save their portfolios. The RTX token is set to impact the crypto payment sector and $190 trillion cross-border payment market, which could offer investors substantial returns, even while the market remains in its downtrend. Price action review of top altcoins in the last few weeks Bearish momentum has hit the crypto market in the last few weeks, particularly for the top altcoins. To take it in context, XRP has seen a fall of about 30% in the last 30 days and a daily change of -8.16%. This fall follows the XRP withdrawal from the 2025 high of $3.39 set in January, which completed the 3 months bull run that started in November 2024. The bull run saw XRP rise over 500%, setting one of the best performances in the market’s top altcoins. The Dogecoin price has reverted from its high in December at $0.4835 and has continued to fall, currently trading at around $0.21. Many people believed the rise of Donald Trump and Elon Musk could offer a form of support that would help catapult DOGE to $1 this year. However, this has not been the case, with Dogecoin showing a strong tendency to fall even further as the price starts trading below the 7-month SMA. Similarly, the position of the Sh i ba Inu coin continues to be threatened with price action and bearish indicators that show it could drop out of the top altcoins soon. You might also like: XRP, ADA holders remain cautious, while this top crypto steals the show in Feb Why Remittix is favored to save crypto portfolios Investors banking on the Remittix token have continued to see their portfolios rise up to 3x in the past couple of months. This is because interest in the Remittix solution continues to win over investors across the crypto market, setting a pace that sees the coin rising every couple of days. As a result, the Remittix presale has raised over $12.7m in a few weeks. Analysts believe the combination of the Remittix solution and the growing importance of an easy to use solution for crypto-to-fiat payments is set to fuel a surge that could see the RTX token pump higher. Investors are continuing to snap up RTX tokens at discounted prices with the launch of the PayFi platform still on the way and RTX set to hit major exchanges in the next couple of months. The Remittix exchange is ushering in a change in the crypto payment sector which could transform the entire crypto landscape. There is high speculation that the price of Remittix will see a potential rise of up to 5,000% after it launches. As such, getting a stake in the Remittix token could make investors profit during and after the presale. For more information on Remittix, visit the website or socials .

The token's value has declined by 25% over the past two weeks and 9% in the last 24 hours. This downturn follows a scandal involving the Libra token, which lost 90% of its value in a short period, and a cooling of interest in meme coin initiatives that had previously favored the Solana network. The total market capitalization of meme coins on Solana fell from $25 billion in January to $9.8 billion, impacting popular tokens like Dogwifhat, Official Trump, and Pudgy Penguins. Despite the price drop, multiple asset managers, including Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, Bitwise, Canary, 21Shares, and VanEck, have applied for exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Solana's spot price.

HUD spokesperson Kasey Lovett told The New York Times that the incident was an “abuse of taxpayer resources” and confirmed authorities were working to identify and fire those responsible. HAHA. The monitors at the Housing and Urban Development building were hacked this morning and displayed an AI video of Donald Trump kissing Elon Musk’s feet, alongside the message: “LONG LIVE THE REAL KING.” pic.twitter.com/FPT6jvqBF1 — Republicans against Trump (@RpsAgainstTrump) February 24, 2025 The brief video, which appeared on HUD’s hallway screens on Monday, included a caption that read, “ Long Live the Real King .” The phrase was meant to ridicule Trump’s February 19 post on Truth Social, celebrating his administration’s decision to block New York City’s congestion pricing plan. AI video pops up after federal workers return to in-person working program The footage was looped repeatedly inside HUD’s offices on the same day all employees were required to return to in-person work, against the backdrop of Trump’s executive order to end remote work for federal workers. According to sources familiar with the situation, HUD officials were initially unable to determine how the department’s monitors were hacked and resorted to unplugging several devices to stop the video from playing.

Yet, several cabinet secretaries, including those involved in national security operations, advised their departments to ignore the directive due to the “sensitive nature” of their work. At HUD, some employees were worried about whether they were required to comply with Musk’s directive, but as of Tuesday, no agency-wide guidance had been issued. The Tesla CEO said on X yesterday that those who failed to answer the email “will be fired at the president’s discretion.” Is Musk overshadowing Trump? In a joint interview hosted by Fox News’ Sean Hannity on February 18, Trump referred to Musk as an enforcer of his administration’s policies, dismissing any allegations that the latter is “pulling the strings.” He tapped the Tesla CEO to oversee the operations of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) office, meant to cut-down wasteful government expenditure. “ You write an executive order, and you think it’s done, you send it out, it doesn’t get done. It doesn’t get implemented ,” Trump said in the interview. “ And some guy that maybe didn’t want to do it, all of a sudden, he’s signing it .” The president admitted in the Fox News interview that he was not acquainted with the billionaire until recently. “ I knew him a little bit through the White House originally ,” Trump said. “ But I didn’t know him before that. ” Still, liberal policymakers see Musk’s role as Trump’s de facto enforcer as an overreach of executive power. They believe the richest man in the world is the one running the government, and President Trump is just a yes man to what he is doing. “ It’s a level of incompetence that we’ve never seen before in government. To say that Elon Musk is not running the United States right now is really a fallacy ,” Senator Doug Jones told NBC News. A February 16-18 survey from Statista showed that out of 1,603 adults, 59% felt DOGE and co-founder Musk have “a lot” of perceived influence on the US President. Out of the figure, 42% of citizens aligned with the GOP party see Elon’s political influence on Washington as too much, but the number is much more amplified on the democratic side, clocking 80%.

BTC price dropped below the $90,000 support level for the first time in over three months, generating a negative sentiment among traders. Crypto traders have turned “fearful” after nearly six months of “neutral” and “greed,” per the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. Amidst the Bitcoin ( BTC ) price correction, a new trend has emerged among institutional investors. A five-day streak of net outflows on U.S. based Spot Bitcoin ETFs raises concern among traders. Are institutional investors giving up on Bitcoin? Is the BTC bull runover? We investigate the on-chain and technical indicators to identify the next big Bitcoin trade. Table of Contents Bitcoin supply on exchanges grows while whales dump BTC Institutional investors lose interest in Bitcoin, should you be worried? Are whales are dumping Bitcoin The next big Bitcoin trade Expert commentary on where Bitcoin is headed next Bitcoin supply on exchanges grows while whales dump BTC Bitcoin made headlines after hitting the $100,000 milestone and a new all-time high above $109,000. After hitting an all-time high, Bitcoin price has declined under the influence of key market movers like declining institutional investor interest, U.S. macroeconomic developments, and supply on exchanges. On-chain data from Santiment shows that supply on exchanges is climbing at the same time as supply outside of exchanges (held by whale wallets) declines. Typically, this indicates entities holding BTC outside of exchanges are transferring holdings to exchange wallets after weeks of consistent accumulation. Bitcoin accumulation by non-exchange wallets was considered a bullish sign for BTC, therefore a decline in non-exchange holdings is considered an expectation of further decline in Bitcoin’s price. A key metric, BTC supply held by funds, is in decline, and this can be interpreted as a drop in Bitcoin holdings of institutions. This is consistent with spot Bitcoin net negative flows observed by Farside Investors.

Fund flow data from CoinShares shows that institutions have pulled $595 million from Bitcoin funds month-to-date. Week-to-date a total of $571 million has been pulled from Bitcoin funds, while Ethereum, Solana, XRP and multi-asset funds see inflows. Net week flows in crypto are dragged down by the outflows in Bitcoin-based funds. CoinShares compiled the data based on fund flows till February 21, after which the BTC supply on exchanges climbed. Bitcoin faced additional selling pressure between February 21 and 25, pushing BTC price lower, under the $90,000 support. Crypto fund flows compiled by CoinShares | Source: CoinShares MicroStrategy stock tumbles, analysts at 10x Research explained the correlation between MSTR and Bitcoin’s price trend. Markus Thielen, the CEO of 10x Research explains that investors viewed MSTR as a leveraged Bitcoin call option, and failed to recognize that they were overpaying significantly, the stock traded 60% above its fair value, according to their February 24 report . When MSTR shares peaked, the stock traded $40 billion in volume on November 21, 2024 and Thielen believes that it is likely that investors offloaded part of their positions to retail buyers. MSTR buyers are, therefore, likely sitting on significant losses — despite Bitcoin’s price remaining flat over the same period. MSTR stock’s performance and demand therefore influence the sentiment of traders treating it as a leveraged Bitcoin call option. BTC price drop under the $90,000 level, therefore, has a critical impact on these traders and retail holders of Bitcoin as a market dynamic shift is underway. Are whales are dumping Bitcoin Santiment data on Bitcoin on-chain analysis shows a decline in whale transactions in two segments, valued at $100,000 or more, $1 million and higher. The downward trend in the transaction count of the two segments started on February 3. Throughout the past two weeks, whale transactions in both segments declined, while profit-taking, measured by the Network realized profit/loss metric, continued. Whales shed their BTC holdings while taking profits. Typically, consistent profit-taking can increase the selling pressure on a token and have a negative impact on price. The Santiment chart below shows the decline in BTC price alongside the dropping count of whale transactions and relatively high and consistent profit-taking by Bitcoin traders. Bitcoin on-chain analysis | Source: Santiment The next big Bitcoin trade Bitcoin price slipped under key support at the $90,000 level on Tuesday. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $88,976.24. The technical indicators on the Bitcoin price chart support further correction in Bitcoin price. Three key support levels that BTC could bounce from are S1, S2, and S3 at $85,072, $81,500, and $76,900. These three support levels coincide with the upper/lower boundaries of fair value gaps on the BTC/USDT daily price chart. The next key support after $90,000 is the pre-election level of $70,577. A breakdown of this support could send Bitcoin to collect liquidity at $67,476. The likelihood of a massive drawdown in Bitcoin is less likely, but February opened with a flashcrash to the $91,230 low on the third. BTC is currently 12% below its $100,000 milestone, and sufficient buying pressure and positive macroeconomic developments could push the token higher. BTC/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news Markus Thielen of 10xResearch presents his technical perspective on Bitcoin price in the latest publication on February 25. In the report, Thielen explains that from a technical analysis perspective, Bitcoin appears to be trading within an Ascending Broadening Wedge pattern. 2025: Ascending broadening wedge | Source: 10xResearch.co Thielen’s three key observations are the widening price action, a wedge-like shape that has emerged in Bitcoin price chart, a partial rise and a setup that suggests correction is impending and a pattern that forms at the end of the prolonged uptrend. Thielen says: “If Bitcoin follows the expected outcome of this pattern, a downside breakout could occur. However, confirmation from volume trends and further price action would be necessary before drawing definitive conclusions.” Expert commentary on where Bitcoin is headed next Ilman Shazhaev, Founder & CEO of Dizzaract discussed Bybit’s hack and the impact on Bitcoin price. Shazhaev told Crypto.news in an exclusive interview: “The Bybit hack has proven that communities can work together on a single mission. The Lazarus Group disrupted the trading platform when it laundered a total of 401,346 ETH stolen, valued at approximately $1.4 billion. Despite the mild retracement recorded over the weekend, negative sell pressure remains in the market. However, the sentiment in the market now is beyond the Bybit hack. The exchange said it has fully replenished its Ethereum reserve and fulfilled all users’ withdrawals. Though the funds came from loans from industry partners and OTC purchases, it has helped Bybit withstand an unusual bank run that saw exchanges like FTX declare bankruptcy. The unity in the market has further placed the broader industry in a positive light, thus showing that the current price action will likely not last for long.” Dr. Sean Dawson, Head of Research at Derive.xyz commented on the bearish shift as institutional funds exit their positions in Bitcoin. Dr.Dawson told Crypto.news: “Bitcoin has seen a 4.5% drop in the last 24 hours, most likely due to the continued exodus of institutional funds from major BTC ETFs. Over the past three weeks, more than $900 million in net BTC ETF outflows have been recorded. Investors are pulling funds in the face of macroeconomic volatility, including concerns around the Trump presidency, the Ukraine, China and Gaza conflicts, and the potential for rising interest rates. As a result, the chance of BTC settling above $100K by the end of March 28 has fallen to 30%, down from 39% just 24 hours ago. Additionally, the probability of BTC reaching $125K by June 27 has dropped from 19% to 15%.” On the decentralized options platform, traders reacted to recent developments by adjusting their positions with a slight increase in BTC 7-day at-the-money implied volatility (ATM IV), now sitting at 46%. The statistic reflects a heightened market uncertainty in Bitcoin price. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

This isn’t just about reclaiming lost assets; it’s a powerful statement against digital theft and a beacon of hope for victims of crypto hack incidents worldwide. But how exactly is Bybit tackling this monumental challenge, and what does it mean for the future of crypto security? Let’s dive into the details of this groundbreaking bounty program . Unveiling the Bybit Bounty Program: A 5% Reward to Combat Crypto Crime Bybit is not just sitting back and watching billions vanish into the digital abyss. They are actively fighting back. Recognizing the sophisticated nature of the Lazarus Group and the vast sums of stolen funds involved, Bybit has established a dedicated website to meticulously track wallets associated with these cybercriminals. To incentivize the global crypto community to participate in this crucial endeavor, Bybit is offering a compelling bounty program : a 5% reward for any tips that lead to the freezing of assets linked to the Lazarus Group’s illicit activities. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements of Bybit’s ambitious initiative: Dedicated Tracking Website: Bybit has launched a specialized platform to monitor cryptocurrency wallets identified as being connected to the Lazarus Group. This transparent approach allows the public to follow the movement of stolen funds and contribute to the recovery effort. Generous 5% Bounty: For every successful tip that results in the freezing of assets, Bybit is offering a significant 5% bounty. This financial incentive is designed to motivate researchers, cybersecurity experts, and even concerned individuals to come forward with valuable information. Significant Progress Already: Even in its early stages, the initiative has shown promising results. Approximately $42.3 million, representing 3% of the total stolen funds , has already been frozen across 6,338 tracked addresses. This early success demonstrates the potential impact of collaborative efforts in combating crypto hack related crimes. CEO’s Commitment: Bybit CEO Ben Zhou has publicly pledged the exchange’s unwavering commitment to fighting crypto-related crimes. His statement reinforces Bybit’s dedication to supporting victims and working towards a safer crypto ecosystem. Who is the Lazarus Group and Why are They a Major Threat? The Lazarus Group is not just any cybercriminal entity; they are a sophisticated, state-sponsored hacking organization believed to be linked to North Korea. They are notorious for carrying out large-scale cyberattacks, including ransomware attacks, cyber espionage, and, most notably, cryptocurrency heists. Their activities are believed to be a significant source of revenue for the North Korean regime, bypassing international sanctions. Here’s why the Lazarus Group is considered a major threat: State-Sponsored Capabilities: Backed by a nation-state, they possess advanced resources, skilled personnel, and sophisticated tools, making them exceptionally difficult to combat. History of Massive Heists: The Lazarus Group has been linked to some of the largest cryptocurrency heists in history, causing billions of dollars in losses to exchanges and individuals. Evolving Tactics: They constantly adapt their techniques to evade detection and bypass security measures, making them a moving target for cybersecurity professionals. Global Reach: Their operations are not limited by geographical boundaries, targeting victims and organizations worldwide. Financial Motivation: Unlike some hacking groups driven by ideology, the Lazarus Group is primarily motivated by financial gain, using stolen funds to support the North Korean regime. What are the Benefits of Bybit’s Bounty Program? Bybit’s bounty program offers a multitude of benefits, extending beyond just recovering stolen funds . It’s a proactive approach that strengthens the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Increased Fund Recovery: The most immediate benefit is the potential to recover a significant portion of the $1.5 billion stolen funds . Even freezing a fraction of this amount can significantly disrupt the Lazarus Group ‘s operations and return assets to rightful owners. Deterrent to Cybercriminals: Publicly announcing a bounty and actively tracking stolen funds sends a strong message to cybercriminals. It demonstrates that exchanges are not passive victims and are willing to invest resources to fight back, potentially deterring future attacks. Enhanced Crypto Security: Bybit’s initiative encourages collaboration and information sharing within the crypto community. The tracking website and bounty program foster a collective effort to identify and combat cyber threats, ultimately enhancing the overall security of the crypto space. Support for Victims: By actively pursuing the recovery of stolen funds , Bybit is demonstrating support for victims of crypto hack incidents. This proactive approach builds trust and confidence in the exchange and the broader crypto industry. Positive Industry Example: Bybit’s initiative sets a positive example for other cryptocurrency exchanges. It showcases a responsible and proactive approach to dealing with cybercrime, encouraging industry-wide adoption of similar security measures and collaborative efforts. Challenges and Considerations in Tracking Stolen Crypto While Bybit’s bounty program is commendable, tracking and recovering stolen funds in the crypto world presents significant challenges. Anonymity and Pseudonymity: Cryptocurrencies, while not entirely anonymous, offer a degree of pseudonymity that can make tracing transactions complex. Cybercriminals often use mixing services and other techniques to obscure the origin and destination of stolen funds . Decentralization and Jurisdiction: The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies makes it challenging to enforce legal actions and recover assets across different jurisdictions. International cooperation is crucial but can be slow and complex. Sophisticated Money Laundering Techniques: Groups like the Lazarus Group employ sophisticated money laundering techniques to convert stolen funds into fiat currency or other assets, making them harder to track and seize. Technological Hurdles: Tracking cryptocurrency transactions requires specialized tools and expertise. Staying ahead of cybercriminals who are constantly developing new evasion techniques is an ongoing technological challenge. Legal and Regulatory Frameworks: The legal and regulatory frameworks surrounding cryptocurrency recovery are still evolving. Navigating these complexities and ensuring compliance across different jurisdictions adds another layer of challenge. Actionable Insights: How Can You Contribute to Crypto Security? Bybit’s bounty program highlights the importance of community involvement in combating crypto hack incidents. Here are some actionable insights on how you can contribute to a more secure crypto environment: Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest cybersecurity threats and trends in the cryptocurrency space. Knowledge is your first line of defense. Report Suspicious Activity: If you have any information related to the Lazarus Group ‘s stolen funds or any other suspicious crypto activity, report it to Bybit through their website or to relevant law enforcement agencies. Practice Safe Crypto Habits: Implement strong security measures for your own crypto holdings, including using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and being cautious of phishing attempts. Support Proactive Initiatives: Support cryptocurrency exchanges and organizations that are taking proactive steps to combat cybercrime and enhance security, like Bybit’s bounty program . Educate Others: Share your knowledge about crypto security with friends, family, and colleagues to raise awareness and promote safer practices within the broader crypto community. Conclusion: A United Front Against Crypto Cybercrime Bybit’s audacious bounty program to track the Lazarus Group ‘s stolen funds is more than just a recovery effort; it’s a symbol of resilience and a call to action for the entire cryptocurrency industry. It underscores the critical need for proactive measures, collaboration, and community involvement in the ongoing battle against cybercrime. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, initiatives like this are vital in fostering a safer, more secure, and trustworthy environment for all participants. The fight against cybercrime in the crypto world is far from over, but Bybit’s bold step offers a glimmer of hope and a powerful example of how the industry can collectively combat these threats and protect the future of digital finance.

Table of Contents Challenges faced by meme coins like SHIB and DOGE Why Lightchain AI challenges meme coins Conclusion Lightchain AI is quickly outshining top contenders like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE).

Challenges faced by meme coins like SHIB and DOGE Meme coins such as Shiba Inu and Dogecoin face significant limitations. They largely lack intrinsic value and practical use, with their worth often driven by social media trends and community sentiment. This reliance creates extreme price volatility, making them high-risk investments subject to sharp fluctuations. Furthermore, Dogecoin’s unlimited supply raises concerns about inflation and the ability to maintain long-term value. These speculative assets are often targets for pump-and-dump schemes, where early investors profit at the expense of those who enter later. Additionally, the concentration of holdings among a few major investors, or whales, can lead to market manipulation, further destabilizing their prices.

Among them, DTX Exchange stands out, blending blockchain transparency with access to 120,000+ financial instruments. With presale momentum and a hybrid trading model, this platform is positioning itself as a compelling alternative for investors eyeing the next major opportunity. DTX Exchange Presale Gains Momentum: 800% Growth Signals Confidence Investors hunting for steady returns in crypto’s choppy waters are flocking to DTX Exchange, where presale token prices rocketed 800% from $0.02 to $0.18. A staggering 700,000+ investors have jumped in, lured by its unique blend of decentralized safety nets and centralized speed. This isn’t just hype—it’s proof that traders crave platforms merging Wall Street’s diversity with crypto’s innovation. Unlike projects tied solely to crypto volatility, DTX Exchange supports stocks, forex, and ETFs alongside digital assets. Analysts note this diversity could attract traders seeking to hedge against swings in tokens like SOL, especially as the Solana price faces renewed pressure. Early adopters also gain exposure to features like 1000x multipliers and copy trading—tools typically reserved for institutional players. With $15.1 million raised and a bonus stage underway, the platform’s trajectory contrasts sharply with larger cryptocurrencies facing headwinds. As one investor tweeted, “DTX’s presale performance feels reminiscent of Solana’s early days—high demand, clear utility, and a community-driven approach.” For those priced out of SOL’s earlier growth amid Solana price fluctuations, this could signal a timely entry point. The Solana Price Recent Dip Highlights Market Search for Stability The Solana price slid to $156 this week, extending a monthly decline of over 36%. While SOL remains a top-ten cryptocurrency by market cap, its struggles reflect broader uncertainty in established tokens. Traders are increasingly diversifying into projects like DTX Exchange, which combines crypto’s speed with traditional finance’s asset breadth. DTX’s rise coincides with SOL’s challenges, offering a case study in shifting priorities. Where SOL excels in decentralized app support, DTX focuses on unifying markets—a strategy resonating as investors prioritize flexibility. The platform’s 200,000 transactions per second throughput and institutional-grade tools further differentiate it from networks grappling with congestion or scalability issues. Market observers suggest hybrids like DTX could redefine success metrics beyond pure price gains. “It’s not just about replacing Ethereum or Solana,” says a crypto strategist. “Platforms enabling seamless cross-asset trading are filling gaps the majors haven’t addressed.” As SOL works to regain footing, DTX’s presale progress illustrates where capital is flowing next. Cardano’s Struggles Contrast With DTX’s Resilient Presale Cardano’s 20% monthly decline underscores the hurdles facing even well-established blockchains. ADA’s downturn, paired with Solana’s slump, has accelerated interest in presale projects like DTX Exchange. Its tokenomics—capped supply and tiered pricing—aim to reward early participants, mirroring strategies that propelled past market leaders. DTX’s appeal lies in balancing innovation with familiarity. The platform’s Phoenix Wallet simplifies managing diverse assets, while audits by firms like SolidProof address security concerns plaguing newer projects. These features, coupled with fractional trading options, cater to both retail and institutional users—a dual focus many rivals lack. Cardano and Solana’s recent stumbles reveal cracks in their dominance, while DTX’s presale surge taps into demand for practical solutions, potentially setting a new standard for crypto resilience. Looking ahead, the platform’s Q2 launch could test its ability to deliver on promises. Yet current metrics—like 120,000+ tradable assets and a user base exceeding 700,000—suggest readiness to capitalize on shifting trends. For investors weighing ADA’s risks or SOL’s volatility, DTX offers a roadmap blending growth potential with measurable safeguards. Final Thoughts While the Cardano and Solana price decline due to market pressures, DTX Exchange’s presale success highlights evolving investor priorities. Its hybrid model and cross-market access position it uniquely in a sector craving stability. For those exploring emerging opportunities, DTX’s trajectory warrants attention.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyst predicts a Dogecoin surge to $69, citing historical trends, while WallitIQ emerges as a game-changer with its 0% swap fees. Dogecoin price history is filled with explosive rallies, and a crypto analyst now suggests that another monumental surge could be on the horizon. According to crypto analyst Dogeolak, historical trends reveal strikingly similar breakout patterns, hinting that Dogecoin (DOGE) could reach an unprecedented price of $69. While speculation runs high, WallitIQ (WLTQ) could be a potential game-changer with an AI-powered platform offering ultra-low swap fees of 0%.

He pointed out that historical breakout patterns suggest another parabolic rally could be in the works. Based on his analysis, bullish momentum aligns with past price cycles, with potential surges projected between July 2025 and October 2029. The Average True Range (ATR) also indicates high volatility ahead, signaling intense price movement phases. While history suggests massive gains, Dogeolak notes that the Dogecoin price hitting $69 would require an astronomical percentage increase — far beyond previous rallies.

The Dogecoin price may see wild swings, but WallitIQ has the potential to make waves in the $60 billion crypto wallet and AI market. With Dogecoin price movements uncertain, this AI crypto could be an alternative for those eyeing long-term rewards.

Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already secured $1,277,233.47 in its presale, attracting 2,540 holders at a current price of $0.015. Analysts tracking its trajectory point to a 300% surge at launch. The token is also projected to hit $1 in the next bull run, delivering a nearly 67x ROI. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) are navigating volatile price patterns, offering short-term opportunities but overshadowed by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale momentum. The window to act is narrowing rapidly for investors aiming to avoid paying 10 times more. Cardano (ADA) navigates critical price levels Cardano (ADA) is hovering near a pivotal moment as its price oscillates between $0.74 and $0.83. Analysts like Ali Martinez highlight an ascending triangle pattern forming on shorter timeframes, suggesting a potential 24% swing in either direction. A break above $0.83 could propel ADA toward $1, reviving optimism after a 58% drop from its December 2024 peak. Conversely, a dip below $0.74 risks a slide to $0.56. While institutional interest, including Grayscale’s ETF application, has fueled a modest recovery, Cardano’s path remains uncertain. Ripple (XRP) faces speculative frenzy Ripple (XRP) is inducing talk with a bold prediction of a 3,900% surge to $99, fueled by comparisons to its 2017 rally. Such a move would require XRP’s market cap to balloon to $5.7 trillion, a figure exceeding Bitcoin’s current valuation. While growing institutional adoption, including XRP Depository Receipts, adds credibility, skepticism persists. Critics argue the crypto market’s maturity makes replicating past gains unlikely. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale accelerates demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a favorite for investors prioritizing predictable gains. The project’s second presale phase has already raised over $1.2 million, with tokens priced at $0.015. Early participants are positioning themselves for a 300% return when MUTM launches at $0.06, followed by a projected climb to $1 in 2025. This growth is anchored in Mutuum Finance’s operational framework: a decentralized lending platform enabling peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer transactions, an overcollateralized stablecoin, and a buy-and-distribute mechanism designed to sustain token value. The platform’s beta launch, timed with its exchange debut, aims to drive immediate user adoption. A $100,000 giveaway further incentivizes participation, rewarding early supporters as the presale advances. With the first phase already sold out, the current window offers the lowest available price before incremental increases in subsequent stages. Over 2,500 holders have already capitalized on this entry point, reflecting confidence in Mutuum Finance’s potential to disrupt decentralized lending. Timing the market for maximum returns Cryptocurrency investments often hinge on timing, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) exemplifies this principle. While Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) grapple with market-driven unpredictability, MUTM’s presale structure eliminates guesswork. The token’s trajectory is mathematically defined: a rise to $0.06 at launch, followed by platform adoption and tokenomics growth. Early investors not only lock in a 4x return but also position themselves for the 67x surge anticipated in 2025. Delaying action risks missing this phase’s discounted rate, as future presale stages will progressively hike the price. History shows that presale opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rarely repeat. With phase two underway and demand accelerating, the $0.015 price tag represents a fleeting chance to capitalize on a project poised for rapid adoption. Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) may offer speculative upside, but neither matches MUTM’s calculated path to at least 67x returns. Visit Mutuum Finance’s official website to join the presale and claim your stake in a decentralized lending revolution. Waiting could mean buying the same tokens at 10 times the price in 2025, don’t let this moment slip away.

In a post on the social media platform X, Burniske, the former head of crypto at Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest and current partner at Placeholder, points out other corrections in the 2021 bull market cycle that ultimately preceded new highs. “In the middle of 2021: BTC drew down 56% ETH drew down 61% SOL drew down 67% Many others 70-80%+ You can come up with all the reasons for why this cycle is different, but the mid-bull reset we’re going through isn’t unprecedented. Those calling for a full-blown bear are misguided.” At time of writing, Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down 20% from its all-time high, Ethereum ( ETH ) is down 50% from its all-time high while Solana ( SOL ) is down 51%. Earlier this month, Burniske said that BTC’s lackluster price performance looked like a “mid-cycle top” reminiscent of April, May, June of 2021, when “many said it was over, top-callers gloated, and then we ripped in 2H ’21.” Former Goldman Sachs executive and current Real Vision CEO Raoul Pal echoes Burniske’s sentiments. Pal, who has been vocally bullish on crypto, also believes the current correction is a speed bump on the way to new highs. “You guys all need to learn patience… This was 2017. Very similar macro structure: 5 x 28%+ pullbacks in BTC Most lasted 2 to 3 months before a new high Alts saw 65% corrections. All were noise.

Citing the immutable nature of Bitcoin transactions, he warned that while Bitcoin itself is designed to be secure, the platforms where digital assets are stored—crypto exchanges—remain prime targets for hackers. “Where there is money, there will be hackers,” Gauthier asserted, emphasizing that as more funds flow into the system, the financial sector, including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies, increasingly attracts malicious actors. The CEO explained that Bitcoin’s design inherently promotes self-custody, urging users not to leave their digital assets on exchanges where vulnerabilities exist. “Don’t leave your coins on an exchange,” he advised, noting that if users choose to do so, it is imperative that the exchange’s security measures are virtually impenetrable. You might also like: Senator proposes limits on crypto ATM transactions to combat scams He further elaborated that Ledger has dedicated the past 10 years to refining their security protocols, offering consumers a reliable way to store their cryptocurrency safely through self-custody solutions. Drawing parallels with traditional banking practices, the Ledger CEO noted that just as people deposit money in banks rather than keeping cash at home, secure alternatives to self-custody exist for digital assets. These remarks follow a major security breach that resulted in a $1.5 billion hack of Bybit on February 21. The attack targeted the exchange’s Ethereum cold wallet , with hackers bypassing multi-signature protocols. Blockchain analysts connected the breach to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, linked to high-profile cyber thefts. Gauthier stressed that Ledger’s technology —proven by selling eight million hardware wallets — provides a superior option compared to outdated methods, such as literally keeping money under one’s mattress.

Raising $1,387,170.46 and boasting over 2,670 holders so far, this decentralized lending and borrowing platform is capturing attention in the crypto market. Investors are flocking to secure tokens at this low entry point, drawn by the potential for massive returns as the project predicts a climb to $13 post-launch. This surge in interest signals a growing demand for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), positioning it as a standout opportunity for those chasing high-yield prospects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized platform reshaping lending and borrowing in the crypto market. Users can lend their digital assets to liquidity pools and earn passive income through interest rates tied to market demand. Borrowers, meanwhile, lock their crypto, like ETH, as collateral to access funds without selling, keeping their investments intact while tapping into liquidity for other ventures. The platform splits into two lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C), where smart contracts handle secure, automated transactions, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P), where users directly negotiate terms with only vetted tokens allowed. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also gearing up to launch a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, fully backed by on-chain reserves. This addition promises a steady asset for transactions, boosting the platform’s appeal as it heads toward a full rollout in its fourth development phase. This practical setup is why investors are taking notice. Presale Fever Heating Up Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has opened phase 2 of its presale, offering tokens at $0.015. The presale is moving fast, having already pulled in $1,387,170.46 and gathered 2,670 holders looking to jump in early. As the stages progress, the price will climb to $0.06 at launch, meaning buyers now lock in a 300% profit the moment trading begins. The first phase sold out quickly, and phase 2 is following suit, creating urgency for anyone wanting a piece of this action. Looking ahead, the post-launch outlook is even brighter. The token is forecasted to hit $1 in 2025, a 66.67x jump from today’s price, driven by the platform’s launch and growing user base. Some enthusiasts even predict a meteoric rise to $13, fueled by the stablecoin rollout and a buy-and-distribute system that uses platform fees to repurchase MUTM tokens and reward stakers. This sustained buying pressure, paired with a beta platform debut at listing, sets the stage for rapid adoption and soaring value. Incentives Sweeten the Deal Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also rolling out extra perks to hook investors. A $100,000 giveaway is underway to reward early backers and pull in fresh faces. The upcoming stablecoin ties it all together, offering a dependable asset for borrowing and trading as DeFi demand climbs. These moves are boosting the platform’s momentum. The community is growing fast with 2,670 holders already on board and funds pouring in. The presale’s low entry price won’t last long, and the 300% launch gain is just the start. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a must-watch project, blending real utility with serious profit potential. The crypto market is excited with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as DOGE and XRP whales pivot to this $0.015 altcoin. Phase 2 is selling out fast, and the 300% launch profit is a done deal, with predictions of hitting $1 in 2025 or even rocketing to $13 as adoption surges. Time’s ticking, head to the Mutuum Finance website now and grab your spot in the presale before prices climb.

To read full editions, subscribe . You probably saw bitcoin’s latest price plummet, briefly falling below $86,000 for the first time since November. It comes as the Bybit hack and SEC moves grab headlines — not to mention the relentless non-crypto macro developments. Even before BTC’s drop, Bitfinex analysts laid out the scene. Bitcoin had mostly traded between $91,000 and $102,000 for weeks, rearing its head to a peak around $109,000 last month. “Bitcoin remains at a critical juncture after nearly 90 days of consolidation,” they explained. “As market participants await a catalyst, bitcoinʼs next major move will likely be dictated by macroeconomic trends and could be decisive.” Fast forward a day, and Compass Point analysts Ed Engel and Joe Flynn note that BTC’s latest drop means it has broken the $92,000 support level (the cost basis for holders who bought within the last six months). “Selling has accelerated as short-term holders are less likely to tolerate unrealized losses,” they explained. “$86,000 is the last line of defense before the air pocket of trading activity that took place between $77,000 to $86,000.” BTC’s price hovered around $86,950 at 2 pm ET. That’s down 5% in the past 24 hours. It’s a 9% drop from seven days ago and a 17% decrease over the last month. Trading volumes remain near year-to-date lows and slightly above pre-election levels, Engel and Flynn added. CoinShares research head James Butterfill attributed the flow of $571 million out of bitcoin investment products last week to “ uncertainty around trade tariffs, inflation and monetary policy.” The US spot bitcoin ETFs saw $516 million more leave their coffers yesterday, Farside Investors data shows — the highest level since Jan. 8. Those funds have now endured net outflows for five straight days. Bitcoinʼs increasing correlation with traditional markets has exacerbated this “corrective phase” seen across crypto assets, Bitfinex analysts argue, noting the S&P 500ʼs fall below the 6,000 level.

Render Token (RNDR) has thrived by offering GPU-based rendering solutions, whereas Injective Protocol (INJ) has concentrated on decentralized finance and exchange services. But Web3Bay (3BAY) introduces a unique proposition—transforming e-commerce by blending blockchain technology with tangible world transactions. Featuring a deflationary model, staking perks, and governance elements, 3BAY emerges as more than a mere digital token. Understanding 3BAY Tokenomics – Potential for 100x Growth like Binance’s BNB? Designed to foster prolonged growth, Web3Bay’s 3BAY token incorporates deflationary tactics, staking rewards, and governance voting, enhancing its intrinsic value. As Web3Bay carves a niche as a decentralized e-commerce hub, the 3BAY token is pivotal, facilitating transactions and encouraging user engagement. A defining aspect of 3BAY is its deflationary strategy, which incrementally reduces the token supply. Notably, a fraction of transaction fees is destroyed, thereby assuring scarcity and value appreciation over time, mirroring the successful trajectory of Binance Coin (BNB). Moreover, staking offers token holders a chance to gain passive income and contribute to network security. This feature motivates prolonged retention of the token, potentially dampening market fluctuations. Additionally, governance voting grants token owners a voice in Web3Bay’s operational decisions, fostering a user-led environment where the community actively directs future developments. The presale phase has already attracted significant interest, amassing $1.5 million in investments. Currently, in its fourth stage, the token is valued at $0.00456, with more than 375 million 3BAY tokens distributed. The pricing escalates progressively with each presale stage, presenting early backers with a tactical investment opportunity. Given its robust utility structure and growing ecosystem, 3BAY is poised for substantial expansion. Should the adoption continue as projected and the deflationary strategies succeed, the token might experience a sharp increase in value, akin to BNB’s evolution from a niche exchange asset to a major financial instrument. Render Token: Redefining GPU Rendering Through Decentralization Launched in 2019, Render Token (RNDR) facilitates a connection between content creators in need of rendering power and GPU owners with excess capacity. This decentralized framework enables artists and developers to access rendering services economically and efficiently. Utilizing OctaneRender, tasks submitted by users are completed by available GPUs, with RNDR tokens simplifying the transaction process. As of February 19, 2025, RNDR’s market price stands at $4.28, up significantly from its initial offering of $0.25 in 2018. The token peaked at $12.46 in March 2024, and with a current circulating supply of about 517.7 million tokens, its market capitalization has reached roughly $2.21 billion. This growth trajectory represents a gain of over 1,600% since its inception, rewarding early investors handsomely. Injective Protocol: Innovation in Decentralized Finance Established in 2018, Injective Protocol is a layer-2 decentralized exchange framework that supports advanced trading operations, including margin and derivatives trading. It empowers users to establish and participate in decentralized financial markets with high efficiency and minimal costs. Since its launch, Injective has achieved considerable growth. It garnered $10 million in a 2021 investment round from figures like Mark Cuban and Pantera Capital and launched a $150 million ecosystem fund in January 2023 to enhance interoperability and DeFi engagement. Trading at $14.49 as of February 19, 2025, with a market capitalization nearing $1.4 billion, INJ has appreciated significantly from its initial $0.40 price in October 2020, providing substantial returns to early stakeholders. Future Prospects for 3BAY, RNDR, & INJ The trajectory of digital assets hinges on their practical applications, sustainability, and the creation of enduring value. Render Token and Injective Protocol have cemented their positions in their respective niches.

Big SHIB holders are leaving their SHIB investments to pursue different market opportunities. Among the rising alternatives, # PEPETO has emerged as a strong contender in the meme coin market. SHIB Whale Transactions on a Steady Decline Shiba Inu’s network has witnessed a significant drop in whale activity over the past three months. Crypto expert Ali Martinez analyzed $1 million SHIB transactions, which, according to his report, experienced a 79% decrease. Major investor activity shows signs of declining involvement, which supports the idea that they are transferring their capital towards different opportunities. #SHIB’s price stability and market performance mainly depend on whale transactions. Large investors who decrease their investment activity create higher market price swings while weakening market trust. SHIB displayed these patterns through its stagnation in market trading and its inability to gain upward movement during recent periods. #SHIB has lost its value structure because institutions take fewer participating roles in the marketplace. Various major investors are transferring their investments into alternative profitable opportunities rather than preserving them in SHIB. Due to this current investor trend, the short-term recovery of SHIB faces uncertainty. PEPETO Gains Traction as a Promising Memecoin As #SHIB struggles, #PEPETO has gained significant momentum in the crypto market. During the project’s presale, more than 4.7 million dollars were invested, indicating powerful initial market interest. At a price of $0.000000112 per token, PEPETO is positioning itself as the next major meme coin.

Bitcoin (BTC) Plunges to Lowest Since November Despite Michael Saylor’s Latest Purch ase Bitcoin price collapsed to its lowest level in four months, crashing to $86,050 as traders reacted to inflation concerns and Trump’s latest tariffs decision . Following a hotter-than-expected CPI report that ignited downward pressure on February 13, Bitcoin extended losses as President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports, set to take effect on March 1. Bitcoin price action (BTCUSDT) The policy shift added fresh economic uncertainty, forcing investors to hedge against potential inflationary pressures. In reaction, BTC price fell another 3% on Tuesday, marking its lowest price since November 2024. Binance order books reveal significant sell-side pressure, as traders rushed to liquidate positions amid fears of prolonged macroeconomic instability. Michael Saylor’s Double BTC Price Catalysts to Lift Market Michael Saylor made two aggressive moves to reinforce Bitcoin’s long-term value, but the market remained unfazed amid Trump’s economic policy shift. On Monday, Saylor’s firm, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), added 20,356 BTC to its treasury, spending nearly $2 billion at an average price of $97,514 per coin. This latest purchase elevated Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings to 499,096 BTC, acquired at an average of $66,357 per coin, totaling $33.1 billion in investments. Despite the massive buy, Bitcoin failed to gain traction, weighed down by investor fears over inflationary fallout from new tariffs. Beyond the acquisition, Saylor made a second bold move, presenting a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Plan to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday, February 21, according to FOX News analyst Eleanor Terrett . Michael Sayor presents Bitcoin Strategic Reserve plan to US SEC, Feb, 2025 | Source: Eleanor Terrett, FOX news. The proposal suggests integrating Bitcoin into the national financial system, potentially generating between $16 trillion and $81 trillion in wealth for the US Treasury. Saylor argues that Bitcoin could serve as a hedge against sovereign debt, addressing America’s mounting liabilities, which stood at $36.2 trillion as of February 5, 2025. However, despite the far-reaching potential positive impacts, Crypto marketsBitcoin price slumped to $86,050, its lowest since November, as inflation fears and Trump’s tariffs overshadowed Saylor’s $2B BTC buy. shrugged off the proposal, focusing instead on immediate economic threats. BTC Tracks Global Market Decline as Inflation Panic Overshadows Saylor’s Moves Despite Saylor’s aggressive accumulation and strategic policy push, Bitcoin fell in tandem with broader financial markets. The S&P 500 registered a sharp decline on Tuesday, tracking the same risk-off sentiment that pressured BTC. Commodity markets also faced significant volatility, reinforcing investor uncertainty amid a changing economic landscape. While Saylor’s long-term strategy underscores institutional confidence in Bitcoin, short-term traders remain fixated on macroeconomic headwinds. Strategy’s continuous accumulation could eventually bolster retail sentiment, but for now, BTC remains vulnerable to policy-driven volatility. Bitcoin Price Forecast: $85,000 Support Remains at Risk Expectations of further inflation could prompt investors to withdraw more capital from Bitcoin and other risk assets as the March 1 tariff implementation nears, now less than a week away. This creates a significant downside risk. Technical indicators reinforce this bearish outlook. Bitcoin price forecast charts show how bears extended the downturn by 3.61% on Tuesday, briefly touching an intraday low of $86,050 on Binance. The decline has pushed BTC below its 100-day simple moving average (SMA), currently at $98,014, a level that had provided support for much of the past three months. The 200-day SMA at $81,627 is now the key downside target, with any further weakness likely to accelerate selling pressure toward this level. Bitcoin Price Forecast The MACD histogram signals intensifying bearish momentum, as the indicator plunges further into negative territory. The MACD line (-621.44) has crossed decisively below the signal line (-1,072.98), confirming a sustained downtrend. A failure to reclaim the 100-day SMA could see BTC test the psychologically significant $85,000 level in the coming days. On the bullish side, Bitcoin remains structurally above the 200-day SMA, a critical long-term trend indicator. Should BTC hold above $85,000 and buyers step in, a rebound toward $90,000 could unfold, with further resistance at $98,000. However, unless sentiment shifts, Bitcoin risks further downside as macroeconomic concerns overshadow positive institutional activity.

SHIB is hovering around $0.000013, mirroring the broader downturn. Bitcoin remains below $90K, while Ethereum struggles under $2,500. If sellers gain control, SHIB could break lower, signaling a potential drop this week. Is Shiba Inu Price Set for Another Decline Soon? Shiba Inu price is battling to stay above a crucial support level as the crypto market experiences heightened volatility. The global market cap has fallen to $2.9 trillion, marking a 5.20% decline in the last 24 hours. Currently, SHIB is hovering near $0.000013, a key price floor that provided strong support in 2024. Market conditions remain bearish, raising concerns about its short-term movement. If this level breaks, the asset could see further downside pressure. Broader crypto weakness has pushed Bitcoin below $90k , while Ethereum is trading under $2,500. Shiba Inu has mirrored this trend, recording a 10% decline in the past day. Its burn rate has also dropped significantly, down 95%, with only 744,765 SHIB removed from circulation. Source: Shiba Burn If selling pressure continues, SHIB could extend its losses and retest the August 5 low of $0.00001. Other meme assets, including Dogecoin and Pepe, have also declined amid the downturn. Traders are closely watching SHIB’s next moves, as holding above this key support could determine its short-term direction. A break below could trigger further selling. Will SHIB Price Dip to $0.00001 Soon? As of Tuesday, the SHIB price is trading around $0.00001412, reflecting a 6% decrease over the past 24-hours. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 39, indicating an oversold condition after dipping below 30. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a minor bullish crossover, with the MACD line edging above the signal line, indicating a potential shift in momentum. Shiba Inu price prediction faces immediate resistance at $0.000015, a crucial level for sustaining its upward movement. Further resistance lies at $0.000018 and $0.00002, If bullish momentum continues, a push toward these levels could materialize. On the downside, key support remains at $0.00001405. A failure to hold above this level could bring renewed bearish sentiment, possibly leading to a retest of the $0.00001 mark this could dip by more than 20%. A break below this threshold might trigger further declines, making it a critical zone for traders. Source: TradingView To sum up, the Shiba Inu price hovers near critical support, facing potential declines.

The meeting, attended by Chia Network CEO Gene Hoffman, Chief Legal Officer Thomas Chow, and Career Capital CEO Trent Martensen, was held on February 25, 2025. Discussions focused on regulatory frameworks for crypto assets, fraud prevention, decentralization, and compliance pathways for blockchain projects. According to the SEC memorandum, the agenda included: Regulation of innovative financial products: Chia Network raised concerns that blockchain-related applications should be treated on their merits rather than rejected because of their relationship to crypto. They cited Permuto Capital’s MSFT Trust I filing as an example. Decentralization standards: Chia noted the need for clear guidelines on decentralization, arguing that technical decentralization should be a key determinant in regulatory decisions. They suggested a public notification and comment period for blockchain projects that claim decentralization. Token registration and pathways for ICOs: Chia proposed updates to Regulation A to accommodate crypto assets, including provisions on decentralization criteria. They proposed a structured transition period for projects to decentralize while remaining compliant with securities regulations. Opposition to regulatory sandboxes: Chia argued that allowing projects to bypass established regulations could lead to systemic risks and encourage hasty token launches. Backward compliance relaxation: Chia proposed a framework for non-compliant projects to gain regulatory approval, while also suggesting fair treatment for those who have adhered to regulations from the start. More engagement with technical experts: The firm suggested that the SEC consult blockchain academics and industry experts rather than relying solely on project founders. Related News: Investment Strategist Explained Why Bitcoin Price Declined, Shared the Event He Said “If This Happens, It Will Fall Even Lower” The meeting highlights Chia Network’s commitment to working within regulatory frameworks, particularly through the S-1 filing process for a potential IPO. The company has positioned itself as a compliance-focused blockchain firm, unlike many crypto projects that face SEC scrutiny for unregistered securities offerings. The XCH price has gained approximately 11% in the last 24 hours. *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, the next-generation dual-chain exchange IntelMarkets is positioned to become the best buy among the two, with its fast-selling utility coin (INTL) priced at $0.09 in its presale. Ethereum Price Trend Analysis: SEC Shows Interest In Crypto Staking The Ethereum price is in the green area after the 1% surge from yesterday following news of the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission's sudden interest in crypto staking. Approval of staking within US spot ETH ETFs could make them attractive to investors, drive massive inflows for issuers, and potentially take Ethereum price to new highs. The new SEC administration, under acting Chair Mark Uyeda, is showing a strong interest in crypto staking, which could be highly beneficial for the current Ethereum price and the long-term ETH ETFs. The agency is actively engaging on the concept, requesting that the crypto industry provide a memo explaining the different types of staking and their advantages. Basically, staking is the process of earning passive returns by using crypto tokens to contribute to a blockchain network's security. ETH infrastructure provider Consensys lawyer Bill Hughes stated that the company is working with the Proof-of-Stake Alliance (POSA) to provide the SEC with an analysis of different staking offerings and how they're affected by securities laws. Ethereum (ETH) Could Benefit From SEC’s Recent Move The recent move aligns with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce's statement on February 4, which stated that the agency's new crypto task force will assist in helping ‘to modify certain features of existing exchange-traded products, including to allow for staking and in-kind creations and redemptions.’ The SEC had earlier acknowledged 21Shares' proposal to allow for staking within its ETH ETF. Staking within ETH ETFs would allow issuers to help investors earn yield on their ETH holdings. If approved, staking could drive massive inflows to ETH ETFs, considering it's one of the major value propositions of ETH, which would turn the tables for the current Ethereum price as well.

The altcoin has broken below a parallel channel, signaling increased bearish momentum. Analysts suggest that unless ADA reclaims the $0.67 level as support, it may continue its decline, testing lower levels. Cardano Price Critical Support at $0.67, Breakdown To $0.53? The crypto market selloff has pushed the Cardano price below the $0.67 support level, raising concerns about further declines. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that ADA is at a crucial juncture, with its structure showing lower highs and lower lows. If the downward trend continues, traders may see increased volatility, with ADA struggling to find a stable support zone. ADA price action suggests that selling pressure remains strong. Analysts warn that failing to recover above $0.67 could lead to further downside, with the next major support level at $0.53. This level could act as a temporary accumulation zone, but if the selling momentum persists, a drop below $0.53 is possible. Source: X The current trend aligns with broader market conditions, where cryptocurrencies are experiencing bearish sentiment. The $0.67 and $0.80 range remains the key zone for ADA recovery. However, without a strong rebound, ADA price could see further losses, reinforcing the ongoing downward trend. Bearish Momentum Persists Cardano price structure indicates weakening bullish momentum. Crypto analysts have noted that ADA inability to hold key support levels has intensified selling activity. The recent decline has confirmed a bearish pattern, suggesting that ADA may struggle to regain upward momentum. The cryptocurrency is also facing technical resistance, making it difficult to reclaim previous price levels. If Cardano price fails to recover soon, traders may see increased liquidations, driving prices lower. Moreover, ADA whales might take advantage of the crypto market selloff to accumulate more tokens at lower prices, anticipating a potential rebound. With ADA long-term holders facing losses, the current market sentiment could either trigger a recovery or extend losses if selling continues. Additionally, bearish sentiment across the crypto market has contributed to ADA’s price weakness. If Bitcoin crash continues to decline, Cardano price could follow the trend. Will Buyers Step in at $0.53? If Cardano price falls to $0.53, buyers might step in to absorb the selling pressure. However, analysts warn that failing to hold $0.53 could expose ADA to deeper corrections, leading to further losses. A recovery above $0.67 would be necessary for ADA to regain bullish momentum. If buying volume increases, ADA could stabilize and attempt to reclaim the $0.80 level. Despite the crypto market crash, some analysts still forecast an ADA rally to $10, citing strong network activity and growing adoption. Charles Hoskinson’s emphasis on Midnight as Cardano’s biggest growth area has fueled optimism. At the time of writing, Cardano price is trading around $0.67, down over 5% in the last 24 hours.

BTC accelerated its drop toward $86,000, sparking comments from Binance’s CEO Richard Teng that the move was a temporary retreat. The current market turbulence is a tactical retreat, not a reversal, wrote Binance’s CEO Richard Teng in a recent thread. The past two days caused market panic as Bitcoin (BTC) extended its drawdown from its all-time high. Teng believes crypto can bounce back even stronger, as it has shown after similar stress tests. Here's my thoughts on the recent market turbulence: It's important to view this as a tactical retreat, not a reversal. Crypto has been here before and bounced back even stronger. Here's why we should stay optimistic. ⤵️ A thread 🧵 — Richard Teng (@_RichardTeng) February 25, 2025 Binance went through $334M in total liquidations for the past 24 hours, a level that is not unusual for mid-cycle drawdowns. The Binance liquidations were surpassed only on Bybit, which turned into the most active market in the past 24 hours. Despite the price fluctuations and break below the $90,000 range, BTC has not seen a significant drawdown in this post-halving cycle. In other cycles, the depth of the bear market erased 70% to 90% of its value, but this time, BTC has seen corrections of up to 25%. In the short term, the BTC price move followed the liquidation of short positions all the way down to $86,000, as some traders predicted. The liquidation cascade affected other assets, shifting the available liquidity. After the recent drawdown, the crypto market will remain with a peak inflow of stablecoins, potentially moving to the next big trend while abandoning defunct narratives. BTC, ETH sink after Bybit stress test The market also sits at a crossroads that may define the coming months. The recent election cycle, followed by several meme token trends, was seen as an overly aggressive grab for liquidity, which essentially burned out the energy for a 2025 bull market. The Bybit hack , followed by significant liquidations on the exchange, was another stress test for the market. BTC has recovered after more significant liquidations, but this time, a general loss of sentiment may reverse the recent relatively easy rallies. Historically, BTC retains relatively low volatility. Even bull cycles have shown resilience, continuing after drawdowns of up to 40%. However, the latest post-halving market enjoyed outsized mainstream attention and caused high expectations of an always-growing market. For crypto, there are few mechanisms to forestall losses, even when there are dedicated buyers and holders. Liquidations for leveraged positions still cause significant price swings. The market is becoming better at absorbing the losses, and exchanges are more liquid with new inflows of stablecoins. Despite this, the market sentiment has changed dramatically, with traders showing extreme fear of opening new positions. Crypto assets still manage a small bounce off the recent lows During the latest drawdown, the percentage of addresses in profit was down to 89.33% . BTC has fallen to levels that may mean capitulation for some of the latest buyers. Despite this, even recent buyers expect a more active 2025 bull market and are reluctant to sell. Recent buyers of BTC are facing the challenge of holding widening unrealized losses after a dip to $86,000. | Source: Bitcoin Magazine Pro The recent dip to $86,000 showed BTC was resilient enough to bounce from the lows twice in a day. BTC recovered to $87,009.92 while previously bouncing over $89,000 again. Other altcoins took the recent correction in stride, with relatively small drawdowns. The market has affected hype assets the most, while altcoins remain in their usual range. After the loss of confidence in the meme market, most assets are down over 90%, and there are expectations memes may never recover. Overall, only the top 5 blue chips have recovered their all-time highs with ease, while other assets require much more liquidity and hype to make a return. The crash of the meme token market has deeply affected both Solana (SOL) and ETH, as the two assets are down more than 50% from their all-time high. With that recent drawdown, the entire ecosystems are getting reassessed for their abilities to lock in gains and retain liquidity for the long term.

The S&P 500 plunged 0.9%, extending its four-day losing streak, while the Nasdaq collapsed 1.8%, wiping out last week’s record highs, per data from Google Finance. The Conference Board reported that consumer confidence for February sank 7 points to 98.3, a far steeper drop than the 102.5 estimate from Wall Street analysts, and it shows a crack in consumer spending power, with Americans now expecting inflation to rise to 6% over the next year, up from 5.2% last month. The weak outlook pushed stocks lower, with investors scrambling to assess the potential for a recession. Tech stocks sink as inflation fears mount The tech-heavy Nasdaq bore the brunt of the sell-off, as investors dumped growth stocks in the face of rising uncertainty. Tesla collapsed 7.8%, making it one of the worst performers of the day, while Palantir slid 3.6%. The Magnificent Seven tech giants, which have fueled much of Wall Street’s recent gains, all traded lower, erasing billions in market value. Meanwhile, world tech stocks have risen a MASSIVE ~1,700% since the beginning of 2009. By comparison, global stocks excluding the Technology, Media, and, Telecom (TMT) sector have gained just ~300%. Tech equities have more than DOUBLED since October 2022 while the remaining stocks are up just 40%. The US technology sector has been one of the major beneficiaries of this trend. Since October 2022, the Nasdaq 100 index has officially risen over +100%. This market needs Big Tech. Anyway, Bitcoin, a favorite among risk-hungry investors, also took a brutal hit, crashing 7.5% to $86,940. Traders pointed to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates as factors squeezing riskier assets, with many pulling back from crypto and AI stocks. Nvidia lost 2%, extending its weekly drop to 13%, while Meta Platforms declined 1.2%. Bank stocks followed the downward spiral, as Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan Chase each slid more than 1%. Traders are now questioning whether the Federal Reserve’s efforts to curb inflation could end up triggering a worse economic slowdown. Trump’s economic and geopolitical games At a White House meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday, Trump confirmed that a 25% levy on Canadian and Mexican imports will take effect next week. “These tariffs are necessary,” Trump told reporters. “We have to protect American workers.” The announcement affected commodity markets, as aluminum prices surged even before the tariffs were officially enacted, adding more pressure to rising costs. The inflation threat had already been looming, with January data showing a surprise jump to 3%, driven partly by an avian flu outbreak that sent egg prices surging. President Donald Trump is seeking to escalate U.S. semiconductor controls aimed at China, according to a report from Bloomberg. Trump’s economic policies faced severe legal setbacks on Tuesday, as a trio of federal judges issued rulings against his administration. In Washington, D.C., Judge Loren Alikhan extended a block on Trump’s freeze of federal spending for grants, loans, and financial aid. The judge blasted the spending freeze, writing, “Defendants either wanted to pause up to $3 trillion in federal spending practically overnight, or they expected each federal agency to review every single one of its grants, loans, and funds for compliance in less than twenty-four hours. The breadth of that command is almost unfathomable.” The spending freeze is part of Trump’s D.O.G.E initiative, a cost-cutting measure led by Elon Musk to slash government expenditures. The ruling temporarily pauses the department, putting another roadblock in Trump’s economic overhaul. Meanwhile, in Washington state, Judge Jamal Whitehead blocked Trump’s executive order halting the Refugee Admissions Program. Whitehead ruled that while Trump has the authority to regulate refugee entry, he “cannot ignore Congress’ detailed framework for refugee admissions and the limits it places on the president’s ability to suspend the same.” In the third case, in D.C. federal court, Judge Amir Ali for a third time ordered the Trump administration to release foreign aid funds. Ali’s order came at the end of a hearing where an attorney for aid groups told him that the money the judge previously had said should be disbursed to the group remained frozen.

However, the launch did not go as planned, as the network encountered issues with finalizing transactions shortly thereafter. Hildobby, a data analyst at crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly, noted that the Holesky testnet had been down for nearly two hours following the Pectra launch due to “buggy code,” which caused an invalid block that most Ethereum clients accepted. Due to this, Holesky has been unable to finalize transactions. According to the analyst, only two Ethereum clients, Erigon and Reth, operated correctly. However, the bug affected clients like Geth, Nethermind, Ethjs, and Besu.

To read full editions, subscribe . We’ve rounded up the myriad of crypto ETF plans issuers are dreaming up, and launching. The proposals continue to move beyond ones focused on solana, XRP and litecoin . An update from yesterday: A 19b-4 filing from Nasdaq signals Grayscale Investments’ intent to offer a Polkadot ETF. 21Shares put out a similar proposal a few weeks back. Polkadot (DOT) has a market cap of nearly $7 billion, ranking it 26th among crypto assets. The filing is not a proposal for Grayscale to convert one of its existing trusts to an ETF wrapper, like it had done with its bitcoin and ether products. That’s because it does not yet have a trust investing in DOT. I previously wrote about how Grayscale historically first goes with private placement launches for accredited investors before obtaining public quotations for unrestricted shares and making the products SEC-reporting companies. The conversion to an ETF is the final step. Grayscale skipped the initial steps upon filing for a Cardano ETF . Speaking of that product, the SEC acknowledged it in a Monday filing , noting the agency would solicit comments on the proposal. The thought is that Grayscale (despite not returning requests for comment) must feel it can take these shortcuts given the evolving regulatory environment . This comes after Nasdaq late last week filed to list shares of Canary Capital’s proposed HBAR ETF, which hold Hedera’s native cryptocurrency. This 19b-4 filing comes a few months after the company submitted an S-1 for the product in November. So, the momentum around altcoin ETF filings has not changed from when we last checked in.

New Targets Emerge,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-continuation-after-crash/,"XRP’s recent price movements have followed a pattern that crypto analyst Javon Marks believes signals the potential for a strong continuation rally. Sharing his analysis on the social media platform X, Marks pointed to a “hidden bullish divergence” on XRP’s daily candlestick chart. Despite the ongoing price crash, the presence of this bullish divergence opens up new bullish targets for the XRP price. XRP’s Price Crash Worsens, But Hidden Bullish Divergence Suggests Next Move XRP’s price action has faced consistent downward pressure over the past week, with the decline intensifying in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, XRP has dropped by approximately 13% in the past 24 hours and is on the verge of retesting a crucial support level at $2. Related Reading: XRP Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle Pattern, Why The Target Is $8 However, an interesting analysis shows that this decline is part of a hidden bull divergence pattern, where both the price and the RSI indicators are creating a series of highs and lows on the 1-day candlestick timeframe. This interesting pattern is characterized by higher lows and higher highs on the XRP price chart, while there’s a series of lower lows and lower highs on the RSI indicator. This divergent formation between the cryptocurrency’s price and the RSI is known to be bullish. Particularly, it suggests the selling pressure shown by the RSI could be slowing down. Javon Marks emphasized that XRP is preparing for a “massive continuation wave up” and that the necessary technical confirmations for such a move are already in place. This assertion builds upon his earlier February 18 analysis, where he described the hidden bullish divergence as forming in a “textbook fashion. Crash To Reverse Soon? Price Targets To Watch According to Javon Mark’s projection, an upside move would see the XRP price eventually creating a higher high, as expected from the bullish divergence pattern. In terms of a specific price target, Mark’s projection shows that the next peak could reach at least $3.80. If realized, this would push XRP beyond its current all-time high of $3.40. Related Reading: XRP Price Rallies To ATH At $3.4, Here’s What’s Driving It And Why The Pump Will Continue However, this outlook hinges on the XRP price holding above the bullish divergence support at $2. Any sustained breakdown below this threshold could challenge the strength of the projected rally and alter the bullish outlook. Adding to this perspective, Marks also noted the similarity between XRP’s consolidation in the past few weeks since it reached $3.36 and that of a consolidation after a strong rally in the first half of 2017 after a strong rally. Although the current consolidation phase has lasted longer than the one observed back then, both formations share key structural similarities. The 2017 consolidation ultimately led to a continuation rally that pushed the XRP price to new highs. If history repeats itself, the present consolidation could also be a precursor to another significant leg up. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.15, down by 13.2% and 15.9% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively, and is now in danger of losing the $2.0 support soon.

OKX’s meticulous planning makes for some fascinating reading. The secret crisis management document seen by CoinDesk refers to a messaging “SWAT Team” that can be mobilized to implement various ways the firm’s top executives can communicate a settlement via social media and when speaking to reporters. Well in advance of Monday’s large fine and forfeiture, OKX had produced specific guidance with regards to settling with the DOJ, as well as the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC, or sanctions watchdog), for example. A favored approach is to point out that the entire crypto industry has been broadly under intense scrutiny and that OKX is cooperating fully with regulators, the document said. This was echoed in Monday’s press release which said OKX “appreciates” the DOJ’s “collaboration.” Since the administration of President Donald Trump took over last month, the main focus for regulatory agencies in the crypto arena has been to reverse their previously aggressive enforcement stance, with the SEC dropping ongoing litigation and closing investigations . But not so in the case of OKX, which, like Kucoin with its recent $300 million penalty and Binance back in 2023, has been forced into costly settlements. The guidance refers to what is expected from OKX founder Star Xu, President Hong Fang and other executives when it comes to “their social media actions in two scenarios: 1) Leak before OFAC settlement, 2) upon OFAC settlement.” Also, on the issue of OFAC, if executives are asked if OKX has served sanctioned markets, one suggestion is to say: “Customers from sanctioned markets slipped through when we had immature compliance controls and systems [...] It is a very small and insignificant part of the Okcoin or OKX customer base.” Indeed, Monday's press release from OKX acknowledged that U.S. customers were able to trade on the global exchange. ""The total number of U.S. customers involved – which are no longer on the platform – amounted to a small percentage of the Company’s worldwide customer population,"" the release said. Brand awareness Another priority for OKX is how the firm choreographs its big-ticket sponsorship arrangements with the likes of Manchester City football club, F1 team McLaren and the Tribeca Film Festival. The firm estimates that around $100 million per annum has been spent on these partnerships over the past three years. The action plan for brand partners involves the OKX marketing chief giving each partner a phone call “at the last hour before the news breaks.” The recommended strategy here is to say OKX has prepared for a regulatory review, given the heightened scrutiny on crypto firms. If asked why the exchange did not share information about this before, the document states that these are pending inquiries and non-public matters. There is also a bullet point suggesting the CMO and OKX’s head of legal “review clauses in our brand partner contracts again.” Don’t mention OKB Another detail that gets attention in the OKX planning document is the exchange’s native cryptocurrency, OKB. An obvious concern in the aftermath of FTX is any suggestion that OKB has been used as collateral or to finance any operations of OKX, as was the case with FTX’s FTT token . Of course, the OKB exchange token hasn't been subject to anything like the iniquities of FTX’s exchange token. However, it was involved in a sudden flash crash in January 2024, after which OKX quickly offered to compensate users who had lost out. The token, which has a relatively thin trading volume and liquidity, saw 10 dormant wallets become active and begin trading just before the crash, according to Marina Khaustova, COO Crystal Intelligence, a blockchain analytics firm. Not long after the OKB crash, OKX executives Tim Byun, the former CEO of OKcoin and head of global government relations, and Head of Product Wei Lan were let go by OKX . A source familiar with the situation said Byun was ""sacrificed"" following the OKB crash. Unsurprisingly, the OKX comms protocol emphasizes that execs should “refrain from mentioning OKB and reference this only if asked.” Media management Another part of the puzzle is how the exchange should deal with media inquiries. Should OKX receive emails or a phone call from a journalist looking for comment about ongoing investigations, the SWAT Team and PR team should go into action to “buy time by offering up leadership schedules” Meanwhile, the plan is “to contact key friendly publications for a parallel story to seed in a complimentary narrative to the originating story,” the document states. “1. Push for delay 2. Confirm friendly publications 3. Asynchronously queue up internal / external comms, so we hit send as the story comes out,” it said. OKX did not provide a comment by press time",Finance|Exclusive|OKX|Exchange,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|OKB|SPONSORED|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-25 21:40:33

Which Level in BTC is Critical for Liquidation?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-microstrategy-be-liquidated-if-bitcoin-falls-further-which-level-in-btc-is-critical-for-liquidation/,"As MicroStrategy (MSTR) has experienced a significant drop of over 55%, speculation has increased regarding the possibility of a “forced liquidation.” With the company owning approximately 499,096 Bitcoins worth $43.7 billion, many are questioning whether further declines in the price of Bitcoin could force MicroStrategy to sell its holdings. MicroStrategy has been accumulating Bitcoin for years, with an average purchase cost of around $66,350 per BTC. This isn’t the first time concerns about liquidation have surfaced; similar discussions arose during the 2022 bear market, when Bitcoin fell from around $70,000 to around $15,000. But the key question remains: Is it different this time? The foundation of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy is its ability to raise capital. In a scenario where liabilities significantly exceed assets, this ability could be compromised. But that doesn’t necessarily mean “forced liquidation.” MicroStrategy's approach includes: Borrowing through 0% convertible notes. Using capital to buy Bitcoin and increase exposure. Selling shares at a premium to raise additional capital. Repeating the cycle to expand assets even further. MicroStrategy currently has approximately $8.2 billion in total debt, backed by $43.4 billion worth of Bitcoin, reflecting a leverage ratio of approximately 19%. Importantly, most of this debt is in the form of convertible notes with conversion prices below the current share price and do not mature until 2028. Related News: Investment Strategist Explained Why Bitcoin Price Declined, Shared the Event He Said “If This Happens, It Will Fall Even Lower” A forced liquidation would likely require a “fundamental change” within the company. Under existing credit agreements, early repayment of convertible notes can be triggered under certain conditions. However, for this to happen, typically one of the following conditions would need to be met: Shareholders vote to dissolve the company. Corporate bankruptcy. MicroStrategy co-founder and Chairman Michael Saylor holds 46.8% of the voting power, making a shareholder-initiated liquidation unlikely. For a serious liquidity problem to occur, Bitcoin would need to experience a sustained price decline of over 50% from current levels. Saylor has repeatedly dismissed the idea of forced liquidation, even claiming that the company would “buy all of Bitcoin” if Bitcoin fell to $1. However, the role of convertible stockholders in such a scenario cannot be ignored. A sustained decline in both Bitcoin and MSTR stock prices could hinder MicroStrategy’s ability to raise capital, which is crucial to its long-term strategy. Investors are witnessing the first bearish market for MicroStrategy since its Bitcoin-focused strategy began gaining traction in 2024. The question is: will investors continue to “buy the dip”? Michael Saylor's stance is clear: “Bitcoin is on sale.” Time will tell whether the market agrees. *This is not investment advice.

The Global Dollar Network announced on Feb. 25 that the U.S. dollar pegged stablecoin, which Paxos introduced on November 1, 2024, was now available on Solana ( SOL ). Paxos’ affiliate, the Paxos Digital Singapore Pte. Ltd, is the issuer of the Global Dollar (USDG), and is an entity regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. At the time of the initial launch, Paxos said its MAS-regulated subsidiary would partner crypto exchanges, wallets and blockchain platforms to accelerate USDG distribution to individuals and institutions.The USDG token initially launched on Ethereum. Per the announcement, institutions can access USDG on Solana via Anchorage Digital and Kraken. “The launch of USDG on Solana will accelerate stablecoin adoption for payments and finance at a global scale, and unlock new opportunities for businesses and retail users alike,” said Lily Liu, President of the Solana Foundation. You might also like: USDC and EURC become first stablecoins approved under Dubai’s new crypto rules Partners that have joined the Global Dollar Network and will integrate USDG include payments infrastructure firm alfred, Brazilian fintech Caliza, and cross-border payments provider Noah. Others are crypto platforms Rain and Sling Money. Global Dollar Network will collaborate with these partners to drive USDG adoption on Solana. Targeted use cases include card payments, cross-border transfers, remittances, and treasury management. Commenting on the integration, Ezra Kebrab, founder and chief executive officer of Caliza, noted: “The future of finance is borderless, and stablecoins are making it a reality. Joining the USDG network enables Caliza to break down barriers to economic opportunity. Now, businesses worldwide can benefit from access to dollar-denominated financial products that are safe and regulated.” The stablecoin market has grown significantly amid regulatory changes and greater adoption. While Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC make up the two largest by market share, other players are making inroads as markets open up in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Paxos’ suite of stablecoin products aimed at this growth potential include Pax Dollar (USDP) and Pax Gold (PAXG). The company also issues PayPal USD (PYUSD) as well as the yield-bearing stablecoin Lift Dollar.

New Funding Strengthens Bitwise’s Position According to a Coindesk report , the asset management company, which manages over $12 billion in client assets, received investments from firms like Electric Capital, MassMutual, Highland Capital, MIT Investment Management Company, Haun Ventures, ParaFi Capital, Khosla Ventures, General Catalyst, Blockchain Coinvestors, and Nikesh Arora. Furthermore, this new funding will help Bitwise strengthen its financial position and add more items to its investment solutions. It is worth mentioning that the crypto investment firm has seen lots of growth, with assets under management increasing more than tenfold in 2024. The firm CEO Hunter Horsley said Bitwise is committed to building a firm that serves its clients for decades. “We’re proud to have been a reliable partner to clients for the last seven years, and we are building the firm to be the best partner to clients for decades to come.” Bitwise is Expanding Investment Offerings Notably, Bitwise grants their clients a wide range of investment products. This includes yield and alpha strategies, multi-strategy funds, separately managed accounts, on-chain staking, index funds, and Bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs). They believe that selling these solutions will help their clients access different areas of the crypto market. Similarly, the firm’s services are used by more than 5,000 wealth teams, registered investment advisors (RIAs), family offices, institutional clients, and over 15 banks and broker-dealers across the U.S. and Europe. With the new funding, Bitwise plans to expand its product lineup and improve investor services. Meanwhile, Bitwise is also growing its team. The company, which has offices in San Francisco, New York, and London, plans to hire more than 30 new employees this year. These new hires will focus on investment research, client service, and educational initiatives to help investors better understand the crypto space. The Future of Crypto Investing Bitwise believes crypto is becoming a core part of institutional investing . The firm sees the asset class following a similar path to private equity, private credit, and high-yield bonds. With these market movements, Bitwise intends to provide structured and trusted investment solutions for institutions looking to enter the market. However, regulatory changes and market volatility remain challenges, but Bitwise is positioning itself to navigate these uncertainties properly. The firm remains committed to being a responsible partner for investors while supporting the broader crypto ecosystem. Meanwhile, Bitwise remains positive, maintaining its bold prediction that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025, regardless of whether a national strategic Bitcoin reserve is established.

To read full editions, subscribe . Crypto’s most lucrative tech marriage appears headed for a divorce. Presently, the Solana memecoin launchpad pump.fun migrates tokens with sufficient liquidity to trade on Raydium, a Solana-based automated market maker. The so-called graduation mechanism has proven very profitable for Raydium: Pump.fun pools accounted for 36% of the DEX’s $154 million in 2024 swap revenue. That looks set to change, as an amm.pump.fun URL recently went online, and an onchain sleuth posted evidence that pump.fun was testing liquidity pools for its own AMM. Raydium’s token is down some 40% since Sunday as investors respond to a looming dent in the protocol’s revenue. AMMs are easy enough to spin up in the open-source world of crypto, and pump.fun’s aspirations to create its own had been spinning around the Solana rumor mill for some time. By graduating memecoins to its own AMM, pump.fun would vertically integrate the token launch process — and potentially push its already-gaudy revenue figures even higher. Pump.fun had at least one other potential suitor for its AMM needs. Ellipsis Labs contacted the launchpad about implementing Plasma, an AMM designed to limit sandwich attacks, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Blockworks. Pump.fun declined the offer. Regardless, the in-house AMM launch feels like a pretty obvious move. Pump.fun apparently plans to launch a token, and having its own fee-collecting AMM could provide value accrual to that token. That likely may depend on whether hardcore memecoin traders deem the pump.fun AMM liquid enough to be worth their time. On X yesterday, anonymous Raydium core contributor Infra warned that pump.fun would be making a “strategic miscalculation” launching its own AMM since Raydium provided the “liquidity that helped Pump tokens thrive.” It’s unclear how good of a look the world would get into any future pump.fun AMM. The memecoin launchpad is closed-source , so it would be a slight change in direction if it releases a fully open-source AMM. Get the news in your inbox.

Last month, US President Donald Trump announced he would impose trade tariffs against Mexico and Canada. The president revealed on Monday that the tariffs will begin their implementation next week after a month-long implementation delay. Investors also expressed their worry over Trump’s administration’s federal job cut program damaging household confidence. Uncertainty about how the administration’s policies will affect global growth and political alliances has reportedly led to switching to alternative assets such as gold. According to Coinmarketcap Bitcoin dropped to $87,239, its lowest point since mid-November. The plummet resulted from investors stepping back from a popular Trump trade. Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone said that the president may push for government cost-cutting over economic growth as part of the DOGE government efficiency push. He suggested the Trump administration may push ahead with the tariffs to balance perceived trade unfairness rather than using them as a negotiation tactic. He added the measures could hurt the markets and the economy. US President Donald Trump holds an executive order on increasing tariffs, in the Oval Office. KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERS Rajeev De Mello, a portfolio manager at Gama Asset Management commented that if the US pulled back from global leadership too quickly multinational corporations and global investors would suffer risks. He added that they have benefited from a stable international order for a long time. Analysts reveal the Fed is unlikely to cut interest rates in 2025 Friday’s release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures(PCE) index will give Federal Reserve officials more information about January’s inflation path. The data will also inform the Fed on its rate cuts decisions. A January Consumer Price Index revealed that inflation rose by 0.5% putting the annual inflation rate at 3%. Josh Jamner, an investment strategy analyst reported that the Fed was unlikely to cut interest rates further after the CPI report. In December, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.25% -4.5%. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) commented that economic activity had continued to expand at a solid pace. It revealed that it would consider the extent and timing of any additional adjustments to the target range. Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted that the Fed evaluated Trump’s proposals but did not incorporate them in the decision to cut rates. Powell emphasized that the Fed would better understand the policies once they were implemented. He revealed the Fed would be cautious before further rate cuts. The chair added that it would be appropriate to move cautiously and look for progress on inflation. The Federal Reserve announced in a January meeting that it would maintain interest rates at 4.25% to 4.50%. The policymakers commented that inflation rose in January after the December rate cuts. Powell said in his press conference the central bank was not in a hurry to revise its rate cuts since the economy remained strong. He added that the Federal Reserve did not know which countries would be affected and for how long the effects would last.

Matt Cole, CEO of Strive Asset Management, sent a letter on February 24 to Ryan Cohen, GameStop’s chairman and CEO, asking the company to convert a huge portion of its $5 billion cash reserve into Bitcoin. Strive manages exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold GameStop stock, and Matt claims this gives his company a “fiduciary responsibility” to advocate for decisions that maximize shareholder value. “We believe GameStop has an incredible opportunity to transform its financial future by becoming the premier Bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector,” Matt wrote in his letter. His argument? Holding cash is a losing game. Bitcoin, he claims, would protect GameStop’s reserves against inflation and help the company outpace monetary debasement. Letter addressed to Ryan Cohen, CEO of Gamestop, on a proposal to adopt the Bitcoin standard. According to Matt’s letter, GameStop has reduced operating losses and offset deficits through interest income from its cash holdings. He said: “By holding Bitcoin through this worldwide monetary revolution, GameStop can transform its substantial treasury from a slowly shrinking resource into a profit center. The moment is ripe now that new FASB accounting standards recognize unrealized Bitcoin gains as profit.” GameStop weighs Bitcoin move as stock surges by 20% Reports of GameStop considering Bitcoin and crypto investments have already sent GameStop shares surging 20% in after-hours trading. A February 14 report from CNBC claimed that GameStop is actively evaluating alternative assets, including Bitcoin. But the report did stress that the company hasn’t made a final decision and is still determining whether crypto aligns with its long-term strategy. Matt’s letter outlines a blueprint for how GameStop could execute a Bitcoin play. He suggests issuing at-the-market (ATM) offerings and convertible debt securities to raise capital specifically for Bitcoin purchases. Letter received. — Ryan Cohen (@ryancohen) February 25, 2025 The strategy is similar to Strategy’s aggressive accumulation of Bitcoin, a decision that completely redefined the company’s entire financial model. Matt also points to companies like Semler Scientific and MARA Holdings, which have seen stock rallies after adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. He said that GameStop is in a prime position to do the same, especially after stabilizing its finances over the last two years. Matt told Ryan that: “Your stock is uniquely suited to purchasing additional Bitcoin to the benefit of your shareholders given its high trading volume. Continuing to issue new equity through an ATM program can generate capital quickly under favorable market conditions, enabling continued Bitcoin acquisitions.” Earlier this month, Ryan posted a photo with Michael Saylor, the Bitcoin maxi founder of Strategy, on X (formerly Twitter). While the report did confirm that Saylor isn’t officially advising GameStop, the meeting had the crypto community excited nonetheless. pic.twitter.com/wlOwEGli6n — Ryan Cohen (@ryancohen) February 8, 2025 Ryan, who bought GameStop shares in 2020 and joined the board in 2021, has been focused on cutting costs, closing unprofitable stores, and streamlining operations. And GameStop has experimented with crypto before. In 2022, the company launched a crypto wallet that allowed users to store digital assets and NFTs. But regulatory uncertainty led to the shutdown of the service in 2023. GameStop’s cash pile stood at $4.6 billion as of November 2, 2023, according to a December securities filing. Under Ryan’s leadership, the company has been strategic with its investments, but Bitcoin would be its biggest gamble yet. “Allocating treasury resources to cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin risks diluting shareholder value, as speculative alternatives can undermine GameStop’s financial stability and potentially impair your ability to raise future financing, including the Bitcoin financing strategies outlined below in Section 4,” said Matt Cole in his letter. Now GameStop of course is a legend in the meme stock sector, thanks to the rise of Keith Gill (Roaring Kitty) in 2021, who led a retail investor movement through YouTube livestreams and Reddit posts. Matt thinks: “By adopting a treasury strategy centered on adopting the Bitcoin Standard where Bitcoin is your hurdle rate for capital deployment in pursuit of your corporate mission, GameStop can move beyond “meme” sentiment, forging a stable foundation to drive sustainable shareholder value.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?
