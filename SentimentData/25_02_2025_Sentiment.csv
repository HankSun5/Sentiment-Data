Following XRP’s price forecast, analysts set sights on PropiChain (PCHAIN) , a new altcoin that simplifies investment and provides opportunities in the AI and real estate space. PropiChain’s recent market listing on CoinMarketCap spells its potential for a 100x rally once it launches officially. The project leverages the real estate investment space, one of the oldest markets in the world, making a name for itself by eliminating the barriers of traditional property investment. Find out why XRP’s price forecast favors this altcoin. XRP Prepares For Massive Moves Following Its Price Forecast Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared in a post on X that XRP was preparing for a possible breakout from its ascending triangle. The analyst shared that if XRP maintained its bullish outlook, the project could experience a 26% move, and many investors anticipate the results of this price forecast. XRP is priced at about $2.7, surging over 11% within the past week due to the positive investor sentiment surrounding the project. Recently, Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) approved a Hashdex XRP ETF , which shows its potential for mainstream adoption this year. Experts predict that XRP will witness a surge of over 31% by May and analysts say that this price forecast will trigger a rally for other altcoins. That’s why top investors believe that the XRP price forecast could lead to PCHAINS massive rally. Meet PropiChain, The Advanced Real Estate Platform PropiChain is a blockchain platform transforming how individuals invest in real estate. Unlike conventional investment systems, PropiChain offers a diverse range of features like tokenized real estate, a metaverse platform, and AI-driven data. Although XRP’s price forecast has sparked excitement among many investors, PropiChain emerges as the best altcoin for long-term investment. The tokenization of real estate is one of the key features that sets PropiChain ahead of other projects. With PropiChain, you can access a variety of AI-driven tools to help you make informed choices. These tools are useful in analyzing real estate trends, rental income, and market fluctuations to ensure that you make the most of your investment. The PropiChain project offers easy access to blue-chip real estate by allowing traders to own fractions of these assets. So, imagine you want to purchase a luxury apartment that’s worth millions of dollars, but you only have $10,000. With PropiChain, rather than trying to acquire millions to purchase this property, you can own a fraction of it with tokenized shares starting at just $1,000. This unique approach is why experts believe that once the PCHAIN token launches, it could surge as high as $10. PropiChain’s bullish price forecast and dedication to streamlining property ownership show its potential to outpace XRP this year. Another reason why analysts believe PropiChain could outpace XRP’s price forecast is the platform’s efforts toward maintaining safety. The PropiChain project leverages smart contracts to ensure that all activities on the platform are secure and transparent. This Altcoin Prepares For A Massive Rally Post-Launch: Join The PCHAIN Presale! The PropiChain presale is in its second round, and each PCHAIN token is priced at $0.011. Already, over $1.2 million has been raised, and this altcoin has quickly become a top choice among savvy investors. Due to the influx of investors to this altcoin’s presale, over 62% of the tokens allocated to this round have been purchased. Experts believe that once round three starts, this altcoin will witness a surge of over 100%, rising to $0.023. Analysts believe this altcoin could mirror XRP’s price forecast once it lists at $0.032.

According to a new announcement from Robinhood, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is dropping its investigation into the trading app less than a year after sending the firm a Wells Notice. The SEC sent Robinhood a Wells Notice , a formal warning of investigation, in May of last year despite Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev’s claims that the firm met with the regulator over 15 times “in good faith”. “We tried to create what’s called the special purpose broker-dealer for the purpose of transacting crypto assets. We actually came in good faith to meet with the SEC. I think we met with them 16 times and, unfortunately, that was not reciprocated.” Now, with the charges dropped, Robinhood calls for the SEC to regulate with regulations as opposed to enforcement actions. Says Dan Gallagher, Robinhood’s chief legal, compliance and corporate affairs officer, on the SEC’s decision to drop charges, “We applaud the staff’s decision to close this investigation with no action. Let me be crystal clear—this investigation never should have been opened. Robinhood Crypto always has and will always respect federal securities laws and never allowed transactions in securities. As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed. We appreciate the formal closing of this investigation, and we are happy to see a return to the rule of law and commitment to fairness at the SEC.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to the post, the seizure was the result of a joint effort between SDNY and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in San Diego. A spokesperson for SDNY did not return CoinDesk’s request for comment before press time, and no further details about the seizure or any related investigation were immediately available. Uranium Finance was essentially a clone of automated market maker (AMM) Uniswap deployed on Binance’s BNB chain (then called Binance Smart Chain). In April 2021, a hacker exploited a bug in Uranium’s pair contracts to steal $50 million in various tokens. At the time of the incident, the Uranium Finance hack was one of the largest monetary exploits in decentralized finance (DeFi) history.

Uranium Finance shuttered after the hack, leaving victims without answers or financial restitution.

The rest of the world appears to be following the United States’ lead after it set the tone for a crypto-forward 2025. The Trump administration has continued to embrace cryptocurrency and is creating a favorable regulatory environment for crypto companies. As a result, financial institutions across the world are now looking to hop on the digital asset train. The latest is DekaBank, a leading German investment bank managing assets worth approximately €377 billion, has officially launched cryptocurrency trading and custody services tailored for institutional clients. Before the Trump pro-cryptocurrency run, Germany had already laid some groundwork for crypto regulation. Back in 2013, the country became one of the first to recognize cryptocurrencies as financial assets. Then, in 2020, it made BaFin licensing mandatory for all crypto exchanges. DekaBank now offers crypto services The recently announced launch is the result of DekaBank’s meticulous planning and development over the span of two years. In December of 2024, the bank secured a crypto custody license from Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( BaFin ) and the European Central Bank ( ECB ) under the German Banking Act (KWG). This licensure authorizes DekaBank to offer comprehensive crypto custody services, ensuring that institutional clients can securely store and manage their digital assets within a regulated framework. In July of 2024, the bank received a license as a crypto securities registrar for the German issuance of DLT-based digital securities. DekaBank is also not new to the digital asset space. In fact, the bank is a very active member of the community. DekaBank is the founder of SWIAT , the blockchain platform for digital securities and has notable names like Standard Chartered and LBBW as investors. Commerzbank was the first German bank to receive a crypto custody license from BaFin and the European Central Bank and DekaBank followed suit not long after. The bank’s services are exclusively for institutional investors Private buyers are explicitly excluded from DekaBank’s crypto offerings. Bloomberg reports that DekaBank is exclusively offering its crypto services to institutional investors as they have the necessary know-how, resources and infrastructure to professionally manage risks from crypto investments. A board member of DekaBank explained the bank’s position, saying, “We have the necessary experience, the necessary licenses as well as a tested and ready-to-use infrastructure to accompany savings banks and our other institutional customers.” Other companies from the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe, the savings bank finance group to which DekaBank belongs, also offer institutional customers access to cryptocurrencies. Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW) has teamed up with Bitpanda to give their corporate clients access to a platform for the custody, buying, and trading of cryptocurrencies. Cooperative banks, Volksbanks and Raiffeisenbanks, under the leadership of DZ bank are in the process of developing their crypto services. They intend to launch officially by mid-year, offering crypto services to private customers. The initiative is being launched alongside IT service provider Atruvia and the Stuttgart Stock Exchange for the German Geno primary banks. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The move has caught the attention of market analysts, with some suggesting that it could be a sign of anticipated price volatility. Massive Token Unlock Raises Questions Solana’s upcoming token unlock event is one of the largest in recent memory, with over $2 billion worth of SOL set to be released into the market. Token unlocks can significantly impact asset prices, often leading to increased supply and downward pressure on value. Given the scale of this event, Wintermute’s decision to withdraw a large quantity of SOL from Binance has raised questions about whether it anticipates a price surge or is positioning itself to manage liquidity as volatility increases. Potential Market Impact of the Unlock Event Large token unlocks can have varied effects on the market. In some cases, they lead to a sell-off as early investors or project teams liquidate their holdings. However, if market demand is strong, the additional supply can be absorbed without significantly affecting prices. Solana has been one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies in recent months, rebounding from its 2022 lows and reclaiming a strong position in the market. Investors are now closely watching whether the upcoming unlock will be met with buying interest or lead to a short-term correction. Wintermute’s Role in Market Liquidity As a market maker, Wintermute plays a crucial role in maintaining liquidity and facilitating trading across exchanges. Its decision to move SOL off Binance could indicate preparations for increased trading activity or plans to deploy liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Historically, market makers have used large-scale token unlocks as opportunities to profit from price movements, whether through short-term trading strategies or arbitrage across different platforms. Broader Implications for Solana’s Ecosystem The Solana ecosystem has been growing rapidly, with a surge in decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and DeFi platforms utilizing its blockchain. While the token unlock represents a potential challenge in terms of market dynamics, strong adoption and institutional interest in Solana could help mitigate any negative effects. Some analysts believe that if Solana can maintain its momentum despite the unlock, it could reinforce confidence in its long-term growth. Others caution that if selling pressure intensifies, the asset could face short-term volatility before finding a new price equilibrium. Conclusion Wintermute’s withdrawal of $38 million in SOL ahead of the $2 billion unlock has added an extra layer of uncertainty to an already significant event for Solana. While token unlocks often lead to increased supply and volatility, Solana’s strong fundamentals and market positioning could help counteract potential selling pressure. Investors will be closely monitoring how the market reacts to the unlock event and whether demand remains strong enough to absorb the new supply. As one of the most-watched cryptocurrencies in the market, Solana’s price action in the coming days could provide valuable insights into broader market sentiment.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,MARKET|SOL|TRADING|BNB|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-24 23:12:00

ETH was last changing hands around $2,600, having dumped back to the south of its 21DMA at $2,700 after briefly hitting $2,850 on Sunday. The world’s second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization remains trapped within multi-week ranges, as it continues to experience elevated sell pressure as it nears it 200DMA just above $2,900. The Ethereum price is now down over 35% from its December highs above $4,000 and remains stuck in a medium-term downtrend. With Bitcoin (BTC) and the broader market also appearing to lose steam, a retest of recent lows in the $2,100s could be on the cards. However, Ethereum could still be a great crypto to accumulate on the dip, owing to what various analysts are referring to as an excellent “risk-reward” profile at current price levels. Big Ethereum Price Bounce Coming? ETH Presents Excellent “Risk Reward” Popular anonymous crypto analyst Doctor Profit argued in a thread on X on Monday that ETH is “the best opportunity in the market”. The big #ETH report – Why I’m Insanely Bullish: This is a long-term analysis of Ethereum (ETH). We are looking at the coming months, not a short-term hype or quick profits.

He also pointed out a multi-year ascending trend channel, and a multi-year ascending triangle formation. Doctor Profit is targeting a rally to the $8,000-$10,000 region this cycle. Fellow crypto analyst Mister Crypto also pointed out this ascending triangle structure, saying that “it doesn’t get any better than this”. Textbook ascending triangle on Ethereum.

Ethereum is heavily undervalued. pic.twitter.com/4FWHgjrkUT — TraderPA (@Trader1PA) February 21, 2025 While volatility could remain elevated in the coming weeks, with further downside likely, Ethereum’s relative underperformance, relatively more “over-sold” market conditions and higher levels of FUD could mean that ETH has less downside risk versus other major cryptos. While there are no guarantees around when the next major market bounce will come, its arguably more favorable price suggests Ethereum has a lot more room to bounce when market sentiment does turn substantially for the better again. Fundamentals Align Towards Ethereum Outperformance The crypto bull market so far this cycle has been characterized by justifiable Bitcoin outperformance. But it has also been characterized, up until the last few weeks anyway, by the outperformance of the low/zero meme coin sector and its associated ecosystem (like the Solana chain), and the relative underperformance of utility cryptos (like Ethereum). That trend could be about to flip. The meme coin market has swooned hard in recent weeks. The Trump meme coin launch and LIBRA scandal has left crypto degenerates and retail exhausted and burnt. Trump coin bagged a lot of people. A President should have never done this. Period. Down 70% from peak. $TRUMP pic.twitter.com/3jDLT8QUye — Prof (@Prof_heist) February 3, 2025 A preference towards cryptos that actually have some underlying value thanks to their underlying utility, but still have massive upside potential, could soon set in. That could see retail traders starting to flood back to undervalued utility plays like Ethereum, Aave (AAVE) and Chainlink (LINK) in droves, rather than chasing the next high-risk, lower-reward meme play. Given that Solana is the main meme coin casino, SOL’s relative outperformance versus ETH could soon flip on its head. That’s especially the case as Ethereum extends its lead over another altcoin in terms of institutional adoption. Having secured spot US ETFs in mid-2024, Ethereum ETFs are soon likely to feature staking, making them substantially more attractive to institutional investors. Whilst ETF inflows have slowed in recent days, they are likely to remain mostly positive this year against the backdrop of the positive shift in the US regulatory environment. FUD may be high right now, but ETH remains the undisputed king of DeFi and, as BlackRock’s preferred altcoin, is likely to remain a major crypto market leader in the years ahead.

Among the many emerging projects, three have stood out—Qubetics ($TICS), EOS, and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). These top cryptos to invest in today offer innovative solutions that aim to solve problems ranging from scalability to decentralized applications. Each project brings its own unique vision, but with so many different blockchain technologies emerging, the real question is: which of these is the best fit for the future of digital finance? In this article, it’ll take a deep dive into Qubetics , EOS, and ICP to help you navigate this exciting landscape.Also explore how Qubetics is making waves with its presale, offering real-world solutions that previous projects have failed to address. So, whether you’re a seasoned investor or just getting started in the crypto space, going to break down why these projects are worth your attention and investment. Let’s explore why Qubetics, EOS, and ICP are making a big impact in today’s crypto market. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Real-World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace When talk about the top cryptos to invest in today, Qubetics ($TICS) undeniably grabs attention. It’s a project that’s not just about theoretical solutions; it’s focused on solving real-world problems. Qubetics is transforming the way that think about asset tokenization, specifically in terms of real-world assets. The Qubetics Real-World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace is making it easier for businesses, professionals, and individuals to digitize physical assets and tokenize them on the blockchain. What makes Qubetics stand out is its presale success. With more than 489 million tokens sold and over 21,200 holders, Qubetics is clearly gaining traction. The ongoing crypto presale has raised over $14 million, and there’s still a lot of buzz surrounding it. Currently, Qubetics tokens are priced at $0.0888 each, and with the presale nearing its final stages, there’s a real sense of excitement about its growth potential. Analysts are predicting that $TICS will see an 181.52% ROI by the end of the presale, with the price expected to soar to $1 or even $5 after the mainnet launch, offering investors massive returns. As more and more industries move toward blockchain integration, Qubetics offers businesses a seamless way to tokenize their assets and unlock liquidity. With the growing interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the increasing importance of asset-backed tokens, Qubetics positions itself as one of the top cryptos to invest in today—for anyone who believes in the future of decentralized finance and asset tokenization. EOS: Empowering the Decentralized Future Now let’s look at EOS, another key player in the crypto market that has earned its spot as one of the top cryptos to invest in today. EOS is a blockchain protocol that aims to offer high-speed transactions, scalability, and an efficient development environment for decentralized applications (dApps). EOS’s architecture was built to tackle some of the common problems seen in earlier blockchain systems, such as slow transaction speeds and high fees. Launched by block.one, EOS has a unique delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which gives it a distinct advantage over other platforms in terms of scalability. One of the key features that sets EOS apart from other platforms like Ethereum is its ability to process thousands of transactions per second, with minimal fees. This makes it an attractive option for developers looking to build dApps that require high throughput without breaking the bank. As an established blockchain platform, EOS has already seen considerable success in terms of adoption. It’s become a go-to choice for developers aiming to build dApps and smart contracts, and it’s positioning itself as a leader in blockchain scalability. The introduction of tools like EOSIO, a software that enables businesses to launch custom blockchains, further strengthens its market position. Investing in EOS means betting on a project with real-world utility and proven technology. As one of the top cryptos to invest in today, EOS continues to evolve, and its strong developer community is a testament to its growing influence in the blockchain space. Internet Computer Protocol (ICP): The Blockchain for the Web Next up is Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), a project that’s aiming to reimagine how to interact with the internet itself. ICP’s ambitious goal is to create an entirely decentralized internet where applications can run directly on the blockchain, removing the need for centralized servers and traditional cloud services. The project is led by the DFINITY Foundation and seeks to build a new kind of global cloud computing system. Internet Computer stands out by bringing smart contract execution to an entirely new level, allowing developers to build decentralized applications that are much more efficient and scalable than what’s possible on other blockchains. ICP integrates its own version of WebAssembly to provide faster execution times for decentralized apps, which makes it a more practical solution for everyday use cases. What’s particularly exciting about ICP is its potential to drive the next generation of decentralized internet infrastructure. Unlike traditional cloud services, where data is hosted by a few major corporations, ICP promises a more distributed model, making the internet more secure and resilient. This vision of a decentralized web has captured the imagination of many, and it’s no surprise that ICP is considered one of the top cryptos to invest in today. However, ICP is not without its challenges. Despite the excitement, the project has faced some volatility in its price since its launch. But for long-term investors who believe in the vision of a decentralized internet, ICP presents a fascinating opportunity for future growth. Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace: A Deeper Dive into Qubetics’ Vision Now look at Qubetics, EOS, and ICP as some of the top cryptos to invest in today, let’s focus on one of the most exciting aspects of Qubetics—its Real World Asset Tokenisation Marketplace. Tokenization has become a buzzword in the crypto space, and for good reason. It allows tangible assets—whether they’re real estate, art, or even commodities—to be digitized and represented as tokens on the blockchain. Qubetics is streamlining this process, making it easier for businesses and individuals to tokenize their assets in a secure and efficient way.

Per the South Korean media outlets Gukje News and Sky E Daily , officers at the Busan Main Customs Office said they had arrested a man and a woman, both of whom are aged “in their twenties.” The officials do not believe the duo know one another. However, they suspect that both were recruited by the same “drug lord” via a Telegram open channel. South Korean Customs Officers: Drug Lord Paid Smugglers in Crypto The customs office said it had charged the pair with violations of the Narcotics Control Act. A Korean-language Telegram open channel that South Korean customs officials think a ‘drug lord’ used to recruit smugglers as ‘part-time workers.’ (Source: Busan Main Customs Office) Officials think the Telegram channel operator “advertised” on the platform, calling the “opportunity” a “high-paying part-time job.” In total, officials said the duo smuggled over 7kg worth of narcotics into the country. They may also have been involved in distributing narcotics to drug users or local dealers in South Korea. In one instance, one of the suspected “drug smugglers” was been accused of “attempting to import at least 700g of highly concentrated liquid marijuana” into the nation from the United States via South Korea’s Incheon International Airport. The same individual also reportedly “received” 4.5kg of synthetic marijuana from Vietnam. The other individual also imported 1.2kg of synthetic marijuana from Vietnam and then helped “distribute it” to buyers in multiple cities including Suwon. Narcotics seized by Busan-based customs officers. (Source: Busan Main Customs Office) Telegram Open Channel Used as Recruitment Platform, Say Officials Officers added that the “drug lord mastermind” gave the duo “specific instructions” via Telegram chats. The mastermind reportedly paid the two individuals crypto via an “unregistered crypto exchange ” that made payments “difficult to trace.” Officers said they had worked on the case with the Gyeonggi Southern Provincial Police Agency and other law enforcement services. A Busan Customs official told reporters that drug dealers were preying on “young people who are familiar with” social media platforms and crypto.

That is how they turned small investments into massive fortunes with ETH and SOL. After riding the waves of growth with these giants, they’re now shifting their profits into this low cap crypto, RCO Finance , aiming to replicate the same success. They know the cycle: identify an undervalued gem before the masses, accumulate before the surge, and watch your profits flow in. With RCOF’s groundbreaking AI-driven trading and real-world use cases, they see another golden opportunity and they’re taking it. Let’s break down why. Solana and Ethereum Are Stalling While Investors Look Elsewhere Two of its biggest giants in the crypto market, Solana and Ethereum, are struggling to push higher. Solana , which saw an incredible rally over the last few months, recently dipped below its $175 support, sparking concerns of a deeper correction. Bulls attempted to reclaim lost ground, but resistance at $175 has turned into a barrier, keeping the price suppressed. If this level holds, SOL risks sliding further to $155 or even $133, as sellers continue to dominate. Ethereum isn't faring much better. It has been hovering below the key $2,850 level for days, unable to mount a convincing recovery. Although support at $2,500 has held firm, buyers are yet to regain control. If ETH cannot push above the downtrend line, the risk of dropping to $2,400 or even $2,300 remains. Whales who once fueled these coins’ parabolic rise are looking for fresh opportunities, and the lack of upward momentum is causing them to reallocate their funds elsewhere. This is why they’re pouring millions into RCO Finance before it blows up. RCO Finance Is a Game Changer Unlike Solana and Ethereum, which are mature assets with slower growth, RCOF is at the beginning of its journey; offering both real-world utility and the kind of explosive potential that made early ETH and SOL investors millionaires. RCO Finance is a revolutionary AI-powered investment ecosystem designed to remove guesswork from crypto trading. The centerpiece of this ecosystem is the Robo Advisor, a next-generation AI tool that scans the market in real-time to provide precise entry and exit points. Just recently, we saw the TRUMP token explode by 100x within hours. While most traders only jumped in late, the RCO Finance Robo Advisor would have detected its early momentum, analyzing price action, social media trends, and institutional movements, to alert users before the surge. But the AI doesn’t just identify winners; it also protects your portfolio from losses. If a coin in your portfolio suddenly shows signs of a breakdown, the Robo Advisor can trigger automated alerts or even execute trades, ensuring you don’t ride an asset all the way down. And it learns. Over time, its machine-learning algorithms improve, adapting to market conditions and refining predictions. But RCO Finance doesn’t stop at AI-powered trading. The project unlocks an unparalleled level of diversification, offering more than 120,000 investment options. Users can allocate capital across stocks, ETFs, bonds, and even tokenized real estate, all from a single KYC-free platform. Additionally, RCO Finance integrates debit cards, allowing you to spend your holdings instantly. No need to swap assets or go through lengthy conversion processes. You can use your crypto for everyday transactions. Presale Demand Surges as Whales Rush in Before the Next Price Hike Unlike most presales, RCO Finance has launched its Beta platform with over 10,000 active users. So you can see the ecosystem in action before committing. As the project transitions into the alpha phase, even more advanced features are set to roll out, further increasing its appeal. Currently in its fifth presale phase , the token is trading at $0.10, but that price won’t last much longer. Once the next phase kicks in, RCOF will jump to $0.13; a guaranteed 30% increase in just a matter of weeks. The project has already raised over $13 million, and as demand continues to surge, early investors are locking in gains before the next price hike. A $1,000 investment at today’s price of $0.10 would be worth $1,300 in the next stage. But the real potential lies in the long term. With major exchange listings on the horizon and widespread adoption ahead, some analysts believe RCOF could experience a 10,000x surge turning that $1,000 into over $100,000 this year. SolidProof’s audit confirms that the smart contract is fully secure, with no vulnerabilities, making it a safe and lucrative bet. The Smart Money Knows When to Move Ethereum and Solana have cemented themselves as pillars of the crypto world, but their early days of explosive growth are behind them. Ethereum went from pennies to thousands, Solana surged from under $1 to over $200, and those who got in early became millionaires. But today, these assets face slower gains. Their market caps are massive, and 10x returns are no longer a guarantee. RCO Finance , however, is just getting started. It offers the same kind of ground-floor opportunity that ETH and SOL had in their infancy. Solana and Ethereum whales aren’t waiting. They see what’s coming, and they’re positioning themselves before the crowd catches on. You too can get in today.

Ltd affiliate has admitted to processing over $1 trillion in transactions for US customers without a license. It will pay more than $504 million in penalties. On Monday, the exchange pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to a felony charge of operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. OKX, which supports spot trading for over 300 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, acknowledged its violations. U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla imposed the penalties, including fines and forfeitures, as part of an agreement between the exchange and federal prosecutors. OKX said in a Feb. 24 statement that the firm acknowledged that certain US customers had previously traded on the company’s global platform due to legacy compliance gaps. According to the exchange, the number of US clients involved amounted to a small percentage of the crypto exchange’s total customer base, and none of these customers remain on its platform. Source: OKX The Seychelles-based crypto exchange emphasized that no customer harm was alleged, and no charges were filed against any OKX employee. However, Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky criticized the OKX affiliate for “knowingly” violating Anti-Money Laundering laws, alleging it facilitated over $5 billion in suspicious transactions and criminal proceeds. ”Today’s guilty plea and penalties emphasize that there will be consequences for financial institutions that avail themselves of US markets but violate the law by allowing criminal activity to continue.” FBI Assistant Director in Charge James E. Dennehy noted that the OKX affiliate advised individuals to provide false information to circumvent requisite procedures. ”Blatant disregard for the rule of law will not be tolerated,” Dennehy added. The DOJ stated that the violations took place between 2018 and early 2024, despite OKX having an official policy since 2017 prohibiting U.S. users from trading on its platform.

Together, they launched four major Money Market Fund (MMF) tokens, tapping into the growing demand for more investment vehicles amongst institutional investors. Institutional Investors Demands Spurs XDC Network’s MMF Launch According to XDC Network’s announcement on Monday, these are its first tokenized funds. Notably, the MMFs are from abrdn, Fidelity International, BlackRock, and State Street and are now available on the XDC Network platform. XDC Network and Archax are keen to expand institutional investors’ access to Traditional Finance (TradFi) through blockchain technology . Keith O’Callaghan, the Head of Asset Management and Structuring at Archax, opines, “Providing digital representations of major MMFs opens up a potential new audience for these types of yield-bearing products that historically have been challenging for some to access.” RWA Tokenization and What XDC Network Brings to the Table XDC’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism will be utilized as part of the strategic partnership. This will facilitate transaction settlement and maintain near-zero gas fees. It is worth noting that this blockchain platform boasts of being the ideal protocol for Real-world Asset (RWA) tokenization, especially for institutions that wish to work with regulated entities like Archax. There is a general rise in the demand for tokenized MMFs amongst institutional investors. This is highly reflected in the RWA tokenization market’s financial value and current outlook. In the first week of February, the RWA tokenization market hit a record Total Value Locked (TVL) of $17.1 billion. Explicitly, this caused it to reach levels last seen in mid-January. Projection For RWA Tokenization Market In its paper “Real-world asset tokenization: A game changer for global trade,” Standard Chartered hinted that the tokenized RWA market could grow to $30.1 trillion by 2034. This forecast is not far-fetched, especially if the suggestion of Eli Cohen, general counsel at Centrifuge, comes into play. Cohen stated that US President Donald Trump’s administration will likely pull away from restrictive financial policies. In his opinion, such moves hold potential for RWA tokenization in 2025 , as it would further boost the sector’s growth.

On the flip side, analysts say the move could be a trigger for an accumulation spree amid prolonged bearish sentiments. Whale Moves $127 Million Worth Of Sol TO Unknown Wallet A Solana (SOL) whale has transferred 846,613 SOL to an unknown wallet in a single transaction amid falling asset prices. With Solana price hovering around the $150 mark, the transferred assets are valued at a hefty $127 million, spiking SOL’s daily trading volumes. While the sizable transfer appears to have gone under the radar, investors say the move could have far-reaching consequences for the beleaguered asset. A majority of traders are viewing the $127 million transfer as preliminary moves for a sell-off given prevailing sentiments. Only a handful of investors see the transfer as an accumulation play ahead of a market breakout. Solana Price Continues To Fall Onchain data indicates SOL has lost 11% in under 24 hours to settle at the $152 mark. Since the asset reached its peak of $294 at the start of the year, it has shed 49% of its value in less than a month. SOL’s market capitalization of $75.4 billion manages to keep it among the top cryptocurrencies by valuation. However, underlying metrics remain grim as it plays second fiddle to Ethereum in DEX weekly volumes. Solana network fees and memecoin activity have also taken a hit in recent weeks while the number of active Solana users fell to its lowest level in five months. SOL Expected To Slip Even Further Amid the unsavory metrics for SOL, chances for a break out remain unlikely for the asset. For starters, the Solana price descent has seen it fall below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, setting the stage for a bearish death cross pattern. MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are painting a depressing picture for SOL with indicators tipping prices to reach $109.

Monero (XMR) is poised for an up to 140% jump following a pivotal privacy ruling, underscoring its lead in the privacy coin niche. Post-mainnet, Celestia (TIA) is drawing eyes with its modular blockchain advancements, potentially driving its value up. Yet, the standout is BlockDAG (BDAG). Having amassed over $197.5 million, with its presale nearing completion and the compelling LISTING1000 bonus offering a 350% increase in coins, BlockDAG offers a prime buying opportunity. Beyond mere market buzz, BDAG’s solution to blockchain inefficiencies is robust, with predictions setting its value at $1 by 2025, offering early adopters substantial potential returns. Monero Set to Soar by 140% After Critical Privacy Decision Currently, Monero, the premier privacy-centric cryptocurrency, trades at about $220.75, marking a 1.87% rise since its last close. Over the previous day, XMR has recorded a trade volume of roughly $58 million, indicating robust market activity. Recent analysis indicates Monero’s value could climb by up to 140% following a beneficial outcome in the Tornado Cash case, likely boosting the appeal of privacy-focused coins. Moreover, Monero’s distinctive privacy capabilities continue to draw those desiring transaction anonymity, further solidifying its market stance. Celestia (TIA) Climbs Post-Mainnet Launch: Is More Growth Ahead? Celestia is trading around $3.20, showing a 2.78% increase over the last 24 hours. Its market capitalization is approximately $1.67 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $81.46 million. Key updates include Celestia’s successful Mainnet Beta rollout, dubbed Lemon Mint, initiating the launch of the inaugural modular data availability layer. Celestia has also partnered with Arbitrum Orbit, enhancing its modular data availability offerings. A consistent price above $3.50 could signal more bullish trends, whereas a fall below $3.00 might suggest bearish possibilities. BlockDAG’s LISTING1000: The Optimal Crypto Entry Point Blockchain networks often suffer from congestion, high fees, and inefficiencies, struggling to meet increasing demands. BlockDAG is engineered to alleviate these problems, and it has captured significant market attention. It’s a pioneering Layer 1 blockchain that combines blockchain and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technologies, ensuring exceptional speed, scalability, and efficiency. Unlike traditional blockchains that sequentially process transactions, BlockDAG enables parallel transaction validation, which eliminates bottlenecks and lowers fees. Since its presale, it has gathered over $197.5 million, selling 18.5 billion BDAG coins swiftly. Buyers from Batch 1 have already realized gains of 2,380%, with BDAG currently priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27. Projections for 2025 place BDAG’s value at $1, suggesting a remarkable 3,930% ROI. With the LISTING1000 bonus now in effect, this potential return is even more enticing. BlockDAG recently introduced a bonus code — LISTING1000, providing a 350% bonus on every BDAG purchase. For example, buying 10,000 BDAG at $0.0248 each would result in receiving 45,000 BDAG post-bonus. If BDAG hits $1 as projected, that $248 purchase could swell to $45,000. The LISTING1000 promotion is temporary and could end at any time, making this the prime moment to act before this chance vanishes. Key Insights! The crypto market favors those who move swiftly, and fleeting opportunities like BlockDAG’s LISTING1000 bonus are rare. While Monero’s privacy-driven revival and Celestia’s cutting-edge blockchain method are promising, BDAG is already establishing its superiority, amassing $197.5 million and delivering a 2,380% ROI to early backers. With the presale now in its 27th batch at $0.0248 and demand soaring, BDAG’s anticipated 3,930% return positions it as the best crypto to buy now . The LISTING1000 bonus is fleeting—missing out could mean losing out on potentially transformative returns. If you’re seeking the next significant crypto development, BlockDAG isn’t just an option—it’s the essential move before time runs out.

Whether aiming for quick profits or steady gains, choosing projects with real-world value is essential. Here’s a look at the best-performing cryptos to buy today, with Web3Bay leading the way for its decentralized e-commerce platform. Web3Bay (3BAY): Presale Gem with Unmatched Growth Potential Web3Bay is drawing attention with its decentralized marketplace that goes beyond price speculation. The platform removes middlemen, letting buyers and sellers trade directly through smart contract escrow services. Starting at $0.003 during its presale, the 3BAY coin has risen to $0.004562625 and is expected to launch at $0.1959—a 6430% ROI for those who joined early. With more than $1.5 million raised, interest in Web3Bay keeps growing. The project offers practical benefits, including a 5% discount for coin holders and planned integrations with PayPal and Google Pay, enhancing accessibility. With limited supply and a governance model, Web3Bay offers long-term value, making it one of the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Web3Bay stands out from projects driven by hype. Its decentralized marketplace delivers real services, allowing secure transactions using smart contracts that lower fraud risk and fees. As more people adopt Web3Bay’s system, demand for 3BAY coins grows since they are essential for transactions and governance. With major payment integrations and community-led governance, Web3Bay has strong long-term potential. Its ability to disrupt traditional e-commerce solidifies its position as one of the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Polkadot (DOT): Expanding Utility With JAM Chain Polkadot is known for its advanced blockchain network. The JAM Chain upgrade simplifies development by letting creators deploy smart contracts directly on Polkadot’s Layer 0, removing the need for parachains and improving efficiency. With greater scalability and new governance tools, JAM Chain is attracting more developers to Polkadot. Its interoperability feature allows smooth integration with other blockchains, boosting the adoption of interconnected apps. As blockchain scalability becomes essential, Polkadot’s solutions may increase DOT’s value, keeping it among the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Avalanche (AVAX): Growing Subnets and GameFi Momentum Avalanche is a top choice for scalability, with its subnet system gaining more users. GameFi and DeFi platforms prefer Avalanche due to its high speed and low costs. Avalanche’s subnets let developers build custom blockchains that still connect to the mainnet, supporting more projects. This flexibility is driving adoption and increasing AVAX demand. The GameFi sector is growing on Avalanche as developers seek fast, scalable networks, positioning AVAX as one of the best-performing cryptos to buy today. Avalanche’s affordable fees and fast transactions are key for developers, attracting many new projects. As more apps use Avalanche, AVAX demand rises, reinforcing its status among the best performing cryptos to buy today. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Building Utility Beyond Memes Shiba Inu is proving meme coins can offer real utility. Its Shibarium Layer-2 blockchain lowers transaction costs and boosts scalability, making SHIB more than just a speculative coin. With ongoing token burns, staking, and an expanding ecosystem of DeFi apps and NFTs, Shiba Inu continues to add value. Community support and regular upgrades make SHIB a crypto to watch. Its growth beyond memes, along with lower fees through Shibarium, solidifies SHIB as one of the best performing cryptos to buy today. Shiba Inu’s improving tokenomics and use cases give it long-term growth potential. With faster, cheaper transactions and added utility, SHIB stands among the best performing cryptos to buy today. Wrapping Up– Best Performing Cryptos to Buy Today! Many cryptos aim for growth, but only a few combine strong fundamentals with future potential. Web3Bay leads the pack with its decentralized e-commerce platform and fast-rising presale, standing out as one of the best performing cryptos to buy today.

This decline pushes BTC’s value even further from its January all-time high of over $109,000. Amid the bearish momentum, analysts are observing signs of renewed interest from retail investors—a critical market segment that could shape Bitcoin’s near-term direction. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Price Manipulated? Expert Exposes The Truth Bitcoin Retail Demand Slowly Recovers A new analysis by CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost has highlighted a promising shift in Bitcoin’s retail demand metrics. Specifically, the 30-day demand change has climbed back into the neutral zone around 0%, recovering from a highly negative -21% seen late last year. According to the insight shared by Darkfost, this is the first time since 2021 that retail demand has shown such a notable turnaround. Historically, periods of recovering retail demand have been linked to eventual price rebounds. For example, in July 2024, retail demand reached a similar low point before beginning to recover. Although it took roughly three months for Bitcoin’s price to respond positively, the subsequent upward movement demonstrated the impact of growing retail interest. Bitcoin retail Investor demand is brewing “Notably, past instances of recovering retail demand have often coincided with upward price movements in the short-term.” – By @Darkfost_Coc Full post ⤵️https://t.co/lvhC8JnvBD pic.twitter.com/YdBr6F78W7 — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) February 24, 2025 Darkfost noted that if this trend holds true this time, the current recovery in retail demand could lay the groundwork for future price gains—though such changes may take time to materialize. Network Activity and Investor Sentiment on the Decline Despite the positive signs from retail demand, overall network activity and investor sentiment tell a more cautious story. Darkfost in a separate post revealed a downward trend in the number of active Bitcoin wallets and transactions used for deposits and withdrawals. The accumulation of Bitcoin by spot ETFs has also slowed, with minor outflows suggesting a more hesitant investor base. Additionally, the number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) is decreasing at a pace reminiscent of previous market corrections. Although this alone does not confirm a market cycle peak, it does raise questions about the underlying strength of current market participants. Investor sentiment has also been weighed down by broader macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Darkfost highlighted that while initial bullish sentiment was buoyed by optimism surrounding Trump’s election and the possibility of favorable US crypto regulations, no substantial policy changes or legislative actions have yet emerged.

In fact, the artificial intelligence industry has entered a state of self-regulation, which is a sharp contrast with the short leash the Biden administration afforded the industry. The Trump administration appears to be trying a similar hands-off approach with the crypto industry. In the last week alone, the SEC dropped investigations into major players, Robinhood and Coinbase. A breath of fresh air from regulation by enforcement The U.S. SEC under the leadership of Gary Gensler regulated the crypto sector by enforcement actions, characterized by unpredictable crackdowns on the crypto projects that popped up on its radar. The return of the Trump administration in January 2025 signaled a paradigm shift, and the resolution of two high-profile cases against Robinhood Crypto and Coinbase are perfect exhibits of the new era for crypto. On February 21, 2025, the SEC’s Enforcement Division sent a letter to Robinhood Crypto (RHC) saying it concluded its investigation and will not move forward with any enforcement actions. This is a sequel to the May 2024 Wells Notice the watchdog issued to the crypto RHC, which many readily point out as an example of the agency’s overreach. Robinhood’s Chief Legal Officer, Dan Gallagher, stated that the investigation should have never been opened, arguing that the company has always operated within federal securities laws. “As we explained to the SEC, any case against Robinhood Crypto would have failed. We appreciate the formal closing of this investigation, and we are happy to see a return to the rule of law and commitment to fairness at the SEC,” Gallagher explained. Recent financial disclosures from Robinhood show that crypto trading has been a major driver of revenue. The company reported transaction-based revenue of approximately $672 million in the fourth quarter, with about $336 million coming from crypto transactions. This staggering 700% increase in crypto revenue alongside a 38% increase in Robinhood shares since the start of the year is one of many indicators of investors’ enthusiasm, primarily stoked by a perceived accommodating regulatory environment. Similarly, Coinbase, another industry heavyweight, experienced a reprieve from its marathon legal bout with the SEC. The SEC had previously approved Coinbase’s business model in 2021, however, in 2023, it accused the exchange of operating as an unregistered securities exchange. After almost two years in court, it announced that it was dropping its lawsuit against Coinbase on February 21, 2025, pending final approval from the commissioner. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase said that the SEC is finally righting a major wrong and that the case should have never been filed, maintaining that the company has always operated within legal boundaries. He suggested that the crackdown was politically motivated, saying what we are all thinking: “What changed over those two years was the political leadership at the SEC.” Of course, the resolutions of the cases against Robinhood and Coinbase relieve immediate legal concerns, they are also tangible evidence of the broader narrative change in crypto industry regulation. By choosing not to pursue the case further, the SEC under the Trump administration sent a message: innovation should not be killed by vague or overly aggressive regulatory practices. The market responded positively to the news of these developments, with Coinbase’s shares rising by 4.9% in premarket trading, and Robinhood seeing close to a 3.3% rise. The AI industry is a blueprint for self-regulation In July 2023, the White House coordinated an initiative with OpenAI, Google, and Meta, to institute standards that include watermarking AI-generated content to enhance transparency and safety in AI applications and improvements like investment in research on AI safety. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) introduced the global AI management standard, ISO/IEC 42001 In October 2024. Speaking about the standard developed in a process involving multiple stakeholders, Susan Taylor-Martin, Chief Executive of the British Standards Institution (BSI), said that “although the regulatory landscape is evolving” this standard provides a reliable framework for managing AI’s risks and opportunities, enabling innovation while maintaining governance. Without the guardrails limiting their European counterparts, American AI firms have become far and away the most valuable within the space—the brief DeepSeek disruption notwithstanding. Similarly, the crypto industry could benefit from self-regulation, by creating Self-Regulatory Organizations (SRO), which create and enforce guidelines for members. Self-regulation isn’t a new concept in crypto; a few countries have crypto SROs like Japan and South Korea. Japan has the Japan Virtual and Crypto Assets Exchange Association and Korea has South Korea’s Digital Asset Exchange Alliance. The Winklevoss Twins, founders of Gemini Exchange even proposed a Virtual Commodity Association in 2019. With the Trump administration’s more relaxed stance, the crypto industry can follow the AI industry’s blueprint and develop internal compliance measures and best practices that prioritize transparency, security, and consumer protection. Just as the AI industry collaborated with the government to shape policies that balance innovation with public interest, the crypto industry can also work with regulators to develop a logical framework that protects customers and protects digital asset innovation. For now, a regulatory vacuum The ease of regulatory clampdown on crypto organizations seems optimistic, however, it potentially leaves a vacuum in bad actor policing. A hands-off approach removes the shackles around companies’ ankles, a sudden and unchecked relaxing of regulatory oversight could expose investors and customers to risks. Case in point, just a few hours after news broke that the SEC had dropped Coinbase’s case, Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit confirmed that his exchange suffered a $1.4 billion hack. The Bybit incident, the largest heist in crypto history, is an immediate reminder of how self-regulation could go wrong. How many companies can be trusted to ensure adequate security measures across platforms? It’s worth mentioning that the Trump administration still plans to regulate crypto with albeit with sensible guidelines. Part of those efforts is the SEC’s acting chairman, Mark T. Uyeda, commissioning a task force to develop a clear and comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets US President, Donald Trump also issued the “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology” executive order on January 23, 2025. While we can already see the benefits of a relaxed regulatory environment in surging revenues and stock prices, the long-term viability of this model hinges on how well the industry can self-police and collaborate with the powers that be. Whatever happens, the next few months will be critical. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

The primary reason for this bearish outlook is the current market sentiment and the price action XLM has formed on the daily timeframe. Current Price Momentum XLM is currently trading near $0.297 and has experienced a price drop of over 12% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume jumped by 120%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. This jump in trading volume is potentially caused by the shift in market sentiment and XLM’s bearish outlook. XLM Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XLM appears bearish as it has broken through the crucial support level of $0.311, which the asset tested multiple times in recent days. Additionally, it closed a daily candle below this level, partially confirming that the price is poised to continue its decline. Source: Trading View With this breakdown and candle closing, there is a strong possibility that the asset could drop by 35% to reach the $0.189 mark in the coming days. Meanwhile, during the price drop, XLM may find temporary support at the $0.25 mark before reaching $0.189. Despite the breakdown of the crucial support, XLM’s price remains above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, which currently acts as a support level. If the asset breaches the 200 EMA and falls below it, there is a high possibility that XLM’s price will continue declining smoothly to that level in the coming days. $6.75 Million Worth Bets on Short Side With the notable price drop and recent breakdown, sentiment has completely shifted as intraday traders appear to be strongly backing short positions, according to on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from the XLM exchange liquidation map shows that bears, or traders betting on short positions, are currently dominating the asset. Meanwhile, with the recent price drop, traders betting on long positions seem to be exhausted. Source: Coinglass Based on recent data, $0.3321 is a level where traders betting on short positions are over-leveraged, holding $6.75 million worth of short positions. Meanwhile, $0.2821 is another level where traders betting on long positions are over-leveraged, holding $1.10 million worth of long positions. This liquidation data and over-leveraged positions indicate that bears are currently dominating the asset and could push XLM’s price toward the $0.189 level soon.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|XLM|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-25 00:31:36

The Inflation Protection Act, as it was called, was passed by the House Business and Labor Committee, but voted down by the full House on its second reading on Feb. 22. The bill would have established a special revenue account for the state’s Board of Investments to invest in precious metals and digital assets. It was introduced by Republican representative Curtis Schomer on Feb. 7 without Democratic support. The fund received a nonpartisan rejection The final vote was not along party lines, however, with 16 Republicans opposing it and one Democrat voting yea. The final vote was 41 for and 59 against. The bill was two pages long. It would have allowed transfers from the state’s general fund into the state’s Inflation Protection Act special fund by the legislature with a maximum of $50 million. The bill would have left revenue from the account in the account and given the state legislature control over the money in the account. Digital assets would have to have a market cap of $750 billion to be eligible for investment under the bill. In other words, the bill would authorize investment in Bitcoin, as it is the only qualifying digital asset. The debate over the bill focused on whether or not the fund was a worthy use of taxpayers’ money, with proponents saying it was a way to optimize state funds. Opponents called the bill speculative and risky. “I am not signing on to that stuff [cryptocurrency] and I can’t imagine a majority of your constituents want you to,” Republican Bill Mercer told the assembly. There is another law affecting cryptocurrency currently before the Montana legislature. An Act Revising Cryptocurrency Laws would prohibit the state from participating in testing a central bank digital currency and legalize the payment of taxes in cryptocurrency. It also protects mining and staking and exempts certain tokens from state security laws. Montana passed a law in 2023 to protect crypto mining in the state. The law prohibits discriminatory utility rates for crypto miners and prevents local governments from “exercising powers related to digital asset mining.” It also defines digital assets as personal property and prohibits taxation of cryptocurrency used as a method of payment. Federal digital asset fund may be created The so-called White House crypto czar, David Sacks, has confirmed in a press conference that a national Bitcoin reserve would be considered . Many states have pulled far ahead of the federal government. According to Bitcoinlaws.com, 18 states currently have cryptocurrency reserve fund proposals. Utah is the furthest ahead. Its Blockchain and Digital Innovation Amendments bill has made it through the House and is up for its second reading in the Senate. Montana joins North Dakota, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wyoming as states that have voted down cryptocurrency reserves. Montana’s four federal legislators are all strong supporters of crypto.

Over the past month, SHIB price has experienced a decline, reflecting concerns within the crypto market. Despite temporary rebounds, the token has struggled to maintain upward momentum, with key technical indicators suggesting persistent selling pressure. However, some analysts believe that an emerging bullish pattern could signal a major reversal, with projections suggesting a potential 400% surge if key support levels hold. Shiba Inu Price Drops, Analysts Spot Signs of a Possible Reversal According to a recent analysis, Shiba Inu price has seen a drop of 29% over the past month, reflecting the overall downtrend in the crypto market. Currently trading at $0.00001476, SHIB’s market capitalization stands at approximately $8.7 billion. Despite a slight rebound in the past 24 hours, the general market sentiment around SHIB remains bearish. Large transactions on the Shiba Inu network have decreased by over 80% in the last 12 weeks, indicating a lack of trust among major investors. On the other hand, analysts have pointed to the emergence of a potential Inverse Head & Shoulders pattern. This pattern could indicate a reversal in the meme coin price direction. If this pattern holds, SHIB could experience a 400% surge, bringing its value to around $0.000081. However, experts caution that such projections must be interpreted carefully, given the overall uncertainty in the meme coin market. More so, the latest burn activity has fueled optimism among traders anticipating a 300% meme coin rally . A 120.3% increase in the weekly burn rate suggests reduced supply, which could drive demand higher. If momentum sustains, Shiba Inu price may attempt a breakout. Technical Indicators Suggest Bearish Momentum Shiba Inu price drop coincides with an 80% decline in large whale transactions over the past 12 weeks. This sharp decrease in whale participation is a sign of declining confidence in Shiba Inu, which could further contribute to short-term market instability. As the crypto market faces broader bearish trends, SHIB’s ability to maintain its levels at critical support levels is crucial for its recovery. From a technical perspective, the Bollinger Bands have widened, signaling increased volatility in SHIB price action. The price is currently below the middle band, which typically suggests a bearish market momentum. Additionally, the MACD indicator remains in negative territory, with the MACD line positioned below the signal line, reinforcing the downward trend. The histogram also shows a continued decline in bullish momentum. These indicators point to the continued pressure on SHIB price, although the lower Bollinger Band could support buying recovery. Source: TradingView Meme Coin Must Defend $0.000011 Support The price of Shiba Inu faces a critical test as it approaches essential support levels. The primary support level at $0.000011 has become a key threshold for SHIB’s short-term future. A break below this support could lead to a further decline in the meme coin price. Conversely, if SHIB can hold above this support level, there may be an opportunity for the bulls to re-enter, and a reversal could be possible. With the broader market facing bearish pressure, SHIB’s ability to stabilize and defend key levels will determine whether the top meme coin can rebound or face further losses.

33767162,[object Object],1740445213,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Goes Cold: Whale Transactions & Active Addresses Plummet,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-goes-cold-whale-active-addresses-plummet/,"On-chain data shows the activity on the Dogecoin network has witnessed a notable drop recently. Here’s what this could mean for DOGE’s price. Dogecoin Activity-Related Metrics Have Plunged Recently As pointed out by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, some Dogecoin indicators related to network activity have returned to the lowest level in a few months. There are three metrics of relevance here: Whale Transaction Count, Transaction Volume, and Daily Active Addresses. The first of these, the Whale Transaction Count , keeps track of the total number of DOGE transfers carrying a value of more than $1 million. Transactions of this size generally belong to the whale entities, so the indicator can be assumed to represent the activity that the humongous traders of the market are participating in. The Transaction Volume , the second indicator, also mostly tells us about the activity of these investors, as it measures the total amount of Dogecoin that’s becoming involved in transfers on the network. The transfers of the small investors are naturally also included in this value, but since the whale transactions tend to be quite large, they drown them out from the data of the metric. The final indicator, the Daily Active Addresses , is the one to watch for to know the activity level of the regular investors. This metric measures the number of addresses taking part in at least one transaction on the network every day, whether as a sender or receiver. While whales are large in size, their numbers tend to be much lower than the retail investors, so the Daily Active Addresses, which favors address count, brings out the behavior of the small entities. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the trend in these Dogecoin on-chain indicators over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, all three of these indicators have dropped to relatively low levels recently, which means activity across the board has declined for Dogecoin. At present, the whales are making just 66 daily transactions and less than 60,000 unique addresses are becoming active on the blockchain. Martinez has noted that such a low level of activity hasn’t been seen since October of last year. Usually, Dogecoin requires high user participation, especially from the whales, in order to mount up any significant move. With the activity-related indicators sitting at lows, it’s possible that the meme coin’s price will continue to struggle in the coming days. The metrics may be to keep an eye on, however, as it often only takes a bit of news to get investors to rush back to the meme coin.

Van de Poppe tells his 776,000 followers on the social media platform X that the layer-1 protocol Near ( NEAR ) appears to be carving a cycle bottom. The analyst says that NEAR is likely in the final stages of its accumulation phase before kicking off a bull run. “This is a typical chart of a standard Altcoin bull run. At first, it runs up, then fully corrects before the real run occurs. Those runs start from the double-bottom retest –> that’s happening right now. Good accumulation area.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X A double-bottom pattern is a bullish reversal structure, indicating that an asset is cementing a price floor before launching an upside burst. At time of writing, NEAR is trading for $3.45. Looking at the payments altcoin XRP , the trader says the coin has already printed massive gains this cycle and that any upside potential will likely be limited. But he also says that it is within the realm of possibility for XRP to do the unexpected and spark another big rally. “In four weeks, the price rallied by 500% on a $30 billion asset. My best guess is that most of the upside is captured already and only the laggards are buying in at these levels. My second best guess is that we’ll consolidate before we continue to go up, which probably takes time. In that sense, you still want to be buying the dip if you’re interested in this one. The question is, where? Anywhere in the lower areas of the range, so let’s say $1.50-2.25. That’s a good region.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, XRP is worth $2.57. Turning to the smart contract platform Sui ( SUI ), Van de Poppe says he remains long-term bullish on the altcoin but warns that a drop to $1.50 is possible. He also believes that a 9x rally is in the cards for SUI if it manages to pull off a real bull cycle. “This has been one of the trending ones and I think it will continue to show strength… I think that, ultimately, the area at $2.50 is the key zone… Invalidation? Sub $1.50… If it loses the trend sub $1.50 –> your potential loss is 40-50%. If it really turns into a bull cycle, then your upside might be 300-800%.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, SUI is trading for $3.41. The last altcoin on the trader’s radar is the fellow layer-1 altcoin Sonic ( S ). According to Van de Poppe, Sonic is in the midst of a solid uptrend, and he believes it will go beyond $1. “The new, shiny, diamond in the markets. Strong upward trend and a lot of momentum on social media. Likely not going to stop in the coming period. From a trader’s perspective, I think that you’d be willing to buy the dips… S o then the region between $0.675-0.775 is the area to go for… Targets? New highs. Uptrend is clear.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X At time of writing, S is worth $0.86.
