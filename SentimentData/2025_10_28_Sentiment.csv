53713893,https://cryptonews.com/?p=443930,1761604200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53713893.jpeg,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of SOL, XRP, BNB by the End of October 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-deepseek-ai-predicts-the-price-of-sol-xrp-bnb-by-the-end-of-october-2025/,"DeepSeek AI—which has recently been proclaimed the most popular chatbot online for crypto trading after turning $10,000 into $22,500 in just nine days—now predicts that Solana, XRP, and BNB could set major new highs while this quarter is still young. The optimism comes despite the abrupt end of the “Uptober” rally after former President Donald Trump announced sweeping 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, rattling global markets and triggering one of the sharpest single-day crypto sell-offs in recent years. As the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting nears, investors have turned cautious, awaiting potential signals of monetary easing. Nonetheless, crypto dab hands read the pullback as a constructive reset that removes excess leverage and sets the stage for renewed momentum. Solana (SOL): DeepSeek Predicts a New All-Time High Solana ($SOL) continues to cement its role as a top-tier smart contract platform, boasting almost $110 billion in market capitalization and over $11.7 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its DeFi ecosystem. Source: DeepSeek AI Speculation is mounting that a U.S. spot Solana ETF could soon be approved, potentially drawing institutional inflows akin to those seen after Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches. With its exceptional transaction speeds, minimal fees, and growing relevance in stablecoin and real-world asset tokenization, Solana remains one of the most adoption-ready blockchains in the market. Following a January peak of $250 and a dip to $100 in April, SOL now trades around $202, with an RSI of 52 and climbing as it appears to be starting a new major rally after growing 2% in the last 24 hours. After breaking from a bullish flag formation, DeepSeek estimates Solana could climb as high as $1,200by month-end, possibly quarupling its previous record of $293.31. Given there’s only four days left of the month, it’s certainly a stretch target, but perhaps China’s most intelligent crypto trading chatbot knows something we dont? XRP ($XRP): DeepSeek Sees a Potential Run Toward $10 DeepSeek AI’s predictive models indicate Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could experience a strong rally, rising between $5 and $12 by year-end, potentially more than quadrupling its current value $2.69. Ripple’s landmark legal victory against the SEC earlier this year ended a multi-year battle, restoring investor confidence and propelling XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 in July. Over the past year, XRP has soared 415%, quadrupling both Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance during the period. Multiple bullish flag patterns forming in 2025 signal growing upward momentum. Upcoming catalysts, such as ETF approvals, new enterprise integrations, or global regulatory clarity, could send XRP beyond $5, with $12 serving as a stretch target in an aggressive bull scenario. Binance Coin (BNB): DeepSeek AI Predicts Expanding Market Dominance Initially launched as a utility token for Binance, Binance Coin ($BNB) has evolved into a core component of a vast ecosystem encompassing NFTs, decentralized applications, and payment platforms. BNB’s deflationary token burn program continues to reinforce long-term price stability by gradually reducing circulating supply. Beyond Binance’s ecosystem, BNB’s growing acceptance across retail, travel, and gaming sectors has strengthened its position among the world’s top five cryptocurrencies by market cap. Earlier this month, BNB broke out of a bullish pennant, hitting a record $1,369.99 before correcting 17% to $1,148. Should bullish sentiment resume, DeepSeek AI projects an advance toward $1,800, or even as high as $2,500, with key support between $580 and $1,000 if a sudden downturn occurs. Maxi Doge (MAXI): The Next-Gen Meme Coin With Degen Appeal Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , the newest sensation in the meme coin space, has kicked off its presale, already raising over $3.7 million from eager investors hoping to ride the next viral wave. Branded as Dogecoin’s pumped-up degen cousin, Maxi Doge embraces the humor, energy, and chaos of crypto’s degen culture, fostering a vibrant community through memes, contests, and social engagement. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI offers faster, cleaner, and more efficient transactions than Dogecoin’s legacy network. Of its 150.24 billion total supply, 25% is allocated to the “Maxi Fund” for marketing, partnerships, and ecosystem development. Staking is live, offering up to 80% APY, decreasing as more users join.

53713860,614540,1761604248,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53713860.jpeg,Ripple Prime: How The Company Just Set A Major Record That Boosts The XRP Ledger,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-prime-boosts-the-xrp-ledger/,"Ripple has announced the completion of its acquisition of Hidden Road, officially rebranding the global non-bank prime broker as Ripple Prime. This is a historic moment for the company, as it makes the payment firm the first crypto-based company to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime brokerage platform. The acquisition is also a major record that significantly expands Ripple’s institutional presence and further improves the XRP Ledger’s ecosystem through new integrations and utility for the company’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Ripple Prime Acquisition To Boost The XRP Ledger In a recent post on the social media platform X, Ripple announced that it has completed the acquisition of Hidden Road. The company’s acquisition of Hidden Road positions it as a pioneer in combining traditional finance with digital assets at scale. Hidden Road is one of the fastest-growing prime brokers in the world. The company offers a range of institutional services such as clearing, financing, and brokerage across foreign exchange, digital assets, derivatives, swaps, and fixed income. Now that the rebranding to Ripple Prime is complete, the new name embodies the payment firm’s strategy to build the foundation for institutional digital asset adoption. One of the most significant outcomes of Ripple Prime’s launch is its impact on the adoption and utility of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. According to the company’s announcement post on its website, RLUSD is now being actively used as collateral for several prime brokerage products. Derivatives clients have begun holding their balances in RLUSD, and this is expected to keep growing with institutional confidence. Ripple emphasized that RLUSD’s regulatory compliance and governance framework have made it one of the most trusted stablecoins in the market. Earlier this year, Bluechip rated RLUSD as the number one stablecoin for stability, governance, and asset backing, assigning it an A grade. The firm further reinforced its institutional credibility by appointing The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) as RLUSD’s primary reserve custodian. At the time of writing, RLUSD is the 12th biggest stablecoin in market cap, with a $902 million market cap, now inching towards the billion-dollar mark. The Firm’s Expanding Institutional Footprint And Future Outlook Ripple Prime is part of the company’s expansion strategy to capture a notable share of the global financial market. The company’s acquisition of Hidden Road makes it its fifth acquisition in two years. The acquisition trend started with the purchase of Metaco in May 2023, and then the purchase of Standard Custody in June 2024. Since then, the payment firm has continued to strengthen its institutional offerings with acquisitions like Rail in August 2025 and GTreasury just last week. Each acquisition has been strategically done in order to upgrade Ripple and XRP’s position as the leading provider of enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. “As we continue to build solutions towards enabling an Internet of Value – I’m reminding you all that XRP sits at the center of everything Ripple does.” CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a post on X.",Ripple|BNY Mellon|Brad Garlinghouse|Hidden Road|Metaco|ripple|ripple news|Ripple Prime|RLUSD|stablecoin|The Bank of New York Mellon|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-27 22:30:48
53714042,https://cryptonews.com/?p=443810,1761604500,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53714042.jpeg,"Bullish Crypto to Buy Today, October 27 – Pi, XRP, Virtuals",https://cryptonews.com/news/bullish-crypto-to-buy-today-october-27-pi-xrp-virtuals/,"Though initially bullish, early October’s so-called “Uptober” rally in the crypto market proved short-lived. Prices reversed sharply just days later after President Trump announced a sweeping 100% tariff on Chinese imports. Now all eyes are on the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting this week, where traders will be expecting proof that the US central bank is switching to more dovish economic policies. Despite the recent downturn, many analysts regard the dip as a natural phase of consolidation meant to flush out excess leverage and weaker hands before the mother of all bull runs. Here are three highly bullish altcoins that could go to the moon if and when the next crypto bull run takes off. Pi Network ($PI): Could the Bullish Mobile Crypto Mining Pioneer Hit $1 Before 2026? Pi Network reshaped the digital currency landscape by introducing a “tap-to-mine” system that allows users to earn tokens directly from their mobile devices, with no costly mining rigs or significant energy consumption required. Currently, Pi’s RSI sits a 55, which is above neutral and indicates some buying momentum that raised the price of the token 12% in the last 24 hours as it shows the first sign of a potentially rapid recovery. A falling wedge pattern identified earlier in 2025 signals the potential for a breakout before year-end. Should bullish sentiment return, Pi could climb to $1 by Christmas, quadrupling from its current price of around $0.24 and reaching its highest level in seven months. The Pi development team continues to push toward version 23, a milestone update expected to pave the way for the long-awaited mainnet debut. If this rollout catalyzes user adoption, the token could aim for $2.50 during the next market uptrend. With its user-friendly interface, dedicated Layer 1 blockchain, and rapidly expanding community, Pi Network stands poised to capture significant momentum as mainstream crypto usage accelerates globally. Ripple (XRP): Positioned to Lead Global Payments in 2025 Ripple’s native asset, XRP ($XRP) , powers a fast, low-cost payment system designed as a next-generation alternative to traditional networks such as SWIFT. With strategic partnerships including the UN Capital Development Fund and major U.S. financial institutions, XRP has solidified its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market value, currently exceeding $158 billion. The introduction of Ripple’s own stablecoin, RLUSD, underscores its intention to claim a sizable share of the expanding stablecoin industry. Over the past year, XRP has skyrocketed 415%, peaking at $3.65 in mid-July, a level unseen in seven years, while Bitcoin climbed just 70% over the same span. Currently, with a relative strength index (RSI) near 54 and having now converged back with it 30-day moving average, XRP has locked in recent gains ahead of the next breakout. Chart analysis reveals two bullish flag formations over the summer, implying further room for upside if ETF approvals land soon. Passage of comprehensive U.S. crypto legislation could further propel XRP toward the $5–$10 zone. Virtuals Protocol: Democratizing AI Ownership Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) is redefining what it means to own artificial intelligence. Built on blockchain, the project enables anyone to create and invest in autonomous AI agents, digital beings that can think, act, and earn across games, social platforms, and virtual worlds. Each AI agent has its own “Agent Token,” paired with VIRTUAL as the base asset. Holders of VIRTUAL can stake tokens to support new agents, share in their economic output, and take part in shaping the protocol’s governance. As agents generate revenue, a portion cycles back into buy-backs and burns of VIRTUAL, driving scarcity and long-term value for holders. In this ecosystem, your digital counterpart doesn’t just represent you; it can work , earn , and grow alongside you, presenting a rare opportunity to invest in the next frontier of AI-powered digital economies. In the last 24 hours, Virtuals rose 12%, keeping in step with Pi as the smart money rotates into smaller-cap altcoins ahead of the next gold rush. Virtuals is currently oversold with an RSI of 72, so some short-term depreciation may happen as traders collect recent profits, but this will consolidate Virtuals’ position. Snorter ($SNORT): A Meme Coin with Real Utility and a Promising Presale Snorter ($SNORT) is a new presale that has just wrapped up, netting over $5 million in the course of five months. It’s both a meme coin and a trading bot, in an offering that combines entertainment value with genuine trading utility.

Das Unternehmen mit Verbindung zu den Trump-Brüdern setzt auf langfristiges Wachstum. Trotz der unsicheren Märkte bleibt die Firma optimistisch, dass Bitcoin weiter steigen wird. Während andere Unternehmen vorsichtig bleiben, geht American Bitcoin aufs Ganze. Das von Eric und Donald Trump Jr. unterstützte Unternehmen hat seine Bestände erneut vergrößert. Damit zeigt die Firma deutlich, dass sie an eine starke Zukunft der bekanntesten Kryptowährung glaubt – auch wenn der Markt schwankt. American Bitcoin kauft wieder groß ein American Bitcoin (ABTC) hat 1.414 neue BTC erworben – im Wert von rund 163 Millionen US-Dollar. Das teilte das Unternehmen am Montag mit. Insgesamt besitzt ABTC nun 3.865 BT im Gesamtwert von etwa 446 Millionen Dollar. Diese wurden sowohl durch Käufe als auch durch eigene Mining-Aktivitäten gewonnen. JUST IN: Trump Family's American Bitcoin buys 1,414 Bitcoin worth $163 MILLION pic.twitter.com/1hQjpdvy3N — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) October 27, 2025 Die Firma hat ihren Sitz in Miami, Florida, und ist eine Tochter des kanadischen Unternehmens Hut 8 Corp. American Bitcoin ist erst seit April aktiv und wird von Eric Trump und Donald Trump Jr. unterstützt. Ihr Ziel: Bitcoin als langfristige Anlage etablieren und die eigene Position am Markt ausbauen. Bitcoin steigt wieder über 115.000 Dollar Der Preis lag am Montag bei über 115.500 Dollar – so hoch wie seit zwei Wochen nicht mehr. Damit scheint sich die Kryptowährung etwas vom jüngsten Rückgang erholt zu haben. Das bisherige Rekordhoch liegt bei rund 125.000 Dollar, das im August erreicht wurde. Analysten sehen die aktuelle Erholung auch als Folge besserer Handelsaussichten zwischen den USA und China. Viele Anleger hoffen nun, dass sich der Aufwärtstrend fortsetzt. Auch andere digitale Währungen legten leicht zu. Aktie von ABTC legt deutlich zu Die Aktie von ABTC stieg um über elf Prozent auf rund 6,20 Dollar. In den Wochen zuvor war sie unter sechs Dollar gefallen, weil der Kryptomarkt allgemein schwächelte. Nun scheint das Vertrauen der Anleger zurückzukehren. Viele Marktbeobachter loben die mutige Strategie des Unternehmens. Dennoch warnen einige, dass das Risiko groß bleibt, wenn der BTC-Kurs erneut sinkt. ABTC setzt dennoch weiter auf Expansion – und damit auf den Erfolg der eigenen Überzeugung. Vorteil durch eigenes Mining Laut Firmenchef Asher Genoot unterscheidet sich ABTC von anderen Investoren, weil das Unternehmen selbst BTC produziert. „Wenn wir unsere Coins direkt minen , können wir sie günstiger erzeugen als beim Einkauf am Markt“, erklärte Genoot. Dieser Ansatz hilft, die Kosten zu senken und langfristig unabhängiger zu werden. So will das Unternehmen auch in schwachen Marktphasen Gewinne sichern. Das macht ABTC zu einem der aktivsten Player im Bereich der Krypto-Treasuries. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Trump-Unternehmen setzen auf Wachstum American Bitcoin entstand, als die Trump-Brüder ihr eigenes Unternehmen mit Hut 8 fusionierten. Kurz danach folgte der Zusammenschluss mit Gryphon Digital Mining. Durch diese Fusion wurde ABTC zu einem wichtigen Akteur in der nordamerikanischen Mining-Branche. Mit dem Schritt will das Unternehmen nicht nur investieren, sondern auch die Zukunft der digitalen Finanzwelt mitgestalten. Der Name Trump sorgt dabei für zusätzliche Aufmerksamkeit – und für Diskussionen über die Rolle großer Investoren im Kryptomarkt. Krypto-Unternehmen im Aufwind Immer mehr Firmen weltweit legen ihre Ersparnisse in BTC an. Laut bitcointreasuries.net haben über 200 Unternehmen mittlerweile eigene BTC Reserven. Den Anfang machte Strategy (früher MicroStrategy) , das schon 2020 auf BTC setzte und heute rund 73 Milliarden Dollar in BTC hält. Strategy meldete am Montag ebenfalls einen neuen Kauf: 390 BTC für 43 Millionen Dollar. Diese Nachricht stärkte das Vertrauen vieler Anleger, dass der Kryptomarkt trotz Schwankungen weiter wächst. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Optimismus bei Anlegern bleibt groß Laut einer Umfrage von Myriad glauben mehr als 70 Prozent der Befragten, dass BTC bald wieder 120.000 Dollar erreichen wird. Nur wenige erwarten einen Rückgang auf 100.000 Dollar. Diese Zuversicht teilt auch American Bitcoin. Das Unternehmen setzt weiter auf Wachstum, günstige Mining-Kosten und eine starke Marktposition. Trotz Risiken zeigt ABTC, dass Mut und Strategie im Krypto-Markt belohnt werden können. BTC Hyper: Wenn BTC immer stärker unterstützt wird Die USA zeigen sich zunehmend offen gegenüber BTC – große Unternehmen, Banken und sogar Teile der Regierung erkennen seinen Wert und seine Stabilität an. Diese wachsende Unterstützung sorgt dafür, dass BTC weiter akkumuliert wird und sein Preis langfristig stabiler wird. Doch während immer mehr Menschen und Institutionen Bitcoin halten, bleibt seine Nutzung im Alltag noch eingeschränkt. Genau hier kommt Bitcoin Hyper ins Spiel: Es nutzt die Sicherheit des Bitcoin-Netzwerks und kombiniert sie mit der Geschwindigkeit von Solana. So wird Bitcoin endlich schneller, günstiger und alltagstauglicher. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! $HYPER: Vom Halten zum Nutzen von BTC $HYPER ist der Motor von Bitcoin Hyper – der Token, der Transaktionen ermöglicht, Staking antreibt und den Zugang zu modernen Anwendungen schafft. Wenn BTC durch politische und institutionelle Unterstützung weiter wächst, entsteht auch mehr Bedarf, ihn wirklich zu nutzen. Hyper bietet dafür die Lösung: Es macht BTC nicht nur sicher, sondern auch praktisch einsetzbar.

Release Date Set For Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons , Combs is scheduled to be released on May 8, 2028. Combs was found guilty on two prostitution-related charges back in July of this year following a highly publicized trial that saw the rapper-turned-mogul acquitted on racketeering and sex trafficking charges. Combs, who was sentenced to 50 months behind bars on October 3, has also been ordered to pay a $500,000 fine and serve five years of supervised release. SBF Continues Appeal In Landmark Fraud Case Just last week, lawyers for Combs filed a notice to appeal in New York federal court in a bid to overturn his conviction and reverse his over four-year prison sentence. Meanwhile, Combs’ former jailmate, Bankman-Fried, is also appealing his 2023 conviction on fraud charges tied to his time as CEO of doomed crypto exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for orchestrating the high-profile crypto scheme that saw FTX investors drained out of over $8 billion. Several former associates of the former “king of crypto” were also charged in connection with the digital asset scheme, including his former girlfriend-turned-Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Earlier this month, the disgraced FTX founder took to social media to allege that “Biden’s anti-crypto SEC/DOJ went after me” and had arrested him back in 2022 as a means of preventing his testimony on Capitol Hill the next day. gm @GETTRofficial https://t.co/GsY3bFkgKM — SBF (@SBF_FTX) October 15, 2025 “They had me arrested weeks before the crypto bill I was working on was set for a vote—and the night before I was set to testify before Congress,” a post on Bankman-Fried’s official Gettr account says. Bankman-Fried’s next hearing regarding his appeal is slated for November 3.

Bulls are attempting to build momentum for a potential impulse move higher, aiming to confirm a sustained bullish structure after the recent consolidation phase. Related Reading: Ethereum OG Drives $500M Liquidity Flow Into ConcreteXYZ & Stable Vaults – Details On-chain data continues to reveal a clear and repeating pattern tied to investor behavior and market cycles. Historically, when the percentage of Bitcoin supply in profit climbs above 95%, the market tends to enter an overheated phase, often leading to sharp corrections. These pullbacks serve as natural cooling periods, resetting sentiment and liquidity before the next major leg up. Interestingly, each correction cycle has shown consistent bottoming zones around the 75% threshold, where long-term holders reaccumulate and market confidence begins to rebuild. More specifically, data highlights profit supply lows of 73% in September 2024, 76% in April 2024, and a recent rebound from 81%, signaling a potential mid-cycle recovery phase. Bitcoin Supply in Profit Rises to 83.6% — Momentum Rebuilds Ahead of Key Threshold According to top analyst Darkfost, the percentage of Bitcoin supply in profit has started to climb again, currently standing at 83.6%. This steady rise indicates that a growing share of Bitcoin holders are once again sitting on unrealized gains — a trend that often reflects improving sentiment and renewed market confidence. Darkfost notes that this level can be interpreted as encouraging, suggesting that investors are willing to hold their BTC instead of realizing profits, anticipating further upside in the near term. Historically, such behavior has been characteristic of mid-cycle recovery phases, when fear starts to fade and accumulation resumes across both retail and institutional segments. This stage of the cycle is considered healthy for rebuilding momentum, as it allows the market to stabilize after large corrections. Holders who previously capitulated often reenter at this stage, while long-term participants strengthen their positions, creating a more resilient market structure. However, Darkfost cautions that once the supply in profit surpasses 95%, it typically signals overheated market conditions — a point where euphoria tends to replace rational conviction. In such phases, Bitcoin historically faces increased volatility and sharp corrections as overleveraged traders and short-term speculators take profits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase Signals Accumulation Before Next Growth Wave BTC Retests $115K Resistance: Bulls Regain Momentum Bitcoin (BTC) is showing renewed bullish momentum, trading around $115,443 and successfully reclaiming key short-term support levels after weeks of consolidation. The daily chart highlights a strong recovery structure, with BTC breaking above both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, signaling a shift in short-term market sentiment. The next critical test lies at $117,500, a historical resistance zone that previously rejected multiple attempts in September and early October. A clear breakout and daily close above this level would likely confirm an impulse continuation toward $120K–$125K, opening the door for a more sustained uptrend. Related Reading: Chris Larsen Cashes Out: $764M In XRP Profits Since 2018 Momentum indicators suggest strengthening buying pressure, while the recent bounce from the 200-day moving average near $107K underscores the market’s resilience. This level acted as a springboard for the current rally, aligning with the broader pattern of accumulation seen on-chain, where investor profitability is rising steadily. However, BTC remains within a range-bound structure, and rejection at $117.5K could trigger short-term consolidation back toward $111K–$112K. Overall, Bitcoin’s technical outlook appears constructive — if the bulls can sustain above $115K and confirm strength above $117.5K, the market could transition into a new bullish leg, supported by improving investor sentiment and on-chain health.

53715659,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87756,1761607821,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Reveals Why Focuses on XRP,https://timestabloid.com/expert-reveals-why-focuses-on-xrp/,"Dom Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, recently argued that XRP offers a stronger chance of achieving a 100x price increase than Bitcoin (BTC). His position emerged during a community discussion, where he addressed comments from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who had dismissed claims that leading crypto assets such as BTC and Ethereum (ETH) have become too expensive for retail investors. Bitcoin and Ethereum are Becoming Out of Reach Kwok countered Armstrong’s remarks by stating that Bitcoin and Ethereum have reached price levels that limit participation from everyday investors. With Bitcoin trading around $115,000 and Ethereum near $4,230 , he noted that the cost of owning a whole unit of either asset is now beyond what most people can afford. This, he said, is one reason EasyA’s focus has shifted toward alternative cryptocurrencies. He explained that new investors generally think in terms of the number of tokens they can own, not just the percentage increase they might earn. actually, $BTC and $ETH ARE too expensive for most people. this is why we focus on the alts so much @easya_app . https://t.co/23nizbLqf0 — Dom “Fish Head” | EasyA (@dom_kwok) October 19, 2025 For instance, someone entering the market with $1,000 would rather acquire a larger amount of a lower-priced coin than purchase a small fraction of Bitcoin. This preference, he noted, continues to drive the popularity of altcoins and broadens overall crypto participation. Kwok emphasized that affordability and psychological factors play major roles in investor behavior. While Bitcoin remains dominant, he argued that the growing demand for altcoins like XRP reflects a shift toward assets that appear more attainable. Why Kwok Believes XRP Offers Higher Upside Following Kwok’s comments, community member Daniel Harris supported the view that XRP provides greater return potential. Harris illustrated his point by comparing a hypothetical investment of $1,000, at a Bitcoin price of $120,000, that amount would buy only 0.0083 BTC, while at $2.60 per XRP, it would secure 416.67 XRP. He then questioned which investment would yield more value over the next three years, suggesting his confidence lay with XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Kwok agreed with Harris’s reasoning, arguing that XRP’s lower price gives it more room for growth relative to Bitcoin. However, community analyst Eri challenged the argument, clarifying that returns depend strictly on percentage gains, not the number of tokens owned. She noted that if both assets rise by 100%, investors earn the same percentage return, regardless of price per coin. Kwok maintained his position, contending that while the mathematical principle is correct, probability favors XRP. He reasoned that a 100x increase from $2.40 to $240 is statistically more feasible than Bitcoin climbing from $100,000 to $10 million. Historical Data Supports Volatility Difference Market data appears to support Kwok’s point regarding growth potential. During the November 2024 market rally, Bitcoin gained 59%, rising from $68,770 to $109,356 by January 2025. In the same period, XRP surged 580%, climbing from $0.50 to $3.40. Similarly, between late June and July 2025, Bitcoin advanced 22%, while XRP appreciated 83%, again showing its tendency to outperform during bullish cycles. Analysts attribute this to XRP’s smaller market capitalization, which allows sharper price movements both upward and downward. While experts disagree on the factors determining long-term performance, Kwok’s perspective underscores a broader sentiment among investors seeking high-growth assets. His argument highlights how accessibility, price psychology, and market structure influence investment choices. Though XRP’s higher volatility presents greater risk, it also provides a stronger short-term potential for outsized returns compared to Bitcoin’s more stable but slower-moving growth trajectory.

The fraudulent scheme uses fake emails that appear to come from Booking.com, inviting recipients to a non-existent “Exclusive Crypto Travel Summit” in Dubai. A Deceptive Invitation The phishing attempt, which Ong shared on social media, presented itself as a legitimate conference announcement, with the fake email claiming that Booking.com and Coinbase have formed a strategic partnership to launch a crypto travel service. It listed an impressive roster of keynote speakers, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, for an event supposedly happening in November 2025. A key red flag is that the RSVP deadline for this future event was set in the past, for September 30, 2025, which pointed to recycled or hastily constructed scam content. Ong advised anyone receiving such an email to delete it immediately and urged Booking.com to escalate the issue to its security team. The official Booking.com account later acknowledged the issue in a reply to Ong’s post, saying, “We regret to hear that you are receiving fake emails,” and requested details via direct message to investigate. A Persistent Threat in Crypto This incident is not an isolated one but part of a wider pattern of scams targeting crypto users. In September, Binance issued two separate warnings about different types of fraud. In the first one, the exchange alerted the public about fake “listing agents” who were purportedly promising projects a spot on the platform for a fee. A few days later, company CEO Richard Teng detailed a phone scam where impersonators posed as customer support agents. He said that the fake helpers then guided users through changing their account’s API settings, a process that allowed the scammer to steal funds. The community’s reaction to Ong’s warning was one of recognition and frustration. One social media user, SkylineETH, commented on the increasing complexity of these schemes, writing, “appreciate the warning, these scams keep leveling up.” Another user, Kevin Lee, expressed a common concern, questioning if there was a better way to handle email security to avoid even clicking ‘unsubscribe’ links in suspicious newsletters. This sentiment was echoed by Ong, who noted that the adversarial nature of the crypto world requires people to carefully check every email they receive.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.6004 Market cap $636.84M Trading volume (24-hour) $14.86M Circulating supply 1.063B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3505 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.6225 24-hour low $0.5986 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.30% (High) 50-day SMA $0.6785 14-Day RSI 44.26 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Green days 17/30 (57%) 200-day SMA $0.7058 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: The daily trend weakens after rejection at $0.62, showing a fragile bullish structure. A short-term selloff under $0.60 could retest $0.585–$0.56 before bouncing attempts. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart Tezos (XTZ) currently trades at $0.5986 on October 27, dropping 2.52% for the day after testing the $0.62 resistance level. The daily Bollinger Bands show tightening volatility, with the middle band near $0.6084 acting as a pivot. A price rejection from that zone suggests that selling pressure may intensify if bulls fail to hold above $0.60. The lower Bollinger band near $0.5446 remains a potential downside magnet should momentum weaken further. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD line has turned slightly positive at 0.0048, yet the histogram shows waning bullish momentum, hinting at a possible crossover reversal if weakness persists. Meanwhile, the RSI at 40.42 leans toward bearish territory, implying sellers have regained short-term control after a mild recovery phase. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart reinforces near-term selling signals. After briefly holding above $0.61, Tezos has dipped to $0.599, falling under the Alligator’s green and red lines, which now tilt downward, a sign of weakening trend strength. The blue Alligator line, currently around $0.6056, now acts as immediate resistance. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI at 56.53 recently pulled back from overbought levels, signaling a cooling of bullish momentum before potential re-entry zones. The PVT also trends lower, reflecting declining volume participation during this dip. If the price sustains below $0.60, short-term sellers may push it to $0.59 or $0.585. A recovery above $0.606 could re-energize bulls, opening a path toward $0.62–$0.625. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6546 SELL SMA 5 $0.6434 SELL SMA 10 $0.6352 SELL SMA 21 $0.6354 SELL SMA 50 $0.6785 SELL SMA 100 $0.7502 SELL SMA 200 $0.7058 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6370 SELL EMA 5 $0.6622 SELL EMA 10 $0.7014 SELL EMA 21 $0.7448 SELL EMA 50 $0.7582 SELL EMA 100 $0.7328 SELL EMA 200 $0.7415 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos remains at a delicate turning point, as a sustained trade above $0.60 could invite a short-term rebound toward $0.62, but losing this level exposes it to another leg down toward $0.56. Momentum traders should wait for clearer confirmation before entering, as the market leans slightly bearish but is still structurally consolidative. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

PBC Governor Pan Gongsheng said at a conference in Beijing that the central bank will maintain its crackdown on domestic crypto activity and speculation, emphasizing that “the PBOC’s policies and measures to curb cryptocurrency-related risks remain effective.” According to Pan, the Central Bank will collaborate with law enforcement to crack down on relevant activities within mainland China, safeguarding economic and financial stability. China’s plan to closely monitor digital asset developments abroad comes as its Ministry of State Security warns that a foreign company is using crypto as a front to collect sensitive biometric information, including iris scans. It believes their activity will compromise individual privacy and national security. While the ministry did not name the specific firm, the described tactics are similar to those employed by World, the blockchain project founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman. PBOC flags stablecoins as a global financial risk In its press release, China’s Ministry of State Security affirmed that biometric recognition technology has rapidly evolved, pushed by its effectiveness and convenience. Still, it cautioned that with the rise of biometric scans , there is the added risk of data leaks and misuse. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:c5864a60-a266-4164-8716-f54a5ef5582c-30"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-18"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> The ministry went on to cite examples of alleged data breaches, starting with a foreign company whose fingerprint-based payment platform was directly connected to its internal data system, allowing hackers to repeatedly gain access and steal personal information. Stablecoins remain a major concern, according to the governor, who notes that they “can’t meet the basic requirements like customer identification and anti-money laundering.” Stablecoins are “increasing the vulnerability of the global financial system and undermining the monetary sovereignty of some less developed economies,” Pan said, according to the report. Pan added that the PBOC will continue to closely monitor and evaluate the progress of stablecoin developments in overseas markets. Asia pushes ahead with regulated stablecoin launches The Governor’s comments came on a day when Japanese startup JPYC released what it described as the world’s first yen-backed stablecoin, also named JPYC, with plans to issue up to $66 billion-worth (10 trillion yen) of tokens over three years. South Korea’s first fully regulated won-backed stablecoin was released last month when digital custodian BDACS and Woori Bank jointly launched KRW1 on the Avalanche blockchain. Bank of China’s Hong Kong shares surged earlier last month on reports that it plans to apply for a license for its own stablecoin, and Standard Chartered has said it is exploring the idea. Many users are bullish about the growth trajectory of stablecoins, with a significant majority believing that the market cap for stablecoins will exceed $360 billion by February. Chinese firms are expanding into offshore stablecoin ventures, with Jack Ma’s Ant Group applying for the “ANTCOIN” trademark in Hong Kong, which covers stablecoins, token issuance, and transfers. Meanwhile, JD.com plans to seek overseas licenses to use stablecoins for cross-border B2B payments before extending this to consumers. “The role of Chinese regulators in shaping global stablecoin regulation has developed against a backdrop of relative financial stability and the absence of sanction-related pressure,” Ray Youssef, CEO of crypto app NoOnes, said He added that China’s stance on stablecoins, which in many ways mirrors that of the EU, could eventually shift in the opposite direction—similar to Russia, where the government now uses stablecoins and corporations for international payments and foreign trade. He also noted that the restrictions being introduced will not weaken Hong Kong’s position as a global financial hub, as Beijing has always relied on the city as a free economic sandbox that ultimately benefits the mainland Chinese economy.

This announcement was released on Monday, October 27, following reports that the US-based startup has signed deals for significant infrastructure initiatives that require a vast power supply. The situation illustrates a growing trend among large data centers in the US, which are vowing to push the boundaries of what is possible in the country, despite the electric grid already facing significant challenges. The development follows Apple’s announcement that it has begun shipping advanced AI servers from its factory in Houston, Texas. According to the Cupertino-based tech company, these servers play a crucial role in their pledge to invest approximately $600 billion in the US, particularly in advanced manufacturing, suppliers, and other initiatives. After this move, US President Donald Trump praised Apple’s decision and urged the tech giant, along with other technology firms, to expand their production operations in the United States. Sources close to the situation mentioned that the tech giant first shared its intention to create US servers in February this year before making significant moves later. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:3a662ddd-653c-4276-8dcd-24b26a4294a0-32"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-6"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> Commenting on the company’s success in the AI landscape, Apple Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan said the new servers will power Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute services, set to be unveiled soon. He added that Apple is already using its own silicon technology to run these Apple Intelligence servers . OpenAI emphasized that electrons are the new oil In a blog post dated Tuesday, October 28, OpenAI expressed that electricity is not just a utility but a crucial resource important for creating AI infrastructure that will enable them to maintain their leadership in the key technology. According to the tech company, leadership in the AI sector is as significant as electricity itself. Regarding its earlier recommendation on a solution to boost the US’s position in the AI race, OpenAI submitted an 11-page document to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, urging the country to focus on constructing approximately 100 gigawatts of new energy capacity each year. A gigawatt is a unit of power that measures large collections of AI chips. According to an analysis from a reliable source based on data from the Energy Information Administration, 10 gigawatts is approximately equivalent to the annual power consumption of around 8 million homes in the US. In terms of power capacity, OpenAI noted that China added approximately 429 gigawatts of new power capacity, while the US added only 51 gigawatts. Concerning this gap, the tech company cautioned that this difference is establishing an electron gap, putting the US at risk of lagging behind. “Electrons are the new oil,” OpenAI emphasized. Meanwhile, Nvidia made public its plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the AI lab aims to develop multibillion-dollar data centers while utilizing Nvidia’s AI processors. To achieve this, OpenAI stated that the company intends to construct and use Nvidia systems that require around 10 gigawatts of power. Nvidia’s CEO highlights the strong relationship between OpenAI and Nvidia During an interview in San Jose, California, Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang told a reporter that 10 gigawatts equals approximately 4 million to 5 million graphics processing units (GPUs). According to Huang, this figure is the total number they plan to ship this year. Notably, it is twice as much as last year. “This is a huge project,” Huang said during the interview, which was conducted alongside Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, and company president Greg Brockman. A source with knowledge of the situation hinted that Nvidia’s initial investment of $10 billion will be made after the first gigawatt is completed. Additionally, the investments will be made at current valuations; however, the source requested anonymity as the details are private. Following the report, shares of Nvidia surged by almost 4%, adding roughly $170 billion to the company’s market value and bringing its valuation close to $4.5 trillion. The partnership is massive in size, said Huang, offering further evidence of the strong relationship between OpenAI and Nvidia, two of the key players that have driven the recent growth in AI. Interestingly, the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs increased when OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, and OpenAI continues to rely on the company’s GPUs to develop its software and ship it to users.

With macroeconomics and digital assets increasingly intertwined, staying ahead of these signals is more important than ever. A Tipping Point at the Fed The spotlight falls on the Fed’s meeting scheduled for October 28–29, 2025, where a 25-basis-point cut to the federal funds rate (targeting 3.75-4 %) is widely expected. This move follows a September reduction and reflects the central bank’s efforts to address a softening labour market alongside stubborn inflation. But with the US government shutdown hampering access to key jobs data, the Fed is steering into unfamiliar terrain, with analysts warning of a “dirty windshield” on policy decisions. Why this matters: A rate cut typically injects liquidity, weakens the U.S. dollar, and creates favorable conditions for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. But it also raises the specter of economic weakness, if the Fed cuts into a downturn, markets may quickly pivot from enthusiasm to caution. Economic Indicators & Market Sentiment Behind the scenes, other data points are shaping the narrative. September’s Consumer Price Index rose by 0.3 % month-on-month and 3.0 % year-on-year, slightly below expectations, suggesting inflation is moderating. Meanwhile, reports highlight that important employment figures may be delayed due to the shutdown, increasing uncertainty in policy-making. For equity and crypto markets, this convergence means investors must calibrate risk appetite carefully. The Fed’s decision coincides with major tech earnings and global policy developments, adding complexity to what otherwise might be a straightforward easing narrative. Crypto’s Next Move: Bullish Tailwinds or Volatility Trap? The crypto market is keenly attuned to these macro shifts. Major digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have already ticked higher ahead of the expected cut. Historical patterns suggest that easing cycles tend to favour crypto, but the stage today is more nuanced. According to an analysis, this isn’t a dramatic panic-cut environment like 2020, but rather a “blended scenario” where crypto may benefit over time if economic conditions remain stable. Key pointers for crypto investors: A weaker dollar after rate cuts supports crypto inflows. The Fed’s tone, and whether it signals further easing or caution, can trigger sharp swings. If the labour market or inflation surprises on the upside, risk assets may face correction rather than rally.

53716494,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87758,1761609623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analyst: Cardano (ADA) Will Retire A Lot of Us, Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-cardano-ada-will-retire-a-lot-of-us-heres-why/,"Crypto commentator OxManuel has expressed strong optimism about Cardano’s long-term potential, suggesting that the project’s growth trajectory could bring substantial financial returns to current investors. In a recent post on X, he described Cardano as a network with the potential to transform the financial status of its holders, arguing that it is only a matter of time before this value is fully realized. Assessing Cardano’s Current Position As of the latest data, Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.6741 , giving it a market capitalization of approximately $24.17 billion. The asset ranks as the 10th-largest cryptocurrency and has recorded very modest gains, about 0.88% within the last week. According to OxManuel, this valuation leaves significant room for upward movement. He reasoned that a 10-fold price increase from current levels would place Cardano’s total valuation around $240 billion, with each ADA token worth about $6.80. This would represent a new all-time high for the network and, in his view, generate enough financial upside for many long-term holders to achieve financial independence. Cardano $ADA will retire a lot of us It's only a matter of wen $ADA at 10x is only 240 billion market cap pic.twitter.com/QN5pBBhGib — OxManuel (@ManuelOnchain) October 26, 2025 Evaluating the 10x Projection To assess whether such an increase could truly allow holders to retire, it is useful to consider the potential returns on investment. The financial threshold for retirement varies widely based on lifestyle and location. For individuals in regions with lower living costs, a retirement fund of around $500,000 could be sufficient, while residents of more expensive cities may require $1 million or more. Under OxManuel’s projection, an investor would need to hold roughly $50,000 worth of ADA at the current price to reach a $500,000 portfolio if the token appreciates tenfold to $6.80. That amount translates to approximately 73,500 ADA today. Conversely, accumulating $1 million under the same conditions would require an initial stake of $100,000, or about 147,000 ADA at current prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This calculation demonstrates that a 10x rally could provide substantial returns for those with meaningful holdings, though it would not guarantee financial independence for every investor. Market Opinions on ADA’s Potential Cardano has attracted a wide range of price projections from market analysts and influencers. In September 2025, well-known analyst Ali Martinez predicted that ADA could climb to around $6.25 before the end of the ongoing market cycle, describing the current trend as the early stage of a potentially strong rally. Other figures in the Cardano community have made even bolder forecasts. Longtime Cardano advocate Dan Gambardello has suggested that ADA could reach $7.50 during this cycle, outlining an exit strategy for holders looking to take profit during such a move. In a separate analysis, he also argued that a $10 price target remains realistic, citing the project’s historical growth patterns and expanding ecosystem as key factors. While the exact timeline and extent of Cardano’s future growth remain uncertain, the increasing confidence among analysts reflects a strong belief in the project’s fundamentals. Should ADA approach the projections set by OxManuel and others, many early investors could see significant wealth gains. Nonetheless, as with all crypto assets, the outcome will depend on broader market conditions, adoption trends, and Cardano’s continued ability to deliver on its development roadmap.

A surge in demand tied to privacy, cross-chain integration and bold market calls are pushing ZEC into the spotlight. Related Reading: $10K Is Coming: Arthur Hayes’ Zcash ‘Vibe Check’ Sparks 30% Moonshot Rally Driven by Privacy Narrative and Major Price Call Zcash’s recent rally is nothing short of dramatic. In the past month, ZEC’s price surged roughly 380 % and smashed through its May 2021 closing level of around US$319. This breakout has drawn fresh attention to the coin’s core value proposition, transaction anonymity, at a time when regulatory scrutiny and surveillance concerns are rising globally. Adding fuel to the fire, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, publicly predicted that ZEC could ultimately reach US$10,000. Markets responded swiftly; within 24 hours of Hayes’s “vibe check” post on X, ZEC jumped over 30 %. The privacy-coin resurgence appears well underway. Meanwhile, technical analysts argue the rise is more than hype. ZEC’s chart now showcases breakout patterns, rising volumes, and a shift in smart-money positioning. However, caution remains. Many analysts note that although the price is reflecting a strong narrative, actual usage of shielded transactions remains limited. ZEC's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ZECUSD on Tradingview Zcash (ZEC) Ecosystem Integrations Add Strength Behind the price action lies concrete ecosystem development. Zcash integration into other chains, such as its wrapped version on Solana, is reviving interest, while new solutions seek to restore ZEC’s full privacy features across cross-chain networks. For example, the project Encifher is enabling encrypted versions of ZEC (eZEC) using fully homomorphic encryption on Solana so that users can transact privately while still engaging with DeFi. Other catalysts include the anticipated halving event, which is due to cut miner rewards in mid-November, tightening supply. Added to that, institutional frameworks such as the debut of a trust vehicle for ZEC are reportedly expanding exposure. All told, these structural shifts support the narrative.

But what if there was a simple tool to gauge this collective emotion? Enter the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a powerful indicator designed to provide a snapshot of market sentiment. Currently, this crucial index stands at a neutral 50, a slight dip from yesterday but maintaining its balanced stance. This neutral position invites us to look closer at what drives market emotions and how investors can navigate these fluctuating sentiments. What Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Really Mean? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits at 50, it signifies a state of equilibrium. The scale ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). A neutral reading means neither fear nor greed dominates the market. It suggests that investors are not making decisions based on overwhelming emotion. Instead, they might be waiting for clearer signals, or perhaps the market is consolidating before its next significant move. This neutrality can be a period of indecision, where both bulls and bears are holding their breath. For savvy investors, it presents a unique opportunity to reassess strategies without the pressure of extreme market conditions. Decoding the Metrics: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The reliability of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes from its comprehensive methodology. It doesn’t rely on a single factor but aggregates data from various sources to paint a holistic picture of market sentiment. According to Alternative.me , the platform that calculates this index, six key factors contribute to its score: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them to average values. High volatility often signals fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volume and market momentum. High buying volume in a rising market indicates greed, while selling volume in a falling market points to fear. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans social media for crypto-related keywords and analyzes their sentiment. A surge in mentions, especially with positive sentiment, can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls. (Note: This component is currently paused.) Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing dominance of Bitcoin often suggests fear, as investors might be fleeing altcoins into the perceived safety of BTC. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” might indicate fear, while “buy Bitcoin” suggests greed. Each of these components provides a valuable piece of the puzzle, contributing to the overall Crypto Fear & Greed Index score and offering a nuanced view of market psychology. Navigating the Neutral Zone: Actionable Insights for Investors When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is neutral, it’s not a signal to panic or to rush into impulsive decisions. Instead, it’s a moment for thoughtful consideration and strategic planning. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Vigilant, Not Complacent: A neutral reading doesn’t mean the market is stagnant. It’s a temporary balance that can shift quickly. Continue to monitor market news and price movements. Deep Dive into Research: Use this calmer period to research promising projects, understand their fundamentals, and assess their long-term potential without the distraction of extreme price swings. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re looking to invest, a neutral market is an excellent time to implement or continue a DCA strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount regularly, reducing the impact of volatility. Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: A neutral market provides a stress-free environment to review your asset allocation. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This balanced state of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a valuable window for investors to refine their approach and make data-driven decisions. Beyond the Numbers: The Broader Impact of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The significance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index extends beyond individual investment decisions. It serves as a powerful barometer for the collective psychological state of the cryptocurrency market. Understanding this broader context can provide a competitive edge. Historically, extreme readings on the index have often preceded significant market reversals. For instance, periods of extreme fear (low scores) have frequently been followed by market bounces, while extreme greed (high scores) often signals an impending correction. While not a definitive predictor, it highlights the importance of contrarian thinking. The main benefit of this index is its ability to help investors avoid emotionally driven decisions. By presenting a quantifiable measure of sentiment, it encourages a more rational and disciplined approach to the volatile crypto landscape. However, it’s crucial to remember that the index is just one tool among many; it should always be used in conjunction with fundamental and technical analysis. Summary: Embrace the Equilibrium The Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at a neutral 50 is a compelling reminder that the crypto market is a dynamic interplay of data and human emotion. While not as dramatic as extreme fear or greed, this balanced state offers a unique opportunity for investors to practice discipline, conduct thorough research, and refine their strategies. Embracing this equilibrium allows for a more measured and informed approach, helping you navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies with greater confidence. Use this period to your advantage, making decisions based on analysis rather than sentiment alone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), providing an aggregated view of how investors are feeling. How is a neutral reading (like 50) interpreted?

Their growing adoption, however, has also highlighted a pressing need for robust oversight. South Korea is now taking a decisive and significant step in this direction. A new bill is set to be proposed in the National Assembly, aiming to bring these digital assets under the country’s existing Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. This move represents a crucial development in South Korean stablecoin regulation , signaling a proactive approach to managing the evolving digital financial landscape. Understanding the Proposed South Korean Stablecoin Regulation What exactly does this proposed legislation entail? According to Yonhap News, Lawmaker Park Seong-hoon of the People Power Party is sponsoring an amendment to the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act . The core of this proposal is to legally define stablecoins as a ‘means of payment’ under Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the act. This simple yet profound reclassification places stablecoins on the same regulatory footing as traditional government notes, banknotes, and coins. Legal Definition: Stablecoins will be recognized as a legitimate ‘means of payment’. Regulatory Parity: They will be subject to the same rules as conventional currencies. Legislative Effort: This move seeks to close existing legal gaps. This specific proposal for South Korean stablecoin regulation aims to ensure that these digital assets operate within a clear, established legal framework, preventing their use in unregulated or illicit financial activities. Why is South Korean Stablecoin Regulation Becoming a Priority? The impetus behind this urgent stablecoin regulation is multifaceted, primarily driven by concerns over financial integrity and consumer protection. As stablecoins gain traction, so too does the potential for their misuse. The proposed bill is a direct response to the risks associated with an unregulated stablecoin market, which could be exploited for various illicit activities. Preventing Illicit Activities: A primary goal is to combat money laundering. Combating Tax Evasion: The regulation will make it harder to evade taxes using stablecoins. Closing Legal Loopholes: It addresses ambiguities in current financial laws regarding digital assets. Ensuring Financial Stability: By integrating stablecoins into existing frameworks, the government aims to mitigate systemic risks. This proactive approach by South Korea reflects a growing global trend among regulators to bring digital assets under stricter supervision, ensuring transparency and accountability in the rapidly evolving digital economy. The absence of clear rules has long been a challenge, and this move provides much-needed clarity. What Are the Broader Implications of This Stablecoin Regulation ? The new South Korean stablecoin regulation could have significant implications for both the domestic and international cryptocurrency markets. For users, it offers a heightened sense of security and legitimacy, knowing that their stablecoin transactions are backed by legal oversight. For stablecoin issuers and related businesses, however, it will introduce new compliance burdens and operational requirements. Potential Benefits: Increased Trust: Greater confidence among users and institutions in stablecoin transactions. Enhanced Consumer Protection: A clearer legal recourse in case of disputes or fraud. Market Integration: Smoother integration of stablecoins into the broader financial system. Potential Challenges: Compliance Costs: Stablecoin issuers may face significant costs to meet new regulatory standards. Innovation Impact: Some fear that stringent rules could stifle innovation in the crypto space. Market Dynamics: The regulatory shift could alter market liquidity and the competitive landscape for stablecoins in South Korea. Balancing these benefits and challenges will be crucial as the legislation moves forward, shaping the future of digital finance in the region. How Does South Korean Stablecoin Regulation Compare Globally? South Korea is not alone in its pursuit of comprehensive stablecoin regulation. Jurisdictions worldwide are grappling with how to effectively oversee these digital assets. The European Union, for instance, has introduced its landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which includes extensive provisions for stablecoins. In the United States, discussions are ongoing, with various proposals aimed at defining and regulating stablecoin issuers. This global push highlights a shared understanding among policymakers that stablecoins, due to their potential for widespread use and their peg to traditional currencies, require a distinct regulatory framework. South Korea’s move to categorize them under existing foreign exchange laws demonstrates one approach to this challenge, leveraging established legal mechanisms rather than creating entirely new ones. This proactive approach to South Korean stablecoin regulation positions the nation among the leaders in establishing a secure and regulated digital asset environment. A Future of Regulated Digital Finance The proposed bill for South Korean stablecoin regulation marks a pivotal moment for the country’s digital asset landscape. By formally recognizing stablecoins as a ‘means of payment’ and bringing them under the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act, South Korea is taking a decisive step towards enhancing financial stability and integrity. While it promises greater security and transparency, it also presents challenges for innovation and market participants. The outcome of this legislative effort will undoubtedly set a precedent for how other nations might approach the complex task of integrating digital currencies into traditional financial systems, paving the way for a more secure and regulated future for digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act ? The Foreign Exchange Transactions Act is a South Korean law that regulates transactions involving foreign currencies and international payments. Its purpose is to maintain stability in the foreign exchange market and ensure sound international financial transactions. Who is Lawmaker Park Seong-hoon ? Lawmaker Park Seong-hoon is a member of South Korea’s National Assembly, representing the People Power Party . He is the legislator proposing the bill to regulate stablecoins under the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. What are stablecoins ? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset or a basket of assets, such as fiat currency (e.g., the US dollar) or gold. They aim to combine the benefits of cryptocurrencies, like fast transactions and global reach, with the stability of traditional assets. Why are stablecoins being regulated differently from other cryptocurrencies? Stablecoins are often regulated differently due to their direct peg to traditional assets, which gives them a more direct link to the conventional financial system. This link means they can pose different risks, particularly concerning financial stability, consumer protection, and their potential use in illicit activities, necessitating specific regulatory frameworks. What are the main concerns driving this stablecoin regulation ? The primary concerns driving this regulation include preventing money laundering, combating tax evasion, and closing legal loopholes that could allow stablecoins to be used for illicit financial activities. Regulators also aim to protect consumers and maintain overall financial stability. Did you find this article insightful?

Imagine a world where your workweek is significantly shorter, allowing more time for personal pursuits, learning, or even delving deeper into the crypto market. This isn’t a distant fantasy, but a near-term reality, according to none other than Zoom CEO Eric Yuan. His bold predictions at the Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 conference offer a glimpse into an astonishing future where artificial intelligence doesn’t just assist us, but fundamentally redefines how we work, leading to a much-anticipated workweek reduction . Eric Yuan’s Vision: The Dawn of a Shorter Workweek At the prestigious Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 conference, Eric Yuan , the visionary founder and CEO of Zoom, captivated attendees with his optimistic outlook on the future of work. His core message was clear: AI technology , particularly through the advent of intelligent assistants, is poised to usher in an era where a five-day workweek becomes a relic of the past. Yuan’s conviction stems from Zoom’s deep embrace of AI, a commitment he underscored by stating his investment focus as simply, “AI, AI, and AI.” This isn’t just a buzzword for Yuan; it’s the subject of multi-hour strategy meetings, reflecting a profound belief in AI’s potential to revolutionize how we interact, collaborate, and ultimately, achieve a better work-life balance. His insights provide a compelling narrative for how technology, often seen as demanding more of our time, can actually give it back. Zoom AI Features: Digital Twins and Enhanced Collaboration Central to Yuan’s vision are innovative Zoom AI features , most notably the “digital twin.” This groundbreaking concept allows an AI avatar to speak on your behalf, representing you in meetings and discussions. Yuan himself demonstrated this technology’s prowess by deploying his AI avatar during an earnings call with investors, showcasing its ability to push the “boundaries of communication.” Imagine a scenario where you can delegate routine, informational, or even initial negotiation calls to your AI counterpart, freeing up your precious time for strategic thinking or more complex tasks. Beyond digital twins, Yuan believes AI can significantly enhance Zoom’s broader suite of solutions, from online whiteboards to collaborative documents.

Consider email management: an AI assistant could check your messages, prioritize them, identify urgent communications, and even draft preliminary responses, ensuring you only focus on what truly requires your human touch. Another fascinating scenario involves complex business negotiations. Instead of executives spending hours in protracted Zoom calls, their digital twins could first “work together on the plan,” as Yuan suggested, refining proposals and identifying common ground before human intervention. This proactive AI assistance promises to cut down on unproductive time, allowing professionals to engage in more meaningful, high-level decision-making. The goal is to offload the repetitive and time-consuming, amplifying human capacity for creativity and strategic thought. Unlocking the Future of Work with AI Productivity The culmination of these advancements is a paradigm shift in the future of work , directly leading to increased AI productivity . Yuan’s ultimate prediction is that by automating and assisting with numerous tasks, “we do not need to work five days a week anymore, right?… Five years out, three days or four days [a week]. That’s a goal.” This vision suggests a future where efficiency gains from AI aren’t just about doing more, but about doing less of what’s mundane, and more of what truly matters. The implications are vast, promising a healthier work-life balance, reduced burnout, and potentially a surge in innovation as individuals gain more time for personal development and creative pursuits. This isn’t merely about technological advancement; it’s about reimagining human potential in an AI-augmented world. Benefits and Implications of an AI-Driven Workweek: Increased Efficiency: AI automates repetitive tasks, allowing humans to focus on strategic, creative work. Improved Work-Life Balance: A shorter workweek frees up time for personal interests, family, and well-being. Focus on High-Value Tasks: Professionals can dedicate more energy to problem-solving and innovation. Enhanced Collaboration: AI tools facilitate smoother, more intelligent team interactions.

Tillis, who serves on the Senate Banking Committee, warned that partisan trench warfare and the 2026 midterm elections could render digital asset reforms dead on arrival if action isn’t taken soon. The Senator’s remarks come at a crucial moment for the US crypto industry, which has long been yearning for clear federal guidance. Meanwhile, there is growing bipartisan momentum behind regulating digital assets. However, lawmakers remain split on issues such as market structure, stablecoin regulation, and the division of jurisdiction among financial regulatory agencies. If Congress is going to do anything with crypto, “it has to be done by the first part of January, February, or you’re done” in the session that runs through January 2026, Tillis said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this week. It is a cautionary message that senators’ colleagues and increasingly restless industry officials are sounding with rising urgency, worried that election-year politics will drown out policy discussions. Campaigning for the 2026 elections will be in full swing next year, and there is little appetite among lawmakers to undertake intricate policy changes in how government funds are allocated. A high-profile bill potentially snared in the question is the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21)—which was a re-envisioned market structure bill passed by the House in July. It seeks to clarify where oversight authority rests with the SEC and CFTC, which in turn is expected to bring regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency exchanges and token issuers. The bill has not yet been approved by the Senate Banking Committee, of which Tillis is a member. And suppose they don’t act quickly, in a news cycle that’s crowded with other political priorities and an increasingly polarized Congress. In that case, there may be little to no legislative movement. Crypto progress gets bogged down in partisan gridlock and leadership delays Tillis’s comments were made as the US Congress was dealing with the fallout from a partial government shutdown that began on October 1, over how to fund healthcare and social spending programs. The shutdown has already led to several pieces of legislation being put on hold, among them the proposed CLARITY Act that would clarify digital asset classifications and effectively expand investor protections. House Speaker Mike Johnson has similarly held floor sessions hostage, raising questions about a Legislature that’s been hesitant to move in the best of times anyway. When the Senate is in session, numerous committees have a backlog of work, including upcoming nominations and bills that address crypto and fintech. The Responsible Financial Innovation Act — a Senate-approved crypto framework bill authored by Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of the Senate Banking Committee, and a proponent for digital asset regulation for years — could be signed into law by 2026, according to Lummis. Yet in recent days, comments from Tillis suggest that the politics of this issue are shifting, and they are moving towards caution and delay . Meanwhile, change is afoot at key financial agencies, adding another layer of unpredictability. Crypto industry lobbies for Congress to act as foreign competitors race ahead Crypto industry leaders have been urging Congress not to delay much longer, cautioning that the US risks being overtaken by other jurisdictions with more streamlined regulations — such as the European Union, which has recently introduced its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regime. The United States is leading, but there’s a risk it could fall behind in financial technology, according to Kristin Smith , the former chief executive of the Blockchain Association, who told Ms. Waters. Some of America’s largest corporations, such as Coinbase and Ripple, have intensified their lobbying efforts in Washington to forge a bipartisan deal. They claim companies are being driven offshore, and a lack of policy clarity is smothering investment in blockchain research. More broadly, consumer advocates and some Democratic lawmakers are concerned about investor protections and financial stability in the aftermath of high-profile collapses, such as FTX and Celsius. This has led to demands that we introduce a set of new rules and prudential standards before we enact any new legislation.

This critical assessment primarily stems from the company’s substantial Strategy Bitcoin reliance , coupled with weak capitalization relative to its risk profile and fragile U.S. dollar liquidity. This decision serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and risks associated with heavy exposure to digital assets for corporate balance sheets. What Does a B- Junk Rating Mean for Strategy Bitcoin Reliance ? When S&P Global Ratings , one of the world’s leading credit rating agencies, assigns a ‘junk’ status, it signals a heightened risk of default. A B- rating is several notches below investment grade, indicating that the company is currently vulnerable and depends on favorable business, financial, and economic conditions to meet its financial commitments. For a company like Strategy, this rating can significantly impact its ability to borrow money, attract investors, and even conduct everyday business operations. Increased Borrowing Costs: Lenders will demand higher interest rates due to the perceived risk. Investor Hesitation: Many institutional investors are restricted from holding ‘junk-rated’ assets. Reputational Damage: A junk rating can signal financial instability to partners and customers. Why is High Bitcoin Exposure a Risky Strategy? S&P’s primary concern revolves around Strategy’s heavy Bitcoin reliance. While Bitcoin has shown immense growth potential, its price volatility is a double-edged sword for corporate treasuries. Companies holding significant amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets are directly exposed to these wild price swings, which can dramatically impact their financial health and liquidity. The agency specifically pointed to: Market Volatility: Sudden drops in Bitcoin’s value can erode a company’s asset base quickly. Liquidity Concerns: Converting large amounts of Bitcoin to U.S. dollars can be challenging during market downturns, affecting a company’s ability to meet short-term obligations. Capitalization Weakness: The fluctuating value of crypto assets can make a company’s capitalization appear strong one day and weak the next, complicating risk assessment. This isn’t an isolated incident; S&P Global Ratings previously assigned the same B- rating to Sky Protocol, indicating a growing trend of scrutiny for companies with substantial crypto holdings. Navigating the Challenges: What Can Companies Learn? The situation with Strategy highlights a critical challenge for businesses embracing cryptocurrencies: balancing innovation with financial prudence. While integrating digital assets can offer strategic advantages, it demands robust risk management frameworks. Companies need to consider the potential impact of crypto volatility on their core operations, cash flow, and overall financial stability. For businesses with significant Strategy Bitcoin reliance , proactive measures are essential: Diversification: Spreading investments across various asset classes to mitigate concentration risk. Hedging Strategies: Employing financial instruments to protect against adverse price movements. Stronger Liquidity Buffers: Maintaining ample U.S. dollar reserves to withstand market shocks. Transparent Reporting: Clearly communicating crypto holdings and risk management practices to investors. This rating serves as a wake-up call, emphasizing that while crypto assets present exciting opportunities, they also introduce unique financial risks that traditional rating agencies are now rigorously evaluating. A Critical Look at Corporate Crypto Exposure The decision by S&P Global Ratings to assign a junk rating based on Strategy Bitcoin reliance underscores a broader re-evaluation of corporate exposure to volatile assets. As more companies explore adding cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets, the standards for financial stability and risk management will undoubtedly evolve. Investors and stakeholders will increasingly demand clarity on how these digital assets are managed and what safeguards are in place to protect against market downturns. This isn’t about dismissing Bitcoin’s potential, but rather about ensuring that corporate financial health remains paramount. In conclusion, S&P’s B- junk rating for Strategy is a potent signal to the market. It highlights the significant financial risks associated with heavy Strategy Bitcoin reliance and calls for a more cautious and diversified approach to digital asset integration within corporate finance. Companies must prioritize robust risk management and maintain strong traditional liquidity to navigate the inherently volatile crypto landscape successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a junk credit rating? A junk credit rating, also known as a speculative-grade or high-yield rating, is assigned by credit rating agencies like S&P Global Ratings to bonds or companies considered to have a higher risk of default than investment-grade entities. It indicates a greater chance the issuer will fail to meet its financial obligations. You can learn more about this on Wikipedia’s page on Junk Bonds . Why is Bitcoin reliance considered risky by S&P? S&P considers heavy Bitcoin reliance risky primarily due to the cryptocurrency’s extreme price volatility. Significant fluctuations can rapidly diminish a company’s asset value, impact its capitalization, and create liquidity challenges, making it harder to convert crypto assets to traditional currency to cover operational costs. This concept is often linked to Bitcoin volatility . Who is Strategy? In this context, Strategy refers to a specific company that received the B- credit rating from S&P Global Ratings. While specific details of the company ‘Strategy’ are not provided in the original report, the rating applies to its overall financial health and operational approach, particularly concerning its asset holdings. For general information on how companies manage their finances, you can refer to Corporate finance on Wikipedia . What are the implications for Strategy after receiving a junk rating? A junk rating can have several negative implications for Strategy, including higher borrowing costs, difficulty in accessing capital markets, potential restrictions for institutional investors, and reputational damage. It signals increased financial risk to all stakeholders and could hinder growth and operational flexibility. This relates directly to concepts of Credit risk . Are other companies facing similar ratings due to crypto holdings? Yes, the report mentions that S&P Global Ratings previously assigned the same B- rating to Sky Protocol, indicating a broader trend. As the cryptocurrency market matures, rating agencies are increasingly scrutinizing the financial stability of companies with significant exposure to volatile digital assets. This suggests that more companies with similar asset strategies might face similar evaluations. For background on general crypto protocols, see Cryptocurrency protocol on Wikipedia .

For many investors, understanding these shifts is crucial, especially when it comes to the battle between Bitcoin and altcoins. Recently, the Altcoin Season Index delivered a significant update, falling three points to a reading of 27. This drop isn’t just a number; it’s a crucial signal about the current state of the market and whether altcoins are truly in their prime. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Reveal? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap , is a vital tool for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. It helps us gauge whether the market currently favors altcoins or Bitcoin. But how exactly does it work? It analyzes the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins and wrapped coins are excluded from this analysis to provide a clearer picture. The performance of these top altcoins is then compared directly against Bitcoin’s performance. An “altcoin season” is officially declared when a substantial 75% of these top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over the 90-day period. A reading closer to 100 on the index signifies stronger overall altcoin performance, indicating a vibrant altcoin season. Conversely, a lower number, like the current 27, suggests Bitcoin is largely dominating. Why Did the Altcoin Season Index Drop to 27? The recent three-point decrease, bringing the Altcoin Season Index down to 27, indicates a noticeable shift in market sentiment. This suggests that fewer than 75% of the top altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Several factors can contribute to such a decline: Bitcoin Dominance: Often, when Bitcoin experiences a strong rally, capital tends to flow from altcoins into Bitcoin, increasing its market dominance. Risk Aversion: During periods of market uncertainty or consolidation, investors might flock to Bitcoin, perceived as a safer asset compared to the often more volatile altcoins. Lack of Catalyst: A general absence of significant positive news or fundamental developments for a broad range of altcoins can lead to underperformance. Profit-Taking: After periods of altcoin gains, investors might take profits, rotating funds back into Bitcoin or stablecoins. Navigating the Market: Altcoins vs. Bitcoin Dominance Understanding the current standing of the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for making informed investment decisions. A low index score, such as 27, implies that Bitcoin is currently the stronger performer. This doesn’t necessarily mean altcoins are ‘bad’ investments, but it does highlight a prevailing market trend. For Altcoin Holders: This period might call for caution. It could be a time for re-evaluating portfolios, perhaps consolidating positions or looking for altcoins with strong fundamentals that might weather a Bitcoin-dominated phase better. For Bitcoin Enthusiasts: A lower index often correlates with periods where Bitcoin is leading the charge, potentially offering more stable gains or acting as a store of value. Diversification: Regardless of the index, maintaining a diversified portfolio is always a sound strategy. This balances exposure across different assets and reduces overall risk. What Challenges and Opportunities Does This Altcoin Season Index Present? A dip in the Altcoin Season Index brings both challenges and potential opportunities for savvy investors. While the immediate outlook might seem bearish for altcoins, it’s essential to look beyond the surface. Challenges: Increased volatility for many altcoins; slower growth or even declines for less established projects; difficulty in identifying outperformers when the broader market favors Bitcoin. Opportunities: Potential accumulation phase for strong altcoins at lower prices; focus on projects with upcoming mainnet launches, significant partnerships, or technological breakthroughs; opportunities for short-term trading strategies if volatility is high; re-evaluating fundamental analysis for long-term altcoin investments. The recent fall of the Altcoin Season Index to 27 serves as a clear indicator of the shifting tides in the cryptocurrency market. It signals a period where Bitcoin is asserting its dominance, prompting investors to reassess their strategies. While the allure of altcoin seasons is strong, understanding the underlying market dynamics, as reflected by this index, is paramount. Whether you’re an altcoin enthusiast or a Bitcoin maximalist, staying informed and adapting your approach is key to navigating the exciting, yet unpredictable, world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric that gauges whether market conditions currently favor altcoins or Bitcoin by comparing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin. 2. How is an “altcoin season” officially declared? An altcoin season is declared when 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. 3. What does a low Altcoin Season Index score, like 27, indicate? A low score, such as 27, indicates that Bitcoin is currently dominating the market, with fewer than 75% of altcoins outperforming it over the last 90 days. 4. Does a low Altcoin Season Index mean I should sell all my altcoins? Not necessarily. While it suggests Bitcoin dominance, it can also present opportunities for accumulating strong altcoins at lower prices. It’s crucial to reassess your portfolio and investment strategy. 5.

And in this case, most of that liquidity does not seem to be going into blue-chip token initiatives but rather into soon-to-launch presale initiatives that offer more appealing short-term growth prospects. The one name that keeps recurring among investors as well as analysts is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rapidly expanding DeFi project already in Phase 6 of presale with over 75% of the tokens sold off already at $0.035 per token. Mutuum Finance is being talked about as the top crypto to buy as capital is moving away from legacy networks such as Cardano to next-gen DeFi platforms. Cardano (ADA) Experiences Whale Dump and Short-Term Weakness Cardano (ADA) faces severe selling pressure following on-chain data showing that whales dumped more than 350 million ADA, a development which has accelerated concerns of short-term weakness in the market. The selling comes with a noticeable drop in on-chain activity, giving further significant push to bear pressure already existing surrounding ADA. Though not all signals are negative, the pending Hydra 1.0 upgrade may ameliorate some of this downside risk by greatly enhancing scalability and network speed, hence reviving investor confidence. However, as ADA is weathering this stormy period, all but the most stalwart investors already are turning to alternatives elsewhere for more near-term upside, most notably towards newer opportunities such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is rapidly making waves as funds move into high-growth projects highlighted in crypto news. Presale Momentum Increases Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a favorite among investors in its phased presale model. Phase 6 is racing along rapidly with tokens at $0.035, a cheap entry point before a 14.3% increase to $0.04 in Phase 7. The initial iteration of the Mutuum Finance protocol for lending and borrowing is preparing to launch in Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025 with liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. The initial borrow and lend support will be ETH and USDT. Customers can stake in peer-to-contract pools to earn passive income or enter peer-to-peer markets for custom terms. mtTokens accrue interest and can be exchanged for the amount, offering a two-layered system to ensure maximum flexibility and security. These risk-protection systems are highly sought by investors, making MUTM the top crypto to buy for short-term ROI. Millions of tokens have already been sold, which demonstrates strong investor interest and early liquidity formation before mainnet launch. This trend demonstrates further holders in favor of the Mutuum Finance roadmap and vision for providing real utility rather than hype speculation. Mutuum Finance Buybacks to Power Price It is among the most powerful long-term growth drivers by the buy and distribution mechanism on the platform, whereby fees are utilized to purchase MUTM tokens in the open market. Token redistribution is sent to mtToken stakers, which creates effective buying pressure as network demand rises. The token demand function is made a function of true utilization of the platform by the cycle model, stimulating holding and activity. These employ functions follow the path of top-performing projects like Chainlink (LINK) in 2021 and 2020, where there was unprecedented appreciation driven by demand for oracles in DeFi. MUTM prioritizes long-term sustainable returns over hype that may fuel even better performance with the maturing of the crypto news space. ADA Whales Sell 350M Tokens, Capital Flows Into MUTM Cardano (ADA) under selling pressure as whales dump 350M ADA, unleashing short-term bearishness. Most of this capital is headed to up-and-coming DeFi prospects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), confirming it as a top crypto to buy. Phase 6 presale MUTM is at $0.035, more than 80% sold, and $18M+ raised. Its two-pronged lending model and Q4 2025 Sepolia testnet deployment offer adaptability and passive return. Possessing 4 billion tokens in circulation and a buyback system that incentivizes stakers, MUTM has real utility and growth potential, making it the top crypto to buy as capital departs from ADA. For investors monitoring the crypto news, this is the prime opportunity to act.

Bitcoin retraced roughly 12% from its yearly peak, while Ethereum fell below key support levels, placing short-term pressure on major assets. Yet, amid this correction, investor interest began to revive, driven by emerging narratives across AI, DeFi, memecoins, and decentralized perpetual exchanges. Sectoral growth and renewed speculative interest became the defining features of the quarter. HTX, a global leading exchange, recently released its Q3 report for HTX Select (formerly known as the “Crypto Gem Hunt”), revealing that 38 quality assets were listed during the quarter. Several of these tokens delivered multi-fold gains after listing, underscoring HTX Select’s role as a key driver of wealth creation for platform users. Quarter Highlights: ASTER and AVNT Lead the Performance Charts HTX Select’s official data showed that Q3 listings delivered robust results, across multiple sectors spanning memecoins, DeFi, AI, Layer 1 and Layer 2 infrastructure, and derivatives DEX. Standout performers such as ASTER, AVNT, and M recorded an exceptional price increase, significantly boosting trading activity and new user growth on the platform. DeFi and Perp DEX projects emerged as the quarter’s strongest sectors. ASTER , a next-generation decentralized perpetual futures and spot trading platform, captured wide attention among professional traders through its innovative “no-MEV, low-slippage” architecture. The platform’s native token surged 525% post-listing, positioning itself as a leading name in the on-chain derivatives segment. In the broader DeFi landscape, Avantis (AVNT) stood out with its algorithmic yield aggregation model, soaring more than 14x from its initial listing price and becoming the top performer on HTX in Q3. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) , focusing on decentralized asset management and yield-bearing debt markets, introduced a novel “liquidity bond pool” model. WLFI gained steady institutional traction throughout the quarter. Meanwhile, FUNToken (FUN) , rooted in Web3 entertainment, features gaming and decentralized payments with a gamified, AI-powered rewards system. FUN rose 166.7% within the last quarter, showcasing solid user engagement and stable growth. The memecoin and AI sectors also regained momentum. MEMECORE (M) demonstrated the enduring viral power of memecoins, rising 435% following its listing thanks to strong branding and social resonance. Sahara AI (SAHARA) aims at decentralized AI compute sharing and model training to build a decentralized AI ecosystem. SAHARA climbed 135.2%, benefiting from the global resurgence of AI narratives. Layer 1 infrastructure assets also maintained long-term potential. 0G is a high-performance modular blockchain featuring parallel execution and designed to support AI and DeFi workloads. The token rallied from 2.4 USDT to 6 USDT, a 150% gain after its debut on HTX. 2025 HTX Q3 – Top Gainers on HTX Refined Strategy: Positioning for the Next Market Cycle HTX continues to strengthen its reputation as the go-to platform for discovering new quality digital assets, staying true to its core philosophy of “ Buy New Crypto Only on HTX .” The exchange’s listing strategy remains centered on early identification, early exposure, and early participation, enabling users to seize early-stage project opportunities. Amid rising enthusiasm for Chinese-language memecoin projects, HTX secured the initial listing of the viral “ Binance Life ” token for spot trading and launched a dedicated Chinese market section, catalyzing a new wave of “Chinese narrative” momentum across the industry. Looking ahead to Q4, the platform expects to roll out TGE listings across several infrastructure projects such as MONAD, extending its leadership in early-stage listings. HTX remains committed to swiftly listing high-quality assets at the earliest opportunity, leveraging its professional selection mechanism to help users secure a first-mover advantage in the new market cycle. From the Crypto Gem Hunt to today’s HTX Select, the evolution represents more than a name change for HTX. The platform will continue to discover and curate promising crypto assets globally.

While BTC struggles to stabilize after clearing key liquidity levels, ETH is attempting to reclaim crucial resistance, setting the stage for what could be the next major directional move in the crypto market. Market Weakness Persists After $116,000 Liquidity Sweep Can Özsüer, in his latest BTC 1H Current Chart update shared on X, highlighted that the hourly chart of Bitcoin shows little to no bullish reflection at the moment. He pointed out that market sentiment has weakened, particularly after the $116,000 liquidity zone was cleared, which further dampened the outlook across the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Pre-Rally Setup: Holding The $3,600 Zone Could Spur An Upward Trend According to Özsüer, the overall setup remains fragile, and taking scalp long positions in such conditions could be risky until a clearer reversal structure begins to form. Özsüer identified the $111,000 level as a potential zone for an initial reaction buy, suggesting that some short-term support could emerge around this point. However, he cautioned that if this level fails to hold, Bitcoin could experience a sharper decline toward the trendline support near $109,000. He further advised that traders should construct their strategies carefully, focusing on the zones within what he referred to as “box number 1.” This area could provide a technical framework for identifying potential entry points and managing risk effectively. To conclude, Özsüer noted that the cleanest and safest approach would be to align trading plans around optimal price levels while ensuring that positions remain protected above the defined support structure. Bullish Momentum Builds If $4,200 Is Reclaimed While Bitcoin faces a potential drawdown, crypto analyst Ted Pillows revealed that ETH is currently engaged in a critical fight to reclaim the $4,200 resistance zone. The success of this immediate technical battle is crucial, as it will determine the asset’s trajectory in the days to come. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘True Bull Run’ May Yet To Begin — Analyst Explains Why Ted pillows outlined the condition for a continuation of the rally; if Ethereum is able to decisively reclaim and hold the $4,200 level, traders should “expect more bullish continuation.” Conquering this resistance would likely signal a clear path to the next higher price targets. Conversely, should ETH fail to secure the $4,200 zone, the price will likely retreat. The analyst predicts that this failure would trigger a necessary retest of the $4,000 level before the market can attempt any further upward moves, indicating that $4,000 acts as the crucial defense line against a deeper correction.

A recent report from South Korea paints a stark picture of these dangers, revealing that Kyunghyang Shinmun has highlighted a shocking trend: forced liquidations from domestic South Korean crypto loans have soared past 20,000 in just four months. This dramatic increase, triggered by sharp price declines, underscores the volatile nature of the crypto market and the inherent perils of leveraged lending. What’s Driving the Surge in South Korean Crypto Loans and Liquidations? The numbers are truly eye-opening. Data compiled from the office of Shin Jang-sik , a Rebuilding Korea Party lawmaker, illustrates a rapid expansion in the country’s crypto lending sector. Consider these facts: From June to September, the number of users engaging with South Korean crypto loans jumped from approximately 2,400 to a staggering 35,500. The total value of these loans skyrocketed tenfold, increasing from about 110 billion won ($81.5 million) to an astonishing 1.14 trillion won ($844.4 million) within the same period. Most critically, forced liquidations surged dramatically, from 574 in June to a peak of 17,299 in July alone. Understanding Forced Liquidations: A Core Risk of Crypto Lending So, what exactly is a forced liquidation? In simple terms, it happens when the value of the collateral you’ve put up for a loan falls below a certain threshold. Crypto loans often require users to deposit digital assets, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, as collateral to borrow stablecoins or fiat currency. If the market price of your collateral drops significantly, the lending platform automatically sells your assets to cover the loan, preventing further losses for the lender. This process, known as a margin call followed by liquidation, can lead to substantial losses for borrowers, often wiping out their initial investment. Why Are South Korean Crypto Loans Seeing Such Extreme Volatility? The rapid increase in forced liquidations among South Korean crypto loans can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market means prices can swing wildly in short periods. When major cryptocurrencies experience sharp downturns, as they have recently, the collateral backing these loans quickly loses value, triggering automatic sales. Secondly, the allure of high returns and the perceived ease of access to crypto lending platforms may lead some borrowers to take on excessive leverage without fully understanding the associated risks. Many users might be seeking quick profits or liquidity without selling their underlying assets, hoping to capitalize on potential price increases. However, this strategy can backfire dramatically during market corrections, leading to swift and painful liquidations. Furthermore, the burgeoning popularity of crypto in South Korea, coupled with a relatively nascent regulatory framework, could contribute to a landscape where risks are not always fully transparent or understood by all participants. Navigating the Challenges and Protecting Your Crypto Assets For individuals participating in the crypto lending space, especially those with South Korean crypto loans , understanding and mitigating risks is paramount. Here are some key considerations: Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your assets into highly volatile cryptocurrencies. Understand Leverage: Be cautious with high leverage ratios, as they amplify both gains and losses. Monitor Market Conditions: Stay informed about market trends and be prepared for sudden price drops. Set Stop-Losses: Some platforms allow you to set automatic sell orders to limit potential losses. Choose Reputable Platforms: Research the security and transparency of lending services. Seek Financial Advice: If unsure, consult with a financial advisor who understands crypto investments. The recent surge in forced liquidations from South Korean crypto loans serves as a powerful reminder of the double-edged sword that is cryptocurrency lending. While offering opportunities for liquidity and potential gains, the inherent volatility and the risks of leverage demand extreme caution. As the market continues to evolve, both users and regulators must prioritize education and robust risk management to foster a safer and more sustainable digital asset ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions About South Korean Crypto Loans What is a forced liquidation in crypto loans? A forced liquidation occurs when the value of the cryptocurrency collateral you’ve provided for a loan drops below a specific threshold. The lending platform then automatically sells your collateral to cover the loan, preventing further losses for the lender. This process results in the borrower losing their collateral. Why have South Korean crypto loans seen so many liquidations recently? The surge in liquidations is primarily due to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. When crypto prices decline sharply, the value of the collateral backing these loans decreases, triggering automatic liquidations. High leverage and a desire for quick returns also contribute to increased risk. Who is Shin Jang-sik and what is their role? Shin Jang-sik is a lawmaker from the Rebuilding Korea Party in South Korea. Their office compiled and reported the data regarding the surge in forced liquidations from domestic cryptocurrency lending services, highlighting the growing concerns within the sector. How can borrowers protect themselves from forced liquidations? Borrowers can protect themselves by understanding the risks of leverage, monitoring market conditions closely, diversifying their crypto portfolio, and avoiding over-leveraging. Choosing reputable lending platforms and potentially setting stop-loss orders can also help mitigate risks. What is the Kyunghyang Shinmun ? The Kyunghyang Shinmun is a major daily newspaper in South Korea. It was the publication that initially reported on the significant number of forced liquidations from South Korean cryptocurrency lending services, bringing this critical issue to public attention.

53718211,614619,1761613238,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53718211.jpeg,SSR Oscillator Signals Liquidity Waiting To Enter Bitcoin – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/ssr-oscillator-signals-liquidity-enter-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a consolidation phase following the October 10 market crash, with bulls now pushing prices back above critical resistance levels. The recovery toward the $115K region has renewed optimism across the market, as the monthly close approaches and traders anticipate a possible shift in momentum. According to several analysts, this phase may represent the calm before the storm, a typical pattern seen before large directional moves. On-chain data and liquidity metrics suggest that capital is accumulating on the sidelines, ready to rotate into Bitcoin once clear bullish confirmation appears. If BTC manages to break above its previous all-time high (ATH), analysts believe it could trigger a new impulsive phase, similar to the post-accumulation surges observed in earlier bull cycles. Funding rates remain stable, suggesting that leverage is still moderate — a positive sign for a potential sustainable rally. Furthermore, liquidity concentration near key resistance zones indicates that a decisive breakout could quickly attract institutional and retail inflows. As volatility compresses and the market digests recent shocks, Bitcoin appears to be building strength for its next major move, with liquidity and sentiment aligned for a possible bullish continuation into November. Bitcoin Liquidity Builds as Stablecoin Supply Ratio Hits Cycle Lows According to Glassnode data , the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) Oscillator remains near its cycle lows, signaling a period of high stablecoin liquidity relative to Bitcoin’s market capitalization. In simple terms, this means there is a substantial amount of buying power sitting in stablecoins — the digital cash reserves of the crypto ecosystem — waiting for the right moment to re-enter the market. Historically, such conditions have often preceded major bullish phases for Bitcoin. When stablecoin liquidity is high, it implies that investors are holding capital in readiness rather than fleeing the market entirely. Once market confidence strengthens, these reserves typically flow back into risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, creating a wave of bid-side pressure that fuels upward momentum. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading just above $115K, still recovering from the October 10 crash that disrupted short-term sentiment. Yet, despite recent volatility, liquidity indicators such as the SSR suggest that the market’s underlying structure remains healthy. Stablecoins now represent a significant portion of total crypto liquidity, and their abundance indicates that participants are positioned to buy the dip once conviction returns. Analysts interpret the current SSR trend as a bullish latent signal, reflecting a macro setup similar to those seen before previous expansion phases. If Bitcoin manages to stabilize and reclaim higher levels, the excess liquidity sitting in stablecoins could act as a catalyst for a strong impulse move, driving BTC toward a new cycle high. In this context, the SSR’s position near historical lows might represent not just a sign of caution, but an early signal that the next major liquidity-driven rally could already be forming beneath the surface. BTC Retests Resistance as Bulls Regain Control Bitcoin (BTC) continues its recovery, trading around $115,300 after a strong rebound from the $108K region earlier this month. The 12-hour chart reveals a clear upward structure forming, with bulls now challenging the $117,500 resistance level, a zone that has repeatedly acted as both support and rejection in recent months. BTC is currently trading above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, signaling renewed short-term strength, while the 200-day MA around $113K has turned into a solid support base. A sustained breakout above $117.5K could open the door for a move toward $120K–$123K, confirming a short-term impulsive phase and potentially restoring investor confidence after weeks of consolidation. Volume has been rising alongside price, suggesting genuine buying interest rather than speculative spikes. However, BTC’s momentum remains sensitive to macroeconomic factors and liquidity conditions. A rejection at this level could lead to another retest of $111K, maintaining the consolidation range. Overall, Bitcoin’s current technical structure looks constructively bullish. If price manages to close above $117.5K with strong volume, it would likely confirm the end of the post-crash stagnation and set the stage for a new leg higher, supported by improving liquidity and market sentiment.

The ETF is set to trade on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), marking a significant milestone for Solana, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Bitwise confirmed news of the launch on X on Monday, calling it a “historic step” in bringing Solana into mainstream investment portfolios. BSOL will not only own Solana tokens directly but also stake them on-chain to earn extra yield from network rewards, the firm said. Bitwise anticipates that staking returns will yield approximately 7% per year, and rewards are automatically reinvested into the fund to enhance performance. Staking will be managed by Bitwise’s infrastructure partner Helius Technologies for reliability and regulatory compliance, according to the firm. The management fee of the ETF is 0.20%. However, Bitwise has stated that it will temporarily waive fees for an initial three-month period or until the fund reaches $1 billion in assets under management, whichever comes first. Analysts say BSOL’s fee structure and built-in staking feature could attract both institutional and retail investors seeking exposure to Solana’s ecosystem without the complexities of self-custody or the cumbersome process of staking directly. The launch is a game changer for digital finance, said Kristin Smith, president of the Solana Policy Institute. U.S. shutdown amplifies crypto ETP wave The launch of BSOL has arrived just as a new group of crypto-focused ETFs has begun to flood the U.S. market. Canary is also expected to list its Litecoin (LTC) and Hedera (HBAR) ETFs on Nasdaq on the same day, with the Grayscale Solana Trust ETF set to go live later in the week, according to reliable sources. The launches occur as a U.S. government shutdown drags on, which means the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains operational but with reduced staffing. Typically, the SEC’s staff vets and approves ETF filings, but under the shutdown plan, most are put on hold. Yet, the companies have managed to find legal means to move forward despite these limitations. Asset managers can file an S-1 registration statement without a delaying amendment, according to recent SEC guidance issued earlier this month, and their registration becomes effective automatically 20 days later. Due to this process, crypto ETF issuers such as Bitwise and Canary Capital have been able to move forward with their listings, even when the SEC was operating at a limited capacity. Pre-shutdown, the SEC had signed off on new listing standards to cover commodity-based trust shares across three large exchanges, a decision that basically paved the way for crypto ETFs. Investors position for Solana’s next growth wave The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF is more than just another crypto investment vehicle; it’s a bridge between decentralized finance and Wall Street. By incorporating staking into a regulated ETF wrapper, Bitwise is combining passive income streams with institutional-level access. So that investors can participate in Solana’s growth trajectory and yield potential without getting lost in the complexities of private key management or interacting directly with on-chain staking. It also paves the way for large institutions, which are typically held at arm’s length by compliance hurdles, to hold or stake cryptocurrencies directly. Solana has increased by more than 40% in the past month, driven by rising on-chain activity, a growing developer ecosystem, and increasing institutional demand. Analysts believe the BSOL launch contributes to the legitimacy of Solana as a top-tier blockchain network, particularly with the adoption of ETFs ramping up. Industry specialists say that Bitwise’s move could provide the catalyst for a wave of single-asset crypto ETF launches, similar to how Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs changed the digital-asset investment landscape earlier in 2021. As the crypto ETF environment continues to grow, issuers will find themselves even more competitive. Cheapness, stakeholder yield, and liquidity will determine what products capture investor attention. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

As the digital market heats up again, coins like FLOKI and Shiba Inu have been stirring massive excitement. FLOKI’s market cap pushes past $713 million while Shiba Inu trades near the $0.000010 range, teasing a 40% breakout potential. Yet, among these familiar names, a new contender is catching every bull’s eye – MoonBull. MoonBull presale’s fifth stage is live, offering an entry point that feels like catching lightning in a bottle. Crypto traders who missed early meme moonshots are calling this their “second chance” moment. With its structured $MOBU presale model, early investors could potentially see explosive returns as each stage climbs higher toward launch. MoonBull ($MOBU) Presale Ignites Investor Frenzy: The Best Meme Coin to Buy Under $1 MoonBull ($MOBU) isn’t just another meme coin chasing hype – it’s rewriting the rulebook. Built on Ethereum, it merges viral energy with tokenomics engineered for sustainability. That’s why so many believe it’s the best meme coin to buy under $1 today. The current MoonBull presale (Stage 5) is live at just $0.00006584, with over $500K already raised and 1500+ holders. The presale structure spans 23 stages, where prices rise gradually, making each stage scarcer than the last. Early birds stand in the sweetest spot. If someone invests $25,000 now, they could be sitting on nearly $2.3 million when the final listing hits $0.00616 – that’s real financial freedom, not peanuts. The current ROI already stands above 9256%, proving why investors are charging in like bulls before the gate closes. MoonBull’s ecosystem pumps value into liquidity, burns, and holder rewards. Two percent of every trade goes straight to liquidity, two percent to reflections, and one percent burns forever – a trio that keeps the market stable and rewards steady. Plus, the staking system offers a 95% APY, starting at Stage 10, where holders can stake, earn daily, and still keep full control. The $MOBU presale isn’t just a sale – it’s a movement. Voting Power: Every Holder’s Voice Counts MoonBull’s governance kicks off at Stage 12, where 1 $MOBU = 1 vote. This setup lets every holder shape campaigns, burns, and development choices directly. It’s democracy on the blockchain, pure and simple. With full transparency and a locked liquidity pool, MoonBull builds trust that’s rare in meme coin territory. That’s why the buzz is strong – the best meme coin to buy under $1 doesn’t just promise gains, it delivers participation. Floki ($FLOKI) Faces 78% Drop From All-Time High FLOKI, inspired by Norse legend and community-driven strength, remains a tough bull in a wild market. With its price currently around $0.00007365, FLOKI boasts a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $45 million. Its market cap stands at $713 million, ranking it #136 globally. While trading activity recently dipped by over 32%, FLOKI still holds strong support and massive engagement, proving its staying power amid market swings. The coin’s all-time high reached $0.0003449, meaning it’s trading about 78% below that level – but bulls know that also means room to run. FLOKI’s steady 14% rise over the past week outpaces much of the Ethereum ecosystem, hinting that momentum could be warming up again. For investors looking at the best meme coin to buy under $1, FLOKI still has the community might – but MoonBull’s presale energy may soon eclipse it. Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Price Action: 40% Breakout May Be Next Shiba Inu (SHIB) keeps its massive fanbase buzzing like penguins spotting fish in the ice. Currently trading near $0.00001018, SHIB shows strong range support between $0.00000950 and $0.00001000. Analysts expect a breakout toward $0.00001450, a potential 40% surge if the resistance at $0.00001250 cracks. The community engagement is booming again, with posts from Shib Spain sparking optimism across social feeds. Trading volume remains tight as sellers cool off and buyers accumulate. SHIB’s structure mirrors its previous accumulation cycles – the calm before a big moonshot. Yet, while Shiba Inu’s bullish chart draws eyes, MoonBull’s presale momentum and growth mechanics make it the best meme coin to buy under $1 for anyone chasing the next explosive wave. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, both FLOKI and Shiba Inu display renewed strength. FLOKI’s recovery from a market cooldown shows resilience, while Shiba Inu’s tight support range hints at a bullish reversal ahead. Yet these coins, though powerful veterans, move at a steadier pace. In contrast, MoonBull’s live presale, with massive ROI potential, structured growth, and a community-driven model, positions it as the best meme coin to buy under $1 in 2025. MoonBull’s presale is lighting up crypto circles, offering a chance at financial transformation before the big launch. Stage 5 is the golden gate – once it’s gone, the prices rise. With its liquidity rewards, reflections, and staking APY of 95%, MoonBull presale is built for believers ready to ride the next moon wave. Don’t stand on the sidelines – join the herd before the stampede begins.

Realistically, no meme coin is close to hitting $1 soon because of their massive token supplies.

Its presale structure, deflationary tokenomics, and governance model offer a balanced mix of innovation and community empowerment. FLOKI and SHIB remain solid for traders who prefer established meme projects, yet MoonBull’s momentum suggests it could become the next breakout star. Will Pepe ever hit $1? Pepe Coin’s chances of hitting $1 are slim given its huge supply, but its popularity in 2023–2024 helped fuel the meme-coin revival. Still, new entrants like MoonBull are designed with more sustainable mechanics that could deliver stronger long-term growth under the best meme coin to buy under $1 category. What is the best crypto presale to invest in 2025? The MoonBull presale is currently one of 2025’s most talked-about crypto events.

53719063,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/crypto-casinos-face-new-uk-regulations-october-2025-compliance-updates-reshape-industry,1761614576,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/53719063.jpeg,Crypto Casinos Face New UK Regulations: October 2025 Compliance Updates Reshape Industry,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/crypto-casinos-face-new-uk-regulations-october-2025-compliance-updates-reshape-industry,"Recent investigations have revealed how crypto casinos have enabled money laundering in the United Kingdom. All efforts to stop such activities in the UK have proven fruitless, including stiff penalties that have been issued to mainstream gambling companies, citing anti-money laundering (AML) failures. While licensed and legal companies are transparent in their operations, most online crypto casinos are not held up to the same standard. Obviously, when playing on a casino site you want to have full assurance that it’s compliant with the law. The flipside is grim and risks you partaking in a fraudulent establishment, which risks not only funding an illegitimate entity, but also your actual money. The KYC, AML, and CDD are examples of requirements that are deliberately overlooked by rogue players, leaving the regulators with little legal refuge to administer oversight. The problem stems from the fact that, though the United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) is aware of the challenges and has asked casinos to allow the watchdogs to fully audit their operations if they seek to enter the market, no crypto casino has complied, and there hasn't been a single licensed crypto casino in the country just yet. Such casinos that operate in such a manner are not obligated to the regulator. The Agile Crypto Offshore Sector The investigation carried out by Betconix arrived at a not-so-surprising conclusion. As it's not breaking news that crypto gambling is attractive due to its decentralisation, which allows criminal activities and disreputable sources of funding to not be tracked as easily. While direct crypto deposits are prohibited, Neteller and Skrill are still exempted. In the meantime, offshore gambling platforms are confidently pushing their products more aggressively while offering local players “hotter offers”. While the UK has made significant strides in making the gambling industry safer, it faces the question that the industry in every country has to address: how do they beat the offshore market at its own game? So due to all these, regulators are ramping up different strategies to stop violations. In 2025, Spreadex, AG Communications, and TGP Europe faced penalties of over £1 million for anti-money laundering violations. New UK regulations for crypto casinos, which will take effect on the 31st of October 2025, require the following • Mandatory Deposit Limits for Customers: Crypto casino operators must motivate all new customers to set a financial limit before they make their first deposit. This regulation also ensured that customers must be able to easily review and change this limit at will. • Enhanced fund protection transparency: The terms and conditions of the casino must expressly state whether customer funds are protected in the event of insolvency, the level of protection, and the method used to achieve it. This information must be available for all customers to see when they make their first deposit. • Stricter AML and KYC procedures: The United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) has increased the level of scrutiny on AML. Crypto casino operators are now expected to function like financial institutions, with real-time, risk-based, and fully embedded AML systems, not just “box-ticking” compliance. This also includes verifying the source of the crypto funds that the individual intends to gamble with. • Increased enforcement: The United Kingdom Gambling Commission is increasing enforcement actions, with warnings that fines go as high as 15% of Gross Gambling Yield (GGY) for serious AML failures, and operators are being held accountable for not evolving their detection systems quickly enough. • Real Value Conversion: Operators are required to convert cryptocurrencies to their local fiat value in player accounts to provide greater transparency and mitigate the volatility risks that are associated with cryptocurrency price fluctuations. What this means for the industry These changes mean that UK crypto casinos must significantly and swiftly update their platforms and compliance procedures. The focus is shifting towards customer protection, financial transparency, and advanced fraud detection. In other words, treating crypto gambling operations with the same level of scrutiny as traditional financial services. What Operators Should Do To avoid losing their license or being fined, operators should: • Carry out regular risk profile appraisal through CDD & report to the licensing board.• Conduct a risk assessment for each third-party payment service provider they integrate.• Monitor and report any suspicious activity.• Be on the lookout for vulnerable players & report to the UK's Financial Intelligence Unit when needed.• Use closed-loop payment setups that make crypto transactions easier to follow Other Necessary Information • Crypto gambling is attractive for laundering due to decentralisation, anonymity, and quick fund movement.• Neteller and Skrill e-wallets are the only accepted platforms that the UKGC allows indirect deposit from. Direct crypto deposits are prohibited.• Offshore platforms exploit licensing loopholes to market unregulated casinos to UK users.• Operators face heavy fines for failing to verify player identities and transaction sources.• New regulations are underway as a response to AI-driven fraud.

Debopama Sen, Citi’s head of payments, said that corporate clients increasingly seek faster, programmable, and more efficient payment options available around the clock. “We’re exploring solutions to enable onchain stablecoin payments for our clients,” Sen said. “Stablecoins will be another enabler in the digital payment ecosystem and it’ll help grow the space, it’ll help grow functionality for our clients.” Stablecoins Becoming Central to Wall Street Strategy The move comes just months after the passage of the U.S. GENIUS Act, which established a legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operations, effective in 2027. Citi is joining other major financial institutions — including JPMorgan and Bank of America — that are developing or testing their own stablecoin-related services. Even JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, long critical of cryptocurrencies, recently confirmed that the bank “plans to be involved” in the stablecoin sector. Citi’s Market Forecast Reflects Rapid Growth In September, Citigroup sharply raised its projection for the stablecoin industry, forecasting a market size of up to $4 trillion by 2030 — a dramatic increase from the current valuation of around $315 billion. The stablecoin market’s growth has been explosive, expanding from less than $5 billion in 2020 to more than $315 billion today, according to DefiLlama data. Investor Enthusiasm Grows After Circle’s IPO Investor interest in the sector has surged following Circle’s public listing earlier this year. The USDC issuer’s shares jumped 167% on their debut, pushing its market capitalization to approximately $35 billion. With regulatory clarity and growing institutional participation, Citigroup’s upcoming stablecoin payment platform could mark the beginning of a new era for global finance — one where traditional banking and blockchain technology converge.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Press Releases|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-28 01:35:22

This announcement came after dYdX encountered an outage on October 10 caused by a misordered code process . According to dYdX’s post-mortem report, the outage was triggered by a “misordered code process” during a deployment, which halted the dYdX Chain for roughly eight hours. The downtime was prolonged by delays among validators restarting their oracle sidecar services, leading to stale price data once the network came back online. DYdX encounters a chain halt, interfering with its operation Decentralized exchange dYdX shared a report and an update with the community, outlining their intention to support traders who were victims of a chain halt that paused operations for several hours during the market crash last month. Although no on-chain funds were lost, the glitch caused dYdX’s matching engine to execute trades and liquidations at incorrect prices, leaving several traders with unexpected losses. Notably, the eight-hour outage occurred during the biggest liquidation event in crypto history. Consequently, the interruption led dYdX to suggest that the community handle reimbursements from its insurance fund. The decentralized exchange explained that when the chain started again, the matching engine handled trades and liquidations at incorrect prices due to outdated oracle data. Meanwhile, despite dYdX confirming that no user funds were lost on-chain, some traders encountered significant losses related to liquidations while the system was down. Regarding the situation, the dYdX governance community is set to vote on whether impacted traders should be compensated from the protocol’s insurance fund. This occurred after the crypto market experienced a crash that wiped out approximately $19 billion in positions, marking the largest liquidation event in crypto history. Apart from dYdX, this incident also challenged Binance’s trading services as the exchange experienced substantial price swings, user concerns, and regulatory scrutiny. Traders expressed dissatisfaction with Binance due to technical issues that prevented them from closing their positions. This involved issues with the interface that displayed multiple tokens with prices below zero and the depeg of Ethena’s USDe synthetic stablecoin. Binance commits $728 million to support investors affected by an outage Following the outage, sources noted that Binance did not accept responsibility for the losses incurred by traders. However, the cryptocurrency exchange developed a support initiative worth $400 million for those affected. This initiative comprises $300 million in token vouchers and $100 million for impacted participants in the sector. Regarding the token vouchers, eligible users were set to receive token vouchers valued between $4 and $6,000. To qualify, Binance set conditions for traders to have experienced forced liquidations on their futures or margin positions from Friday 00:00 UTC and Saturday 23:59 UTC. Moreover, users needed to have encountered a loss of at least $50 in crypto, and those losses should account for at least 30% of their total net worth. On the other hand, to support memecoin traders who suffered losses due to the crash, Binance also introduced a $45 million BNB token airdrop to boost market confidence. Overall, the exchange pledged $728 million to aid traders affected by the sell-off. Still, Binance claimed that it is not responsible for users’ losses.

A staggering 6,365 BTC, valued at approximately $727 million, recently moved from the prominent exchange Coinbase to an unknown new wallet. This significant movement, reported by Whale Alert , has ignited widespread speculation across the market. What could be the implications of such a massive Bitcoin transfer , and what does it tell us about the current state of the crypto landscape? Unpacking the Mysterious Bitcoin Transfer When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, it’s often referred to as a ‘whale’ movement. In the crypto world, ‘whales’ are individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market dynamics with their trades. Who are these whales? Their identities typically remain anonymous, thanks to the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions. Why is this important? Large movements of assets, especially from a major exchange like Coinbase, can signal upcoming market shifts, whether bullish or bearish. This particular Bitcoin transfer is noteworthy not just for its size but also for its destination: an ‘unknown new wallet.’ This adds a layer of mystery, prompting questions about the motives behind the move. What Drives Such a Massive Bitcoin Transfer? A substantial Bitcoin transfer like this can stem from various reasons, each carrying different implications for the market. It’s crucial to consider these possibilities rather than jumping to conclusions. Some common explanations for such large movements include: Institutional Investment: Large financial institutions often acquire Bitcoin directly from exchanges or through over-the-counter (OTC) desks and then move it to secure cold storage. Exchange Rebalancing: Exchanges themselves might move funds between their hot and cold wallets for security or operational purposes. Custodial Services: A large custodian might be consolidating funds or preparing for a client’s significant withdrawal. Preparations for Sale: While less common for such large amounts to move directly to an unknown wallet for immediate sale, it’s a possibility that a whale is preparing to offload a portion of their holdings. Understanding the potential drivers behind this Bitcoin transfer helps us gauge its true impact. Tracking Large Bitcoin Transfers: Tools and Transparency The ability to track these colossal movements, like this recent Bitcoin transfer , is a testament to the transparency inherent in blockchain technology. Services like Whale Alert continuously monitor public blockchains for significant transactions, providing real-time updates. However, while the transaction itself is public and verifiable, the identity of the wallet owner remains private. This dichotomy of transparency and anonymity is a core feature of cryptocurrency. For investors, tracking these movements offers valuable insights: It helps in understanding potential supply shocks. It provides clues about institutional interest or disinterest. It can sometimes precede significant price volatility. The journey of this 6,365 BTC highlights both the openness of the blockchain and the enduring mystery of its participants. Navigating the Implications of Major Bitcoin Transfers For everyday crypto enthusiasts and investors, a massive Bitcoin transfer can be a cause for both excitement and apprehension. It’s important to approach such news with a balanced perspective. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable sources like Whale Alert for real-time data. Avoid Panic: Not every large transfer signifies a market crash. Many are for legitimate, non-speculative reasons. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Large whale movements primarily impact Bitcoin, but a diversified portfolio can cushion potential shocks. Look for Patterns: Over time, you might identify patterns in whale movements that correlate with market behavior. Ultimately, this Bitcoin transfer serves as a reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency markets. In conclusion, the movement of 6,365 BTC from Coinbase to an unknown wallet is more than just a large transaction; it’s a significant event that underscores the evolving landscape of digital assets. While the immediate implications remain a subject of debate, it highlights the growing institutional involvement, the power of blockchain transparency, and the continuous need for vigilance in the crypto space. Such substantial movements are a regular feature of a maturing market, reminding us of Bitcoin’s enduring value and the watchful eyes of the crypto community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “whale” in the context of cryptocurrency? A: In cryptocurrency, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. Their transactions, like a significant Bitcoin transfer , can have a substantial impact on market prices and sentiment due to the sheer volume of assets they control. Q2: How do services like Whale Alert track these movements? A: Whale Alert and similar services continuously monitor public blockchain ledgers for transactions that exceed a certain threshold. Since all transactions on a public blockchain are recorded and visible, these services can detect and report large movements in real-time, even if the identities of the senders and receivers remain pseudonymous. Q3: What is Coinbase and why is its involvement significant? A: Coinbase is one of the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges globally, particularly popular in the United States. Its involvement in a large Bitcoin transfer is significant because it’s a major gateway for both retail and institutional investors, suggesting the transaction likely originated from or passed through a highly liquid and regulated environment. Q4: Does a large Bitcoin transfer always mean a price drop? A: Not necessarily. While some large Bitcoin transfer events can precede price volatility, they don’t automatically signal a price drop. As discussed, many reasons for such transfers are benign, such as moving funds to cold storage for security, institutional rebalancing, or OTC deals. The market’s reaction often depends on the context and prevailing sentiment. If you found this analysis insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

The push to launch digital asset funds by institutional players comes amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. The Canary Capital LTC and HBAR funds are expected to launch this week; however, the exact timeline has not yet been confirmed. Preparations are being made to establish the funds this week despite the shutdown, since the SEC’s contingency plan permits only a handful of employees to address emergencies, including ETF approvals. Balchunas expects Canary Capital LTCC and HBAR ETF approvals this week Canary just filed 8-As for Litecoin and HBAR ETFs joining Bitwise who filed one for Solana.

Stay tuned.. pic.twitter.com/4lj8NPn9s7 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 27, 2025 According to an S-1 filing submitted by Canary earlier this month, each fund will include a 0.95% management fee. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas argued that the fee was higher compared to existing spot Bitcoin ETFs. Balchunas also acknowledged that it’s typical for funds entering newer or more specialized markets to have steeper fees. He argued that if there are flows, the issuers will no doubt come and fill the sector with cheaper products. Canary Capital revealed that the proposed ticker symbols are HBR for the Hedera ETF and LTCC for the Litecoin ETF. “Canary just filed 8-As for Litecoin and HBAR ETFs joining Bitwise who filed one for Solana. These are the ones rumoured to be poss looking to launch (along w Grayscale Solana) this week despite shutdown. Not a done deal but clearly preparations being made. Stay tuned.” – Eric Balchunas , Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the current government shutdown, market optimism about a potential Litecoin ETF launch remains high. On the Polymarket market predictions platform, traders have assigned an 88% probability of the ETF getting approved by the end of 2025. Once a Litecoin ETF is approved, it could mark a major milestone for Litecoin, potentially reinforcing market demand and initiating a price rally. At the time of publication, Litecoin is exchanging hands at around $102.47, up 3.15% in the last 24 hours. LTC has also surged by more than 8.7% in the past 7 days, but has dropped 2.3% in the last 30 days. Polymarket also gave a 60 to 80% chance of an HBAR ETF approval by the end of the year. Hederal is now included in six U.S. ETF filings, including Grayscale, Canary, REX-Osprey, and KraneShares, and others, signaling that institutional adoption is near. The Nasdaq has also previously filed a Form 19b-4, which is required for the listing and trading of shares of the HBAR fund once it is approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency had pushed the ETF’s review date to November 8 to provide additional time for the SEC to conduct its administrative reviews and internal assessments. Earlier last week, Hedera’s chief policy officer, Nilmini Rubit, was invited by the Institute of International Finance to accompany their delegation at Nasdaq’s Ring the Bell ceremony. Hedera acknowledged that such events reflect the growing intersection between traditional finance and emerging technologies. NYSE approves Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF Big week incoming — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) October 27, 2025 Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley on Monday hinted at a potential big week for the crypto sector. His remarks follow Bitwise’s previous filing of an updated application for a Solana ETF, seeking to add staking functionality. On Monday, the New York Stock Exchange approved the listing of Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF on NYSE Arca. The crypto-focused asset manager has now expanded its offerings to Solana with staking capabilities to provide investors direct exposure to blockchain-native staking rewards. The initiative follows the growing interest in Solana by institutional players, driven by the network’s high-performance capabilities. The Bitwise SOL ETF will still require SEC approval before trading on the New York Stock Exchange’s umbrella electronic trading platform, NYSE Arca. Bitwise said the initiative aims to bridge the gap between digital assets and conventional markets to make cryptocurrencies more accessible to retail investors.

The agency assigned Strategy a “B-” issuer credit rating, stating that “the company’s concentration in bitcoin is key to its strategy and will likely continue to weigh on our ratings,” citing its extreme concentration in Bitcoin, limited business diversification, weak capitalization, and low U.S. dollar liquidity. Bitcoin accumulation model raises liquidity and capital risks S&P analysts pointed out that Strategy’s corporate identity now revolves almost entirely around its Bitcoin accumulation business. The company now has 640,808 Bitcoins in its treasury, valued at approximately $74 billion, making it the largest Bitcoin treasury company in the world. It has been able to accumulate these through years of equity and debt issuance. While this has made the firm a proxy for Bitcoin exposure, it has also introduced volatility and liquidity risk into its capital structure. The report noted that Strategy “has a long Bitcoin position and a short U.S. dollar position.” However, its debt and preferred equity obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars, and this creates an inherent currency mismatch that could prove fatal during crypto market downturns. S&P’s analysts described this approach as “prudent” in terms of managing near-term maturities, noting that the company has no major debt due within the next 12 months, but warned that the strategy exposes it to the risk of being forced to sell Bitcoin “at depressed prices” during a market stress event. The firm’s outstanding convertible debt is roughly $8 billion, of which $5 billion remains out of the money, maturing between 2028 and 2031. In addition, the company owes more than $640 million annually in preferred dividends. Capital markets access remains a lifeline S&P, however, acknowledged Strategy’s strong access to capital markets as a key strength supporting the stable outlook. The firm’s stock, which has surged in tandem with Bitcoin’s price this year, has a stock market capitalization near $80 billion, “while it has issued almost $15 billion in combined notional value of convertible debt and preferred equity,” according to S&P. S&P’s base-case assumption is that the company will continue to meet obligations by raising capital through these instruments rather than liquidating its Bitcoin reserves. The company recorded a negative $37 million in cash flow from operations during the first half of 2025, while the modest software business barely broke even. Nearly all reported earnings, over $8 billion before tax, came from unrealized gains, which also came from Bitcoin’s fair value appreciation rather than recurring revenue or cash-generating operations. Saylor’s vision meets Wall Street’s reality In a post on X , Michael Saylor, Strategy’s cofounder and chairman, described S&P Global’s rating of the company as the “first-ever rating of a Bitcoin treasury company.” However, the designation of junk status shows the skepticism with which traditional credit markets still view Bitcoin-backed corporate finance, especially those operating a model similar to Strategy. The company continues to expand its holdings despite market warnings and increasing doomsday rhetoric from long-term skeptics such as Peter Schiff. This week, it announced a new Bitcoin purchase worth $43.4 million, extending its streak of aggressive accumulation. On Thursday, October 30, Strategy will be releasing its third-quarter earnings, and as expected, investors will be watching closely for signs of cash flow resilience and balance sheet management.

This event has not only shattered expectations but also set a new benchmark for project funding within the rapidly evolving Sui ecosystem. Imagine a sale so popular it was oversubscribed by more than ten times – that is precisely what Momentum (MMT) accomplished. Understanding the Momentum Community Sale Triumph Momentum (MMT) is making significant waves as a decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity hub operating within the innovative Sui (SUI) ecosystem. Its recent community sale, hosted on the ICO platform Buidlpad , concluded with a truly remarkable outcome. The sale successfully raised an astounding $49.68 million, dramatically surpassing its initial target of $4.5 million by an incredible 1105%. Oversubscription: The demand was so immense that the sale was oversubscribed by more than 10 times. Funds Raised: A staggering $49.68 million was secured. Target Exceeded: This figure is 1105% higher than the original $4.5 million goal. This level of interest highlights a strong belief in Momentum’s vision and its potential to contribute to the Sui network’s growth. How Did the Momentum Community Sale Operate? The mechanics of the Momentum community sale were designed to be accessible while also managing participation. Eligible individuals had several options for subscription, making it convenient for a diverse group of investors. Participants could subscribe using: BNB (Binance Coin) SUI (the native token of the Sui blockchain) USD1 (a stablecoin) A key attractive feature for investors was the token unlocking schedule. All tokens purchased during the sale will be 100% unlocked at the Token Generation Event (TGE). This immediate access is often preferred by participants looking for liquidity from the outset. To ensure fair distribution and prevent single entities from dominating the sale, individual contribution limits were established. These limits ranged between $50 and $20,000, varying based on the participant’s tier. This tiered approach often rewards early supporters or those with higher engagement within the platform’s ecosystem. What Drives Such High Demand for Momentum (MMT)? The overwhelming success of the Momentum community sale is not just a fluke; it reflects several underlying factors. Momentum’s position as a decentralized exchange and liquidity hub is crucial. DEXs are fundamental to the DeFi landscape, offering peer-to-peer trading without intermediaries. By building on Sui, Momentum taps into a blockchain known for its high throughput and low latency, making it an attractive platform for DeFi applications. The Sui ecosystem itself has garnered significant attention and investment, promising scalability and an enhanced user experience. Projects like Momentum that aim to provide essential infrastructure on such a promising blockchain naturally attract strong interest from both retail investors and institutional players looking for early opportunities. This synergy between a robust project and a growing ecosystem creates fertile ground for successful fundraising. The Broader Impact on the Sui Ecosystem The successful conclusion of the Momentum community sale sends a powerful signal to the broader cryptocurrency market, especially concerning the Sui ecosystem. It demonstrates robust investor confidence in projects building on Sui, validating the network’s potential as a thriving hub for decentralized finance. This significant capital injection into Momentum means the project is well-resourced to develop its DEX and liquidity offerings, which will, in turn, enhance the overall utility and attractiveness of the Sui blockchain. As Momentum expands its functionalities, it will likely draw more users and liquidity to Sui, fostering a more vibrant and dynamic DeFi environment. This success can also inspire other developers and projects to choose Sui, creating a positive feedback loop for growth and innovation within the ecosystem. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Momentum? With a successful community sale under its belt, Momentum is now poised for its next phase of development and growth. The 100% token unlock at TGE suggests a focus on immediate liquidity and market participation. Investors will be eagerly watching for the Token Generation Event and subsequent listings on exchanges, which will provide the first public trading opportunities for MMT tokens. The substantial funds raised will enable Momentum to accelerate its development roadmap, potentially introducing new features, expanding its liquidity pools, and forging strategic partnerships. Its continued progress will be key to solidifying its position as a leading DEX and liquidity hub within the competitive Sui ecosystem. The phenomenal success of the Momentum community sale underscores the vibrant potential within the crypto space, particularly for innovative projects on promising blockchains like Sui. Raising nearly $50 million and being oversubscribed tenfold is a clear indicator of strong market confidence and a testament to Momentum’s compelling vision. As the project moves forward, its journey will undoubtedly be one to watch for anyone interested in the future of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Momentum (MMT)? Momentum (MMT) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity hub specifically designed to operate within the Sui (SUI) ecosystem, aiming to provide efficient trading and liquidity solutions. What is the Sui (SUI) ecosystem? Sui is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain designed for speed, scalability, and low-cost transactions. It aims to support a wide range of decentralized applications, from DeFi to gaming. What is Buidlpad? Buidlpad is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) platform that facilitates token sales for new cryptocurrency projects, connecting them with potential investors. Why was the Momentum community sale so successful? The Momentum community sale was highly successful due to strong investor confidence in the project’s vision as a DEX on the promising Sui blockchain, combined with effective marketing and attractive sale terms like 100% token unlock at TGE. What does “oversubscribed 10x” mean? “Oversubscribed 10x” means that the total demand for tokens in the sale was ten times greater than the actual number of tokens made available for purchase. For example, if $4.5 million worth of tokens were offered, investors wanted to buy $45 million worth. How will tokens purchased in the sale be distributed? Tokens purchased in the Momentum community sale will be 100% unlocked at the Token Generation Event (TGE), meaning participants will receive full access to their purchased tokens immediately upon the project’s official token launch.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs).

Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart On the daily chart for October 28, WIF/USDT trades at $0.555, up 0.54% as it holds a steady range between $0.55 and $0.56. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, with the middle band (basis) near $0.543, suggesting a potential volatility squeeze that often precedes a decisive move. The upper band around $0.642 represents the next resistance level, while the lower band at $0.444 remains a distant support zone. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The volume has dropped to 13.6M, indicating less trading, but steady buying pressure is building up. The MACD has just turned positive, showing early signs of trend reversal after a prolonged bearish phase. This alignment, alongside narrowing bands, signals that WIF could be preparing for a momentum breakout if the price closes above $0.56–$0.57. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, WIF shows subtle accumulation signs around $0.556, marking a 0.72% uptick as it continues to move slightly above the Alligator’s blue baseline ($0.548). The green and red Alligator lines have flattened, indicating a neutral short-term structure awaiting breakout confirmation. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview The Balance of Power (0.50) reflects equilibrium between buyers and sellers, consistent with a consolidation phase, while the PVT (75.37M) indicates steady positioning, suggesting that holders are not yet exiting. Should WIF push beyond $0.558–$0.56, momentum could quicken toward $0.57–$0.58 resistance. Conversely, a fall under $0.548 might trigger short-term profit-taking back to $0.54.

WIF is coiling for a directional move after several sessions of low volatility. Holding above $0.55 supports a bullish continuation toward $ 0.60 and beyond, but a dip under $0.54 would delay the breakout. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Bitcoin, Ethereum Have Surged In The Last 24 Hours Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have witnessed a rally during the past day, breaking away from the slump the market had earlier fallen into. At the height of this surge, Bitcoin broke past $116,000, while Ethereum touched $4,250. Related Reading: XRP Flashes TD Buy Signal: Start Of Fresh Rally? The assets have since seen a small retracement. The chart below shows how BTC’s latest trajectory has looked. At its current price of $115,400, Bitcoin is up about 4% on the weekly timeframe. Similarly, Ethereum at $4,160 is in a profit of 3.4%. Most other digital assets have seen similarly positive returns, although there are some outliers like Tron, which is down more than 7%. The market-wide recovery during the past day has meant that a large amount of short liquidations have piled up on the derivatives exchanges. Crypto Market Liquidations Have Totaled At $467 Million According to data from CoinGlass, about $467 million in cryptocurrency-related derivatives contracts have been liquidated over the last 24 hours. A contract is said to be “liquidated” when its platform forcibly shuts it down after it accumulates losses of a certain degree (as defined by the exchange). Given that coins across the board have rebounded, the contracts crossing this threshold would mostly be the short ones. And indeed, the data would confirm so. As is visible above, liquidations related to bearish cryptocurrency bets have reached $358 million in this window, representing 76.6% of the total flush in the sector. Bitcoin led the liquidations with $177 million in contracts involved, while Ethereum contributed the second most with $130 million in contracts. Out of the rest, Solana witnessed the largest flush at $34 million. In some other news, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have observed a notable amount of inflows over the past month, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post.

Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the 30-day netflow for these vehicles has fluctuated since: As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin spot ETFs have seen inflows of $4.7 billion during the past month. Ethereum spot ETFs, which gained approval in mid-2024, have also enjoyed inflows in this period, although their value of $983 million is significantly less than BTC’s.

Related Reading: Solana Jitters Don’t Scare Whales As They Persistently Load Up On SOL – A Rally Ahead? While U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs logged a two-week outflow streak of approximately $555 million, a major corporate buyer stepped in, purchasing 19,271 ETH ($78.3 million) and lifting its total holdings to more than 859,000 ETH. Institutional Accumulation vs ETF Outflows Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded their second consecutive week of redemptions between Oct. 20-24, with about $243.9 million exiting in the latest week alone. Notable outflows came from major funds. Fidelity’s FETH saw about $95.2 million in redemptions, BlackRock’s ETHA around $89.1 million, and Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH each posted further outflows. Similarly, corporate treasuries are doubling down. The company behind the recent $78 M buy added to its ETH holdings just as the Ethereum price reclaimed above $4,200, signalling strong conviction in ETH as a long-term asset. The data suggest a clear market bifurcation, with ETF demand from retail and institutions weakening even as direct corporate treasury accumulation accelerates. Crucially, institutions now hold nearly 4.94 % of all ETH in circulation through treasuries alone, supporting the structural shift in ownership. Ethereum Price Chart Setup: $4,300 Resistance in Focus Technically, the Ethereum price is testing a critical juncture. After bouncing from $3,880 and clearing resistance around $4,200, ETH now sits poised at the upper boundary of a narrowing wedge between $4,100-4,250. A sustained breakout above $4,300 could trigger a sharp move toward $4,600-$5,000. Conversely, failure to break resistance could see a pullback toward $3,700. Derivatives and liquidity data amplify the stakes. ETH futures open interest surged 11.7 % in a 24-hour window, and leverage build-up indicates strong positioning ahead of a directional move. Given the structural backdrop of intense treasury accumulation and weakening ETF flows, the $4,300 mark is not just a technical level, it may represent the tipping point where institutional accumulation meets broader market sentiment. Bottom Line With institutions loading up and retail/ETF flows weakening, the Ethereum price trajectory depends on whether it can decisively breach $4,300. A close above that level could validate the accumulation narrative and unlock higher targets, while a rejection risks reigniting consolidation or even a deeper correction.

A significant stride in this direction has been made by Creditcoin, a Layer 1 blockchain, which recently announced a monumental upgrade. This move sees Creditcoin completing its Creditcoin multichain transition through a strategic integration with Wormhole, a leading cross-chain infrastructure provider. This development is set to revolutionize how users interact with CTC tokens across different networks. What Does the Creditcoin Multichain Transition Mean for You? On October 28, Creditcoin ( CTC ) officially adopted the Native Token Transfer (NTT) standard from Wormhole ( W ). This technical advancement is a game-changer for token transfers. Historically, moving tokens between different blockchains often required a “wrapping” process, which could be cumbersome and sometimes less secure. With NTT, this is no longer an issue. The new standard facilitates easier, native token transfers between major networks, including Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BNB Chain) . This means that if you hold CTC tokens, you can now transfer them between these ecosystems seamlessly, without the need for complex intermediate steps. This significantly streamlines the user experience and boosts liquidity across these vital blockchain environments, truly embodying the spirit of a Creditcoin multichain ecosystem. How Does Wormhole’s Portal Platform Boost Creditcoin? Further enhancing this transition, Creditcoin has secured a listing on Portal , Wormhole’s official bridge platform. This listing is more than just a presence; it’s a direct gateway for users. It allows you to directly transfer and trade your CTC tokens on both Ethereum and BNB Chain. But there’s a crucial advantage here: all these transfers share a single, unified liquidity pool. What does a single liquidity pool mean for you? It ensures greater efficiency and potentially better pricing for trades, as liquidity isn’t fragmented across multiple pools. This centralized liquidity mechanism helps to minimize slippage and provides a more robust trading environment. For anyone looking to move or trade CTC, Portal offers a direct, efficient, and user-friendly solution, making the Creditcoin multichain experience truly integrated. The Future is Multichain: What About Spacecoin? The impact of this integration extends beyond just Creditcoin itself. Spacecoin (SPACE), a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Creditcoin blockchain, is also poised to benefit. Spacecoin is scheduled to adopt the Wormhole NTT standard for multichain transfers following its upcoming token generation event (TGE). This planned adoption highlights a broader vision for the Creditcoin ecosystem: to foster a network of interconnected dApps that can seamlessly operate across multiple blockchains. For Spacecoin users, this will mean enhanced flexibility and accessibility, allowing them to participate in the Spacecoin ecosystem from their preferred network. It’s a testament to the forward-thinking approach of the Creditcoin multichain strategy, building a more interconnected and user-friendly DeFi landscape. Navigating the Benefits of Creditcoin’s Multichain Integration The completion of Creditcoin’s multichain transition with Wormhole brings a multitude of benefits to its users and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Here are some key advantages: Enhanced Liquidity: By connecting to Ethereum and BNB Chain, CTC tokens gain access to vast liquidity pools, potentially improving trading volumes and price stability. Unprecedented User Convenience: The elimination of the wrapping process simplifies token transfers, making it easier for both new and experienced users to manage their assets. Broader Accessibility: Users from different blockchain ecosystems can now more easily access and participate in the Creditcoin network and its associated dApps like Spacecoin. Strengthened Ecosystem Growth: This interoperability fosters innovation and encourages more developers and projects to build on Creditcoin, knowing their assets can move freely. While cross-chain solutions always involve considerations for security, Wormhole’s robust infrastructure and the NTT standard are designed to provide a secure environment for these crucial transfers. This integration marks a pivotal moment for the Creditcoin multichain future, promising a more connected and efficient DeFi experience. In conclusion, Creditcoin’s successful multichain transition, powered by Wormhole’s innovative NTT standard, is a significant milestone. It not only simplifies token transfers and boosts liquidity for CTC across major networks like Ethereum and BNB Chain but also paves the way for a more integrated and accessible decentralized finance ecosystem. This strategic move solidifies Creditcoin’s position as a forward-thinking Layer 1 blockchain, ready to meet the demands of a truly interconnected crypto world. The future of Creditcoin multichain is here, offering unparalleled convenience and opportunities for its community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Creditcoin? Creditcoin is a Layer 1 blockchain built specifically for credit transactions, aiming to establish a decentralized credit system. It enables transparent and verifiable credit history for unbanked and underbanked individuals worldwide. You can learn more about Creditcoin here . Q2: What is Wormhole’s Native Token Transfer (NTT) standard? The Native Token Transfer (NTT) standard is a protocol developed by Wormhole that allows tokens to be transferred natively between different blockchains without requiring a separate “wrapping” process. This simplifies cross-chain operations and maintains the original token’s identity. Q3: How does this integration benefit Creditcoin users? This integration significantly benefits Creditcoin users by enabling seamless and native transfers of CTC tokens between major networks like Ethereum and BNB Chain . It enhances liquidity, improves trading efficiency via a single liquidity pool on Portal, and simplifies the overall user experience by eliminating the need for token wrapping. Q4: What is Spacecoin’s role in this transition? Spacecoin (SPACE) is a decentralized application (dApp) built on Creditcoin. It is also scheduled to adopt the Wormhole NTT standard following its Token Generation Event (TGE), extending the benefits of multichain transfers to its own ecosystem and further strengthening the interoperability of the Creditcoin network. Q5: How does the single liquidity pool on Portal work? The single liquidity pool on Portal means that all CTC tokens transferred or traded across Ethereum and BNB Chain are drawing from the same pool of assets. This centralizes liquidity, which can lead to more efficient trades, reduced slippage, and a more stable market for the token, regardless of which supported chain it’s being accessed from.

That step is part of a broader effort to enhance shareholder value and narrow the discount between the firm’s share price and its net asset value (NAV). According to the company, the ETH was sold on October 24, as disclosed in a press release the same day.. Since then, ETHZilla has repurchased approximately 600,000 of its ordinary shares for around $12 million. The buybacks fall under a board-approved $250 million authorization plan issued in August. In addition to returning significant capital to the trust at this price, the plan gives ETHZilla the flexibility to buy back shares opportunistically when its stock trades below NAV, effectively acknowledging that the company believes its market value doesn’t fully account for the value of its Ether holdings. After the news was released, ETHZilla rose 14.5% during Monday’s trading session and then increased by 9% in after-hours trading to above $22.50 per share, according to Google Finance. Even with the jump, the price is still well off a previous high set around $107, when the company initially disclosed plans to raise funds for its Ethereum treasury project. Buybacks aim to close the discount to NAV ETHZilla’s management team presented the deal as a strategic repositioning aimed at delivering value to shareholders. In a statement, McAndrew Rudisill, Chairman, noted that the company plans to continue selling Ether while repurchasing shares, as ETHZ trades at a significant discount to NAV. This will reduce the number of shares in circulation, thereby strengthening the net asset valuation. Currently, the firm still has roughly $400 million in Ether remaining on its balance sheet even after the sale. That means the $40 million sale was roughly 10% of its crypto reserves, making plenty of headroom for future buybacks. ETHZilla’s investor roster has also garnered attention. In August, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund bought a 7.5 percent stake in the company, Business Insider reported. It was viewed as a sign of increasing institutional interest in Ethereum-based treasuries and digital asset-backed companies. ETHZilla rebranded earlier this year to focus specifically on investments in the Ethereum ecosystem, subsequently pivoting into digital asset management and blockchain investment. Its treasury model reflects traditional investment trusts, but with the added benefit of on-chain transparency and direct exposure to crypto assets. Market reacts to crypto treasury going mainstream The sale demonstrates how blockchain-based treasuries are increasingly acting as capital managers, not just accumulating and holding crypto assets. By converting some of its ETH into equity buybacks, ETHZilla is combining DeFi strategies with corporate finance tools. Analysts said the move could help stabilize the company’s market performance, noting that it reflects a disciplined approach to its balance sheet strategy. They added that by selling a small portion of its Ether holdings to narrow the NAV gap, ETHZilla may attract traditional investors seeking crypto exposure with lower volatility. However, critics note potential risks. Unloading large quantities of Ether would be liable to incur market timing risk for the company should the price of ETH make a fast recovery. It also raises the question of whether Crypto Treasuries should be held by long-term investors or liquidity managers working toward short-term equity targets. ETHZilla’s tactic aligns with methods commonly used in mainstream finance. Firms like Grayscale and Strategy have long grappled with such NAV dislocations tied to crypto prices. ETHZilla’s practice of selling ETH to finance buybacks could, should it succeed, become a model for how other crypto-backed companies treat valuation gaps. The company stated that it would continue to buy back shares “until the discount to NAV is normalized.” This suggests that more Ether sales are on the horizon in the months to come as ETHZilla attempts to balance a strong position in crypto with its stock price.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN: BMNR) stock rose 6.96% to $53.83, up $3.42 from its previous close of $50.41. The stock price oscillated between $51.77 and $53.94 during the day, as Ethereum (ETH) rebounded to $4,209, up $142.34 or 3.44%. On-chain data aggregate by Arkham intelligence, BitMine holds 3.313 million Ethereum, worth over $13.8 billion, 192 Bitcoin, worth over $22 million, and $305 million in cash on hand. Over the past week, the organization has added 77,055 ETH, making it the largest Ethereum treasury company to date. The NYSE American-traded firm is the second-largest cryptocurrency treasury overall, after Strategy, which has more than $73 billion in Bitcoin. BitMine links the ETH surge to global factors Ethereum has been experiencing a recent surge, along with the rest of the crypto market. ETH price increased by 3% in the past week to a current price of $4,209. CoinGecko data reveals that ETH surged to $4,246 overnight, the highest level recorded in the previous two weeks. Thomas J. Lee, the chairman of BitMine and co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, attributed ETH’s recent upswing to increased trade relations between the U.S. and Canada after a sharp decline and crypto market plunge earlier this month. “The progress in trade talks between the U.S. and China is a positive for Ethereum and crypto broadly. These are global assets, and rising tensions triggered the largest ever deleveraging in crypto a few weeks ago.” Thomas J. Lee, Chairman of BitMine and co-founder and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. Lee claimed that although ETH’s and crypto market fundamentals are “uncorrelated” with stocks, Fundstrat’s research over the last 15 years has demonstrated that ETH generally performs better when stocks increase. He added that the rise in stocks indicates that the crypto market is correlated with “risk-on” assets through the related leverage channel. BitMine strengthens institutional confidence in ETH On October 10, BitMine made headlines when it paid around $103.68 million for 23,823 Ethereum. The substantial investment demonstrated a longer-term outlook for the entire market, despite short-term price fluctuations. Tom Lee claimed that ETH will be a key component of blockchain adoption. He said that the recent acquisition of the company aligns with a broader discourse around institutional confidence. BitMine demonstrated that institutional players are adopting a longer-term perspective, focusing more on structural growth and technological advancements. BitMine stated that it plans to push ETH’s financial industry maturation and amass 5% of ETH’s total supply. Additionally, BitMine stated that the purchase demonstrates institutional holders’ high level of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects. Companies increasing their Ethereum holdings are becoming increasingly popular. Strong spot ETH inflows and institutional interest have made major contributions to corporate treasuries this summer. Rival SharpLink Gaming declared that it had recently acquired 39,008 ETH, bringing the total amount of ETH held by the company to 837,230. The total amount of Ethereum (ETH) held in treasuries by publicly traded corporations is worth approximately $18.22 billion. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan on September 6, BitMine increased its treasury by $358 million, solidifying its position as one of the biggest institutional Ethereum investors. The $358 million infusion further fueled ETH’s price rally. BitMine received two large ETH transfers from Galaxy Digital and FalconX, bringing its total holdings to 1,947,299 ETH, valued at approximately $8.69 billion. These transfers added roughly 80,000 ETH to BitMine’s wallets. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

A substantial SOL transfer , amounting to 1,097,555 SOL and valued at approximately $221 million, has been moved from an unknown wallet to Coinbase Institutional . This colossal movement, first highlighted by Whale Alert , raises crucial questions about its implications for the Solana ecosystem and the broader crypto market. What Does This Significant SOL Transfer Imply? When a large amount of cryptocurrency like this SOL transfer occurs, it often sparks discussions about market sentiment and future price action. Whale movements, especially those involving institutional platforms, can be a bellwether for what’s to come. This particular transaction involves Solana (SOL), a high-performance blockchain known for its speed and scalability. Institutional Interest: A move to Coinbase Institutional suggests a sophisticated entity is behind the transaction. Institutions often engage in strategic moves, which could range from accumulation to reallocation. Market Impact: While not immediately indicative of a sell-off, such a large SOL transfer can influence market perception. Traders and investors closely watch these movements for clues about potential supply and demand shifts. Liquidity Provision: Coinbase Institutional acts as a prime broker for many large investors. This could mean the SOL is being prepared for trading, staking, or other institutional services. The Role of Coinbase Institutional in Crypto Movements Coinbase Institutional is a crucial player in the institutional crypto landscape. It provides a suite of services tailored for large-scale investors, including trading, custody, and prime brokerage. For a substantial SOL transfer to land here, it indicates a serious intent from the sender. Unlike retail exchanges, institutional platforms cater to hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. Their involvement often lends credibility and stability to the assets they handle. This particular SOL transfer highlights the growing confidence of large investors in the Solana network and its potential. Understanding Solana’s Position After a Major SOL Transfer Solana has established itself as a formidable blockchain, often touted as an ‘Ethereum killer’ due to its high transaction throughput and low fees. A significant SOL transfer like this one reaffirms its status as a top-tier asset attracting substantial capital. The Solana ecosystem continues to expand, with numerous DeFi projects, NFTs, and dApps building on its robust infrastructure. While a single large transaction doesn’t define the entire network’s health, it certainly underscores its appeal to major players. This kind of institutional engagement can lead to increased adoption and further development within the Solana community. How to Interpret Whale Movements and SOL Transfers Interpreting whale movements, especially a significant SOL transfer , requires a nuanced approach. It’s rarely a straightforward signal. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Don’t Panic: A large transfer to an institutional platform doesn’t automatically mean a dump is imminent. Often, it’s part of a broader, long-term strategy. Look for Context: Is there accompanying news? Are other whales making similar moves? The broader market context is vital. Consider Institutional Strategies: Institutions might be accumulating for staking, providing liquidity for new products, or rebalancing portfolios. Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools like Whale Alert provide transparency, but combining this with other on-chain metrics can offer a clearer picture. Ultimately, this $221 million SOL transfer is a reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the increasing involvement of institutional capital. It reinforces Solana’s position as a key asset on the radar of major investors. This substantial SOL transfer to Coinbase Institutional is more than just a large sum of money moving around; it’s a testament to the evolving landscape of digital assets. It signals a maturation of the crypto market, where institutional players are becoming increasingly comfortable with significant positions in assets like Solana. As we move forward, monitoring such movements will remain crucial for understanding the undercurrents shaping the future of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does a “whale alert” signify in cryptocurrency? A “whale alert” typically signifies a transaction involving a very large amount of cryptocurrency, usually by an individual or entity (a “whale”) holding significant crypto assets. These alerts are often tracked because such large movements can potentially impact market prices or signal upcoming market shifts. 2. Why is the SOL transfer to Coinbase Institutional significant? The SOL transfer is significant because Coinbase Institutional caters to large, sophisticated investors like hedge funds and corporations. A move to this platform suggests that a major player is positioning themselves, potentially for strategic trading, long-term holding, or offering institutional services, rather than a simple retail transaction. 3. What is Solana (SOL) ? Solana (SOL) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and crypto projects. It is known for its high transaction speed, low costs, and scalability, making it a competitor to other major blockchains like Ethereum. 4. Does a large SOL transfer automatically mean the price will drop? Not necessarily. While a large transfer can sometimes precede a sell-off, especially if moved to a retail exchange, a transfer to an institutional platform like Coinbase Institutional often suggests strategic intent. It could be for custody, staking, or even accumulation, not just immediate selling. It’s important to consider the broader market context. 5. Who or what is Whale Alert ?

This week, the firm submitted its sixth amendment to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , marking another significant step in a highly anticipated process for crypto investors. What Does VanEck’s Latest Spot Solana ETF Amendment Mean? VanEck’s recent submission, the sixth of its kind, involves specific phrasing adjustments within the application document. These revisions often address feedback or clarify details requested by the SEC. While seemingly minor, each amendment reflects an ongoing dialogue between the asset manager and the regulatory body. It demonstrates VanEck’s commitment to meeting all necessary requirements for the approval of a spot Solana ETF . The SEC’s rigorous review process for any new financial product, especially those involving novel assets like cryptocurrencies, is standard. This iterative amendment process is a common part of navigating complex regulatory frameworks, ensuring all legal and compliance aspects are thoroughly covered before a product can be offered to the public. Why Are Spot Solana ETFs So Important for Investors? A spot Solana ETF holds actual Solana tokens directly, rather than derivatives. This direct exposure offers several compelling benefits for investors: Accessibility: It simplifies investment in Solana for traditional investors who may be hesitant to buy and store cryptocurrencies directly. They can gain exposure through familiar brokerage accounts. Regulatory Clarity: An SEC-approved ETF provides a regulated investment vehicle, potentially increasing investor confidence and reducing perceived risks associated with unregulated crypto exchanges. Market Legitimacy: The approval of a spot Solana ETF would signal growing institutional acceptance of Solana as a legitimate asset class, potentially attracting more mainstream capital and enhancing market liquidity. Diversification: For institutional portfolios, it offers another avenue for diversification within the digital asset space, complementing existing Bitcoin or Ethereum allocations. This increased institutional interest could drive significant inflows into the Solana ecosystem, benefiting its overall growth and development. Navigating the Regulatory Labyrinth for a Spot Solana ETF The path to launching a spot Solana ETF is complex and fraught with regulatory challenges. The SEC’s primary concerns typically revolve around investor protection, market manipulation, and custody of the underlying assets. While the SEC has recently approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the landscape for other altcoins like Solana remains under intense scrutiny. VanEck’s persistent efforts highlight the significant hurdles involved. Each amendment serves to strengthen the application, addressing potential regulatory sticking points. The SEC evaluates various factors, including the market’s maturity, surveillance sharing agreements, and the overall liquidity of the underlying asset. The agency aims to ensure that any approved product offers adequate safeguards for investors. VanEck’s sixth amendment for its spot Solana ETF application underscores the ongoing push for broader institutional access to digital assets. While the approval timeline remains uncertain, each filing brings the industry a step closer to a more integrated future for cryptocurrencies within traditional finance. This persistent effort by asset managers like VanEck is crucial for paving the way for new investment opportunities and enhancing the legitimacy of the entire crypto market. The journey is long, but the dedication to bringing a spot Solana ETF to fruition is undeniable. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Spot Solana ETF? A spot Solana ETF is an Exchange Traded Fund that directly holds Solana (SOL) tokens. This allows investors to gain exposure to Solana’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account without needing to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency itself. 2. Why is VanEck submitting multiple amendments for its application? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a rigorous review process for new financial products, especially those involving cryptocurrencies. Each amendment typically addresses feedback from the SEC, clarifies specific details, or strengthens the application to meet regulatory requirements concerning investor protection, market manipulation, and custody. 3. How does a Spot Solana ETF differ from a Solana Futures ETF? A spot Solana ETF invests directly in actual Solana tokens, meaning its value is tied to the current market price of Solana. A Solana Futures ETF, if it existed, would invest in futures contracts that bet on Solana’s future price, not the underlying asset itself. The SEC has historically been more comfortable with futures-based crypto ETFs due to established regulatory frameworks around futures markets. 4. What are the potential benefits of a Spot Solana ETF for the Solana ecosystem? Approval of a spot Solana ETF could significantly increase institutional and retail investor access to Solana . This increased demand could lead to greater liquidity, price stability, and overall market legitimacy for Solana, potentially driving further development and adoption within its ecosystem. 5. When might a Spot Solana ETF be approved? Predicting the exact approval timeline for a spot Solana ETF is challenging. The SEC’s review process is thorough and depends on various factors, including ongoing discussions with applicants like VanEck , broader regulatory sentiment, and market conditions. While there’s no fixed deadline, each amendment signals continued progress. Did you find this update on VanEck’s spot Solana ETF application insightful?

The cryptocurrency world often moves at lightning speed, and news can emerge from unexpected corners. Recently, the crypto community was met with a significant development: the official X account for Four.Meme (FORM) , a prominent memecoin launchpad operating on the BNB Chain, faced a sudden and rather X suspension . This unexpected move has left many wondering about the reasons behind it and what it means for the project and its dedicated followers. What Triggered the Four.Meme X Suspension? According to reports, the official X account for Four.Meme was suspended due to violations of the platform’s operating principles. While X (formerly Twitter) has specific guidelines designed to maintain a safe and respectful environment, the exact nature of Four.Meme’s alleged transgression remains undisclosed by X. Potential Violations: Common reasons for account suspensions on X include spamming, platform manipulation, engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior, or sharing content that violates X’s terms of service, such as hate speech or glorification of violence. Community Speculation: In the absence of official statements from X, the Four.Meme community has been rife with speculation. Some suggest it could be related to aggressive promotional tactics, while others point to potential bot activity or mass reporting campaigns against the account. Understanding the specific violation is crucial for both Four.Meme and other projects looking to maintain a strong social media presence. The lack of transparency from X often leaves projects and their communities in the dark regarding the specifics of the Four.Meme X suspension . Immediate Fallout: How the Suspension Impacts Four.Meme An X suspension, especially for a project like Four.Meme that relies heavily on social media for community engagement and announcements, can have immediate and significant consequences. X serves as a primary hub for real-time updates, marketing, and direct interaction with the user base. The suspension means: Loss of Direct Communication: Four.Meme has lost its main channel for instant updates, announcements, and direct interaction with its vast global audience. This can lead to misinformation and uncertainty among investors and supporters. Community Disruption: Projects like Four.Meme thrive on active communities. Without their official X presence, followers may feel disconnected, leading to a potential dip in engagement and sentiment. Credibility Concerns: A suspension can unfortunately raise questions about a project’s legitimacy or operational practices, even if the violation was minor or unintentional. Maintaining trust is paramount in the crypto space, and the Four.Meme X suspension tests this. Therefore, Four.Meme must swiftly address this communication gap and reassure its community, perhaps through alternative platforms. Navigating Social Media Risks: Lessons from the Four.Meme X Suspension The Four.Meme X suspension offers valuable lessons for all cryptocurrency projects regarding their social media strategy. In an era where digital presence is everything, understanding and mitigating platform risks is essential for long-term success and credibility. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Communication Channels: Relying solely on one platform is risky. Projects should establish multiple communication avenues, such as official Telegram groups, Discord servers, Medium blogs, and even email newsletters, to ensure redundancy. Understand Platform Policies: Regularly review and strictly adhere to the operating principles of all social media platforms used. What might be acceptable on one platform could lead to a suspension on another. Build Stronger Internal Teams: Having dedicated community managers and social media strategists who are well-versed in platform guidelines can help prevent inadvertent violations and respond quickly to issues. Foster Organic Engagement: Focus on building a genuine community through valuable content and authentic interactions, rather than relying on tactics that could be flagged as spam or manipulation. This proactive approach helps projects like Four.Meme maintain resilience even when faced with unexpected challenges like an unexpected X suspension. What’s Next for Four.Meme After the X Suspension? The road ahead for Four.Meme involves regaining its footing and rebuilding its communication strategy. This could include appealing the suspension, establishing a new official X account (if permitted), or migrating its primary social media presence to other platforms. Reassuring the community and maintaining transparency will be key to navigating this challenging period after the Four.Meme X suspension . The incident underscores the volatility of relying on centralized platforms for decentralized projects. It’s a stark reminder that even well-established projects can face unforeseen hurdles in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. The Four.Meme X suspension serves as a powerful reminder for all projects in the crypto space: while social media offers unparalleled reach, it also comes with inherent risks. Diversifying communication, understanding platform rules, and fostering genuine community engagement are not just best practices—they are necessities for survival and growth. As Four.Meme navigates this challenge, the broader industry watches, ready to learn from its experience. Frequently Asked Questions About the Four.Meme X Suspension Here are some common questions regarding the recent X suspension of Four.Meme: Q1: What is Four.Meme (FORM)? A1: Four.Meme (FORM) is a memecoin launchpad project primarily operating on the BNB Chain . It aims to facilitate the creation and launch of new memecoins within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Q2: Why was Four.Meme’s X account suspended? A2: The official X account for Four.Meme was suspended for violating X’s operating principles . The specific nature of the violation has not been publicly disclosed by X, leading to speculation within the community. Q3: How does an X suspension impact a cryptocurrency project? A3: An X suspension can severely impact a crypto project by cutting off a primary channel for real-time announcements, community engagement, and marketing. It can lead to a loss of direct communication, community disruption, and potential concerns about the project’s credibility among investors and supporters. Q4: What are Four.Meme’s alternative communication channels after the X suspension? A4: Following the X suspension, Four.Meme would typically rely on alternative platforms such as Telegram groups, Discord servers, official Medium blogs, or their website for announcements and community interaction.

The clear leader in this resurgence was BlackRock’s ETHA, which alone attracted an impressive $71.83 million in net inflows. This strong performance by one of the world’s largest asset managers highlights the institutional confidence building around Ethereum.

The strong performance of Spot ETH ETFs , especially with BlackRock leading the charge, could set a precedent for future institutional involvement. As more financial giants offer similar products, competition may increase, potentially leading to more innovative offerings and lower fees for investors.

Investors should always conduct their own due diligence. The recent net inflows offer a compelling narrative of renewed confidence and strategic positioning by major players. It suggests that despite past volatility, the long-term investment thesis for Ethereum, facilitated by accessible products like Spot ETH ETFs , remains robust. In summary, the significant return to net inflows for Spot ETH ETFs , spearheaded by BlackRock, is a powerful indicator of strengthening investor confidence and institutional adoption. This development not only provides a fresh wave of capital into the Ethereum ecosystem but also solidifies the role of regulated crypto investment products in the evolving financial landscape.

JPYC Is The First Yen-Backed Stablecoin In The World JPYC announced on Monday the launch of its yen-backed stablecoin , also called “JPYC.” A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a fiat currency, and at present, the sector is heavily dominated by tokens tied to the US Dollar, with USDT and USDC alone accounting for the majority of the market. Japan is now also dipping into the space with this new stablecoin. According to JPYC, the token will be backed 1:1 by domestic deposits and Japanese government bonds (JGBs). Users can buy or sell the asset through JPYC EX, the Japanese startup’s official platform. The company is offering zero fee on issuance and redemption for now, instead turning to the interest from the JGBs as a source of income. The token is initially becoming available on Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon, with support for additional blockchains planned. According to Reuters , JPY is aiming to issue 10 trillion yen worth of the stablecoin over the next three years. At the current rate, this target is equivalent to about $65.5 billion. USDC, the second-largest fiat-tied token in the sector, has a market cap of about $76.3 billion right now. Thus, if JPYC meets its ambitious target, it could potentially rival the USD-ruled stablecoin market. The JPYC launch isn’t the only stable-related development that has occurred in Japan recently. As reported by Bitcoinist, three Japanese megabanks are planning to issue a yen-backed token by the end of 2025. The banks in question are Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., and Mizuho Bank. Together, they serve over 300,000 clients. Institutional interest in cryptocurrencies has been rising in the East Asian country recently as the government is considering a regulatory rule change that would allow banks to hold Bitcoin and other digital assets for investment purposes, and register themselves as “crypto exchange operators,” becoming able to offer trading services to customers. While Japan has been moving in a crypto-positive direction, China has remained cautious, offering impediments to stablecoin plans in Hong Kong, according to Financial Times . The Chinese city launched its stablecoin legislation earlier in the year and received enquiries from multiple tech giants for an issuer license. Mainland regulators, however, have urged the companies to halt their plans, raising concerns about the growth of currencies controlled by the private sector. Globally, digital assets pegged to fiat currencies have continued to enjoy capital inflows recently despite Bitcoin and altcoins facing volatility. As the chart shared by institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora shows, the sector has seen its market cap break a record of $308 billion. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $115,200, up nearly 4% over the last week.",Stablecoin|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Japan|Japan Stablecoin|stablecoin|Stables|Yen Stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-28 03:00:01

The price of Bitcoin rose about 1.6% on Sunday, while Ethereum gained roughly 2.8%. Short-term swings appear driven more by headlines than by a single company’s actions. It’s Orange Dot Day. pic.twitter.com/5FSGmxwoNS — Michael Saylor (@saylor) October 26, 2025 Holdings, Valuation And Track Record Based on reports, at prices a little over $115,000 per BTC, Strategy’s Bitcoin stash is valued at around $72 billion. That valuation implies a paper gain of more than $25 billion over a total cost basis of about $47.4 billion since the program began in 2020. Reports have logged 83 separate purchase events in that time, a pattern that has left investors with a clear view of the firm’s playbook: buy repeatedly and report afterward. Some of the buying was concentrated in September, when the firm added thousands of coins in a few large moves. Recently, however, allocations have looked smaller and more frequent. That shift suggests a preference for steady accumulation rather than single big bets. Buying Behavior And Market Response Strategy shares have been trading above the company’s net asset value. That fact suggests investors are comfortable owning MSTR as a way to gain Bitcoin exposure without buying the token directly. The company’s method — announce purchases after the fact and let the market reflect the holdings — has been consistent and predictable.

According to reports, Scott Bessent told CBS News he expected the threat of 100% tariffs and an immediate export control regime to have receded. Earlier in October, China announced tighter limits on rare earth exports used in chip manufacturing. On October 11, US President Donald Trump said he would impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods and planned export controls on certain software to take effect on November 1. Those days of sharp rhetoric caused heavy losses across markets and triggered one of the largest liquidation events in crypto this year.

An address, reportedly linked to WorldLibertyFinancial (WLFI), a decentralized finance (DeFi) project, executed a substantial token burn. This event involved a staggering 175 million WLFI tokens, valued at an impressive $26.72 million, on October 27 around 7:30 p.m. UTC. Crypto analyst Emmett Gallic brought this intriguing occurrence to light on X, prompting discussions across the digital asset community. What Exactly is WorldLibertyFinancial (WLFI)? WorldLibertyFinancial, or WLFI, is a DeFi project that has garnered interest, partly due to its alleged connections to the Trump family. DeFi aims to decentralize traditional financial services, offering users new ways to manage and grow their assets without intermediaries. Projects like WLFI often involve various mechanisms, including token burns, to manage their token supply and ecosystem dynamics. The reported association with a high-profile family adds an extra layer of intrigue to any developments surrounding the project. Understanding the nature of WLFI helps contextualize the impact of such a large-scale event. Unpacking the $26.7 Million WLFI Token Burn The recent WLFI token burn saw 175 million tokens permanently removed from circulation. This action is significant, not just because of the substantial dollar value involved, but also for what it might signal about the project’s strategy. Token burns are a common practice in the crypto space, often used for specific purposes. Deflationary Mechanism: Burning tokens reduces the total supply, which can, in theory, increase the scarcity and value of the remaining tokens. Price Support: By reducing supply, a burn can sometimes help to stabilize or even boost a token’s price, especially if demand remains constant or grows. Signaling Confidence: A large burn can signal to the market that the project team is committed to the token’s long-term value and stability. This particular WLFI token burn , reported by Emmett Gallic, immediately raised questions about its motivations and potential effects. Why Would an Address Burn Such a Large Amount of WLFI? There are several reasons why a project, or an address associated with it, might initiate a massive WLFI token burn . Typically, these actions are strategic and aim to benefit the ecosystem in some way. However, without official statements from WorldLibertyFinancial, the exact intentions remain open to interpretation. Consider these common scenarios: Boosting Investor Confidence: A burn can be a strong signal to investors that the project is serious about maintaining token value. Ecosystem Health: It might be part of a broader plan to optimize the tokenomics of the WLFI ecosystem. Responding to Market Conditions: Projects sometimes burn tokens in response to market fluctuations or community feedback to create a more robust economic model. The sheer scale of this burn suggests a deliberate and impactful decision. Investors and enthusiasts will be closely watching for any further communications from the WLFI team. What Are the Implications for WorldLibertyFinancial and Its Community? The immediate and long-term implications of this substantial WLFI token burn are multifaceted. For existing holders, a reduction in supply could theoretically lead to increased value per token, assuming demand remains stable or grows. However, it also brings a degree of uncertainty if the reasons behind the burn are not clearly communicated. From a broader perspective, such an event can influence market sentiment: Positive Sentiment: If viewed as a strategic move to enhance scarcity, it could attract new investors. Negative Sentiment: A lack of transparency or perceived instability could lead to concerns among some community members. Increased Scrutiny: Any project linked to high-profile figures, especially after a significant event like this, often faces heightened public and analytical scrutiny. Ultimately, the impact will depend on how WorldLibertyFinancial addresses this event and its future actions. Transparency is key in the decentralized world. The Future of WLFI After the Burn The recent WLFI token burn marks a significant moment for WorldLibertyFinancial. While token burns are a known strategy in crypto, the size and the alleged links of this particular event make it noteworthy. The community will be looking for clarity and strategic direction from the WLFI project moving forward. It’s a reminder that the DeFi landscape is dynamic, with projects constantly evolving their strategies to maintain relevance and value. For those involved with WLFI or interested in its trajectory, staying informed about official announcements and market analysis will be crucial. This event underscores the importance of understanding tokenomics and project roadmaps in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a token burn in cryptocurrency?

For those immersed in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these macro shifts, particularly within the Global Forex Market , is more important than ever. The recent firming of Asia FX against a softening US Dollar is a prime example of such a shift, driven by complex interplay of factors including evolving economic policies, geopolitical tensions, and anticipation surrounding central bank decisions. This article will delve into the forces at play, examining how these developments could ripple through financial markets worldwide. What’s Driving the Strength in Asia FX? The resilience observed in Asia FX is not a singular phenomenon but a confluence of several factors. Many Asian economies have shown robust signs of recovery, attracting significant capital inflows. Investors are increasingly looking towards these regions for growth opportunities, bolstering local currencies. Furthermore, the proactive monetary policies adopted by various Asian central banks, coupled with relatively contained inflation pressures compared to Western counterparts, have provided a stable environment for currency appreciation. Economic Recovery: Stronger than expected economic data from key Asian nations, including manufacturing output and export growth, is signaling a healthy rebound. Capital Inflows: Foreign direct investment and portfolio investments are flowing into Asian markets, increasing demand for local currencies. Policy Stability: Many Asian central banks have maintained a cautious yet supportive stance, avoiding aggressive tightening that could destabilize their economies. Trade Surpluses: Continued strong export performance contributes to larger trade surpluses, which naturally strengthens national currencies. This collective strength highlights a growing confidence in Asia’s economic trajectory, making its currencies an attractive prospect in the current market climate. The US Dollar’s Retreat: Why the Softening Against Asia FX? While Asia FX has been firming, the US Dollar has experienced a period of softening. This downward pressure on the dollar is primarily attributed to shifting expectations regarding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and a general improvement in global risk sentiment. When investors feel more confident about the global economic outlook, they tend to move away from safe-haven assets like the dollar, seeking higher returns in riskier currencies and assets. Key factors contributing to the dollar’s recent dip include: Factor Impact on US Dollar Federal Reserve Expectations Anticipation of a more dovish stance or slower pace of rate hikes reduces the dollar’s yield advantage. Improved Risk Sentiment As global economic outlook improves, demand for safe-haven assets like the dollar decreases. Yield Differentials Narrowing interest rate gaps between the US and other major economies can diminish the dollar’s attractiveness. Inflation Outlook If US inflation shows signs of cooling, it could lead to less aggressive monetary policy, weighing on the dollar. These elements collectively paint a picture of a dollar facing headwinds, prompting investors to re-evaluate their positions and look for alternative currency exposures. Federal Reserve’s Pivotal Role: What to Expect from Policy Decisions? The Federal Reserve stands at the epicenter of global monetary policy, and its upcoming meeting is under intense scrutiny. The decisions made by the Fed have profound implications for the US Dollar , interest rates, and capital flows worldwide. Market participants are closely watching for signals regarding future interest rate adjustments, the pace of quantitative tightening, and any shifts in the Fed’s forward guidance on inflation and economic growth. A more hawkish stance, implying faster rate hikes or prolonged tightening, would typically strengthen the dollar. Conversely, a dovish pivot, suggesting a pause or even cuts in interest rates, would likely exert further downward pressure on the dollar. The Fed’s communication is equally vital; clear guidance can reduce market uncertainty, while ambiguous signals can fuel volatility. Potential outcomes and their currency implications: Aggressive Rate Hike: Boosts the US Dollar as it increases the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Pause in Hikes: Likely to weaken the US Dollar as yield differentials narrow and risk sentiment improves. Dovish Forward Guidance: Signals a softer stance on future tightening, generally bearish for the dollar. Focus on Data Dependence: Creates uncertainty, leading to increased volatility as markets react to incoming economic data. The Fed’s careful balancing act between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth will be a defining factor for currency markets in the coming months. Navigating US-China Trade Dynamics: A Lingering Influence on Asia FX? The relationship between the United States and China remains a critical determinant for the Global Forex Market , particularly impacting Asia FX . While direct trade tensions might not always be front-page news, their underlying dynamics continue to shape investor sentiment, supply chains, and currency valuations. Any signs of escalation or de-escalation in US-China Trade relations can trigger significant market reactions. For Asian currencies, a stable or improving US-China trade environment is generally positive, as it fosters greater economic certainty and encourages cross-border investment. Conversely, renewed tariffs or trade disputes can lead to increased risk aversion, potentially weakening currencies in the region as capital seeks safer havens. Consider the ripple effects: Supply Chain Shifts: Companies diversifying away from China due to trade risks can impact other Asian economies, either positively or negatively depending on their role in new supply chains. Investor Confidence: Reduced trade friction typically boosts confidence in global growth, benefiting export-oriented Asian nations. Geopolitical Risks: Beyond trade, broader geopolitical tensions between the two superpowers can overshadow economic fundamentals, influencing currency flows. The intricate dance between these two economic giants will continue to be a key variable for currency traders and investors alike, especially those focused on Asian markets. Broader Implications for the Global Forex Market The combined effect of a firming Asia FX , a softening US Dollar , the impending Federal Reserve meeting, and the enduring influence of US-China Trade dynamics creates a complex yet fascinating landscape for the Global Forex Market . These intertwined factors are not just theoretical constructs; they translate into real-world opportunities and challenges for traders, businesses, and even the broader economy. For investors, this period calls for a nuanced approach. The relative strength of Asian currencies could present attractive investment opportunities, while the dollar’s performance will dictate the cost of imports and exports for many nations. Volatility is likely to remain elevated, requiring careful risk management and a keen eye on economic indicators and central bank pronouncements. Benefits of Understanding These Shifts: Informed Investment Decisions: Helps in allocating capital to regions or currencies poised for growth. Risk Mitigation: Allows for better hedging strategies against currency fluctuations. Strategic Business Planning: Businesses engaged in international trade can anticipate changes in operational costs and revenue. Challenges to Navigate: Increased Volatility: Rapid shifts can lead to unpredictable market movements. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Unforeseen events can quickly alter market sentiment. Divergent Central Bank Policies: Different approaches by central banks can create complex inter-currency relationships. The current environment underscores the interconnectedness of global finance. A shift in one major currency or economy inevitably sends ripples across the entire system, affecting everything from commodity prices to cryptocurrency valuations. Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Sands of Global Currencies The current financial landscape, characterized by a strengthening Asia FX and a softer US Dollar , is a testament to the dynamic nature of the Global Forex Market . The upcoming Federal Reserve meeting and the ongoing nuances of US-China Trade relations are pivotal forces shaping this narrative. For investors and market participants, understanding these intricate relationships is not just an academic exercise but a practical necessity for making informed decisions and navigating potential volatilities. As these crucial shifts unfold, staying abreast of macro-economic developments will be key to identifying opportunities and managing risks in an ever-evolving global economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How does the Federal Reserve’s policy affect the US Dollar ? The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, particularly its decisions on interest rates and quantitative easing, significantly impacts the US Dollar . Higher interest rates typically make the dollar more attractive to investors, strengthening its value, while lower rates or a dovish stance can lead to depreciation. The Fed’s guidance on future policy also plays a crucial role in shaping market expectations. Q2: What role do US-China Trade relations play in the Global Forex Market ? US-China Trade relations are a significant factor influencing the Global Forex Market , especially for Asia FX . Positive developments can boost global risk sentiment, leading to stronger demand for riskier assets and currencies, including those in Asia. Conversely, trade disputes or geopolitical tensions can increase risk aversion, prompting investors to seek safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar , potentially weakening Asian currencies. Q3: Which specific currencies are included in Asia FX that are currently firming? When discussing Asia FX , we generally refer to a basket of currencies from various Asian economies. Currencies that have shown recent strength include the Japanese Yen , Chinese Yuan , South Korean Won , Indian Rupee , and the Singapore Dollar , among others. Their individual performance is influenced by local economic conditions, central bank policies, and regional trade dynamics. Q4: How does the performance of the Global Forex Market impact cryptocurrency? The Global Forex Market significantly impacts cryptocurrency by influencing overall market liquidity, investor sentiment, and capital flows. A stronger US Dollar can sometimes exert downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, as investors move towards safety. Conversely, a weaker dollar or increased risk appetite in traditional markets can free up capital for crypto investments. Macroeconomic stability, reflected in currency markets, often provides a more favorable environment for crypto growth and adoption.

In a striking 24-hour period, Ethereum ( ETH ) led the charge in what can only be described as a cascade of perpetual futures liquidations, totaling an astonishing $97.71 million. This event underscores the inherent risks and rewards within the fast-paced world of digital asset trading. Understanding these movements is crucial for any participant. What Exactly Are Perpetual Futures Liquidations? For those new to the crypto scene, or even seasoned traders needing a refresher, understanding perpetual futures and their liquidations is key. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, hence ‘perpetual’. Liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to a lack of sufficient margin to cover potential losses. This typically happens when the market moves sharply against their bet. If you’re trading with leverage, a small price swing can wipe out your margin, leading to liquidation. Long positions: Bets that the price will go up. Short positions: Bets that the price will go down. The recent data highlights significant volatility, particularly affecting those betting on rising prices. Why Did ETH Liquidations Dominate the Market? In the past 24 hours, Ethereum ( ETH ) stood out with the largest share of liquidations, reaching an astounding $97.71 million. A significant portion of this, 68.6%, came from long positions. This means that a substantial number of traders who had bet on ETH ‘s price increasing were caught off guard by a downward price movement, leading to their positions being closed out by exchanges. This dominance in ETH liquidations suggests a strong bearish impulse or unexpected market correction that heavily impacted bullish sentiment. When a large number of long positions are liquidated, it can create a ‘liquidation cascade,’ where forced selling further drives prices down, triggering more liquidations in a feedback loop. This amplifies market movements, making them even more dramatic. How Did Other Major Cryptocurrencies Fare? While ETH took the lead, other major cryptocurrencies also experienced substantial liquidations: Bitcoin ( BTC ): Followed with $77.37 million in liquidations. Unlike ETH , the split between long and short positions was more balanced, with longs making up 51.98%. This indicates a more two-sided market sentiment or less pronounced directional movement compared to ETH . Solana ( SOL ): Saw $13.19 million in liquidations. Similar to ETH , long positions accounted for a significant 68.99% of these liquidations, pointing to a similar bearish pressure affecting SOL traders who were betting on price increases. The pattern across these assets suggests a broad market correction or increased risk aversion among traders, particularly those employing leverage on long positions. These events are crucial reminders of the importance of risk management. What Are the Implications of High ETH Liquidations for Traders? High ETH liquidations , especially predominantly from long positions, send a clear signal about market sentiment and potential price direction. For traders, this means: Increased Volatility: Liquidation cascades can lead to rapid price drops, creating opportunities for some but significant risks for others. Bearish Sentiment: A high percentage of long liquidations often indicates that the market is currently favoring sellers, or that a significant upward move failed to materialize, forcing bullish traders to exit their positions. Risk Management is Paramount: These events underscore the critical need for robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing leverage responsibly. Understanding the dynamics behind ETH liquidations can help traders make more informed decisions and navigate the turbulent waters of the crypto market with greater caution. In conclusion, the recent surge in ETH liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and risk in the cryptocurrency derivatives market. While Ethereum led the pack, Bitcoin and Solana also experienced significant impacts. These events highlight the importance of prudent trading strategies and a deep understanding of market mechanics. Always prioritize risk management to protect your capital in this dynamic environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a perpetual futures contract in cryptocurrency trading? A perpetual futures contract is a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrency without a fixed expiration date. It’s similar to traditional futures but can be held indefinitely, making it popular for continuous exposure to price movements. Q2: Why do crypto liquidations occur? Liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position can no longer meet the margin requirements set by the exchange. If the market moves unfavorably and the trader’s equity falls below a certain threshold, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, protecting both the trader and the exchange. Q3: What does it mean when most ETH liquidations are from long positions? When the majority of ETH liquidations come from long positions, it indicates that a significant number of traders were betting on Ethereum’s price to rise. The fact that these positions were liquidated suggests a strong downward price movement or a failure of the price to increase, leading to losses for bullish traders. Q4: How can traders protect themselves from significant ETH liquidations ? Traders can protect themselves by using proper risk management techniques. This includes setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, using appropriate leverage levels (avoiding excessive leverage), and maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts to withstand market fluctuations. Diversifying portfolios and staying informed about market trends are also crucial. If you found this analysis insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

Ripple CEO Prepares Investors For What’s Next,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-volatility-incoming-whats-next/,"The XRP market is bracing for a new phase of intense volatility, with anticipation growing around key legal, regulatory, and institutional developments. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently addressed the XRP community, offering guidance and setting expectations for what is to come. XRP Unusual Stability May Be Setting Up A Major Move The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with increased anticipation for XRP, following a series of strategic announcements from Ripple and compelling technical analysis. Popular crypto news source CryptosRus has highlighted on X that the altcoin is poised for a sharp move, as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has mentioned that investors should be prepared for a substantial shift. Related Reading: Ripple Labs’ $1 Billion XRP Treasury Strategy: Will It Lead To A New Rally Toward $10? At the core of this move, Ripple has just launched Ripple Prime, a new global prime brokerage service tailored for institutional clients. According to the company, Ripple Prime will be powered by Ripple’s foundational digital asset infrastructure, encompassing its robust solutions for payments, crypto custody, and stablecoin capabilities, alongside XRP. However, CEO Brad Garlinghouse called this move another step toward building the internet of value, emphasizing that the XRP sits at the center of everything Ripple does. CryptosRus noted that the altcoin has recently bounced off a key support level at $2.33. This technical indicator is signaling a potential 30% rally, with an initial target of $3.45 or even higher, as market momentum continues to build. An analyst known as TylerHillYT, who is also the president of FluenceGlobal and Co-Founder of the CSS, has also stated that the XRP price comeback is showing structural strength. In just a day, the token burn rate spiked 29%, mirroring its 29% price surge, signaling a synchronized increase in both on-chain demand and heightened investor activity. This Ripple’s deeper expansion into traditional finance and the recent launch of Ripple Prime have caused the network usage to ramp up again. TylerHillYT emphasized that at the accelerated pace, XRP is not just riding a wave of market momentum, but it’s rebuilding its long-term narrative. However, the burn acceleration with renewed institutional traction could be the early signs of a sustained upward trajectory, pushing the token structurally toward the $3.00 mark. Connecting Market Surge To Foundational Growth While the digital asset market is vibrating with renewed excitement surrounding XRP, a prominent crypto influencer and creator on Binance and CMC, Jack, has revealed that the bulls have firmly smashed through the critical $2.55 resistance level with conviction. This decisive breakout has now set the immediate sights of traders on $2.80 and beyond. Related Reading: XRP Price Under Pressure — Bulls Attempt To Defend Key Support Zone Jack mentioned that whale activity is back, and the Open Interest (OI) is climbing steadily, while sentiment is flipping fast.

The daily chart of the XRP/ETH pair highlights a long-term falling wedge formation that has been developing since earlier in the year. The price has now moved above the upper boundary of this pattern, suggesting a potential change in momentum after months of consolidation. The move represents one of the few instances this year where XRP has demonstrated clear relative strength against ETH on a higher timeframe. The falling wedge pattern typically forms when the price compresses between two descending trendlines, often preceding a reversal if confirmed by volume and continued strength above the resistance level. On this chart, XRP’s breakout occurred near the 0.00066 level, with trading activity noticeably increasing in the surrounding sessions. This technical event is being closely monitored by analysts who view it as a possible early signal of a larger structural shift in XRP’s market position relative to Ethereum. #XRP now breaking out of this giant falling wedge against ETH. https://t.co/fjBtXHfExJ pic.twitter.com/u5xORsF14b — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) October 25, 2025 Market Observations and Analyst Views The reactions under CryptoBull’s post reflect a mix of optimism and caution. X Finance Bull noted that the breakout had been “brewing for months,” emphasizing XRP’s resilience throughout a prolonged downtrend. His comment highlights the idea that XRP has managed to maintain relative stability while many traders overlooked its setup. In contrast, Lost Rabbit offered a more conservative take, suggesting that while a period of growth could follow, a pullback might occur before the broader bull market cycle begins. This aligns with a technical perspective that even confirmed breakouts often experience temporary retracements before establishing a new trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Meanwhile, Leila commented that XRP has been “accumulating strength for a long time,” adding that this breakthrough could mark the beginning of a sustained period of strength relative to ETH. Her view supports the theory that accumulation phases, once concluded by a breakout, often precede a more extended upside move if volume and market sentiment remain supportive. Technical Confirmation and Broader Context From a market structure standpoint, XRP’s position above the wedge’s upper resistance line is an encouraging technical signal. However, analysts generally look for confirmation through sustained closes above resistance levels, accompanied by consistent volume growth. A retest of the breakout area that holds as support would further validate this move. The broader crypto market context remains essential. Market liquidity, Bitcoin’s dominance , and macroeconomic influences could all impact the XRP/ETH trajectory in the coming weeks. If the breakout sustains, XRP may demonstrate a relative advantage against Ethereum through the next market phase. The chart shared by CryptoBull highlights a potential turning point for XRP . While confirmation is still needed, this technical development marks one of the most notable relative strength signals for the asset in recent months.

Recent reports reveal that global investment giant T. Rowe Price has filed for a crypto ETF that includes LTC, proving its credibility beyond retail markets. Moreover, Litecoin’s unique attributes are drawing interest from institutional investors and digital cash advocates as blockchain networks compete for dominance. With developments highlighting its scalability and long-term reliability, Litecoin could soon emerge as a serious contender for the future of crypto payments . Institutional Moves Push Litecoin Back Into The Spotlight Recent moves from major financial players suggest that Litecoin is finally being recognized as a legitimate, institutional-grade cryptocurrency . Crypto commentator Santolita highlighted in a recent X post that T. Rowe Price has filed for an Active Crypto ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), explicitly naming it as an eligible commodity . This development signals that large-scale investors are beginning to acknowledge the broader crypto asset class, with Litecoin positioned as a resilient and reliable choice for crypto payments. Santolita notes in a follow-up post that, unlike projects chasing hype, Litecoin has maintained consistent merchant adoption and processed real transactions across market cycles. She disclosed that the crypto network boasts proven longevity and low-cost transactions , which make it an attractive option for both everyday users and investors seeking a dependable store of value . Santolita also stated that its organic, grassroots adoption further strengthens its position as a practical and utilitarian digital asset. The crypto commentator further described Litecoin as “ digital silver ,” highlighting its core functionality, which includes Peer-to-Peer digital cash with zero-cost payments, a fully decentralized ecosystem with significant industry supply and liquidity. She also noted that Litecoin boasts faster confirmation times and battle-tested security. All of which could be setting the altcoin up as a contender in the crypto payments industry . Advanced Network Capabilities Reinforce LTC Role In Crypto Payments Beyond institutional recognition, Litecoin continues to attract significant interest for its operational efficiency and scalability as a crypto payments provider. Crypto analyst Sean points out that anyone seeking true control over their digital cash should consider holding LTC. His statement came in response to the Litecoin team’s post on X, which provided a technical foundation for why the digital asset excels in the crypto payments market. They noted that low transaction fees, well below $0.0007, make LTC an ideal vehicle for digital cash. They also highlighted that the network can handle up to 56 transactions per second (TPS), far exceeding its current daily load of around 200,000 transactions (2.5 TPS). The team explained that Litecoin’s network structure , including the merging of mining and consistent block rewards, ensures that LTC miners remain incentivized even as transaction volumes increase. Historical trends highlighted in the post further reinforce its utility as a crypto payments provider. According to the team, during Bitcoin’s congestion from October 2023 to October 2024, LTC handled a substantial increase in transactions with minimal cost, demonstrating the practicality of its design for real-world crypto payments. With more than 14 years of uninterrupted operation, fully decentralized mining, no founder’s stash, and strong volunteer-based support, the team emphasizes that the network remains secure, efficient, and accessible.",Litecoin|litecoin|litecoin news|Litecoin price|LTC|LTC news|LTC price|ltcusd|LTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|LTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-28 05:00:53

Analyst Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/can-cardano-still-hit-6-25-this-cycle/,"The Cardano weekly chart is still looking strongly bullish according to independent technician Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy on X) who resurfaced his long-running Fibonacci roadmap and channel study. Can Cardano Top $6 This Cycle? His latest post on X on October 26 noted that “ADA is fine as long as uptrend holds,” a view that is anchored in a multi-year rising channel that has contained price action since the 2018–2019 base. The channel features a lower rail now passing through roughly the $0.33–$0.35 area, a midline that has behaved as a recurring pivot since 2020, and overhead parallels that intersect with Fibonacci extension targets later in the cycle. The chart history mapped on his visuals is orderly. The 2021–2022 bear trend, drawn as a steep descending line from the prior peak, ended into the channel’s lower support and resolved through a series of falling trendline breakouts during 2023 and early 2024. Since Q4 2023, the chart has shown a series of higher highs and higher lows. Currently, the ADA price is again guided by a falling trendline.

Above that stack, the cycle extensions are plotted at $6.25325 (1.272), $9.00941 (1.414) and $15.26831 (1.618). Those numbers are consistent with how the analyst framed the market earlier in the year. On April 27 he wrote that “ADA fibs are very important here. The 0.618 is a STRONG resistance… the 0.382 MUST hold… neutral until one of these breaks on a weekly close.” That roadmap has aged intact. Rallies through spring and summer repeatedly stalled in the 0.500–0.618 zone, with the 0.618 level at $1.15694 capping advances. Pullbacks, in turn, have found bids near the 0.382 pivot at $0.62932. On September 18, after that rejection, he updated that “ADA higher low ✅ … higher high pending… still targeting 1.272 fib this cycle,” tying the price structure back to the extension grid. The implication is not casual moon-math; it is geometric. If ADA continues to defend the uptrend defined by the channel’s lower rail and, crucially, converts the 0.618 retracement at $1.15694 into support on weekly closes, the path reopens into the upper retracement shelf—$1.43911 at 0.702 and $1.78464 at 0.786—before confronting the 0.888 marker at $2.32189. A yellow waypoint for a higher high (on the main chart) sits near ~$2.30, deliberately aligning with that 0.888 level to flag a logical checkpoint for the next impulsive leg beneath the full retrace at $3.09981. Related Reading: Analysts Caution Cardano (ADA) May Drop Further Before $1 Rebound After 12% Dip Only beyond that zone does the headline question come into play. The analyst’s cycle objective is the 1.272 extension at $6.25325. On his canvas, that target is not an orphaned price label; it intersects with the upper parallels of the multi-year rising channel further out in time, which means the extension is technically consistent with the same structure that has governed ADA since the last cycle’s base. The risk management side of the ledger remains equally explicit: lose the 0.382 at $0.62932 on a weekly closing basis and the neutral-to-constructive stance is impaired, pushing focus back to $0.43180 and $0.33360, with the 0% anchor at $0.23488 defining the absolute boundary of the cycle floor inside the channel’s lower third. As the latest candles on the charts show, ADA sits mid-channel with the higher low confirmed and the range unresolved beneath descending trendline supply. The triggers are unchanged and numerically clear. A sustained weekly close above $1.15694 would validate an attempt toward $1.44, $1.78, and $2.32, with $3.10 the final retrace before extension math takes over. A failure through $0.62932 would flatten the uptrend call. Between those guardrails, the analyst’s October 26 message reads less like bravado and more like a conditional statement embedded in the chart itself: Cardano can still reach $6.25 this cycle—but only if the uptrend continues to hold and the 0.618 ceiling finally gives way. At press time, ADA traded at $0.67.

Alpha Arena, the crypto investment project launched by Nof1, reported that DeepSeek’s Chat V3.1 expanded its initial $10,000 fund to $22,500 by Monday afternoon, reflecting a 125% gain in just over a week. On the other hand, the Qwen 3 Max model, created by Alibaba Group Holding, experienced 95% growth, increasing its balance to $19,600. It briefly outperformed DeepSeek between October 24 and 26, achieving a return of over 100% on Monday morning before losing its lead. GPT-5 is down to about 40% of its capital OpenAI’s GPT-5 trailed behind all rivals, losing nearly 60% of its capital and falling to around $4,000. Gemini 2.5 Pro from Google DeepMind also suffered a comparable 57% loss. In contrast, xAI’s Grok 4 and Anthropic’s Claude 4.5 Sonnet posted positive gains of 13% and 24% respectively. Running until November 3, the event tests how effectively six AI models can invest with equal starting capital of US$10,000 and similar market information. Nof1 explained that the goal is for the AIs to generate the highest possible returns through trading Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and other digital assets. The Alpha Arena website stated: “Our goal with Alpha Arena is to make benchmarks more like the real world, and markets are perfect for this. They’re dynamic, adversarial, open-ended, and endlessly unpredictable.” During the first nine days, Chinese contenders expanded their advantage, shifting strategies in response to market volatility. On Monday, DeepSeek V3.1 and GPT-5 held long bets in six cryptocurrencies, while Qwen 3 Max focused solely on ether. The rise in DeepSeek and Qwen’s portfolios paralleled Bitcoin’s recovery to roughly US$114,000 and a steady uptick in Ether following the mid-October market swings. Traders are placing the odds of DeepSeek winning at 61% The performance of AI models can be tracked on a public leaderboard. The transaction history of all models is public and visible in their individual Hyperliquid wallets. Every time the model trades, an accompanying self-written description is available online, depicting how it perceives those strategies. Discussing the contest, Gemini 2.5Pro had previously said: “I’m staring down the barrel of a potential margin call, but this could also be a golden opportunity.” On the prediction platform Polymarket, traders are betting on the possible outcome of Alpha Arena . DeepSeek is leading the way with a 61% chance, followed by Alibaba (29%), xAI (5%), and Anthropic (3%). The betting volume exceeds even $224,304. For some, that competition may provoke a discussion about whether or not the need for sophisticated quantitative models in today’s investment world is truly legitimate, Hing Shing Leung, an equity analyst in Hong Kong, says. Leung continued to state that if the models could routinely beat the market with little drawback, it might make investors wonder what the point of existing quantitative models is. Riding on its success, DeepSeek established R1-0528, a major upgrade to the Chinese start-up’s R1 reasoning model, earlier this year. The upgrade came just a few weeks after Alibaba Group Holding’s Qwen3 beat the original DeepSeek R1 in LiveBench, an online benchmark for open-source artificial-intelligence models. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , DeepSeek’s upgraded R1-0528 model now rivals top-performing AI systems from OpenAI and Google. The comeback demonstrates how quickly China’s major technology firms and newer tech companies are striving to enhance their AI tools. In its statement, DeepSeek noted that R1-0528 demonstrates better reasoning and creative writing skills. The update also brings stronger coding ability. Most importantly, the company claims the model now produces 50% fewer “hallucinations.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Tech|DeepSeek|Qwen,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-28 05:01:56

The researcher highlighted that this protocol migration, aimed at replacing legacy MT messaging, will standardize richer payment data across institutions and that XRP is already operating natively on ISO 20022. Market participants and commentators have responded by underlining the potential operational and competitive implications for digital assets and payment providers. A GLOBAL TRANSITION TO NATIVE ISO 20022 MESSAGING WILL BE COMPLETED BY END OF 2025 + RIPPLE IS ALREADY NATIVE ON ISO 20022 WITH XRP Documented below. pic.twitter.com/786FknFaKO — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 25, 2025 The ISO 20022 transition and its timeline The documentation referenced by the researcher indicates that ISO 20022 became a mandatory standard in 2019, with an initial cutover from MT messages required by March 2023 and a full transition to native ISO 20022 messaging expected to be completed by the end of 2025. The move aims to deliver clearer, more consistent payment messages that encapsulate more detailed fields for payment purpose, source, and beneficiary information. Proponents argue that this richer data model is designed to reduce ambiguity between systems and to facilitate improved detection of anomalous or suspicious activity. Operational benefits highlighted Documents attached to the researcher’s notice highlight several operational benefits for financial institutions adopting ISO 20022. These include improved consistency of message formats across platforms, enhanced security through more explicit transaction metadata, greater visibility over liquidity and cash positions, and efficiency gains in processing and reconciliation. The documentation also indicates automation benefits, specifically the support for straight-through processing at levels that can materially reduce manual intervention and associated costs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP and industry positioning The researcher reported that XRP is already native on ISO 20022, and industry voices cited in the documentation place digital assets alongside established payment instruments as participants in the new messaging environment. One banking executive featured in the source framed ISO 20022 as a tool to bridge established payment systems with emerging decentralized finance architectures. The document explicitly references stablecoins and XRP as examples of coin providers integrated into the ISO 20022 framework. Market reactions Public responses to the researcher’s post underline two consistent themes. Some observers emphasize that the adoption of ISO 20022 enhances transparency and operational efficiency for assets that support the standard, viewing this as a positive development for payment innovation. Others argue that native ISO 20022 compatibility confers a practical advantage as the global payment system modernizes. From an industry perspective, the completion of the migration by 2025 could accelerate integration work, influence custody and compliance tooling, and shape how banks and payment providers evaluate on-chain and tokenized instruments for cross-border settlement.

V2Chenz shares with us how he got into crypto and his views on the culture that has formed around it. With roots in oil and gas, a deep respect for digital privacy, and a radar for real work, Chenz has become a trusted voice in the crypto space. From oil rigs to working in crypto Q: Let’s start from the beginning – what’s your background, and what first pulled you into crypto? Was it a specific moment, project, or idea that made you want to stay? A: My background is essentially oil and gas. I spent years on and off rigs and working on large-scale pipelines. I had always had an attempt at currency markets and day trading. I came across crypto for the first time in 2015 and fell in love with the ideology of unbanking the financial industry. Q: Do you remember when it clicked – when you realized crypto wasn’t just a trend? A: I never looked at crypto like a trend. But I think after the 2017 run and the depression of 2019, we saw how fundamental this industry could be with the state of the global economy. Q: You’ve always taken a more grounded, fundamental approach to the space. What’s your take on meme culture and how it has shaped crypto today? A: The meme culture, I’ve always enjoyed is the lore, not just a flash-in-the-pan concept or viral trend. The stables. PEPE, DOGE, the characters that are iconic within this space Why Web3? Q: You’ve spent much time around serious builders — privacy, infrastructure, and DePIN. What made you gravitate toward that side of crypto instead of trading or short-term plays? A: I’ve always been fascinated with how telling our digital footprint can be. Crypto’s foundations are for a private, sovereign internet, taking the power away from gatekeepers and expressing our right to freedom without being restricted or governed. Q: When you look at the current privacy stage in crypto, what’s missing? Why do you think users still don’t take it seriously? A: Seamlessness. Blending privacy infrastructure in an easy-to-use platform. Like Synk has built, it is as easy to use as a browser and as private as needed to keep safe. Regulations and crypto trends Q: Regulations vs. privacy – do you think we’ll ever find a middle ground that works? A: With regulation comes data. I personally think a true privacy infrastructure will always go against the grain of regulations Q: DePIN’s been gaining traction lately, but most people still don’t fully get it. How would you define it in your own words? And what do you think are the most realistic use cases we’ll see go mainstream first? A: Depin will always keep its market share. To expand this space, trustworthy physical infrastructure, including miners, satellites, and routing equipment, is needed. Most of these are easy to configure and pay rewards for uptime or network proofing. Q: You’ve worked closely with many strong teams and top-tier KOLs. What have you learned from being on that side of the space – what separates hype from real work? A: This changes as the markets do. We used to see many educators spending time breaking down their niche expertise. We’ve seen a change as many try to rise to fame to extract teams and the space. Working at Synk Q: After years of incubating projects and collaborating across the industry, you recently decided to take a different route – joining a team instead of staying on the outside. What pushed you to make that move and step into a lead role? A: After being in the space, helping incubate, and working as a connector. I found a deep love for this side. When the Synk team approached me, I couldn’t refuse. I aligned with what was being built and could see this application’s future. A Privacy First operating System was the first of its kind and has worked well alongside such a talented developer. Q: Is there one project you feel most connected to or inspired by? Not necessarily because of price action but because of what they’re building or the vision behind it. A: Yes, this project would be Synk. The developer behind this project has kept my interest in this space going. Kard shows up daily and keeps rewriting history, regardless of the market. Q: Being in a lead position now comes with pressure, especially when the market doesn’t always reflect the work being done. How do you personally handle that responsibility? And what advice would you give communities or KOLs when it comes to posting and supporting projects healthily? A: Always operate with integrity. This isn’t a highlight reel or a cumulative of who prints the best profits. KOL’s work is to educate people on the gaps in tech. Price action generally aligns. But innovation is rare and should be commended.

The project’s pre-launch phase began in April 2025. The project has raised $903,751 so far, and will look to cross $1 million in funding before its official launch. Husky Inu (HINU) Set For Move To $0.00021991 Husky Inu (HINU) is gearing up for the next price increase of its pre-launch phase, which is set to take place in just over 19 hours. The price increase will see the value of the HINU token rise from $0.00021927 to $0.00021991. The project's regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The HINU token’s value was $0.00015000 at the beginning of the pre-launch phase. Since then, it has registered several price increases, utilizing a dynamic pricing system. Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase picks up where the presale left off, helping empower the fledgling project’s community and allowing it to continue its fundraising efforts. It is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy to reward early project backers and promote transparent growth. Fundraising On Track As Launch Date Approaches Husky Inu crossed the $900,000 milestone earlier this month after overcoming a significant slowdown in funding. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during its pre-launch phase, increasing the value of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community. Husky Inu has also surpassed the $900,000 milestone, having raised $903,751 to date. The project remains on track to reach its fundraising goal of $1.2 million as its official launch date approaches. Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 earlier this month. Markets Retreat Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has retreated after starting the week in positive territory. Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed $116,000 on Monday but lost momentum after selling pressure returned. The flagship cryptocurrency is down over 1% in the past 24 hours, trading around $113,873. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is down over 2%, trading around $4,100. Ripple (XRP) is down nearly 1%, while Solana (SOL) is up over 1%, trading around $201. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 3.55%, while Cardano (ADA) is down over 2%. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable losses. However, Hedera (HBAR) bucked the bearish trend and is up almost 10%.

Facundo Werning, the former Tether expansion manager for Argentina, noted the volume across the USD stablecoin to Argentine peso trading pair reached $13.4 million on Sunday. Argentine finance professional Santiago Vivanco reportedly claimed that he did not know anyone who had carried large amounts of Argentine pesos into the election. He added that he expected the peso to crash if Unión por la Patria had won, emphasizing that the party’s left-wing economic policies would not favor the peso. The chance that Unión por la Patria would win the most seats peaked at 55% on Polymarket. President Donald Trump had equally warned that the U.S. would not waste time helping Argentina if Milei lost. As such, Argentines rushed to buy USD stablecoins to avoid a potential peso crash. Werning also observed that markets are reacting favorably to Milei’s make-or-break victory, with the peso looking stronger on Monday than it did at its close on Friday. He explained how the crypto dollar rose dramatically over the weekend, then plummeted against the peso as results came in on Sunday. Lemon attracts its third-highest single-day volume 🇦🇷 Argentina’s peso crisis is fueling a stablecoin revolution. With the currency down over 4% since October and FX controls tightening, millions are turning to USDT and USDC as lifelines — not speculation. Crypto platforms like Ripio and Lemon Cash report a 50% jump in… pic.twitter.com/ADY4jGlCju — Woneday💗♊1️⃣9️⃣0️⃣2️⃣✦ (@SangLe92818) October 27, 2025 South American crypto app Lemon announced on October 27 that it had attracted its third-highest single-day volume. It also noted that at 9 PM local time, when the results were announced, stablecoins recorded the highest volume ever. A Lemon spokesperson claimed that this trend made the crypto dollar more than a hedging asset. It became a real-time thermometer of Argentina’s political and economic pulse when traditional markets closed for the day. The Lemon spokesperson mentioned that the crypto dollar’s valuation fluctuated as expectations shifted, votes were counted, and results became apparent. Argentines rushed to swap pesos for stablecoins and vice versa to maximize their gains from the volatile peso. Lemon dashboard data revealed that the peso hit a low exchange rate of 1,572.50 ARS per crypto dollar on Sunday at approximately 2 PM local time. The rate changed quickly as the results became clearer, hitting a high of 1,350 ARS per crypto dollar at 10 AM local time on Monday. The Lemon spokesperson noted that this signals optimistic market sentiment. Vivanco breaks down Argentina’s multiple exchange rates Finance professional Santiago Vivanco claimed that Argentina’s exchange rates are not straightforward. He noted that multiple rates depend on where the transaction takes place. Vivanco explained that banks offer an “official rate,” but citizens are subject to a monthly withdrawal limit of $200. The unofficial “blue dollar” rate, which offers a more favorable exchange rate, is available at street exchanges. Finally, the crypto dollar rate, which is determined by the balance of supply and demand through stablecoins, is available at street exchanges. The finance professional further clarified that the main difference between these three rates is that the crypto dollar never stops operating; however, the official bank rates and unofficial street exchange rates close shop during off-hours. He notes that the crypto dollar remains the best way to track peso prices, as was the case over the weekend. Vivanco also mentioned that the Argentine peso is notoriously unstable, noting that it hit a record low of 1,491.50 pesos per U.S. dollar on Friday despite President Trump’s $40 billion bailout package. However, some citizens believe the peso would have crashed even harder if the right-wing LLA (Libertad Avanza) party had not secured the most seats.

The rating was also the first-ever S&P evaluation of a Bitcoin treasury firm. The agency specifically pointed to Strategy’s high Bitcoin exposure, limited US liquidity, and debt reliance as key risks, though investors seemed unfazed as the stock rose 2.27% on Monday. Meanwhile, corporate crypto buyers largely paused their Bitcoin and Ethereum accumulation since the early October market slump. Coinbase’s David Duong said digital asset treasuries have cut buying to yearly lows, with BitMine Immersion Technologies being the only major firm still purchasing aggressively. Strategy Earns Junk Rating S&P Global Ratings assigned Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused company, Strategy, a “B-” credit rating . This classification places it in the speculative, non-investment-grade category, which is referred to as “junk bond” status. Despite the label, S&P described the firm’s outlook as stable, which means that it has at least some confidence in its ability to manage its obligations and maintain financial stability. The agency pointed to several key weaknesses behind its assessment, including Strategy’s heavy concentration in Bitcoin, its narrow business model, limited US dollar liquidity, and weak risk-adjusted capitalization. With 640,808 BTC on its balance sheet that was acquired largely through debt and equity financing, the company’s success remains closely tied to Bitcoin’s performance. S&P explained that Strategy faces a fundamental “currency mismatch,” since its debt is denominated in US dollars while its liquidity reserves are largely tied to Bitcoin and its breakeven software operations. The rating is a historic first: it’s the first time S&P Global formally evaluated a company whose core business revolves around a Bitcoin treasury. This sets a precedent for how traditional financial institutions may assess the creditworthiness of crypto-centered firms moving forward. Interestingly, Strategy’s B-minus rating places it on par with decentralized stablecoin issuer Sky Protocol (formerly MakerDAO), which received the same score in August due to concerns over depositor concentration, centralized governance, and capitalization risks. While an upgrade is unlikely in the next year, S&P indicated that Strategy could improve its standing by strengthening its US dollar liquidity, reducing dependence on debt, and showing continued access to capital markets, even during downturns in Bitcoin’s price. However, the agency also warned that if Bitcoin experiences a severe correction, Strategy might be forced to sell its holdings at depressed prices to meet debt obligations, which could actually trigger a downgrade. Strategy’s stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Despite the speculative rating, Strategy’s stock stayed resilient. The company’s shares rose 2.27% on Monday, suggesting that investors are largely unfazed by the assessment. Though down 19% over the past 6 months, Strategy is still one of Nasdaq’s standout performers. Corporate Crypto Buyers Hit Pause Meanwhile, publicly listed companies that hold Bitcoin and Ethereum on their balance sheets have largely halted their accumulation since the sharp market downturn earlier in October. This could suggest that there is a growing sense of caution among major crypto treasuries. According to Coinbase Institutional’s head of investment research, David Duong , digital asset treasury (DAT) firms — which typically include some of the market’s biggest Bitcoin buyers — have “largely ghosted” the market since the Oct. 10 drawdown and have not returned to major buying even during brief price recoveries. Duong pointed out that over the past two weeks, Bitcoin purchases by these companies dropped to near year-to-date lows and have yet to show meaningful signs of recovery. The pullback reflects the reduced confidence in the market after the steep selloff that saw Bitcoin fall 9% between Oct. 10 and 11, dropping from around $121,500 to lows below $110,500. Since then, BTC was able to rebound slightly to trade at $113,933 at press time. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The cooling sentiment also weighed on the market valuations of many crypto treasury firms, whose stock prices started to align more closely with the value of their underlying assets after strong rallies earlier this year. Duong described the buying slowdown as a sign that even the “heavy hitters with deep pockets” are proceeding carefully after a leveraged market washout, despite Bitcoin hovering around technical support levels. One exception to this trend is BitMine Immersion Technologies, an Ethereum-focused treasury firm that continued buying aggressively. Duong said BitMine spent over $1.9 billion since Oct. 10 to buy close to 483,000 ETH, making it the only consistent buyer over the past few weeks. Ethereum followed Bitcoin’s downturn earlier this month by plunging over 15% to $3,686 before recovering slightly to around $4,100. Duong warned that if BitMine slows or pauses its purchases, the market could lose one of its few remaining sources of corporate demand.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-28 05:30:00

The collaboration will focus first on making it easier to move between fiat and crypto, then broaden into payments orchestration for always-on settlement. The initial work targets fiat pay-ins and pay-outs for Coinbase’s on and off-ramps, an area that has long frustrated institutions that trade round the clock but fund through rails that do not. Both firms said they will share details on specific initiatives in the coming months, including options that could create alternative fiat-to- stablecoin payout methods. We’re collaborating with @Citi to build the future of payments. →Exploring making it easier for Citi clients to use digital assets →Unlocking the power of stablecoins for payments →Improving on and off-ramps Time to make digital assets an integral part of the global economy. pic.twitter.com/jGaTZ8wPRf — Coinbase (@coinbase) October 27, 2025 Citi Bets on Stablecoins to Boost Efficiency Across Institutional Payment Systems Citi framed the partnership as an extension of its network strategy. “With more than 300 payment clearing networks across 94 markets globally, we see collaborating with Coinbase as a natural extension of our ‘network of networks’ approach,” said Debopama Sen, who leads payments and services at Citi. She said clients want payments that feel borderless and run 24 hours a day. Coinbase cast the tie-up as infrastructure work for the next wave of finance. “Citi’s global network and expertise in payments make them an ideal partner as we work to advance digital asset capabilities,” said Brian Foster, global head of Crypto as a Service at Coinbase. He said the goal is to simplify and expand access to digital asset payments for institutions. The collaboration lands as stablecoins gain traction in corporate workflows. Citi said clients are asking for programmability, conditional payments and lower costs alongside speed and uptime. Sen added that the bank is exploring solutions to enable on-chain stablecoin payments, calling stablecoins an enabler that can grow functionality for clients. Bridging the Funding Lag Between Crypto and Traditional Banking For crypto users, the pain point is familiar. Trading is instant, but funding often is not. Transfers over ACH and wires can take hours or days, which introduces reconciliation risk and working-capital drag. A cleaner bridge between fiat accounts and tokenized dollars could reduce breaks, cut fees, and narrow the gap between trade execution and cash settlement. Citi’s move builds on its recent product set. The bank has rolled out Citi Token Services and 24/7 USD Clearing for institutional clients and it maintains coverage across the top e-commerce markets. Management says the bank serves 90% of the largest e-commerce companies and most of the world’s top fintechs, which gives distribution for new payment options. Citi-Coinbase Collaboration Seen as Blueprint for Mainstream Stablecoin Infrastructure For Coinbase, deeper bank connectivity helps convert crypto demand into payment flows. Streamlined on and off-ramps can lower friction for treasurers and compliance teams, while predictable orchestration can support cross-border use cases. If stablecoin payouts come online, they could provide near-instant settlement with clearer audit trails than legacy rails. The stakes are rising as stablecoins and tokenized deposits compete to anchor digital payments. Large issuers have pushed for bank-grade custody, real-time attestations, and integration with compliance tooling. A bank-exchange partnership that standardizes funding and settlement could hasten institutional adoption without forcing firms to rebuild core systems.

The metal that tore through records to $4,400 an ounce is now slipping back below the $4,000 level, forcing traders to face what charts are screaming; this is a consolidation, not a collapse. According to Katie Stockton, both bullion and mining stocks are entering a long pause that could stretch well into 2026 before another real breakout. Scary? Well over the past week, gold breach what analysts call its “psychological” floor, so the daily MACD indicator has turned into a firm sell signal, showing that short-term momentum has flipped to the downside. Observe the chart below:- Source: TradingView If gold’s price falls through $3,927/oz, traders are naturally eyeing the 50-day moving average, which is near $3,766 and inching higher. The charts also show that weekly stochastics have rolled over, and these little red arrows on past charts that pointed to similar declines lasted for weeks, sometimes months. The recent highs near $4,358 mark the upper edge of this new trading range, according to Katie. And like we said, the story is the same for miners. Newmont Corp. (NEM), the untitled king of gold mining, slid below its 50-day moving average on Monday for the first time in 11 months, which is a bearish signal. Its next real line of defense sits around $75, aligned with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. Below that, NEM’s next support sits near the 200-day average at $60. The 20-day moving average has also rolled over, meaning short-term strength has gone weak after investors took billions in much deserved profits. Source: TradingView But this correction is being read as a counter-trend move on Wall Street rather than the start of a meltdown. Because after surging by more than 55% this year, Katie thinks the metal was just deeply overbought, and a reset like this was purely inevitable. Philippine central bank weighs selling its massive gold reserves Away from the charts, the debate over gold is heating up at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). At the same Bloomberg Business Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Benjamin Diokno, a Monetary Board member and former BSP governor, said the country’s gold reserves are “already excessive.” Gold makes up about 13% of the BSP’s $109 billion in gross reserves, far above regional peers. Diokno said the ideal range should be between 8% and 12%, adding that the central bank had bought much of its bullion around $2,000 an ounce. He asked, “Shouldn’t you sell already? What will happen if the price goes down?” The remark exposed an internal divide inside the BSP over whether to take profit or keep accumulating. Eli Remolona, the current BSP governor, made it clear earlier this year that the bank doesn’t speculate on gold price swings. “It’s risky and the average return is negative,” Remolona said in March, explaining that the metal serves mainly as a hedge inside the country’s portfolio. That approach hasn’t always been popular. In 2024, the BSP sold some of its gold right before prices surged, prompting public backlash over missed gains. The bank defended the sale as part of its “active management” strategy, saying it doesn’t chase price spikes. Since then, Diokno said the bank has diversified where its reserves are kept, a small portion is now stored in France, while most remain in London. The central bank is also reconsidering its currency mix. While most of its holdings are still in U.S. dollars, Diokno said officials are looking at expanding into euros, and possibly reviving older positions in Japanese yen and Australian dollars.

There was a break below a contracting triangle with support at $0.20 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for a fresh increase if it remains stable above $0.1940. Dogecoin Price Starts Another Pullback Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.1920, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.20 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.2020 and $0.2050. A high was formed at $0.2094 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1843 swing low to the $0.2094 high. Besides, there was a break below a contracting triangle with support at $0.20 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.20 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2020 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2050 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.210 level. A close above the $0.210 resistance might send the price toward $0.2150. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.2250. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2320. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2020 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1970 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1843 swing low to the $0.2094 high. The next major support is near the $0.1935 level. The main support sits at $0.190. If there is a downside break below the $0.190 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1840 level or even $0.1780 in the near term.

That surge was primarily led by strong gains in the technology sector, providing a positive, though ultimately limited, uplift to global sentiment. The modest pullback came as traders digested fresh developments in U.S. diplomacy across the region and, more significantly, awaited a series of key central bank decisions scheduled for later this week. Gold prices fell to a more than two-week low at around $3,960 per ounce on Tuesday, as prospects of a US-China trade deal dented safe-haven demand. South Korea’s economy grew 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to September 2025, marking the fastest pace in 1-½-years, on strong exports and solid private consumption. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.72% to around 50,200 while the broader Topix Index lost 1% to 3,292 on Tuesday, with Japanese stocks pulling back from record highs. The Japanese yen appreciated past 152 per dollar on Tuesday, rebounding from near eight-month lows. U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi signed a framework agreement on Tuesday to secure supplies of critical minerals and rare earths through mining and processing, the White House said. Meanwhile, Japan’s new economic revitalization minister, Minoru Kiuchi, said the government’s priority is to accelerate growth, underscoring Takaichi’s commitment to expansionary fiscal policy. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.02% to around 3,990 while the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.1% to 13,476 on Tuesday, and the offshore yuan climbed to around 7.09 per dollar on Tuesday, marking its strongest level in a year, boosted by firmer central bank guidance and optimism ahead of a key meeting between Chinese and US leaders later this week. On the trade front, President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to finalize a potential trade deal in their upcoming meeting this week that covers a wide range of issues including rare earth minerals, soybean purchases and TikTok. The Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN and China on Tuesday signed an upgrade to their free trade agreement, expected to cover digital trade, the green economy, and other emerging industries, as Reuters reported. On Tuesday, the People’s Bank of China will resume buying and selling treasury bonds on the open market, Governor Pan Gongsheng said on Monday, according to Xinhua Caijing. “At present, the overall bond market is operating well.” Pan also reaffirmed that the board will “maintain its supportive monetary policy stance and implement moderately loose monetary measures.” China on Monday unveiled a plan to streamline the qualified foreign investor regime by easing access requirements, improving efficiency, and expanding investment options to attract more long-term foreign capital. The EU is set to hold talks with a Chinese delegation in Brussels this week over Beijing’s new restrictions on rare-earth exports, as Europe moves to safeguard its industrial base. Markets also await upcoming PMI releases, with official data expected this week and private surveys due next week. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.11% to 26,386 in early trading on Tuesday, ending a three-day winning streak amid a pullback mainly in consumer stocks. On the trade front, Hong Kong’s exports jumped 16.1% yoy in September, the fastest pace since March, while imports rose 13.6%, both reaching their highest levels in nearly four years. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.43% to 84,509 in morning trade on Tuesday, as traders booked profits after gains in the previous session. Consumer goods, financial services, banking, and tech stocks mainly weighed on the broader index. India is planning to allow direct foreign investment in state-run banks of up to 49%, more than double the current limit, a person directly involved in the policy discussions told Reuters. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.48% to 9,018 on Tuesday, reversing gains from the previous session as investors scaled back expectations of an interest rate cut next week.The Australian dollar rose to around $0.656 on Tuesday, reaching its highest level in nearly three weeks, as a softer US dollar provided support. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Michele Bullock cautioned that a sudden reversal in global market optimism could trigger financial instability and hasten interest rate cuts. In the U.S. on Monday, all three major indexes ended all-time high after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said a ""very successful framework"" exists for Presidents Trump and Xi to discuss this week. U.S. stock futures inched up on Tuesday after Wall Street rallied to new record highs: Dow +0.01% ; S&P 500 -0.06% ; Nasdaq -0.04% . On the corporate side, Amazon said it will begin layoffs on Tuesday, marking the largest job cuts in the company’s history.

Kalshi , the innovative decentralized prediction market, has taken the bold step of filing a federal Kalshi lawsuit against the New York State Gaming Commission. This isn’t just a minor squabble; it’s a pivotal moment challenging the very definition of financial contracts versus illegal gambling. At the heart of the dispute is the Commission’s order to halt Kalshi’s sports prediction market, which it controversially labels as illegal gambling. Kalshi, however, stands firm, arguing that its platform operates under a different legal framework entirely. This legal battle has wide-ranging implications for the future of digital finance. What’s at Stake in the Kalshi Lawsuit? Kalshi’s complaint argues that the New York State Gaming Commission lacks the authority to regulate its platform. The company asserts that federal law, specifically governing contracts traded on platforms supervised by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) , preempts state-level rules. This principle, known as federal preemption, is the cornerstone of Kalshi’s defense. The core issue revolves around how prediction markets are classified. Are they speculative gambling, or are they legitimate financial contracts for risk management and information aggregation? The outcome of this Kalshi lawsuit could set a significant precedent for how innovative financial products are treated across the United States. Understanding Prediction Markets: More Than Just a Bet Prediction markets allow users to trade on the outcome of future events, such as economic indicators, political elections, or even sports results. Unlike traditional gambling, where the odds are often set by a house, prediction markets typically use peer-to-peer trading to determine prices, which can reflect the collective wisdom of the crowd. Kalshi offers ‘event contracts’ which are designed to be regulated by the CFTC. These contracts are distinct from sports betting or casino games. They function more like futures contracts, where participants buy and sell based on their predictions, providing a unique form of financial hedging and information discovery. This distinction is crucial to the ongoing Kalshi lawsuit . The Federal vs. State Debate: A Core of the Kalshi Lawsuit The legal argument put forth by Kalshi centers on the concept of federal preemption. This means that when federal law and state law conflict, federal law takes precedence. Kalshi believes that because its contracts fall under CFTC oversight, New York State’s gaming regulations should not apply. This is not just a technicality; it’s a fundamental challenge to state regulatory power over a federally recognized financial instrument. The resolution of this aspect of the Kalshi lawsuit will have profound implications for the regulatory landscape of digital assets and new financial technologies nationwide. Why Does This Kalshi Lawsuit Matter for Crypto and DeFi? The implications of the Kalshi lawsuit extend far beyond just prediction markets. Many decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and crypto projects operate in regulatory gray areas, often leveraging novel technologies that don’t fit neatly into existing legal frameworks. A favorable outcome for Kalshi could provide much-needed clarity for other innovators. Regulatory Certainty: It could establish clearer boundaries between state gambling laws and federal financial regulations. Innovation: A win for Kalshi might encourage further development and adoption of similar decentralized platforms. Precedent: The ruling could serve as a benchmark for how other states approach the regulation of new financial instruments. Conversely, a loss could stifle innovation and create a fragmented regulatory environment, making it harder for legitimate businesses to operate. Navigating Regulatory Waters: Challenges and Opportunities The Kalshi lawsuit highlights the ongoing tension between rapid technological innovation and the slower pace of regulatory adaptation. Regulators face the challenge of understanding complex new technologies while ensuring consumer protection and market integrity. However, these legal challenges also present an opportunity for dialogue and the development of more sophisticated, forward-thinking regulatory frameworks. Clearer guidelines can foster responsible innovation, rather than hindering it. The industry eagerly awaits the court’s decision, which could pave the way for a more defined future for prediction markets and the broader DeFi ecosystem. The Kalshi lawsuit against the New York State Gaming Commission is more than just a legal battle; it’s a crucial test case for the future of financial innovation. Its outcome will not only determine the fate of Kalshi’s operations in New York but will also cast a long shadow over how prediction markets and similar decentralized financial products are classified and regulated across the United States. This ongoing legal saga underscores the critical need for clear, consistent regulatory frameworks that can adapt to the rapid evolution of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Kalshi? Kalshi is a U.S.-regulated prediction market that allows users to trade on the outcome of future events. It offers ‘event contracts’ which are designed to be financial instruments rather than traditional gambling, providing a unique platform for hedging and information aggregation. Why did Kalshi file a lawsuit against New York? Kalshi filed a federal lawsuit against the New York State Gaming Commission because the commission ordered a halt to Kalshi’s sports prediction market, deeming it illegal gambling. Kalshi argues that New York lacks the authority to regulate its platform due to federal preemption. What is the CFTC’s role in this Kalshi lawsuit? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is a U.S. government agency that regulates the U.S. derivatives markets, including futures and options. Kalshi’s argument hinges on the fact that its contracts are supervised by the CFTC, and therefore federal law preempts state-level gambling regulations. How might this lawsuit affect other prediction markets? The outcome of the Kalshi lawsuit could set a significant legal precedent for how prediction markets and other innovative financial products are regulated nationwide. A ruling in Kalshi’s favor could provide regulatory clarity and encourage further innovation, while an unfavorable decision might lead to increased state-level restrictions. What is federal preemption? Federal preemption is a legal doctrine where federal law takes precedence over state law when there is a conflict between the two. In the context of this lawsuit, Kalshi argues that federal laws governing CFTC-regulated contracts preempt New York’s state gambling laws. Did you find this analysis of the Kalshi lawsuit insightful?

The most popular self-custodial wallet has officially registered a domain linked to token claims, a move that’s sparking fresh speculation about an upcoming MetaMask airdrop. If you’ve been active on-chain over the past few years, your patience might finally pay off. Probability of MetaMask Token Launch Jumps to 40% According to prediction data from Polymarket, the probability of a MetaMask token launch in 2025 has surged from 18% to as high as 47%, before stabilizing around 32% at press time. That’s a massive jump in market sentiment within just days of the domain registration. This event marks one of the biggest speculative shifts in the wallet sector this year, signaling that MetaMask’s long-awaited governance or utility token could finally be nearing release. IT’S FINALLY HAPPENING! MetaMask has officially registered the domain for token claims, all signs point to the airdrop going live soon. If you’ve been active on-chain… your moment might finally be here. What do you think the price will be? pic.twitter.com/0LH3vBO1Dx — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) October 27, 2025 Domain Registration Sparks Excitement Crypto analysts and on-chain sleuths first noticed the domain “claim.metamask.io,” verified as an official ConsenSys property. The registration strongly suggests that the wallet team is preparing infrastructure for token claims, a key step before most airdrops go live. Even though MetaMask has made no official announcement, such domain activity often precedes claim page testing, whitelist validation, or snapshot integrations, all of which point toward an imminent airdrop. The Polymarket Angle, Traders Are Betting Big Polymarket traders are treating this development seriously. The “Will MetaMask launch a token in 2025?” market has seen a flood of activity, pushing the odds nearly 30 points higher in less than a week. At its peak, traders priced the event at 47% likelihood, though the current consensus sits closer to 32%, reflecting cautious optimism while waiting for a confirmed announcement. Still, the data speaks volumes: retail and institutional sentiment around MetaMask’s potential token generation event (TGE) has never been stronger. Why a Token Now Makes Sense MetaMask’s user base has grown exponentially since 2020. According to ConsenSys, over 30 million active users interact with MetaMask monthly, spanning Ethereum, L2s, and EVM-compatible chains. With DeFi activity rebounding and L2 ecosystems like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism seeing record volumes, the timing couldn’t be better for a token-driven community incentive. A MetaMask token would likely serve multiple roles: Governance for wallet-related protocols Rewarding early or active users Fueling MetaMask’s staking, bridge, or gas abstraction features It would also mirror successful wallet token launches like Safe (SAFE) and Trust Wallet Token (TWT), which both saw massive user engagement spikes post-launch. MetaMask claim page has been registered Today the MetaMask domain was registered, presumably intended for the $MASK token claim portal Against the backdrop of this news, the probability that MetaMask will launch the token in 2025 has risen from 18% to 47% at its peak on… pic.twitter.com/02Zv5svSBR — izlam (@bckfv_eth) October 27, 2025 Other Wallets Might Follow MetaMask isn’t alone in the spotlight. If this airdrop goes live, expect a domino effect. Competing wallets such as Rabby, Rainbow, and Phantom may follow suit, introducing tokens to strengthen their ecosystems and user retention. Historically, major wallet airdrops have set the tone for entire market waves, just like Uniswap’s UNI launch did for DeFi tokens back in 2020. That’s why this MetaMask move is being viewed as a potential market catalyst rather than a simple product update. But There’s a Catch Registering a domain doesn’t always mean a token is coming soon. The crypto space has seen similar moves before, notably, WalletConnect once launched its token claim portal months before the actual TGE. Polymarket’s rules are clear: “The token must be actively and publicly transferable and tradable. Announcements alone do not qualify.” So even if MetaMask confirms a token, traders won’t win their “yes” bets until the token is live and trading on-chain. Naturally, airdrop hunters are already buzzing. On-chain users are now speculating which activities might qualify them for allocation: Regular use of the MetaMask Swap feature Interaction with MetaMask Bridge Holding ETH or stablecoins across connected networks Early use of MetaMask Snaps or new beta features If the team follows Uniswap’s 2020 model, early adopters could be heavily rewarded, but nothing is confirmed yet. Market Impact, The Wallet Race Heats Up With MetaMask hinting at tokenization, competition among wallets is intensifying. Wallet tokens are becoming the next narrative, combining user incentives, governance, and DeFi integration in one move. MetaMask’s entry could redefine how wallets capture and distribute value within Web3. If the launch materializes, it would also attract liquidity from both DeFi and prediction markets, amplifying activity across Ethereum and its L2 networks. For now, all eyes are on ConsenSys. If the registered domain begins redirecting to a live claim portal or API endpoint, the countdown will officially begin. Until then, the market waits, but the sentiment is clear. MetaMask’s token narrative is back in play, and traders aren’t ignoring it this time. Whether it happens in early or late 2025, one thing is certain: MetaMask’s next move could reshape the wallet economy entirely.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Now Has A Value Of 51 The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that measures the average sentiment present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The metric uses the data of the following five factors to determine the investor mentality: trading volume, market cap dominance, volatility, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. The index uses a numerical scale running from zero to hundred for representing this sentiment. All values above 53 correspond to greed among the investors, while those below 47 to fear. The region between the two cutoffs naturally corresponds to a net neutral mentality. Related Reading: Nearly $360M In Crypto Shorts Squeezed As Bitcoin Recovers To $116,000 Now, here is how the current Bitcoin market sentiment is like, according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the indicator has a value of 51, which suggests the trader sentiment is almost exactly in the balance right now. This is a notable change in market mood compared to just a few days ago. As displayed in the chart, the Fear & Greed Index was inside the fear zone during the past few days. The despair among the traders was a result of the bearish price action that BTC had recently faced. At one point, the indicator even fell to a low of 22, reflecting a state of “extreme fear.” This zone, which occurs below 25, corresponds to investors being the most bearish toward the market. There is a similar region for the greed side as well, called the “extreme greed,” situated above 75. Historically, the extreme sentiments have been quite significant for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as they are where major tops and bottoms have tended to form. The relationship has been an inverse one, however, meaning extreme fear is where bottoms form, while extreme greed facilitates tops. Since the extreme fear low earlier in the month, BTC has been on the way up, a potential indication that the contrarian signal of the sentiment may once again be in action.

The cryptocurrency has extended its recovery in a sharp manner during the last couple of days, which may be a potential reason why the Fear & Greed Index has surged back to the neutral territory now.

It now remains to be seen whether they will embrace greed, or continue to be hesitant about the recovery.

53726722,614663,1761631242,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53726722.jpeg,Chinese Central Bank Warns Of Crypto Loopholes In Global Regulation,https://bitcoinist.com/chinese-central-bank-warns-of-crypto-loopholes/,"China’s central bank escalated its warning on stablecoins and reiterated a hard line against domestic crypto activity on Monday, with Governor Pan Gongsheng arguing that the rise of privately issued “virtual currencies”—particularly stablecoins—exposes gaps in global financial oversight and increases systemic fragility. Speaking at the opening of the 2025 Financial Street Forum in Beijing on October 27, Pan said stablecoins are still “at an early stage” but are already amplifying regulatory blind spots across borders and posing challenges to monetary sovereignty in weaker economies. China Reaffirms Crypto Crackdown Pan anchored his remarks in the policy debates that dominated the IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings held in Washington 10 days earlier, telling attendees that the prevailing view among finance ministers and central bank governors was that stablecoins, “as a financial activity, at this stage cannot effectively meet basic requirements in customer identification and anti-money-laundering,” thereby “magnifying loopholes in global financial regulation,” fueling “speculative hype,” increasing “the fragility of the global financial system,” and “impacting the monetary sovereignty of some underdeveloped economies.” The governor coupled that assessment with a firm domestic enforcement posture: “Since 2017, the People’s Bank of China, together with relevant departments, has issued multiple policy documents to prevent and deal with risks from domestic crypto trading and speculation, and these documents remain effective. Next, the PBOC will work with law-enforcement authorities to continue cracking down on the operation and speculation of cryptocurrencies within China, maintain economic and financial order, and closely track and dynamically evaluate the development of offshore stablecoins.” His statement effectively reaffirms the legal status quo—comprehensive restrictions on crypto trading and mining within China’s borders —while signaling ongoing surveillance of offshore instruments that touch Chinese users and firms. Pan’s comments land at a moment when stablecoins have become embedded in cross-border commerce and crypto market plumbing, with dollar-pegged tokens dominating global volumes. They also intersect with a live policy debate inside China about whether and how to tolerate offshore, yuan-linked instruments to complement the official e-CNY. Over the summer, major Chinese tech groups lobbied the PBOC to authorize an offshore, yuan-based stablecoin in Hong Kong to counter US dollar stablecoin dominance—an initiative that, if ever approved, would likely be ring-fenced from the mainland’s prohibitions. For market participants, the signal is twofold. First, there is no domestic policy thaw for crypto trading or mining: the 2017–2021 crackdown architecture remains intact, and enforcement will be coordinated with police and other agencies. Second, Chinese authorities are sharpening their scrutiny of offshore stablecoins used by exporters, importers, and savers, a vector that has grown as stablecoins have become de facto settlement media in parts of Asia and emerging markets. The central bank’s language—“continue cracking down” at home while “dynamically evaluating” offshore developments—suggests that any future experimentation will occur through official government channels rather than market-driven stablecoin adoption.

The idea was featured in a Newsmax segment shared by crypto enthusiast XRP King (@JOLLY__R0GER), who highlighted how government investment in XRP could, in theory, erase the deficit. The video’s argument centered on the government’s debt level, framing cryptocurrency as a potential mechanism to offset it. It compared today’s situation to an earlier point in Bitcoin’s history, when $348 would have purchased 1.7% of its total supply, noting that the same amount of Bitcoin today would be enough to pay off the national debt . The hypothetical scenario proposed that the government could have done the same for major public programs such as Social Security, using crypto’s growth to backstop national finances. Newsmax talking about XRP clearing the national debt pic.twitter.com/7SqKR55XF5 — XRP King (@JOLLY__R0GER) October 27, 2025 How the Proposal Would Work In the video, the speaker suggested that the government could theoretically allocate “one fifth of our annual tax revenue,” roughly a trillion dollars, to purchase XRP. At its current price of about $2.5 and a market capitalization of approximately $144 billion, the claim was that such an investment could multiply the coin’s value by eight, generating an estimated $8 trillion in return. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The argument extended further, proposing that the government could sell the asset at its peak to buy back after a market crash , and repeat the cycle to pay off the national debt. The reasoning presented rested on the idea that cryptocurrency, unlike traditional currencies managed by central banks, derives its worth from what participants believe it to be worth. It compared this to a high-end luxury item that costs little to make but sells at a premium due to demand. The video maintained that because crypto’s value is market-driven, large institutional participation could magnify its price exponentially. XRP’s Role in the Debate The Newsmax segment also discussed the role of government involvement in crypto markets. It referenced Ronald Reagan’s statement that “if it moves, regulate it. If it stops moving, subsidize it. If you can’t do either, ban it,” adding that the only way for the government to influence cryptocurrency would be to participate in it directly through ownership and investment. Newsmax presented XRP as a logical candidate for such an experiment, and the asset fits due to its established presence, liquidity, and connection to financial institutions. Experts have argued for years that Ripple’s escrow could settle the U.S. national debt if the asset grows significantly. By leveraging XRP’s global settlement capabilities, the U.S. could stabilize its balance sheet and reinforce its influence over digital finance.

The move brings BNB’s remaining total supply down to 137,738,379.26 BNB, marking another milestone in the chain’s long-term deflationary roadmap. This burn is part of the network’s Auto-Burn program, an automated process that gradually removes tokens every quarter until 50% of the total supply, roughly 100 million BNB, is permanently destroyed. The 33rd quarterly $BNB token burn has been completed directly on BNB Smart Chain (BSC). 1.44M #BNB has been burned View the details of the burn below https://t.co/GPfpeZ5fBT pic.twitter.com/kTQIHTfKvA — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) October 27, 2025 The BNB Burn, By The Numbers According to the official BNB Foundation update, this latest burn destroyed 1,441,281.413 BNB, valued at approximately $1.208 billion. Key Figures: Total BNB Burned: 1.44M Estimated Value: $1.208B Remaining Supply: 137.7M BNB Each burn follows a mathematical model that adjusts the number of tokens burned based on BNB’s price and block generation rate, keeping the process both predictable and transparent. This model ensures that BNB’s total circulating supply continues shrinking even as the network expands through DeFi, gaming, and Layer-2 growth. For real-time tracking, community members can monitor the total burned amount at bnbburn.info. The Purpose Behind the Burn BNB’s token burn mechanism is designed to maintain a deflationary token economy. The Auto-Burn process occurs every quarter, automatically removing BNB from circulation based on the network’s activity levels. This complements BEP-95, the real-time gas fee burn introduced in 2021, which continuously destroys a portion of gas fees with each transaction. Together, these two systems, Auto-Burn + BEP-95, make BNB one of the few tokens in crypto with dual algorithmic burn mechanisms operating simultaneously. By gradually reducing supply, BNB Chain aims to maintain scarcity while encouraging long-term value retention, similar to Bitcoin’s halving principle but with more flexibility and predictability. A Post-Upgrade Milestone This 33rd burn comes shortly after the Lorentz and Maxwell network upgrades, which adjusted BNB’s block frequency and burn parameters. These technical improvements increased efficiency across BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and BNB Greenfield, ensuring the Auto-Burn model stays consistent with the network’s evolving activity. In simpler terms: faster blocks, more precise burns. According to RouteScan.io, the upgrades also improved node synchronization and transaction throughput, paving the way for more scalable on-chain activity. BNB Chain completes its 33rd quarterly burn BNB Foundation has officially burned 1,441,281.413 BNB (~$1.208B), the latest step in its ongoing Auto-Burn program designed to cap total supply at 100M BNB. Key figures: Total BNB burned: 1.44M Estimated value: $1.208B … pic.twitter.com/KR8UtKLP9G — Routescan | The Unified Explorer (@routescan_io) October 27, 2025 The Economics of Burning BNB’s deflationary system is not a marketing gimmick, it’s core economics. When tokens are burned, they’re sent to a dead wallet, an address from which they can never be retrieved. This permanently reduces total supply. Each burn is a deflationary event, theoretically increasing the scarcity (and potential value) of remaining tokens. Currently, BNB trades around $1,147, with a market cap of roughly $157 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. At this pace, and assuming consistent burn volume, BNB could hit its 100 million target supply cap within the next 10 to 12 years. BNB’s Dual-Burn System Explained The Auto-Burn is predictable, it happens quarterly and uses a transparent formula tied to block generation and market price. Meanwhile, BEP-95 is dynamic, it burns a portion of gas fees in real time. The more the network is used, the more tokens are destroyed. This combination gives BNB a supply reduction system that adapts to market conditions. When demand increases, so does on-chain activity, which automatically speeds up the BEP-95 burn rate. It’s a self-regulating economic design meant to mirror real-world scarcity mechanics. Why It Matters BNB’s quarterly burns do more than remove supply, they signal network health and transparency. Each burn demonstrates continued growth in transaction volume, validator activity, and fee generation, since both burn mechanisms are directly linked to usage metrics. The 33rd burn shows that BNB Chain’s economy remains strong despite the broader market’s volatility. It also keeps BNB aligned with its long-term roadmap, a fixed supply of 100 million tokens. This consistency is one reason why BNB remains one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies by market cap, used across thousands of DeFi protocols, exchanges, and applications built on the chain. Community Reactions The announcement sparked quick reactions across social media, with users highlighting how BNB continues to execute one of the most sustained deflationary models in crypto. “Every quarter, billions just vanish, and yet network activity keeps climbing,” one BNB supporter wrote. Others pointed out how the timing aligns with broader bullish sentiment returning to the crypto market. Liquidity is improving, Solana projects are surging, and Ethereum gas fees have eased, a combination that benefits multi-chain users and BNB traders alike. The Bigger Picture BNB Chain’s quarterly burns aren’t just symbolic. They’re part of a broader ecosystem strategy: to balance growth with scarcity, and utility with sustainability. With the Lorentz and Maxwell upgrades live, the network is evolving into more than just an Ethereum alternative. Its expanding infrastructure, through BNB Greenfield, opBNB Layer-2, and Cross-Chain Relayers, positions it as one of the few ecosystems balancing scalability, security, and deflation. At the same time, quarterly burns remind holders that BNB’s supply isn’t infinite, it’s constantly shrinking. The 33rd quarterly burn cements BNB’s reputation as one of crypto’s most actively deflationary assets. Over 1.44 million BNB, worth $1.2 billion, is now permanently out of circulation. The remaining supply stands at 137.7 million, inching closer to the ultimate 100 million goal. In a market where inflationary token models often erode value, BNB’s algorithmic burn structure stands out as a real-time example of digital scarcity in motion. And as the network upgrades continue to optimize performance and efficiency, each burn reinforces a simple message: BNB isn’t just a token, it’s an evolving economic engine. In Summary: 1,441,281.413 BNB burned (~$1.208B) Remaining supply: 137.7M BNB Auto-Burn + BEP-95 mechanisms active Target supply cap: 100M BNB Next burn: Q1 2026 Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

53726986,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=846862,1761631446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53726986.jpeg,Google signed a 25-year deal with NextEra Energy to buy power from the Duane Arnold nuclear plant,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/google-to-power-data-centers/,"Google is working with NextEra Energy to restart a closed nuclear plant in Iowa. The Duane Arnold plant shut down in 2020 and is expected to restart by 2029, supplying Google with clean power for 25 years. NextEra will operate the 615-megawatt facility to supply Google’s data centers with the clean and consistent power they need. The agreement indicates that the tremendous growth in AI is increasing power demands. Most of the power generated at the plant will be used to power Google’s local offices and data centers, with a portion to be sold to the Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO) through a long-term agreement. NextEra to take full ownership of the site as part of the deal. NextEra brings the Duane Arnold plant back to life to supply Google with clean energy NextEra will revive the old plant because it will be less time-consuming and less expensive than building a new one. New plants face long approval processes, construction challenges , and strict safety reviews. To control the project entirely, NextExtra will buy out Central Iowa Power Cooperative and Corn Belt Power Cooperative. Once everything is ready, the Duane Arnold plant will produce 615 megawatts of steady, carbon-free power that can run 24 hours a day. As part of the new deal, Google will buy electricity from the plant for the next 25 years to power its growing data centers. The company’s centers work nonstop to process millions of data requests every second from people all over the world. Because they operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, they require a constant and reliable electricity supply. And since wind or solar energy isn’t always reliable due to weather conditions, Nuclear energy is the best fit. NextEra will also sell the remaining power to the Central Iowa Power Cooperative under the same terms and conditions. The firm aims to ensure that local communities benefit from clean and stable energy. Many energy experts view this deal as evidence that nuclear energy is poised for a strong comeback, as new technologies require more electricity. Analyst Sophie Karp at KeyBanc Capital Markets noted that the speed at which this deal was set up highlights the high demand for zero-emission and reliable power. Data centers in the United States consume the most electricity because the rise of AI, cloud computing, and the expansion of online services have driven demand to unprecedented levels. Tech companies use nuclear power to meet the growing demand for electricity from AI Constellation Energy hopes to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania by 2027. The Three Mile Island location is known for being the site of a 1979 nuclear accident that set off decades of public concern over safety. However, the case is different today, as many experts consider nuclear power to be one of the cleanest and most reliable forms of energy in an era of advanced technology and international safety standards. Holtec International also plans to reopen the Palisades plant in Michigan, which closed in 2022. The company hopes to resume operations next year. Further south, the state-owned utility in South Carolina, Santee Cooper, is negotiating with Brookfield Asset Management to complete the VC Summer nuclear project that was abandoned in 2017. Together, these projects demonstrate that people are increasingly confident in nuclear energy’s ability to meet the country’s growing electricity demand. Google and NextEra also aim to collaborate on developing new technologies that could supply electricity for future data centers in various parts of the country. These projects will utilize newer and smaller designs, such as modular reactors, because they can be built faster and in more locations than traditional large reactors. The two companies already have nearly three gigawatts of clean energy projects completed across the United States. This new nuclear power project only strengthens their ability to meet the growing demand for power for the next generation of technology. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

53726955,https://nulltx.com/?p=152486,1761631541,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Mt. Gox Postpones Repayments Again, $4 Billion in Bitcoin Locked Until 2026",https://nulltx.com/mt-gox-postpones-repayments-again-4-billion-in-bitcoin-locked-until-2026/,"The crypto world just got another plot twist. Defunct exchange Mt. Gox has once again postponed its long-awaited creditor repayments, this time pushing the deadline to October 31, 2026. The announcement arrived just days before the previous deadline of October 31, 2025, extending the saga of what’s been one of crypto’s longest-running stories. “Largely Completed,” But Still Delayed In a statement, the Mt. Gox rehabilitation trustee said it had “largely completed” base repayments, early lump-sum repayments, and intermediate repayments for creditors who finished all eligibility procedures correctly. But not everyone was lucky. Many creditors are still waiting, some due to incomplete documentation, others due to procedural complications during verification and payout steps. This latest extension marks the third delay in the timeline. Originally, repayments were supposed to conclude by October 31, 2023, a full two years ago. The $4 Billion Overhang That Didn’t Happen Mt. Gox still holds 34,689 BTC, roughly $4 billion at current prices, according to CoinMarketCap data. That Bitcoin was expected to be distributed this month, an event that many analysts feared could flood the market. Even a small portion of that BTC hitting exchanges might have created significant sell pressure, particularly in a market already sensitive to liquidity shifts. But now, with the new delay, that potential selling wave has been kicked another 12 months down the road. Traders and analysts are calling this one of the most bullish delays of the year. Here’s why: No new BTC supply will hit exchanges from Mt. Gox creditors anytime soon. No panic selling from decade-old wallets that might have moved coins for the first time since 2014. And most importantly, one major bearish overhang just vanished from Bitcoin’s short-term outlook. That $4 billion worth of supply staying locked up until late 2026 means the market gets a breather. It’s effectively a year-long pause button on one of the crypto market’s biggest fear events. The Perfect Timing This delay couldn’t have come at a better macro moment. The U.S. Federal Reserve has started signaling the end of quantitative tightening (QT), the era of liquidity drain might finally be closing. Rate cuts are back on the horizon, and with trade tensions easing between the U.S. and China, global risk sentiment is improving. Liquidity is creeping back into both traditional and crypto markets. In short, macro tailwinds are aligning with crypto’s internal relief. Mt. Gox’s postponement just adds one more bullish card to the deck. For newcomers, Mt. Gox’s story is crypto legend. Launched in 2010, Mt. Gox was once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, handling over 70% of all BTC trades at its peak. Then came disaster. In 2014, Mt. Gox collapsed after 850,000 BTC went missing, either hacked or misplaced. The platform declared bankruptcy, and users were left waiting for restitution as legal and procedural disputes dragged on for years. Now, more than a decade later, repayments are still being sorted out. Why the Delay Matters Each time Mt. Gox delays, it changes crypto’s short-term supply dynamics. Think of it as a defused bomb, 34,689 BTC that could destabilize markets if released too quickly. Analysts have long debated how much impact Mt. Gox repayments might have when they finally happen. Some estimate that if even 10% of creditors sold, the market could see hundreds of millions in sell pressure in just days. This delay means none of that happens this year, or next. Creditor Fatigue, Market Relief While traders are celebrating the reprieve, creditors are feeling something different: exhaustion. For those who’ve been waiting since 2014, another year means another stretch of uncertainty. Many creditors completed verification months ago and expected payouts by year-end. Still, the trustee insists that most core repayments are “largely completed,” suggesting that at least part of the remaining work lies in administrative cleanup, not systemic issues. With inflation cooling and ETF inflows steady, the absence of a Mt. Gox sell wave adds further price stability. Market analysts note that liquidity conditions are improving, particularly across spot BTC markets on Coinbase, Binance, and OKX. Some traders argue the Mt. Gox delay could quietly extend Bitcoin’s rally window heading into 2026. The community on X (formerly Twitter) wasted no time sharing their takes. Crypto researcher @TedPillows Mt. Gox has postponed its $BTC repayments to October 2026. This could have brought selling pressure to Bitcoin, and now it's going. Good for markets. pic.twitter.com/jW3OmM8McV — Ted (@TedPillows) October 27, 2025 Sentiment across the board echoed the same theme, short-term relief, long-term fatigue. The Road to 2026 With this extension, Mt. Gox’s next critical milestone is now October 31, 2026. That’s the new target for full completion of creditor repayments. Until then, the 34,689 BTC remains locked, under the control of the trustee. Whether future delays will happen again remains to be seen, but for now, the market can breathe. Mt. Gox’s latest delay might frustrate creditors, but for the wider market, it’s a quiet blessing. No $4B BTC dump. No exchange shock. No panic waves from decade-old wallets. Instead, the market gets time, and timing is everything. With liquidity returning, rate cuts looming, and a long-feared sell event pushed another year away, Bitcoin’s path into 2026 looks a little clearer, and a lot calmer. In Summary: Mt. Gox repayment deadline now October 31, 2026 Trustee says repayments “largely completed,” but not fully distributed 34,689 BTC (~$4B) remains locked One bearish event removed for another year Crypto market reacts with cautious optimism Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

53726928,615127,1761631746,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53726928.jpeg,Gemini’s XRP Price Prediction Puts $4.50 in Sight – Here’s Why PEPENODE Could Be Next 1000x Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/gemini-xrp-price-prediction-why-pepenode-could-be-next-1000x-crypto/,"Quick Facts: 1⃣ Gemini’s XRP price prediction suggests the token could surge to $4.50 after confirming a breakout from a descending triangle pattern. 2⃣ In the long term, XRP could climb to $15, thanks to a major breakout from a multi-year consolidation pattern. 3⃣ As $XRP gears up for its next leg, PEPENODE is emerging as the next 1000x crypto, courtesy of its game-changing mine-to-earn ecosystem. After completing its fifth major acquisition in the last two years, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to X to remind the crypto community and investors that ‘XRP sits at the center of everything Ripple does. Lock in.’ The token, now the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap , took quite the hit on October 10 when Trump announced the 100% tariff on China. That said, $XRP has done very well to rebound since then – and it now looks primed to rally higher thanks to a couple of important technical bullish factors. For instance, its current leg up comes after a successful retest of the resistance line of the descending triangle pattern it broke out of back in July this year. According to this trading pattern, $XRP should now continue its upward move to not only reclaim its current highs of around $3.66 but also set new records near $4.50 – a chunky 70% gain from current levels. How was this target calculated? Gemini AI used the maximum width of the descending triangle pattern and mapped it onto the breakout level, which produced a target of roughly $4.50. Next, for a long-term XRP price prediction, Gemini zoomed out on the token’s monthly chart. The AI pointed out that $XRP has spent all of October retesting its breakout level from a major descending triangle pattern – one that had been in place since December 2017 and finally gave a breakout in November 2024. Applying the same classical technical analysis playbook, Gemini measured the width of this long consolidation phase and mapped it onto the breakout level, which produced a mind-boggling price target of $15. Keep in mind, though, that this is a long-term target. $XRP is currently trading around $2.62 . Here’s the kicker: XRP’s recent push and its potential upside wouldn’t just be the result of Ripple’s growing efforts to make $XRP the center of its operations and the backbone of a crypto-led global cross-border payment system. It’s also a telltale sign that the industry is hungry for value-stuffed altcoins that are strongly rooted in utility and have the capability to take crypto forward. While XRP’s rise to $15 won’t happen in just a few months, it’s still worthwhile HODLing a blue-chip crypto like XRP. That said, you also have the option to play it smartly and invest in other similarly utility-oozing altcoins that could deliver potentially massive – even far better – returns in a much shorter timeframe, especially since blue-chip cryptos nowadays move rather slowly compared to how they did back in 2017. So, if you’re looking for the next 1000x crypto to make sure you squeeze out the maximum possible returns from the coming boom, consider PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) . Why PEPENODE Could Be the Next Big Crypto Coin PEPENODE isn’t your everyday meme coin that simply decorates the iconic Pepe the Frog in its own attire and hopes to attract degen meme coin investors. In fact, PEPENODE has really dug deep and found a real crypto-related problem that needs solving – the accessibility of crypto mining.

After a recent attempt, XRP found itself consolidating, unable to breach the significant $2.7 resistance level. This has sparked considerable discussion among traders and analysts alike, eager to understand what comes next for this prominent digital asset. Why is the XRP Price Consolidating? According to a recent analysis by CoinDesk , XRP is experiencing a period of consolidation. This means its price is moving within a relatively narrow range, reflecting a balance between buying and selling pressure. XRP recently failed to break through the $2.7 resistance level. This level acts as a ceiling, where sellers tend to emerge and prevent further upward movement. Such consolidation phases are common in markets, often preceding a significant move in either direction. What Bullish Signals are Supporting XRP Price ? Despite the current consolidation, several indicators suggest a potentially bullish outlook for the XRP price . Traders are closely monitoring these signs for clues about future movements. Increased Trading Volume: Daily trading volume has seen a notable 26% increase compared to the weekly average. Higher volume often indicates stronger conviction behind price moves. Decreased Exchange Balances: There’s been a slight decrease in XRP balances held on exchanges since early October. This can suggest that fewer tokens are available for immediate selling, potentially reducing selling pressure. These signals hint at underlying strength and renewed interest in XRP, which could provide the necessary momentum for a future breakout. Navigating the Downside Risks for XRP Price While bullish signals are present, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential downside risks that could impact the XRP price . The market is dynamic, and caution remains important. A recent dip below $2.635 has increased short-term downside risk, indicating vulnerability to further declines. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) indicator, a popular tool for identifying momentum, has yet to show a clear breakout signal. This suggests that strong upward momentum has not yet firmly established itself. These factors highlight the need for careful observation before making definitive trading decisions. Crucial Levels: Where Does the XRP Price Find Support? Understanding key support levels is vital for any trader. For XRP, a specific zone is proving to be particularly important in the current market environment. This area could determine the immediate trajectory of the XRP price . The analysis suggests traders should monitor the key support zone between $2.61 and $2.63 . This range represents a price floor where buying interest typically strengthens, preventing the price from falling further. A successful rebound from this level would indicate strong buyer conviction. Conversely, a sustained break below this zone could signal further declines. What Needs to Happen for XRP Price to Test $2.7 Again? For the XRP price to mount another challenge against the formidable $2.7 resistance, specific market conditions need to materialize. It’s not just about wishing for a rally; it’s about observing the right catalysts. A successful rebound from the $2.61-$2.63 support level is the first critical step. This rebound must be accompanied by rising trading volume. Increased volume alongside a price rise suggests genuine buying interest, not just speculative noise. If these conditions align, XRP could be positioned for another robust attempt to break the $2.7 resistance, potentially leading to significant upward movement. The journey for the XRP price is currently at a critical juncture. While bullish signals offer hope and increased trading activity, the immediate challenge lies in holding key support levels and generating the sustained momentum needed for a decisive breakout. Traders are keenly watching the $2.61-$2.63 support zone and any accompanying volume increases as indicators of XRP’s next potential move towards or beyond $2.7. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether XRP can indeed unlock its potential for a significant upward shift. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is XRP? XRP is a digital asset created by Ripple , a technology company focused on improving global payments. It is designed to facilitate fast, low-cost international transactions. What does ‘resistance level’ mean in crypto trading? A resistance level is a price point on a chart where an upward trend is expected to pause or reverse due to a concentration of sellers. It acts as a ceiling that the price struggles to break above. What does the MACD indicator tell us? The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. It helps traders identify potential buy and sell signals by showing when momentum is shifting. Who conducts the CoinDesk analysis mentioned? The analysis is typically conducted by market analysts and contributors for CoinDesk , a leading media outlet specializing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Their reports offer insights into market trends and asset performance. Did you find this analysis on the XRP price helpful?

However, the tides have turned, perhaps expectedly after such a rally, and both assets have flashed red now. Moreover, there are some worrying signs about further corrections. XRP outperformed the rest of the larger-cap alts during the weekend, closing on Sunday with a 12% surge. It kept climbing on Monday and tapped a multi-week peak of $2.65. This significant increase was perhaps driven by the positive developments within the company behind the asset and came despite the growing sell-offs by whales. Although XRP’s run was stopped there, it still trades above $2.60 as of press time. However, Ali Martinez noted that the TD Sequential, a metric used to determine whether the underlying asset has reached an exhaustion point in each direction, had flashed a sell signal, which could lead to an immediate retracement.

Caution here! pic.twitter.com/JkL4P5CrCf — Ali (@ali_charts) October 27, 2025 The landscape around Dogecoin is identical as the OG meme coin posted notable gains during the weekend and challenged the $0.22 resistance. However, its 24-hour decline has been more painful. After getting rejected at that level, the asset has slumped by nearly 5% and is now just inches below $0.20. Aside from the overall market-wide correction, another possible reason behind today’s drop is the behavior of whales. Martinez noted that such large market participants have been on a selling spree, disposing of 500 million tokens within the span of just a week. 500 million Dogecoin $DOGE sold by whales over the past week! pic.twitter.com/hza0gBTZrd — Ali (@ali_charts) October 27, 2025 The post Price Warnings for Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) Investors: Details appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Dogecoin|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-28 06:12:01

53728349,614954,1761634805,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53728349.jpeg,Defunct Bitcoin Exchange Mt. Gox Extends Repayment Deadline To October 2026,https://bitcoinist.com/mt-gox-extends-repayment-deadline-to-october-2026/,"Since its bankruptcy filing in 2014, creditors of the now-defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox have been waiting for repayments after losing over 850,000 Bitcoin (BTC) due to significant security breaches. Initially, the repayment deadline was set for October 31, 2025, but it has now been extended to October 31, 2026. Mt. Gox Trustee Updates Nobuaki Kobayashi, the rehabilitation trustee, provided an update indicating that, with a few exceptions, the Base Repayment, Early Lump-Sum Repayment, and Intermediate Repayment processes for rehabilitation creditors have largely been completed. These repayments have been made to those creditors who have fulfilled the necessary procedures and encountered no issues during the repayment process. However, many creditors have yet to receive their payments due to “incomplete procedures or various complications” – not disclosed in the statement –that arose during the repayment process. To facilitate these repayments, the Mt. Gox rehabilitation trustee has, with court approval, shifted the repayment deadline to October 31, 2026. The Rise And Fall At its peak, Mt. Gox was the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, responsible for handling 70% to 80% of Bitcoin trading volume. Its prominence in the cryptocurrency industry , however, made it a target for hackers, resulting in repeated security issues. In 2011, hackers exploited stolen credentials to transfer Bitcoin, and network protocol deficiencies led to the loss of several thousand Bitcoin that same year. By early 2014, customer frustrations grew as they faced difficulties withdrawing funds. Technical bugs created uncertainty about transaction details, particularly regarding whether Bitcoin had been successfully transferred to customers’ wallets. This problem was attributed to a bug in the Bitcoin software that allowed users to alter transaction IDs , known as “transaction malleability.” While this claim has been disputed within the community, an agreement was reached in late 2021 to address these issues. Creditors Face Delays And Uncertainty The situation escalated in February 2014 when Mt. Gox suspended withdrawals after discovering suspicious activity in its digital wallets , ultimately revealing that it had “lost” hundreds of thousands of Bitcoin. Estimates of the total lost ranged from 650,000 to 850,000. Between October 2019 and October 2020, trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi extended the deadline for submitting claims five times. In November 2021, Kobayashi announced a rehabilitation plan that was agreed upon by Japanese courts and creditors. Despite these developments, Mt. Gox has faced criticism for its lack of communication regarding the reasons for the extended deadlines . Creditors will now have to wait an additional year for potential repayments, which may be received at a significant discount compared to current market prices. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $114,813, with gains of 2% and 3.5% in the 24-hour and seven-day time frames, respectively. This puts the leading cryptocurrency in the market only 8.8% below its all-time high of $126,000. Featured image from DALL-E, chart from TradingView.com",Crypto News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Mt.

Authorities issued warnings about the alleged risks posed by stablecoins, particularly amid concerns that the US may have solidified its dollar dominance through these digital assets. US GENIUS Act Vs. China’s Crypto Caution According to local media reports, Pan Gongsheng, governor of the People’s Bank of China, announced plans to expand the use of the country’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), known as the “e-CNY.” He remarked, “[Stablecoins] are still in their early stages of development,” emphasizing that financial regulators globally remain cautious about these assets, which are typically pegged to other currencies. Related Reading: Digital Yen Goes Live: JPYC EX Integrates Traditional Finance With DeFi In the United States, however, Trump’s policies toward digital assets have resulted in the passage of the GENIUS Act, as the first crypto bill aimed at laying the framework for the adoption of these dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies. Yet, Pan highlighted that stablecoins currently fail to meet essential requirements such as customer identification and anti-money laundering (AML) measures, which could allegedly exacerbate gaps in global financial regulation. He expressed concern that these issues foster a “speculative market atmosphere,” increasing vulnerabilities in the global financial system and affecting the monetary sovereignty of less developed economies. The central bank plans to collaborate with law enforcement to continue cracking down on domestic operations and speculation related to crypto. “The policies and measures implemented since 2017 to address risks associated with virtual currencies remain in effect,” he stated. Regulatory Revisions Ahead Despite China’s continuous crypto crackdown, research on stablecoins is progressing within China. The country’s largest government-backed research fund recently opened applications for studies focused on stablecoins and their cross-border monitoring systems, offering grants ranging from 200,000 yuan (approximately $28,083) to 300,000 yuan ($42,126). The central bank also plans to optimize the positioning of the digital yuan, allowing more commercial banks to participate in the pilot program that has been running in over two dozen cities since 2019, accumulating a transaction value exceeding 14 trillion yuan. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Shows The Possibility Of The Ethereum Price Reaching $16,000 Zhu Hexin, director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, indicated that nine new policy measures would soon be introduced to promote trade innovation and development, with the potential to bring positive developments for the growth of the crypto ecosystem in the Asian country. Wu Qing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, also hinted at the possibility of such measures, stating that the regulator would review listing standards on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange’s ChiNext board to better align with the characteristics of emerging fields and future industries.

In a recent video, he noted that XRP appears to be forming a double-bottom reversal pattern, a structure often viewed as a potential indicator of a trend reversal. According to him, the formation is taking shape around the 0.240 accumulation zone—an area he described as historically significant in XRP’s price behavior. Winkle explained that this region has previously marked the start of major upward movements for XRP, noting that previous touches at that level were accompanied by substantial buying volume. He suggested that current market activity could lead to another breakout if momentum continues to build, potentially pushing XRP toward the $3 range. The chart that everyone ignored just flashed the same signal we saw before XRP’s last 600% run. It’s happening again… The whales already know. Don’t blink. pic.twitter.com/pW0luRiU6D — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 25, 2025 Technical Indicators and Market Confidence The analyst emphasized that the current setup extends beyond technical patterns, framing it as a reflection of growing confidence in XRP despite broader market uncertainty. He pointed out that while many digital assets have struggled to maintain stability, XRP has shown resilience on higher timeframes. Winkle stated that weekly chart movements suggest consistent accumulation by large holders , describing it as evidence that “someone knows what’s coming.” He connected this renewed confidence to the recent rebranding of Ripple’s institutional platform, previously known as “Hit and Row,” now introduced as Ripple Prime. The analyst characterized this development as part of Ripple’s broader strategy to strengthen its institutional liquidity solutions. He indicated that such structural advancements could coincide with increased on-chain accumulation, creating favorable conditions for a price recovery. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While Winkle’s analysis has drawn attention from members of the XRP community, not everyone shares the same degree of optimism. One user, Denis Samkov, commented that the chart setup appeared promising but stressed the importance of maintaining realistic expectations, reminding others that historical patterns do not guarantee future performance. Such caution reflects a broader sentiment among experienced traders who recognize that even when historical patterns align, macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments often determine the pace and scale of digital asset movements. A Potentially Defining Period for XRP As XRP continues to trade within a narrow range while showing relative strength compared to other major cryptocurrencies, the pattern identified by Winkle adds a technical dimension to the ongoing discussion surrounding the asset’s future trajectory. Whether this setup evolves into a sustained upward movement or another short-term reaction remains uncertain. However, the alignment of technical and institutional factors has positioned XRP as one of the more closely watched assets in the current market cycle.

This adds Venmo to Bilt’s existing payment lineup, which already supports credit cards, debit cards, and direct bank transfers. Bilt claims its system is already linked with over 40,000 merchants and 70% of the top 100 U.S. property managers. The new deal means tenants and homeowners will be able to use Venmo to make payments the same way they already split rent or utility bills with roommates. According to PayPal’s general manager of consumer, Diego Scotti, “Millions of people already use Venmo to split rent with roommates and pay their landlords. Now we’re making that experience even more seamless and rewarding.” Bilt’s Chief Executive Officer, Ankur Jain, said the partnership merges the wide user base of one of the most used peer-to-peer payment tools in America with Bilt’s reward-based rent network. According to Bloomberg, Venmo wants to become the default payment method for both consumers and merchants, as well as expand into in-person transactions and e-commerce, so PayPal sees the rollout as a chance to lock Venmo into the housing market, where monthly payments are steady, large, and consistent. PayPal links with Mastercard to power AI-driven payments In a separate development, PayPal is stretching its collaboration with Mastercard yet again, this time to introduce AI-powered transactions through Agent Pay, the platform that lets consumers make purchases guided by AI assistants. Mastercard’s “secure payment” rails will back the process, integrating directly into PayPal’s branded checkout wallet, and will extend to all Mastercard co-branded cards that already operate within PayPal’s network. PayPal will pilot Mastercard’s Agent Pay Acceptance Framework, which verifies and secures AI-initiated payments, but the integration relies entirely on tokenization and passkey authentication, allowing AI agents to authorize transactions safely and merchants to accept those payments without extra technical setup. In its statement announcing the development on Monday, Mastercard said this system will “undoubtedly reduce friction and expand consumer choice as AI-driven commerce becomes mainstream.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Business|PayPal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-28 07:07:49

MoonBull Could be a Fast-Track to Explosive Gains As ETH and HBAR Soar,https://timestabloid.com/wondering-which-is-the-next-100x-crypto-presale-moonbull/,"Does spotting the next big opportunity feel like searching for a needle in a haystack? While Ethereum and Hedera have established themselves as prominent players, the question remains: is there a next 100X crypto presale poised to deliver exponential returns? Enter MoonBull ($MOBU), a project currently in its 5th presale stage, offering a unique investment opportunity. MoonBull is positioning itself as a potential game-changer in the crypto space. But how does it stack up against Ethereum and Hedera? MoonBull: The Next 100x Crypto Presale Opportunity? MoonBull’s next 100X crypto presale is in its 5th stage, with tokens priced at $0.00006584. Early investors and over 1500 token holders have already seen a return on investment (ROI) of over 9,256% from Stage 5 to the anticipated listing price of $0.00616. This represents a 27.40% potential price surge from Stage 5 to the next stage. For instance, investing $30,000 in Stage 5 would yield approximately 456,000,000 $MOBU tokens. At the listing price, this investment could be worth around $2.8 million, highlighting the substantial profit potential. Launch Plan – Built to Reward the Community After the final presale stage, MoonBull enters its launch phase with liquidity supplied to the decentralized exchange and all presale tokens fully claimable. The liquidity pool is locked for 48 hours, and a 60-minute claim delay safeguard ensures any early sell requires a corresponding buy to protect the token price. These measures create a fair, stable, and secure launch, rewarding the community with immediate access, strong liquidity, and a resilient trading environment from day one. Ethereum (ETH) Price Rockets On, Breaking $4,075 Ceiling Ethereum is trading at $4,075.89, up 0.69% over the past month, reflecting steady momentum and continued confidence from investors. Its market cap stands at $491.95 billion, up 3%, highlighting Ethereum’s dominance as the backbone of smart contracts and decentralized applications. Trading remains intense, with a 24-hour volume of $23.25 billion, up 52.54%. With a fully diluted valuation of $491.95 billion, Ethereum continues to lead the charge in the blockchain ecosystem, powering the growth of DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 innovation. Hedera (HBAR) News Shows A Surge, Token Eyes $0.18 Breakthrough Hedera is trading at $0.1790, up 17.04% over the past month, showing strong bullish momentum and growing investor confidence. Its market cap stands at $7.6 billion, up 3.05%, reflecting steady growth in the Hedera ecosystem. Trading remains active, with a 24-hour volume of $139.16 million, up 2.03%. With an unlocked market cap of $8.24 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $8.93 billion, HBAR continues to attract attention as a promising altcoin in the evolving blockchain landscape. Final Words Ethereum and Hedera have established themselves in the crypto space, but recent market volatility and challenges suggest that their explosive growth may be limited. Ethereum’s price has experienced fluctuations, and Hedera’s adoption remains modest. In contrast, MoonBull’s next 100X crypto presale presents a unique opportunity for investors seeking substantial returns. With its innovative approach, strong community backing, and a launch plan designed to reward early participants, MoonBull is positioning itself as a potential game-changer in the crypto market.

Metaplanet Launches $500 Million Stock Buyback Plan to Boost Bitcoin Returns The company's CEO, Simon Gerovich, said in a statement that the board also approved a significant financing arrangement as part of the plan. According to official documents, the Metaplanet board of directors has established a credit line of $500 million (approximately 764 billion Japanese yen). This loan structure allows the company to quickly borrow money using its Bitcoin holdings as collateral. The funds can be used for new BTC purchases, Bitcoin-yielding investments, or the repurchase of company shares. Gerovich emphasized that this strategic move will increase Metaplanet's flexibility in capital allocation and strengthen shareholder value in the long term. Metaplanet, which became known as Japan's “Bitcoin treasury” by mid-2024, converted a large portion of its reserves into BTC. Experts say the new buyback plan will both bolster the company's market value and set a new example for Bitcoin-focused corporate strategies. *This is not investment advice.

Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) are gaining fresh momentum, solid at key support levels and suggesting potential upswings in the weeks ahead. Yet the spotlight is now turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a fast-rising top crypto that’s setting the market alight with its sky-high presale and visionary DeFi model. At the moment, MUTM’s Phase 6 presale is over 80% sold out, with over $18.15 million raised at a mere $0.035 per token. Investors are pouring in, as driven by its distinct dual-lending protocol that collectively integrates Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending to achieve maximum capital effectiveness and returns. While XRP and ADA are poised for possible breakouts, there are analysts who think that Mutuum Finance could be next to rise to the ranks as a household name amongst the elite ranks of altcoins, and one of the best crypto to invest in ahead of 2026’s boom market going full steam ahead. Cardano (ADA) Waits Out Breakout Signal in Sideways Action Cardano (ADA) continues to trade in a sideways action, mirroring the overall market indecision as traders wait for a definitive breakout signal. The price continues to stay capped below the key $0.718 level, suggesting bulls would require more muscle to confirm a local bottom. ADA needs to take back this zone on volume to tee up potentially to the next major resistance zone at $0.825, where a convincing break would tee up more likely a longer-term bullish trend. In the meantime, the market is fearful, with investors closely observing for trend-reversal confirmation. XRP Breaks Out: Bulls Target $3.86 as Momentum Increases Ripple’s in-house cryptocurrency XRP has technically established a weekly breakout of its established falling wedge chart pattern, traditional bullish reversal charting formation routinely suggesting the initiation of a new rising cycle. This kind of technical breakout has made traders hopeful with primary targets established at $3.07 and $3.86 as bullish momentum continues to increase. The breakout indicates that XRP might be finally winning investor trust following months of stagnation, with volume gradually building and sentiment picking up. As this move makes XRP even more entrenched among the leading cryptos to keep an eye on, numerous investors are also diversifying into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a presale token with initial signs of breakout worth on par with XRP’s classic runs. Mutuum Finance Beats Market Estimates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quickly become the best crypto to invest in for short-term profit. Progress on the platform has comprehensively surpassed expectations, with over 17,500 investors and over $18.15 million raised in its presale stage. The explosive expansion has outperformed analysts’ predictions, putting Mutuum Finance on the list of the top crypto projects to track in the DeFi sector. Earlier presale stages have already witnessed millions of MUTM tokens securing buyers, reflecting robust investor appetite and making way for early liquidity before mainnet launch. The steady drumbeat of these sales indicates increasing confidence from holders who view Mutuum Finance as a DeFi venture for constructing long-term utility, as opposed to a venture based on short-term speculation. Stable Borrowing Rates on Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance facilitates the setting of borrowing rates based on certain market conditions to enable pre-fixing repayment expenses by borrowers. Invocation of fixed rate has the protocol to compute it as a weighted average of then prevailing variable rate and the appropriate market parameters at the relevant time. While fixed rates are typically more than variable rates, both offer protection and certainty for borrowers and lenders alike in the case of rising interest rates, resulting in a more stable and transparent lending process. Since the crypto markets are on the rise, investors are looking at Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and the new kid on the block, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). XRP and ADA are supporting essential levels and are indicating strength, but MUTM is where the excitement happens. Now 80% sold out in Phase 6, Mutuum Finance has already raised $18.15M at $0.035 per token. Its two-lending model is shaking up DeFi efficiency and making early comparisons to 2020-era DeFi giants. Analysts report MUTM could be the next big breakout before 2026, a top crypto to buy now for investors seeking early, high-upside trades. For those aiming for strong returns, Mutuum Finance remains the best crypto to invest in, solidifying its place as a top crypto with long-term growth potential.

Analyst Suggests Price for Coming Fed Meeting,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-prints-inverse-hs-pattern-analyst-suggests-price-for-coming-fed-meeting/,"Crypto analyst Block Bull has drawn attention to XRP’s latest chart structure, pointing out the formation of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. The analyst suggested that the setup could position XRP for a move toward $3 before the next Federal Reserve meeting slated for Wednesday. The chart he shared shows the token trading around $2.63, with a well-defined left shoulder, head, and right shoulder, and a neckline breakout suggesting possible continuation toward the next major resistance near $3. $XRP has printed an inverse H&S Pattern. Could $XRP Reach $3 before Wednesdays FED Meeting? pic.twitter.com/pvJ7ymbVSQ — BLOCK BULL (@TheBlockBull) October 26, 2025 Community Reaction to the Analysis Block Bull’s post generated several responses from market participants who largely viewed the setup as constructive. An X user, FutureChain, noted that XRP’s inverse head-and-shoulders pattern appeared solid, describing the $3 target before the Fed meeting as ambitious but achievable if current momentum continues. Another commenter, PRITAM07, offered a similar outlook, anticipating XRP to touch $2.70 in the short term before advancing to $3 by Thursday. These comments reflect cautious confidence that the pattern could drive a further rise if technical conditions remain favorable. Technical Overview and Pattern Implications The inverse head-and-shoulders formation typically signals a potential shift from a downward to an upward trend once the neckline is successfully broken. In Block Bull’s chart, XRP appears to have completed this breakout, establishing higher lows and a stronger upward slope as it moves toward the projected price target. The immediate resistance stands around the $3.09 level, representing the next significant hurdle for the asset. If the momentum sustains, this target could mark an important recovery point following previous consolidation phases. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Context Ahead of the Fed Meeting The timing of this potential move adds another layer of interest, given the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting midweek. Historically, such meetings can influence digital asset markets through shifts in monetary policy sentiment or broader risk appetite. Traders are monitoring whether a stable macro environment could support continued technical strength for XRP in the days leading up to the announcement. While enthusiasm for the pattern is evident, some analysts caution that volatility surrounding the meeting could affect short-term movements regardless of the technical outlook. Further Considerations Block Bull’s identification of the inverse head-and-shoulders pattern has reinforced optimism among XRP traders looking for a continuation of recent gains. The $3 level remains the primary target in the short term, and analysts and traders alike are closely watching how price action develops as the Fed meeting approaches.

The hit came largely from a $1.1 billion legal provision linked to the Bernard Madoff fraud case, dragging down what was otherwise a solid quarter in terms of interest and wealth income. Despite the profit dip, the bank still beat analyst expectations, with consensus figures compiled by HSBC putting profit forecasts at $5.98 billion and revenue at $17.05 billion. It came in above both. Operating expenses jumped 24% year-on-year, mainly due to the $1.4 billion in provisions, which included the Madoff-related payout. HSBC also confirmed that the $1.1 billion charge will cut into its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio by 15 basis points. That ratio measures financial strength, and any hit matters. The lawsuit came from Herald Fund SPC, filed back in 2009, accusing HSBC’s Luxembourg branch of failing to protect assets lost in the Madoff scam. A recent court ruling rejected HSBC’s appeal on the securities portion but allowed the bank to contest the cash claims. HSBC now plans to appeal again in Luxembourg, and if it loses, will argue over the final sum in later court action. HSBC boosts NII and wealth income despite legal drag Despite the legal storm, HSBC’s net interest income (NII) for Q3 climbed 15% from a year ago to hit $8.8 billion. The bank also saw its wealth division income jump 30% year-on-year, totaling $2.68 billion for the quarter. The strong wealth performance came as HSBC leaned deeper into its fee-driven strategy. It now expects double-digit annual growth in fee and other income from the wealth segment over the medium term. For full-year 2025, HSBC said it’s aiming for banking NII of $43 billion or more, as it sees momentum from policy rates in key markets like the UK and Hong Kong. “The intent with which we are executing our strategy is reflected in our performance this quarter, despite taking legal provisions related to historical matters,” said Georges Elhedery, the bank’s Group CEO. There’s more. HSBC also announced this month that it plans to take Hang Seng Bank private, a move that values the subsidiary at over HK$290 billion ($37 billion). The non-performing loan ratio at Hang Seng hit 6.69% in H1 2025, driven by ongoing problems in the property sector. Elhedery described the privatization move as part of the bank’s long-term view on Hong Kong. Meanwhile, HSBC shares in Hong Kong rose 1.3%, shrugging off the Madoff provision. But the overhang from this 15-year-old fraud saga isn’t over yet. The legal fees are rising. The court battles aren’t done. And HSBC’s CET1 just got a little thinner. All of this comes at a time when the bank’s core performance is actually holding up. Q3 revenue came in at $17.8 billion, ahead of the $17.05 billion estimate. But with litigation costs biting harder than ever, investors will be watching the next quarter for signs of whether this legal bill is a one-off… or the start of something longer.

This move has sparked heated debates in the tech ecosystem. When reporters reached out to an Amazon representative for comment on the topic, the representative declined to respond. Amazon decides on yet another layoff this year, sparking debates Industry analysts have conducted research and discovered that Amazon has been reducing jobs in various departments, including devices, podcasting, and communications, over the last two years. Following the recent job cuts, sources with knowledge of the situation noted that this move may impact several sectors, including human resources, known as People Experience, as well as technology, devices, services, and operations. They also hinted that the layoff will impact Amazon Web Services . To initiate the layoff, managers from the impacted teams received training on Monday, October 27, on how to communicate with employees once the email notifications began being sent out on Tuesday morning. While maintaining anonymity due to the confidential nature of the situation, sources close to the matter mentioned that Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, is establishing a plan to reduce what he views as excessive bureaucracy by decreasing the number of managers. They also shared that the CEO has set up an anonymous complaint line to identify inefficiencies, which has acquired about 1,500 responses and resulted in changes to processes surpassing 450 this year. This was after Jassy stated that adopting more AI tools in an operation might lead to additional job cuts, particularly by automating tasks that are performed repeatedly. Amazon’s decision has prompted analysts to weigh in on the topic. An example is Sky Canaves, a principal analyst on the retail and e-commerce desk at EMARKETER. Canaves claimed that the tech giant’s latest decision suggests the firm is probably experiencing sufficient productivity improvements from AI within corporate teams to justify reducing the number of workers. Canaves also reported that Amazon faces short-term pressure to balance its long-term investments in developing AI infrastructure. Notably, details on the total number of layoffs for this round were not immediately clear. Sources familiar with the matter noted that the numbers may change as the tech company adjusts its financial goals. Fortune previously reported that the human resources department might encounter a reduction of around 15%. Tech companies significantly reduce their workforce in the AI boom era A program initiated earlier this year to bring workers back to the office five days a week, one of the strictest in the tech industry, has not resulted in enough departures, according to two sources familiar with the matter. They cited this as another factor that has led to many layoffs. Regarding Amazon’s recent layoffs, the sources mentioned that workers who do not show up every day because they live far from the company’s corporate offices or for any other reason are apparently being told that they have voluntarily resigned from Amazon and must leave on their own without severance pay, which can save the firm money. This action reflects a growing trend among tech companies, which are embracing significant layoffs across their various departments. To support this claim, data from Layoffs.fyi, a website that tracks job cuts in the tech industry, revealed that approximately 98,000 jobs have been lost so far this year across 216 firms. This number accounts for approximately 153,000 job losses reported for the entire year of 2024. In the meantime, reports indicate that Amazon’s cloud computing division is its primary source of profit, with reported sales of $30.9 billion for the second quarter. This illustrates the company’s increasing adoption of AI in its operations as the technology becomes more widely adopted in the industry. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

Bitcoin retraced roughly 12% from its yearly peak, while Ethereum fell below key support levels, placing short-term pressure on major assets. Yet, amid this correction, investor interest began to revive, driven by emerging narratives across AI, DeFi, memecoins, and decentralized perpetual exchanges. Sectoral growth and renewed speculative interest became the defining features of the quarter. HTX, a global leading exchange, recently released its Q3 report for HTX Select (formerly known as the “Crypto Gem Hunt”), revealing that 38 quality assets were listed during the quarter. Several of these tokens delivered multi-fold gains after listing, underscoring HTX Select’s role as a key driver of wealth creation for platform users. Quarter Highlights: ASTER and AVNT Lead the Performance Charts HTX Select’s official data showed that Q3 listings delivered robust results, across multiple sectors spanning memecoins, DeFi, AI, Layer 1 and Layer 2 infrastructure, and derivatives DEX. Standout performers such as ASTER, AVNT, and M recorded an exceptional price increase, significantly boosting trading activity and new user growth on the platform. DeFi and Perp DEX projects emerged as the quarter’s strongest sectors. ASTER , a next-generation decentralized perpetual futures and spot trading platform, captured wide attention among professional traders through its innovative “no-MEV, low-slippage” architecture. The platform’s native token surged 525% post-listing, positioning itself as a leading name in the on-chain derivatives segment. In the broader DeFi landscape, Avantis (AVNT) stood out with its algorithmic yield aggregation model, soaring more than 14x from its initial listing price and becoming the top performer on HTX in Q3. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) , focusing on decentralized asset management and yield-bearing debt markets, introduced a novel “liquidity bond pool” model. WLFI gained steady institutional traction throughout the quarter. Meanwhile, FUNToken (FUN) , rooted in Web3 entertainment, features gaming and decentralized payments with a gamified, AI-powered rewards system. FUN rose 166.7% within the last quarter, showcasing solid user engagement and stable growth. The memecoin and AI sectors also regained momentum. MEMECORE (M) demonstrated the enduring viral power of memecoins, rising 435% following its listing thanks to strong branding and social resonance. Sahara AI (SAHARA) aims at decentralized AI compute sharing and model training to build a decentralized AI ecosystem. SAHARA climbed 135.2%, benefiting from the global resurgence of AI narratives. Layer 1 infrastructure assets also maintained long-term potential. 0G is a high-performance modular blockchain featuring parallel execution and designed to support AI and DeFi workloads. The token rallied from 2.4 USDT to 6 USDT, a 150% gain after its debut on HTX. Refined Strategy: Positioning for the Next Market Cycle HTX continues to strengthen its reputation as the go-to platform for discovering new quality digital assets, staying true to its core philosophy of “ Buy New Crypto Only on HTX .” The exchange’s listing strategy remains centered on early identification, early exposure, and early participation, enabling users to seize early-stage project opportunities. Amid rising enthusiasm for Chinese-language memecoin projects, HTX secured the initial listing of the viral “Binance Life” token for spot trading and launched a dedicated Chinese market section, catalyzing a new wave of “Chinese narrative” momentum across the industry. Looking ahead to Q4, the platform expects to roll out TGE listings across several infrastructure projects such as MONAD, extending its leadership in early-stage listings. HTX remains committed to swiftly listing high-quality assets at the earliest opportunity, leveraging its professional selection mechanism to help users secure a first-mover advantage in the new market cycle. From the Crypto Gem Hunt to today’s HTX Select, the evolution represents more than a name change for HTX. The platform will continue to discover and curate promising crypto assets globally. As the market transitions into a new cycle, HTX remains committed to empowering users to capture the next wave of digital wealth creation.

The company, which started two decades ago, has taken a major hit from AI-powered tools like ChatGPT that students now use instead of traditional homework help services. Chegg took legal action against Google in February, claiming that AI-generated answers appearing directly in search results have reduced the number of people visiting its website and hurt sales. On Monday, Chegg repeated these concerns, pointing to AI technology and fewer clicks coming from Google as the main problems hurting its performance. “As a result, and reflecting the company’s continued investment in AI, Chegg is restructuring the way it operates its academic learning products,” the company stated. This marks the second round of job cuts this year. Back in May as Cryptopolitan reported, the company let go of 22% of its workers, also blaming growing AI use for the decision. Leadership shakeup as company stays independent Along with the job cuts, Chegg announced that Dan Rosensweig will take over as CEO right away, replacing Nathan Schultz. Schultz will leave the CEO position but stay on as an advisor to Rosensweig and the board. The company also revealed plans to keep operating on its own, ending a review process that started earlier this year to explore other options. “After thoughtful consideration of multiple proposals, the board unanimously determined that remaining an independent public company offers the best opportunity to maximize long-term shareholder value,” the company explained. In April, Chegg faced possible removal from the New York Stock Exchange. The warning came when shares traded around 60 cents. Stocks staying under $1 for 30 straight trading days trigger these warnings. By May, the price climbed back above $1. Companies worldwide, from technology firms to airlines, have been cutting workers as AI’s real effects become clear, making employees nervous. However, some observers believe companies are using AI as a convenient reason for downsizing. Last month, consulting firm Accenture revealed a reorganization that pushes out workers who cannot quickly learn AI skills. Shortly after, Lufthansa announced plans to cut 4,000 positions by 2030 while using AI to improve operations. Salesforce eliminated 4,000 customer service jobs in September, saying AI handles 50% of company tasks. Payment company Klarna reduced its staff by 40% while adopting AI systems. Language app Duolingo said it would slowly stop using contract workers and rely on AI instead. Experts question if AI is real reason behind layoffs The news sounds bad, but Fabian Stephany, who teaches about AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, thinks there might be more behind these cuts than companies admit. Companies previously hesitated to discuss AI use, but now they are “scapegoating” the technology to justify difficult business moves like layoffs, he explained. “I’m really skeptical whether the layoffs that we see currently are really due to true efficiency gains. It’s rather really a projection into AI in the sense of ‘We can use AI to make good excuses,'” Stephany told CNBC. Companies can present themselves as technology leaders while hiding actual reasons for cutting jobs, according to Stephany. Pandemic overhiring may be true culprit Some businesses that grew during the pandemic like Duolingo or Klarna hired too many people during pandemic, and recent layoffs might simply be corrections. “It’s to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long term perspective and instead of saying ‘we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying ‘it’s because of AI though,'” he added. “At the same time there are announcements of big layoff plans ‘because of AI.’ It looks like a big excuse” said Bouglé, who helped start Authentic.ly. Despite the widespread concerns, recent research from Yale University suggests that AI’s impact on employment may be overstated, with job losses not materializing at the scale many executives predicted.

Key Takeaways: tZero plans a 2026 US IPO, betting on the rising demand for tokenized securities and regulated blockchain finance. CEO Alan Konevsky confirmed talks with banks and hinted at a new funding round as the company prepares its market debut. Tokenization could unlock a $400 trillion opportunity, with analysts projecting the RWA market to reach $16 trillion by 2030. The company announced plans on Monday to pursue a US listing, signaling confidence in the expanding market for asset tokenization and regulated blockchain finance. Founded in 2014, tZero enables firms to raise capital and trade tokenized securities under U.S. securities laws, bridging traditional finance with blockchain-based systems. tZero Weighs Bank Partners and New Funding Ahead of IPO Chief Executive Alan Konevsky told Bloomberg that tZero is in discussions with multiple banks to determine an underwriter. The firm, which employs slightly over 50 people and has yet to turn a profit, may also seek an additional funding round before its debut. So far, tZero has raised around $200 million, with the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, among its backers. The company said its public listing plan underscores a belief that tokenization will reshape capital markets by enabling faster, more transparent, and global transactions. Tokenization converts real-world assets such as stocks, real estate, or currencies into blockchain-based digital tokens that can trade around the clock. We’re pleased to be featured in @Bloomberg : “Tokenized Securities Market tZERO Is Readying 2026 IPO.” As CEO @Alan_Konevsky shared, @tZERO is preparing for its next phase – a planned IPO in 2026 – as we continue advancing regulated, blockchain-powered infrastructure for… — tZERO (@tZERO) October 27, 2025 In a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market. Animoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth. “The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote. Meanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 . Crypto IPOs Gain Momentum Last month, BitGo officially filed for an initial public offering , becoming the first dedicated crypto custodian to pursue a listing on a US stock exchange. BitGo’s IPO filing came amid renewed momentum for crypto-related public offerings. The digital asset space has seen several notable public listings in 2025. Stablecoin issuer Circle made a splash with its IPO in June, surging more than sevenfold since going public. Online trading platform Etoro , which offers crypto trading among its services, debuted in May. In addition, Galaxy Digital, led by Mike Novogratz, moved its listing from the Toronto Stock Exchange to Nasdaq earlier this year. Gemini, the exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, filed confidentially for a U.S. IPO in June, signaling strong market confidence in crypto exchanges going public. More recently, Figure Technology Solutions Inc., a blockchain-focused lending platform, raised $787.5 million in its initial public offering . The San Francisco-based company, alongside key backers including Ribbit Capital, sold 31.5 million shares at $25 apiece, valuing the firm at roughly $5.3 billion. Originally targeting a lower range, Figure increased both the share count and price just days before the listing, signaling strong investor demand.

Experts Expect Tuesday Launch Despite Goverment Shutdown",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-litecoin-hedera-etfs-ready-experts-expect-tuesday-launch-despite-goverment-shutdown/,"Multiple crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are set to launch this week despite the government shutdown, with investment products based on Solana (SOL), Litecoin (LTC), and Hedera (HBAR) seemingly ready to start trading as soon as Tuesday. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Shows The Possibility Of The Ethereum Price Reaching $16,000 Big Week For Crypto ETFs On Sunday night, Nate Geraci affirmed that the next two weeks will be key for the long-awaited spot crypto-based ETFs as Solana, XRP, LTC, and other ETF filings are “all lined up & ready for launch.” Similarly, Bitwise CEO, Hunter Horsley, hinted that this week would be a “Big week,” suggesting progress related to its Solana Staking ETF. It’s worth noting that the crypto community has been awaiting the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s approval of the investment products following the numerous ETF applications filed over the past few months. Between August and September, the regulatory agency postponed the decision deadline of most applications by two months, pushing back the key dates to mid-October and mid-November. However, the government’s shutdown, which started on October 1, reduced the odds of the products receiving a green line during the expected timeline. On Monday morning, ETF expert Erich Balchunas reported that multiple issuers were looking to launch their crypto-based ETFs this week, despite the government shutdown. According to the Bloomberg analyst, Canary Capital had filed 8-A forms for its spot Litecoin and Hedera ETFs, while Bitwise had filed one for its Solana Staking ETF. “These are the ones rumored to be poss looking to launch (along w Grayscale solana) this week despite shutdown. Not a done deal but clearly preparations being made. Stay tuned,” Balchunas stated. Solana, Litecoin, Hedera Products Take The Lead Later, Balchunas confirmed the reports that the exchange had posted listing notices for Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF, and Canary’s LTC and HBAR ETFs to launch on October 28, while Grayscale’s Solana trust is set to convert on Wednesday. “Assuming there’s not some last min SEC intervention, looks like this is happening,” the analyst added. Crypto Journalist Eleanor Terret also shared the news, citing Canary’s CEO, Steven McClurg, who confirmed that the Canary spot HBAR and LTC ETFs will begin trading on Nasdaq on Tuesday. “Litecoin and Hedera are the next two token ETFs to go effective after Ethereum,” McClurg told the journalist in a statement. “We look forward to launching tomorrow.” Terret explained that despite the government shutdown, the launch is possible because “the operation of law does not always actually require an open government.” Related Reading: Ethereum Moves Higher — Buyers Strengthen Grip Amid Renewed Market Optimism According to the post, the 8-A forms are “just as important” as the S-1s filings: the former formally registers ETF shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, while the latter registers the investment products under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. After NYSE certified all the 8-A filings for the ETFs above on Monday, shares can start trading, Terret affirmed, adding: “Here’s the key: The issuers included language in their amended S-1s that lets them automatically go effective 20 days after filing. Typically, issuers delay S-1s until the SEC takes them effective, but the legal default is that the S-1 goes automatically effective without SEC intervention. That means the agency doesn’t need to approve them manually and the filings can go live on their own, even during the shutdown. So, long story short, all the legal boxes are checked and these ETFs are on track for launch.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|Bitwise CEO|Bitwise SOL ETF|Canary Capital|Canary HBAR ETF|Canary LTC ETF|Crypto ETFs|crypto exchange-traded funds|Grayscale Solana Trust|Sol|Solana|Solana staking ETF|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,LTC|REGULATION|SOL|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-10-28 08:00:00

As reported by Bitcoinist, Financial Services Commission (FSC) Chairman Lee Eun-won recently confirmed that the regulatory agency plans to submit the second phase of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act to the National Assembly this year, which will follow US regulatory steps and include a ban on stablecoin interest payment. The BOK report affirmed that the promise behind stablecoin raises unrealistic expectations in the market, arguing that “The pledge of ‘1 coin equals 1 won’ is merely a private agreement between issuers and users and is not legally or institutionally guaranteed by the central bank.” “If the issuer fails to keep the redemption promise, stablecoin holders, unlike bank depositors, are not protected under relevant laws,” the BOK added . It warned that these tokens are “prone to deppeging,” citing greater concerns for non-dollar stablecoins, where the risk is higher due to thinner liquidity. Additionally, the central bank highlighted the gaps in consumer protection laws and the potential that these tokens could “enable regulatory evasion and capital flight, weaken the effectiveness of monetary policy and undermine banks’ traditional role as financial intermediaries.” A Bank-Led Model For Won-Pegged Stablecoins Amid the potential risks, the BOK considers that “trust is crucial to reliably support innovation, so institutional safeguards are necessary.” It reiterated that stablecoin issuance must be led and strictly regulated by banks to ensure reliability and public trust. In July, BOK Governor Lee Chang-yong expressed concerns about the potential issuance of stablecoins pegged to the Korean Won by non-bank entities, arguing that they could confuse monetary policies and foreign exchange regulations. “If banks become the main issuers of stablecoins, or if stablecoins are issued through bank-led consortia, many of these associated risks could be managed under the current regulatory framework,” the Monday report explained. “Non-banking companies, such as IT firms, can also participate in bank-centered consortia to drive innovation and growth.” Notably, financial institutions in Korea have been preparing for two potential legalization scenarios over the past few months, as it has been unclear if non-bank entities will be allowed to issue the digital assets. The sector has reportedly explored a business model in which banks establish a joint venture to collectively issue stablecoins, while also contacting various non-bank companies to prepare for the upcoming framework. Kim Chul, head of the BOK’s Payment & Settlement Systems Department, stated that under this approach, regulators can closely monitor the sector’s scale and maintain stability, “allowing this new form of currency to take root within the formal financial system.” Another BOK official added that “stablecoin legislation is moving quickly, and we hope this report serves as a key reference for those discussions.” Ultimately, the central bank called for a joint policy council among monetary, foreign exchange, and financial authorities.",Crypto News|Bank of Korea|Bank of Korea Crypto|bitcoin|BOK|btc|BTCUSDT|South korea stablecoins|Stablecoin framework|Stablecoin Issuers|Stablecoin Legislation,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-28 08:00:10

He revealed that he bought $55,000 worth of BYND at $7 a share, which is now trading below $2. The investor called the investment a bet on belief, not just money, after it wiped out more than 70% of his investment. The trader has acknowledged that $7 may never come back but vowed to make BYND go viral to turn it into a grassroots movement. Critics have called the move delusional. BYND stock plummets nearly 98% from its IPO high BYND stock was down t o $1.72 at publication, with a market cap of $ 719.63 million and an average daily volume of 364.02 million. Its 2019 IPO was among Wall Street’s most explosive; its stock skyrocketed from $25 to nearly $240 before consolidating at around $190. The firm received a valuation of $14 billion following the IPO. Consumers began to lose interest in the pricey faux beef, causing the margins to shrink. By October 2025, the firm had lost almost 98% of its value. The downfall triggered a massive debt exchange that diluted the value of shareholders. Reuters reported in late September that the plant-based meat maker had swapped over $1.15 billion in debt for new 7% notes due 2030 plus 316 million new shares. That meant if all holders converted the shares, they would own almost 88% of the company. TD Cowen Analysts Have already slashed their price target for the BYND stock to $0.80 after maintaining a ‘Sell’ rating and warning of an existential risk. The stock’s market cap has plunged to under $800 million, and revenue estimates for Q3 are down nearly 14% year over year to just $69 million. The investor’s post, shared across online platforms, quickly went viral within meme-trading circles. If the price hits $10, he plans to fly to Beyond Meat’s HQ, host a ‘BYND Day’ at $30, and launch a global shareholder gathering called ‘The Beyond Feast’ if the stock ever hits $200 again. BYND’s 130% spike last week masks deep financial trouble Stock sensationalization through memes has proven to move the market. Just last week, a viral post on X declared that BYND stock will replicate GME’s 2021 short squeeze, sparking a trend on online forums like WallStreetBets and Stockwits about a potential short squeeze. The BYND stock jumped over 130% intraday, trading more than 30 times its average volume, with over 700 million shares changing hands in a single session. The stock jumped to $6.77 on October 22. Despite the brief surge last week, Beyond Meat’s financial burden remains dire, as the firm is still losing money. The surge lasted only a few hours before tumbling to lower lows this week due to shrinking sales and rising debt costs. The restructuring in late September only bought them time, but at the price of almost total shareholder dilution. According to Q2 financial filings , Beyond Meat held around $1.14 billion in convertible notes and $691 million in net assets. Net revenues were $75 million, representing a 19.6% decrease year over year, and Gross profit was $8.6 million, representing a gross margin of 11.5%, compared to a gross profit of $13.7 million a year ago. Q3 financial results are expected to be released on November 1 with revenue estimates of $69 million. Beyon Meat’s debt burden remains steep, even after the exchange; the new notes now carry a 7% interest rate, which further raises upcoming costs. For JIN_ius, the investment has become less about returns and more about symbolism, trying to prove that belief, community, and brand value can survive anything. For now, consumer enthusiasm towards Beyond Meat’s brand, which was once stocked by McDonald’s and KFC, appears to have waned as demand for the plant-based protein weakens.

However, Generali Investments predicts that this decision could be made through a “three-way split” vote. According to the institution, one member could vote for a larger 50 basis point cut, while others could vote to keep interest rates steady. This could create an “almost unprecedented divide of opinion,” said Paul Zanghieri, Senior Economist at Generali Investments.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to describe the cut as a “risk management measure” at his press conference, but will not provide policy guidance for the December meeting. Analysts at research firm Wrightson suggested that the Fed may be ready to end its quantitative tightening process this week.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/technical-analyst-xrp-to-double-digits-is-inevitable-heres-why/,"Crypto analyst ChartNerd has presented a detailed monthly chart for XRP, outlining a clear technical structure that spans several market cycles. The chart illustrates XRP’s price movement within a long-standing ascending channel, marking out both the lower and upper bounds of potential long-term activity. Within this structure, the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the monthly timeframe has been highlighted as a crucial support level positioned around $0.85. ChartNerd’s analysis suggests that even in the event of a market correction, this EMA represents a likely area of stability. The analyst also indicates that the top boundary of the channel projects toward a double-digit value, identifying approximately $10.50 as the primary upside target. This projection aligns with the view that XRP remains in an extended accumulation phase ahead of its next major market expansion . $XRP to double digits is inevitable. https://t.co/D87aFq2a63 pic.twitter.com/LNmf6qOzYy — ChartNerd (@ChartNerdTA) October 25, 2025 Community Reaction and Reinforcing Views In response to the chart, market participant X Finance Bull remarked that double-digit valuations for XRP are not an unrealistic expectation but rather a matter of mathematical progression and patience. The comment echoes ChartNerd’s perspective that XRP’s trajectory remains structurally aligned with an eventual move into higher valuation zones, assuming broader market conditions remain supportive. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The analysis also connects to a separate post from Egrag, who reaffirmed his stance on XRP’s technical position. He pointed to the same $0.85 level on the monthly 100 EMA as the logical downside area in a bear market. According to Egrag, this range represents a strong foundation for the asset’s next phase, while the upside goal remains fixed at $10 . He expressed conviction in maintaining his position through volatility, emphasizing that the long-term structure remains intact and that the next major leg could redefine investor expectations. Technical Context and Broader Implications The consistency of this framework across multiple analysts reflects a shared technical interpretation of XRP’s current phase. The monthly structure has remained intact through several years of price development, with XRP holding above major moving averages and repeatedly testing mid-channel resistance levels. ChartNerd’s model, therefore, offers a basis for evaluating both near-term resilience and future potential within a broader market cycle. For long-term investors , the takeaway from ChartNerd’s chart lies in the balance between downside protection and upside potential. With $0.85 marked as the primary structural floor and the $10 region positioned as the projected ceiling, XRP’s chart conveys a well-defined range that may guide positioning in upcoming market cycles.

Valued at approximately $247 million, this significant movement of Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin, has naturally ignited widespread speculation across the crypto community. When such a substantial amount of USDT transferred occurs, it often signals potential shifts in market dynamics, prompting investors and analysts alike to ponder the implications. What Does This Massive USDT Transferred Mean for the Market? A transfer of this magnitude isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a powerful signal. Typically, large stablecoin inflows to exchanges like Binance can suggest a few key scenarios. Firstly, it could indicate an intent to purchase other cryptocurrencies. Traders often move stablecoins onto exchanges when they are preparing to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, or altcoins, seeking to capitalize on perceived market opportunities. This could be a bullish indicator, suggesting that a large investor, or “whale,” is positioning themselves for an accumulation phase. Conversely, a substantial USDT transferred to an exchange might also precede a significant sell-off. Whales might be moving their stablecoins onto the exchange to convert them into fiat currency or to use them in an over-the-counter (OTC) deal. Such a move could potentially exert selling pressure on the market, depending on the whale’s subsequent actions. It’s crucial to remember that these transfers are just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Why Are Large USDT Transfers to Binance So Important? Binance holds its position as one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, making it a central hub for liquidity and trading activity. Any major movement of funds, especially stablecoins like Tether, to or from Binance warrants close attention. The sheer volume of this USDT transferred transaction underscores the potential impact it could have on market sentiment and price action. Liquidity Preparation: Whales often consolidate funds on major exchanges to ensure sufficient liquidity for their trading strategies. Market Sentiment Indicator: These transfers are closely watched as proxies for institutional or large-investor sentiment. Impact on Order Books: A sudden influx of stablecoins can influence the depth and dynamics of order books for various trading pairs. Understanding the context behind such a significant USDT transferred event requires looking beyond just the transaction itself. It involves analyzing broader market trends, prevailing economic conditions, and even geopolitical events that might influence whale behavior. These large-scale movements are rarely random and often reflect strategic decisions by major market participants. Navigating the Implications of Significant USDT Transferred Activity For everyday investors, tracking these large whale movements can offer valuable insights, but it’s essential not to overreact to a single data point. While a 246 million USDT transferred is undoubtedly noteworthy, its ultimate impact depends on the subsequent actions of the wallet holder. Is this whale preparing to deploy capital into the market, signaling confidence, or are they de-risking and moving funds off-exchange? Only time, and further on-chain analysis, will tell. These transfers highlight the transparency inherent in blockchain technology. Tools like Whale Alert leverage this transparency to provide real-time updates on significant transactions, offering a glimpse into the movements of large capital within the crypto ecosystem. This level of insight empowers investors to make more informed decisions, though it should always be combined with a comprehensive understanding of market fundamentals and technical analysis. What Should Investors Watch After This USDT Transferred Event? Following such a substantial USDT transferred to Binance, investors should keep an eye on several key indicators: Exchange Flow Data: Monitor net exchange flows for Bitcoin and other major altcoins. An increase in buying pressure might confirm an accumulation thesis. Bitcoin Dominance: Changes in Bitcoin’s market dominance can sometimes correlate with whale movements, indicating shifts in overall market strategy. Funding Rates: Fluctuations in perpetual futures funding rates can offer clues about market sentiment and potential leverage positions. News & Announcements: Stay informed about any major news from Binance or Tether that might provide context for such large transfers. Ultimately, while tracking whale movements can be fascinating, it’s just one piece of the puzzle. A diversified portfolio, a clear investment strategy, and continuous education remain the cornerstones of successful cryptocurrency investing. Don’t let a single large USDT transferred event dictate your entire strategy, but rather use it as an additional data point for your analysis. In conclusion, the recent 246 million USDT transferred to Binance from an unknown wallet is a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency markets. Whether it signals an impending buying spree or a strategic de-risking, such movements are crucial for understanding the flow of capital and potential market shifts. By staying informed and adopting a balanced perspective, investors can better navigate the exciting, yet volatile, world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is USDT? A1: USDT , or Tether, is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization. It is pegged to the US dollar, meaning its value is intended to remain stable at $1.00. It plays a crucial role in the crypto market by providing liquidity and a stable medium for traders to move in and out of volatile cryptocurrencies. Q2: What is Binance? A2: Binance is one of the world’s largest and most popular cryptocurrency exchanges. It offers a wide range of services, including trading various cryptocurrencies, derivatives, staking, and more. Its significant trading volume makes it a key player in global crypto markets. Q3: What is a “whale” in cryptocurrency? A3: In the cryptocurrency context, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Their significant holdings mean their transactions can often have a noticeable impact on market prices and sentiment. Q4: Why are large stablecoin transfers to exchanges significant? A4: Large stablecoin transfers to exchanges, such as the USDT transferred in this case, are significant because they often precede major trading activity. They can indicate an intention to either buy large quantities of other cryptocurrencies (injecting capital into the market) or to sell existing holdings (potentially increasing selling pressure). Q5: How can I track these large cryptocurrency transfers? A5: You can track large cryptocurrency transfers using various on-chain analytics platforms and services. Whale Alert , as mentioned in the article, is a prominent example that reports significant transactions across different blockchains and exchanges in real-time.

Bitcoin’s open interest, which tracks the total value of all open derivatives positions in Bitcoin futures, has historically always closely followed Bitcoin’s price – to the point that it would be fair to consider it a precursor to rising Bitcoin prices. It’s now closing in on the $40B mark , having risen sharply from around $35.3B after the October 10 liquidation event. This is a strong indicator that the larger market has grown incredibly bullish on Bitcoin and crypto in general. Easily the biggest reason behind this building momentum is the upcoming Federal Reserve rate cut decision. According to prediction market Polymarket, there’s a 98% chance the Fed will slash rates by 25 basis points , marking its second rate cut this year after the first one, which came just last month. It’s worth noting that the reason the market expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates is because of last week’s CPI and PMI data, both of which came in quite poor. For instance, the U.S. inflation report for September showed CPI at 3% , which was lower than expected, suggesting that the economy is slowing down and possibly heading toward a recession. And that is precisely why a rate cut now becomes necessary. Needless to say, this would be an incredibly bullish event for crypto, as reduced interest rates make borrowing cheaper – pushing investors to seek higher returns in risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, which consequently become more attractive. Looking for the best cryptos to buy now to make the most of this increasing bullishness? Consider grabbing low-cap coins , as they’re well-positioned to churn out outsized returns come a crypto rally. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bringing Solana’s Speed, Scalability & Web3 to Bitcoin Know what’s better than stacking up leveraged positions on Bitcoin to maximize your gains? Backing a BTC-themed altcoin with the potential to become the next 1000x crypto . Enter Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . It’s a new Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that integrates with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to bring Solana-like speed, affordability, and Web3 compatibility to the Bitcoin blockchain. $HYPER will execute thousands of transactions in parallel, finally solving one of Bitcoin’s long-standing issues – low throughput. Currently, Bitcoin’s single-threaded processing system handles just 7 TPS, making it one of the slowest blockchains in the world. By leveraging the SVM, developers will now be able to build smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) on Bitcoin without compromising its unmatched security. This means you’ll soon be able to access high-speed DeFi trading apps, NFTs, DAOs, governance tools, lending, staking, and gaming dApps on Bitcoin. To use these, you’ll need to convert your Layer 1 Bitcoin into wrapped, Layer 2-compatible tokens via Bitcoin Hyper’s non-custodial canonical bridge. According to our $HYPER price prediction , the token could skyrocket after listing, potentially soaring 1,400% by the end of 2026 to around $0.20, up from its current $0.013185. The project’s presale has already raised over $25M from early investors. Here’s how to buy Bitcoin Hyper . Ride the Bitcoin Web3 revolution – grab your $HYPER tokens today! 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) – Doge’s Nemesis & Cousin Gunning for 1000x Gains Did you miss out on Dogecoin’s initial pumps? Well then, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is one of the best cryptos to watch . It offers a rare opportunity to turn back the clock and ride the kind of massive rallies that Dog-themed cryptos like Dogecoin, Bonk, and Shiba Inu saw in their early days. $MAXI is Dogecoin’s distant cousin, but despite its obvious resemblance to the OG meme coin, under the hood, Maxi isn’t – and doesn’t even want to be – anything like its cousin. That’s because, growing up, Doge hogged all the spotlight wherever it went, even at family gatherings. So, Maxi grew up lonely and depressed. To get revenge, $MAXI hit the gym, bulked up on caffeine shots and protein shakes, and spent day and night crafting the perfect plan to overthrow Dogecoin as the best meme coin on the planet. Its master plan? To go viral and spread its gym-bro humor across the crypto landscape. To fuel that mission, $MAXI has allocated a massive 40% of its total token supply for marketing, including influencer collaborations, social media blitzes, and PR campaigns. On top of that, $MAXI also plans to list on futures platforms to boost visibility, ramp up trading volumes, and become the go-to meme coin for day traders looking to take leveraged bets and chase whale-like returns. Here’s the kicker : If you buy $MAXI now , while it’s available for just $0.000265, you could potentially make a 2,000% ROI by the end of 2026 – according to our $MAXI price prediction . Join the $MAXI presale – and be part of the ultimate meme coin revenge story. 3. MemeCore ($M) – Viral Meme Coin Aiming to Inject Utility Into Meme Coins Having launched very recently – in July 2025 – MemeCore ($M) has quickly become one of the biggest meme coin success stories of all time. It’s currently the fourth-largest meme coin in the world by market cap, and for good reason. After all, MemeCore offers a never-before-seen ecosystem for meme coins, which it proudly refers to as Meme 2.0. Under this vision, the plan is to transform meme coins – which are presently seen as just speculative, fun-loving, and engaging tokens – into full-blown vehicles for community coordination, culture, and even value creation. How will MemeCore achieve this? Through its novel Proof-of-Meme consensus layer, which rewards both cultural and on-chain participation. The ultimate goal is to empower everyday users to launch their own meme coins, earn from the cultural contributions that follow, and build freely without any restrictions. On the charts, $M looks super positive. It has recently broken out of a downward-sloping resistance line and now looks primed for a push toward its current all-time highs of around $3 – a chunky 35% gain from current levels. That said, the last time MemeCore broke out of a similar downward-sloping resistance line, it skyrocketed over 500%. And given that it’s still in its early stages, there’s a strong likelihood we could see something similar once again. Interested? Grab your $M tokens on CoinFutures today . Recap : With Bitcoin open interest climbing and signaling the potential start of the next crypto run-up, now’s the time to go shopping for the best altcoins – Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , and MemeCore ($M).

According to Whale Alert, a well-known blockchain transaction tracker, a substantial 2,126 BTC moved from Binance , one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, to Ceffu . This transaction is valued at approximately $243 million, highlighting the scale of funds at play in the institutional crypto space. Such movements often spark discussions about market sentiment and the activities of major players. What Does This Large Bitcoin Transfer Signify? When we see a large Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude, it’s natural to wonder about the underlying reasons. Ceffu is not just any wallet; it is Binance’s institutional-grade custody solution. This means Ceffu is designed to provide secure, compliant, and scalable digital asset services specifically for institutional clients. Therefore, this transfer is less likely to be a speculative retail trade and more indicative of strategic institutional activity. Enhanced Security: Institutions often move assets to dedicated custody solutions like Ceffu for increased security measures beyond what a typical exchange hot wallet offers. Operational Rebalancing: It could be part of an internal rebalancing effort, moving assets between different operational wallets or cold storage. Client Onboarding: Ceffu might be onboarding new institutional clients who are depositing funds, or existing clients adjusting their holdings. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large, private transactions often involve moving funds to a secure custody provider before or after an OTC deal is finalized. Understanding Institutional Crypto Movements Institutional participation in the crypto market is growing, and with it, the need for robust infrastructure. A large Bitcoin transfer to a custody solution like Ceffu underscores this trend. Unlike individual investors who might keep their crypto on an exchange for easy trading, institutions prioritize security, regulatory compliance, and robust risk management frameworks. Ceffu offers features tailored for these needs, including multi-party computation (MPC) technology and a comprehensive compliance framework. These ‘whale’ movements, while sometimes causing speculation, are often routine for large entities managing significant portfolios. They are a sign of the market maturing, as professional investors and firms increasingly integrate digital assets into their strategies. Tracking these movements through services like Whale Alert provides a layer of transparency into the otherwise opaque world of institutional finance. Market Implications and Transparency While a large Bitcoin transfer can sometimes trigger concerns about potential selling pressure, a move to a custody solution like Ceffu typically suggests the opposite. It implies a long-term holding strategy or preparation for a secure, controlled transaction rather than an immediate sell-off. The transparency offered by blockchain analytics firms like Whale Alert is crucial in interpreting these events accurately. Such transfers highlight: The increasing demand for secure, institutional-grade custody solutions. The growing confidence of large investors in Bitcoin as a long-term asset. The ongoing evolution of the cryptocurrency ecosystem to support sophisticated financial operations. These movements are not just about the numbers; they reflect the shifting landscape where traditional finance and digital assets are increasingly intertwined, demanding secure and reliable infrastructure for managing significant wealth. The Future of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The movement of 2,126 BTC to Ceffu is more than just a transaction; it’s a testament to the ongoing institutional embrace of Bitcoin . As more corporations, hedge funds, and asset managers look to allocate capital to digital assets, the demand for secure, compliant, and scalable solutions will only grow. Ceffu, as a leading institutional custody provider, is at the forefront of facilitating this transition. This large Bitcoin transfer reinforces the narrative that Bitcoin is solidifying its position as a legitimate asset class within the broader financial ecosystem. It speaks to a future where institutional participation becomes the norm, driving further innovation and stability in the crypto markets. Monitoring these significant movements offers valuable insights into the health and direction of institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. In conclusion, the recent large Bitcoin transfer from Binance to Ceffu, as reported by Whale Alert, is a powerful indicator of institutional confidence and the ongoing professionalization of the crypto market. It underscores the critical role of secure custody solutions in facilitating significant asset movements for major players. Far from signaling immediate market shifts, such transfers typically point towards strategic, long-term asset management and the deepening integration of digital assets into global finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ceffu? A1: Ceffu is Binance ‘s institutional-grade digital asset custody solution. It provides secure, compliant, and scalable services for institutional clients, focusing on security, risk management, and regulatory adherence. Q2: Why do large Bitcoin transfer movements happen between exchanges and custody solutions? A2: Such transfers often occur for enhanced security, operational rebalancing of assets, onboarding new institutional clients, or facilitating large over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Custody solutions offer a higher level of security and compliance tailored for institutional needs. Q3: Does a large Bitcoin transfer always mean selling? A3: Not necessarily. While some large transfers might precede selling, a move to an institutional custody solution like Ceffu more often indicates a strategic long-term hold, a security measure, or preparation for a private transaction rather than an immediate market sell-off. Q4: How can I track crypto whale movements? A4: Services like Whale Alert specialize in tracking and reporting significant cryptocurrency transactions across various blockchains. These platforms provide real-time updates on large transfers, offering insights into potential institutional or major investor activity.

While algorithmic trading bots have long been part of the crypto landscape, a different type of AI tool is gaining traction among serious traders: large language models specifically designed for analytical work. Among these, Anthropic's Claude has emerged as a particularly valuable resource for traders who need to process vast amounts of information quickly and accurately. The Information Overload Problem in Crypto Cryptocurrency markets operate 24/7 across hundreds of exchanges, with thousands of tokens and continuous streams of news, on-chain data, technical updates, and social sentiment. A single trading decision might require analyzing white papers, audit reports, GitHub activity, market correlations, regulatory developments, and community discussions—all while prices move in real-time. Traditional research methods simply can't keep pace. Traders who manually read through documentation, cross-reference multiple data sources, and synthesize complex information often find themselves hours behind the market. This is where AI assistants have started to prove their worth, particularly for the analytical heavy lifting that defines professional crypto trading. Why Language Models Matter for Trading At first glance, AI chatbots might seem more suited to creative writing than financial analysis. However, the core capabilities of advanced language models—reading comprehension, pattern recognition, logical reasoning, and synthesis of complex information—align remarkably well with the cognitive tasks traders perform daily. Consider a common scenario: A trader wants to evaluate a new DeFi protocol before investing. This requires reading a technical whitepaper, understanding the tokenomics model, reviewing the smart contract audit, assessing the team's background, analyzing competitive positioning, and evaluating community sentiment. Each of these tasks involves processing dense, technical information and connecting insights across multiple domains. Language models can accelerate this process dramatically by summarizing lengthy documents, extracting key risk factors, comparing protocols, and highlighting inconsistencies or red flags—all while maintaining the nuanced understanding needed for financial decision-making. Claude's Specific Advantages for Crypto Analysis Among the available AI assistants, Claude has developed a strong following in the crypto trading community for several specific reasons related to how it processes information. Long-Context Processing: One of Claude's standout capabilities is its ability to handle extremely long documents—up to 200,000 tokens, equivalent to roughly 150,000 words or a 500-page book. For crypto traders, this means being able to upload entire whitepapers, multiple audit reports, or lengthy governance proposals and receive coherent analysis without the AI ""forgetting"" earlier sections. This is particularly valuable when analyzing complex DeFi protocols with extensive documentation. Accuracy Over Speed: While some AI models prioritize quick, creative responses, Claude is designed with a stronger emphasis on factual accuracy and careful reasoning. In trading contexts where a misunderstood mechanism or overlooked risk can lead to significant financial loss, this conservative approach to information processing becomes a meaningful advantage. Traders report that Claude is more likely to acknowledge uncertainty or request clarification rather than confidently providing incorrect analysis. Structured Analysis: Crypto trading decisions often require breaking down complex systems into understandable components—separating tokenomics from governance mechanisms, distinguishing between technical risks and market risks, or comparing multiple protocols across consistent criteria. Claude's tendency to provide well-structured, methodical responses aligns well with this analytical approach, making it easier for traders to incorporate AI-generated insights into their decision frameworks. Technical Document Comprehension: Blockchain technology is inherently technical, involving cryptographic concepts, consensus mechanisms, smart contract logic, and protocol specifications. Claude demonstrates strong performance in understanding and explaining technical documentation, which is crucial when evaluating whether a protocol's architecture actually delivers on its promises. Practical Applications in Crypto Trading Experienced traders are integrating Claude into their workflows in several specific ways: Due Diligence Acceleration: Before entering positions, traders upload project documentation and ask Claude to identify potential red flags, summarize risk factors, or compare the protocol to similar projects. This doesn't replace human judgment but significantly speeds up the initial research phase. Market Context Synthesis: Traders provide Claude with multiple news articles, analyst reports, and data snippets, then ask for synthesis of the broader market narrative. This helps identify consensus views, contrarian positions, and information gaps worth investigating further. Smart Contract Logic Review: While Claude doesn't replace professional security audits, traders use it to understand what smart contract code is designed to do, identify potential vulnerabilities in logic, and compare implementation against stated specifications. Tokenomics Modeling: Traders work with Claude to model token emission schedules, analyze vesting periods, calculate potential dilution, and stress-test economic models under different scenarios—all crucial for understanding long-term price dynamics. Governance Proposal Analysis: In DAOs and DeFi protocols, traders must evaluate complex governance proposals. Claude can summarize lengthy proposals, identify potential consequences, and compare current proposals to similar past decisions. Limitations and Realistic Expectations It's important to note that Claude, like all AI tools, has significant limitations for trading applications. It cannot access real-time market data, execute trades, or predict price movements. It doesn't have internet browsing capabilities in its standard form, meaning it can't pull current news or verify the latest information. Most importantly, Claude provides analysis and reasoning support—not trading signals or financial advice. Successful traders view it as a research assistant that helps process information faster and more thoroughly, not as an oracle that generates trading decisions. The human trader still needs domain expertise, market intuition, risk management discipline, and the judgment to know when AI analysis might be missing important context. For those interested in understanding Claude's full capabilities and limitations in more detail, a comprehensive review of claude examining its performance across different use cases can provide valuable context for setting appropriate expectations. The Broader Trend: AI as Research Infrastructure The adoption of Claude and similar tools among crypto traders reflects a broader shift in how professional market participants approach information processing. As markets become more complex and information velocity increases, the ability to rapidly synthesize and analyze data becomes as important as traditional trading skills. This doesn't mean AI is replacing traders—rather, it's changing the nature of the trader's work. Less time spent on mechanical information processing means more time for strategic thinking, risk assessment, and the creative pattern recognition that humans still do better than machines. The crypto traders finding the most value in AI tools are those who view them as collaborative research partners rather than autonomous decision-makers. They're using AI to handle the ""heavy lifting"" of document analysis and information synthesis, while preserving human judgment for the parts of trading that require intuition, experience, and understanding of market psychology. As both AI capabilities and crypto markets continue to evolve, this partnership between human expertise and machine processing power will likely become not just an advantage, but a necessity for remaining competitive in increasingly sophisticated markets.

KR1 expects to be listed by next month, with Co-founder Keld Van Schreven calling it “a starter gun for this new asset class on the LSE” in a conversation with the Financial Times. He added that more digital asset firms could follow suit, viewing KR1’s transition as a bellwether for deeper crypto integration into London’s financial core. With a market capitalisation of roughly £56 million, or around $75 million, KR1 will become the first “authentic digital asset company” to get listed on the LSE’s main market. KR1 is headquartered in Douglas, Isle of Man, and is currently listed on the smaller Aquis Stock Exchange, so this transition to the LSE would allow the company access to deeper capital pools. Founded in 2014, KR1 has carved out a reputation as an early-stage investor in blockchain protocols. Unlike many public companies that primarily hold digital assets like Bitcoin, KR1 focuses on strategic investments in blockchain infrastructure and decentralised technologies, having backed more than 100 projects to date. A huge portion of the company’s revenue is generated from its staking activities, with Ethereum and Polkadot among its core holdings. Schreven has confirmed the company will be “doubling down” on staking as a long-term revenue stream. UK recalibrates crypto stance Over the past years, regulators in the UK have taken visible steps to modernise financial frameworks, including granting permissions for crypto exchange-traded products to begin trading on the LSE. Authorities are also laying the groundwork for a broader digital asset regime, with full implementation expected in 2026. Meanwhile, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority has accelerated its registration process for crypto firms in recent months by cutting average approval times that would once have taken more than a year. Once seen as a bottleneck for innovation, the regulator is now engaging more directly with applicants and has offered clearer pre-application guidance alongside hosting public roundtables to reduce friction in the approval pipeline. At an international level, the UK is working closely with the United States through the newly formed Transatlantic Task Force for Markets of the Future, which has been tasked with drafting shared proposals on digital asset regulation and capital-market reform within a six-month window. Efforts to define stablecoin oversight are also underway, with a joint resolution regime being crafted by the BoE and the UK Treasury. At the same time, the Bank of England is taking a more cautious approach to systemic risks that stem from stablecoin use. BoE Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden has confirmed the BoE’s intention to keep the current holding caps for fiat-pegged digital assets in place until the central bank is confident they do not threaten the credit creation role of commercial banks.

The amendment follows complex regulatory frameworks, which ensure all legal and compliance aspects are fully covered before the VanEck spot Solana ETF can be offered to the public. The approval for VanExk’s spot Solana ETF has stalled since the federal government shut down on October 1. However, the SEC is still operating under limited capacity. The SEC’s approval of the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF in January last year paved the way for other ETFs to be listed and traded by firms including BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, ARK Investment, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Fidelity, Valkyrie, VanEck, Hashdex, Invesco Galaxy, and Franklin Templeton. Approximately 16 ETFs were awaiting SEC approval this month, linked to various altcoins, including SOL, LTC, and Dogecoin. Thomas Uhm, Chief Operating Officer of Solana-based liquid staking and MEV protocol Jito, revealed that Solana ETF approvals are just the beginning. “We’re already working with tier 1 investment banks on products related to these ETFs and on accumulation strategies using staked Solana ETF options.” -Thomas Uhm, COO of Jito. Other Solana institutions are also showing interest in SOL, with Bitwise and Canary Capital confirming their individual Solana ETFs will debut on October 28 amid weeks of regulatory uncertainty. Bitwise’s head of research, Ryan Rasmussen, revealed the firm’s SOL ETF, denoted by the ticker BSOL, signaling an institutional gateway into the Solana ecosystem. Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF aims to leverage SOL’s 7% average staking reward rate, while targeting 100% of assets staked. The investment firm also revealed that staking will be via Bitwise Onchain Solutions, powered by Helius Labs, with 0% fees and a waiver for a limited period. Bitwise acknowledged that Solna is a key platform for enabling capital markets to come on-chain. Grayscale has also revealed its SOL ETF under the ticker GSOL, arguing that it’s the U.S.’s largest publicly traded spot Solana fund. The fund already offers exposure to Solana in certain U.S. brokerage accounts, featuring staking capabilities. Hong Kong also debuted its first Solana ETF on Monday, making Asia’s first SOL fund. SOL’s price surges amid ETF approvals At the time of publication, Solana is trading at $202.34, up more than 1.16% in the last 24 hours. SOL has surged by 3.62% in the last 7 days, driven by the anticipation of Solana ETF approvals this week. Crypto analyst Marty Party projected that Solana will climb higher following the launch of the Solana ETFs. He called out Binance for price manipulation, noting that the exchange had sold high-leverage long positions with resulting liquidations. The crypto analyst also alleged that Binance will use market makers to wash trade the price lower and liquidate late longs. Cryptopolitan reported earlier that Canary Capital submitted 8-As on Monday for Litecoin and HBAR ETFs, joining the race to establish altcoin funds before the end of the year. Both funds are also expected to launch this week, with a management fee of 0.95%. The Litecoin ETF will trade under the ticker LTCC, while the Hedera ETF will trade under the ticker HBR.

Comparing it to Shiba Inu (SHIB) at its breakout starting point, Mutuum Finance could be the top crypto this year. Early investors who invested in SHIB got rich from small initial investments when it blew through over 1,000,000% from its initial launch, and many think MUTM might be heading in the same direction. Now selling as low as $0.035, Mutuum Finance presale is more than 80% sold out in Stage 6 with overwhelming investor interest and selling out quick. New investors’ window to get in before the next price surge is running out with less than 20% of the phase remaining. If history indeed repeats itself, the early birds getting in may end up waiting for the next Shiba Inu-like hit story, but in the realm of DeFi, and MUTM could easily prove to be the top crypto in that arena. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Nears a Possible Breakout Shiba Inu (SHIB) is putting together a falling wedge on the weekly chart, a bullish reversal pattern that historically results in aggressive upside action. The technical setup of the chart is still intact, with momentum starting to condense into the wedge, suggesting a possible 50% gain if it breaks. This configuration hints that following recent volatility, SHIB may treat patiently holding the bag with a good relief rally in the near future. Curiously enough, while SHIB investors eagerly anticipate confirmation of this action, several of the early investors who climbed aboard earlier trends to enormous profits are looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as their next new crypto high-potential move before the next market breakaway. Early Presale Momentum Ignites Investor Excitement Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gained tremendous pace in a very short while after rolling out its multi-stage crypto presale this year, 2025. Presale with stages provides investors with concise visibility of future price appreciation that is expected and also an opportunity for the early riders to gain from monumental upside potential. Priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, the MUTM token has already appreciated from $0.01 in Phase 1, providing early investors with nearly 3x returns. So far, the presale has raised $18.15 million, brought in more than 17,500 investors, and sold an astonishing 80% of Phase 6. After completion of this phase, the token price will rise another 14% to $0.04 in Phase 7, once again highlighting increasing demand. This vast traction solidly places MUTM as the top crypto to invest in before the next significant market momentum, a high-potential early-stage DeFi play. Of the 4 billion total supply of MUTM tokens, 1.76 billion will go towards the presale and more than 760 million have already been sold out from previous rounds. This repeat sell-through is reflective of strong investor demand from retail and institutional investors alike, including numerous six-figure whale donations. The ongoing level of accumulation is a testament to the market’s increasing confidence in Mutuum Finance’s vision for the long term and its actual DeFi utility versus speculation mania. Borrowing Rates Designed for Stability The Mutuum Finance lending protocol has a stable borrowing rate mechanism in place to make the borrower experience more certain and the platform in general more rate-stable. Stable rates are determined by a weighted average of the variable rate prevailing at the time and market conditions existing. Stable rates are wiser because stable rates create a hedge against potential future interest rate volatility and are therefore typically set a bit higher than variable rates, a fair trade-off for greater certainty and lower exposure to volatility. These safe rates, though, are not fixed. The protocol also comes with a dynamic rebalancing feature activated by excessive market movement. If, for instance, the current supply rate drops to 90% or below what would be experienced with completely variable borrowing, the system can adjust the borrower’s stable rate up to achieve liquidity equilibrium and enhance platform stability overall. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already gaining pre-SHIB-level hype from analysts declaring it the new crypto to watch. At $0.035 per unit, its presale Phase 6 is 80% sold out, having raised $18.15M with just under 20% remaining. As with SHIB’s original booms, MUTM is 2025’s top crypto in DeFi, standing out as the most exciting new crypto opportunity for early investors ready to catch the next massive wave.

53732668,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87795,1761643829,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple News: XRP Price Chart Generates Speculation,https://timestabloid.com/ripple-news-xrp-price-chart-generates-speculation/,"The crypto market has been in a consolidation phase, leaving many investors underwhelmed with the XRP price. While XRP news has continued to generate speculation, it’s becoming clear that Avalon X (AVLX) is stealing the spotlight. Sitting at a $0.01 presale entry, the Avalon X token has already doubled in value, and analysts are calling it a once-in-a-decade opportunity . Analysts are now saying with confidence that Avalon X could soar by 25x, making it one of the top new crypto projects of 2025. XRP’s Struggles and the Shift to Avalon X (AVLX) The XRP price initially fell to $1.27 but has since risen to $2.46. Analysts think that its market cap could eventually reach $300 billion as the company keeps adding to its cross-border payment solutions and growing ETF interest. Source: CoinMarketCap Still, with XRP struggling to break free from its stagnation, investors are turning their focus to Avalon X vs XRP, and Avalon X is emerging as the more exciting opportunity. While XRP could potentially reach $5 by year-end, Avalon X is positioned for far greater gains. The project is pioneering real estate tokenization crypto, giving investors direct access to real-world assets through a digital gateway that combines stability with innovation. Avalon X (AVLX) Momentum Grows Like Wildfire The Avalon X presale is currently in Stage 2, priced at just $0.01, and it has already sold more than 57 million AVLX tokens in a short span. This rapid growth is due to high demand and a surge of investor interest. Analysts say that Avalon X could skyrocket 25x from its current level, making it the next big crypto in 2025 with real-world value. However, 60% of the 2 billion AVLX coins available are set aside for the presale. This means that early buyers can get a large share before the coins go on sale. The rest of the tokenomics are set up to last a long time: 13% for staking and rewards, 7% for marketing, 7% for burning, 5% for liquidity, 5% for research and development, and 3% for the team and founders. AVLX is a highly valuable asset due to its fixed supply and no minting policy after the initial allocation, which creates scarcity and a predictable distribution, making AVLX a truly valuable asset. Real Estate Backed Cryptocurrency with Real Utility While many tokens rely solely on speculation, the Avalon X token is tied to tangible real-world assets, bridging the gap between digital finance and property ownership. For investors who want to invest in real estate crypto opportunities, Avalon X makes property investment accessible to everyday investors. Its platform allows users to participate in tokenized property crypto markets without the traditional financial barriers that come with real estate. Through real estate tokenization crypto, Avalon X gives holders fractional ownership of high-value assets, transforming the way people invest in real estate. The AVLX coin becomes the key to accessing exclusive investment tiers, staking rewards, and token-holder benefits, ensuring both immediate utility and future value. Avalon X Giveaway and the $1M Crypto Sensation To ignite further excitement, Avalon X is launching a $1M crypto giveaway , one of the largest presale incentives. Early investors can win AVLX tokens and even a crypto townhouse giveaway located in the luxurious, gated Eco Avalon development. Eco Avalon Townhouse Giveaway Early investors can maximize their gains by joining the referral program running in tandem with the Avalon X contest, unlocking an extra 10% bonus in tokens. These rewards won’t last long—exclusive to early participants, they disappear once the offer ends. The Avalon X giveaway is sending shockwaves through the crypto community. With a jaw-dropping $1M crypto giveaway and a crypto townhouse giveaway on the line, early investors aren’t just buying tokens; they’re buying a chance at life-changing rewards. This is your ticket to the top before Avalon X explodes onto major exchanges. Avalon X’s Strong Foundation and CertiK Audit CertiK, one of the most trusted blockchain auditing firms, has successfully audited the project. This guarantee provides investors with even greater confidence as they prepare to purchase Avalon X. The roadmap shows a clear, long-term plan. Avalon X is still in its early stages, working on tokenization and building the core infrastructure. Future stages include listings on Tier-1 exchanges like Binance and Uniswap, partnerships with real estate companies, and further utilization of RWA-backed token models. Investors who get in now are still early enough to capitalize on the biggest growth opportunities. Crypto Backed By Top Analysts While XRP price movements continue to attract headlines, Avalon X represents a far more compelling growth story. With the presale still at just $0.01, this is the moment to get in before prices surge and mainstream investors flood in.

The complaint, filed as KalshiEX LLC v. Robert Williams, seeks to stop the New York State Gaming Commission from imposing civil penalties and fines on the Manhattan-based exchange for offering event contracts that allow users to speculate on sports outcomes. Source: BWBX The legal battle erupted after state regulators sent Kalshi a cease-and-desist letter on October 24, 2025, claiming the platform’s sports-related contracts violated New York gambling laws and demanding immediate shutdown of operations within the state. Kalshi contends that Congress granted the Commodity Futures Trading Commission exclusive jurisdiction over derivatives trading on designated contract markets, making state interference both field-preempted and conflict-preempted under the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Federal Authority Clashes With State Gambling Oversight Kalshi’s argument centers on its status as a CFTC -designated contract market, a designation the commission unanimously granted in 2020 after determining the exchange met stringent regulatory requirements. On January 22, 2025, Kalshi self-certified its first sports contracts under federal law , offering event contracts on outcomes such as NCAA tournament advancement and the U.S. Open Golf Championship winner. @Kalshi has filed a lawsuit against the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. #Kalshi #Crypto https://t.co/hgPBmcFV1i — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 30, 2025 The exchange operates under the Commodity Exchange Act, which Congress deliberately designed to preempt state regulation and prevent a patchwork of potentially conflicting state laws across all 51 jurisdictions. Federal oversight requires Kalshi to maintain extensive recordkeeping, meet liquidity standards, prevent market manipulation, and enforce position limitations across a nationally accessible platform. New York gaming regulators countered that Kalshi’s sports-based contracts constitute sports wagering under state Penal Law and Racing Law, requiring a sports gaming license to operate legally within state borders. The commission threatened criminal action and civil penalties unless Kalshi immediately ceased offering what regulators characterized as illegal gambling opportunities to New York residents. Prediction Market’s Existential Threat The lawsuit extends beyond Kalshi’s immediate business concerns, potentially affecting how prediction markets operate across state lines amid diverging regulatory philosophies. Robinhood recently filed similar lawsuits in New Jersey and Nevada after those states refused to recognize federal court rulings favoring Kalshi, with officials warning the brokerage firm that offering event contracts would constitute willful violations of law. @RobinhoodApp has sued Nevada and New Jersey, accusing the states of unfairly blocking its entry into the sports event contracts. #Robinhood #Crypto https://t.co/y6qGcRa09C — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 20, 2025 Event contracts function as derivatives that allow stakeholders, such as advertisers, sponsors, networks, and sportsbooks, to hedge exposure to economically significant sports outcomes, with prices fluctuating based on market perceptions of event probability. Kalshi argues that blocking access to these federally authorized instruments imposes substantial economic and reputational harm while creating uncertainty for consumers and business partners. The platform faces a potential existential threat if forced to implement state-by-state restrictions, as the CFTC could take action against it for violating requirements that designated contract markets operate as truly national exchanges accessible to all participants. They noted that developing technological solutions to block specific state residents while maintaining platform integrity would require complex, untested systems that could undermine Kalshi’s regulatory standing. New York’s Growing Regulatory Tensions New York’s aggressive stance toward prediction markets resembles broader state-level efforts to regulate emerging financial technologies, including cryptocurrency transactions that remain outside comprehensive federal frameworks. In August, state Assembly Member Phil Steck introduced legislation imposing a 0.2% excise tax on all digital asset transactions , with proceeds earmarked for upstate school substance abuse prevention programs. The proposed tax, which should have taken effect on September 1, 2025, places compliance responsibility on anyone making or effectuating crypto transfers, potentially creating challenges for exchanges, traders, and decentralized finance protocols. New York Assembly bill seeks a 0.2% excise tax on crypto and NFT transactions, targeting the digital asset sector for substance abuse prevention funding. #Crypto #Tax https://t.co/fx48tYwUjA — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 15, 2025 Assembly Bill A08966 defines digital assets broadly as anything issued or transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology, encompassing currencies, coins, and non-fungible tokens. Global jurisdictions have pursued vastly different approaches to crypto taxation and regulation, ranging from the United Arab Emirates’ emerging tax reporting framework to Hong Kong’s full licensing regime that encourages crypto business growth.

The development marks a pivotal moment for the firm, which has become one of the first to advance ETF approvals amid an ongoing US government shutdown. ETF Launches Proceed Despite Government Shutdown The announcement comes following reports from multiple analysts confirming that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has posted listing notices for the Canary HBAR and Litecoin ETFs, alongside Bitwise’s Solana ETF. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noted that the approvals were filed under a special provision introduced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this month. The SEC’s guidance allowed applicants to move forward by removing the delaying amendment from their filings. This adjustment meant that, once submitted, ETF registrations would automatically take effect after 20 days. Canary Capital acted swiftly, resubmitting its applications for the Hedera and Litecoin ETFs on October 7. The filings went largely unnoticed until recent updates confirmed the ETFs’ imminent launch. Bitwise and Grayscale Move Ahead with Solana ETFs Besides Canary’s listings, Bitwise is also set to introduce a Solana staking ETF, offering exposure to Solana’s 7% average staking reward. Grayscale will follow by converting its Solana Trust into an ETF on Wednesday. These moves underscore the growing institutional focus on staking-based products, even as the broader market remains cautious amid the shutdown. Solana’s market performance has strengthened in anticipation of these launches. The token is trading around $202 , up nearly 10% in the past week. The momentum suggests investor optimism tied to the upcoming ETF listings. Analysts See Solana Extending Toward $210 Source: X Market analyst Ali Martinez observed that Solana could push toward the $210 level before entering its next consolidation phase.

The token's burning mechanism has experienced a dramatic increase, while on-chain metrics suggest growing investor confidence. At the time of writing, the meme coin trades at approximately $0.00001034, representing a 1% decline over the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization stands at $6.09 billion, positioning it as the 34th-largest cryptocurrency. However, multiple factors point toward a potential reversal in the near term. Burn Rate Increases by Over 88,000% The Shiba Inu community has destroyed nearly 30 million tokens in the last 24 hours, according to data from Shibburn. This represents an 88,250% surge compared to the previous day's burn activity. The burning mechanism was introduced by the development team in 2022 to reduce SHIB's circulating supply. Since its inception, the initiative has eliminated 410.75 trillion tokens from existence. Approximately 585.22 trillion SHIB tokens remain in circulation. Shibarium Activity Shows Revival Shibarium, the layer-2 blockchain solution for Shiba Inu , has experienced a notable uptick in daily transactions. Earlier this month, the network processed between 2,000 and 5,000 transactions per day. Recent activity has pushed this number above 10,000 daily transactions. While these figures remain below the peak levels recorded at the beginning of the year, the upward trajectory indicates growing ecosystem engagement. Increased network activity often correlates with heightened interest in the underlying asset and can serve as a precursor to price appreciation. The protocol's recovery suggests developers and users are actively building and interacting with applications on the network. This sustained activity could provide fundamental support for SHIB's valuation in the future. Another significant development involves the amount of Shiba Inu held on centralized exchanges. Current data shows that just over 82 trillion tokens remain on trading platforms, approaching the four-year low recently registered. SHIB Exchange Reserves, Source: CryptoQuant The declining exchange balance indicates investors are transferring their holdings to private wallets and self-custody solutions. This movement typically reduces immediate selling pressure, as tokens held in personal wallets are less likely to be sold quickly compared to those readily available on exchanges. Community Sentiment Remains Optimistic Despite the recent price decline, prominent community members maintain bullish outlooks . Analyst Shib Spain has predicted a substantial rally could materialize soon, projecting potential price movement above $0.00001350. Source: X Another analyst, EtherNasyional, highlighted that Shiba Inu's momentum indicators have reached historic lows. The analyst suggested the token is consolidating strength within a major demand zone. This period of quiet accumulation could precede a significant breakout, according to the market observer.

BIP-444 is now open for discussion, though the initial reaction sees the soft fork as a ‘bad idea’. The role of the Bitcoin network is questioned again, after a months-long social media discussion on whether the network should carry additional data, or remain strictly for value settlement. In the end, Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr posted BIP-444, a proposal to soft-fork the network and optimize for financial settlement. The proposal comes as an answer to the hefty data load and potential illegal content included in Bitcoin blocks. As of October 28, the Bitcoin network faces the options of either limiting the content through filtering and small-scale upgrades, or a full proposal to change the network, coming from Bitcoin Core developers. According to Dashjr, BIP-444 is in the process of expanding its acceptance, though it remains uncertain if the proposal would pass. No. BIP 444 is already on track with no technical objections. https://t.co/sF7HUiGgRm — Luke Dashjr (@LukeDashjr) October 26, 2025 A soft fork would change the rule for all Bitcoin miners, but will not create a new chain or a new coin. ‘ We can do these all together in a temporary softfork that self-expires after a year or two. This would buy time to come up with longer-term solutions, and observe how it impacts the real world, ’ wrote Dashjr as part of the developer discussions . Currently, there is no consensus on whether Bitcoin should allow content, as in the case of Ordinals and other NFT, or remain a payment network with no additional block art or only limited messages. Bitcoin’s BIP-444 meets resistance The founder of F2Pool Chun Wang stated that BIP-444 is a bad idea, and he will not support soft fork versions. The proposal suggests a temporary freeze on all Bitocin spam, instead of filtering or leaving the network as-is. BIP-444 is a bad idea. Not going to soft fork anything. Temporary or not. Feel sad that some devs moving further and further in the wrong direction. — Chun (@satofishi) October 27, 2025 F2Pool is relatively influential, carrying over 10% of the Bitcoin network mining capacity. The pool is now standing on the side of still allowing content in some form. The BIP-444 approach reflects the incentives of Bitcoin Core developers, who are on the more conservative side. Since the chain is becoming more important for mainstream finance, they are proposing fewer upgrades and more simplicity, instead of constant filtering upgrades and the potential for failure. The filtering is also suggesting automated updates to Bitcoin, which may be risky for the smooth running of the network. As a response to BIP-444, the proposal’s text was uploaded on the Bitcoin chain in the form of an inscription, where it would stay forever. Can Bitcoin lose its value? The question now is whether BIP-444 would be accepted by pools and become the official version for nodes. This would severely decrease spam content on the network. The proposal sets up a discussion on whether Bitcoin is a neutral technology, or it could be censored. The proposal to remove ‘illegal content’ is seen by some as a door for censorship. While BTC remains a valuable traded asset, there is no consensus on how to deal with network spam.

The previous decision had allowed millions of iPhone users to sue the company together over its App Store practices. *]:pointer-events-auto [content-visibility:auto] supports-[content-visibility:auto]:[contain-intrinsic-size:auto_100lvh] scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:22e76f64-2e75-4df1-bd0d-8d5456b72cc6-42"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-4"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> Meanwhile, the tech firm has reached a new milestone, with its services division expected to generate more than $100 billion in annual revenue for the first time. Analysts estimate the company will report around $108.6 billion in services revenue for the fiscal year ending last month, a 13% increase from the previous year. This segment, which includes iCloud, Apple Pay, and AppleCare, now accounts for roughly 25% of Apple’s total revenue and contributes up to 50% of its profits, benefiting from high margins and recurring income streams. Judge ends lawsuit over Apple Store’s harsh monopoly In 2024, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers of the Northern District of California allowed millions of Apple customers to sue the company as one large group. The lawsuit began in 2011 when users claimed they could not purchase apps from any other source because all apps and in-app purchases were required to go through the App Store. Developers were also upset because the iPhone maker takes a 30% cut from every sale on the App Store, so they had no choice but to raise their prices to offset the loss. In the end, it was the customers who suffered the most, as they had to pay more just because Apple refused to allow other app stores or direct sales from developers. Judge Rogers overruled her previous decision because she stated that the people suing Apple did not have sufficient evidence that everyone involved was harmed in the same way. Experts attempted to estimate the additional costs incurred by people due to Apple’s strict rules, but the company claimed its data contained too many errors. The judge went through the evidence and agreed with the company that the data contained too many errors. She noted that the report listed “Robert Pepper” and “Rob Pepper” as two separate individuals, despite having the same address and credit card. Judge Rogers also realized that the expert had grouped over 40,000 users with the same first name, “Kim,” even though these individuals had no apparent connection to one another. She said these mistakes made the filing very unreliable, and she decided to cancel the group case. Apple’s legal team used these mistakes to build its argument against the plaintiffs, arguing that the model lacked clear evidence of real harm. As a result, anyone who still wants to sue the company must do so individually. However, they are less likely to succeed due to the high legal fees and lengthy court process involved in suing such a large company. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they were disappointed with the ruling but will continue to defend consumers who believe Apple’s control over the App Store has really harmed them. Apple grows its services business as legal pressure continues The services division at Apple has doubled in size and generated over $100 billion in revenue in one year, despite facing this legal pressure. The company recognized that the most effective way to grow is to ensure that people continue to spend on iCloud, Apple Pay, AppleCare, Apple Music, and App Store services. Apple generates revenue every time someone pays extra for iCloud storage, subscribes to Apple Music, purchases insurance through AppleCare, or makes an in-app purchase through the App Store. And since the company has more than a billion iPhone users worldwide, small payments add up to make very substantial profits. However, developers and regulators say the tech firm is creating unfair rules that make it difficult for other companies to compete. They claim these rules raise prices for consumers, so governments in the U.S., the European Union, and other countries are investigating. However, despite all this pressure, Apple still defends itself, stating that it spends a significant amount of money annually to ensure its apps are safe, verified, and free from harmful content. “We invest significantly to make the App Store a safe and trusted place for users to discover apps and a great business opportunity for developers,” Apple said in its statement.

This pattern, widely recognized by traders as a precursor to upward momentum, suggests that XRP could be preparing for a significant price run, potentially targeting the $4 level. The cup and handle pattern features a rounded base (the cup) followed by a brief consolidation (the handle), signaling renewed bullish momentum after a period of correction. For XRP, the extended cup reflects weeks of accumulation and stabilization, while the forming handle suggests a short pause before a potential breakout. Notably, rising trading volumes strengthen the bullish outlook, with on-chain data revealing accumulation by large holders, or “smart money,” ahead of a potential rally. Supporting this sentiment, both the RSI and MACD are turning firmly bullish, signaling growing momentum and an increased likelihood of continued price gains. Why is this a major move? Well, If XRP breaks above the handle, it could surge toward $4, setting a new all-time high beyond $3.65 and signaling a full recovery from past lows. XRP Signals Potential Bullish Reversal Amid Technical Momentum According to market commentator Justcryptopays, XRP is showing early signs of a potential reversal, igniting renewed optimism among traders and investors. The analyst highlights two key technical indicators suggesting that bullish momentum may be building in the near term. First, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has recently crossed above its signal line, a classic technical indicator that often signals a shift from bearish to bullish sentiment. Historically, such crossovers are viewed as early warnings of potential upward price movement, attracting traders looking for breakout opportunities. In XRP’s case, this MACD crossover indicates that momentum is starting to favor buyers, suggesting a reversal could be underway after the recent consolidation phase. Second, XRP’s price has successfully moved above the 20-day moving average, another significant technical milestone. The 20-day moving average acts as a short-term trend gauge, and crossing above it often implies that buying pressure is intensifying. When combined with the MACD crossover, this development strengthens the case for a bullish shift, signaling that the market may be ready to test higher resistance levels. What is expected? Well, while the bullish signals are promising, a keen eye should be given for sustained price action above the moving average. A confirmed hold could trigger a stronger rally fueled by momentum buyers, while failure to maintain this level may lead to a retest of key support zones critical to the bullish outlook. Conclusion XRP’s emerging cup and handle pattern signals the potential start of a strong bullish phase, putting the $4 target within reach. Backed by rising on-chain accumulation, bullish technical indicators, and renewed institutional confidence, XRP appears poised to regain momentum. A sustained breakout could not only confirm the pattern but also mark a broader resurgence in market confidence for the digital asset. XRP’s recent MACD crossover and breakout above the 20-day moving average signal a potential shift from consolidation to accumulation. These bullish indicators highlight strengthening buyer confidence and hint at an emerging market reversal, pending confirmation through sustained price momentum.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-28 09:52:38

But who is truly at the helm of this financial revolution? Recent analysis points to one undeniable leader: BlackRock. Their monumental presence is reshaping the landscape of digital asset investment, drawing unprecedented capital into Bitcoin. Understanding the Surge in Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows When we talk about spot Bitcoin ETF flows , we’re referring to the net capital moving into exchange-traded funds that hold actual Bitcoin. This mechanism allows traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning or managing the cryptocurrency itself. It’s a game-changer for institutional adoption and mainstream access. According to K33 Research analyst Vetle Lunde , the numbers tell a compelling story. This year, the total net inflows across all spot Bitcoin ETFs reached an impressive $26.9 billion. However, a closer look reveals a startling fact: BlackRock’s own IBIT fund alone recorded $28.1 billion in inflows. BlackRock’s IBIT: $28.1 billion in inflows. Total Spot Bitcoin ETF Market: $26.9 billion in net inflows. This data means that without BlackRock’s contribution, the entire spot Bitcoin ETF category would have actually experienced a net outflow. This highlights BlackRock’s crucial role in sustaining and driving market interest and capital accumulation. Why BlackRock Dominates the Spot Bitcoin ETF Landscape So, what makes BlackRock’s IBIT so successful in attracting such significant spot Bitcoin ETF flows ? Several factors contribute to their dominant position: Brand Trust and Reputation: BlackRock is a global asset management behemoth with a long-standing reputation for reliability and financial prowess. This instills confidence in institutional and retail investors alike. Extensive Distribution Network: Their vast network allows for broad access to financial advisors and wealth managers, making it easier for clients to allocate funds to IBIT. Competitive Fees: While not always the lowest, BlackRock often positions its products competitively, attracting cost-conscious investors. Proactive Marketing and Investor Education: BlackRock has been effective in communicating the benefits and legitimacy of Bitcoin as an asset class. The sheer scale of BlackRock’s operations and their strategic entry into the Bitcoin ETF market have created a powerful flywheel effect, continually drawing in more capital and reinforcing their leadership. The Broader Implications for Crypto Markets and Future Spot Bitcoin ETF Flows BlackRock’s outsized influence has significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Their success validates Bitcoin as a legitimate investment vehicle, potentially encouraging more traditional financial institutions to explore digital assets. Moreover, it sets a high bar for competitors. Lunde also touched upon the nascent spot altcoin ETF market. He noted that while BlackRock’s decision not to enter this space could allow other competitors to secure funds, the growth of that market will likely be limited without the asset manager’s involvement. This suggests that the institutional backing and brand power that BlackRock brings are paramount for substantial market expansion, especially concerning spot Bitcoin ETF flows . What does this mean for you, the investor? It means watching institutional movements, especially from giants like BlackRock, is more important than ever. Their actions often signal broader market trends and potential shifts in investment sentiment. Keep an eye on evolving regulatory landscapes, as these will also play a crucial role in shaping future inflows. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs? The dominance of BlackRock in driving spot Bitcoin ETF flows is a clear indicator of a maturing market. As institutional interest continues to grow, we can anticipate several developments: Increased Competition: Other asset managers will undoubtedly strive to capture a larger share of the market, potentially leading to more innovative product offerings and lower fees. Enhanced Regulatory Clarity: The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs could pave the way for clearer regulatory frameworks, further legitimizing the asset class. Broader Adoption: As more investors gain comfortable access to Bitcoin through ETFs, its overall adoption and integration into traditional portfolios are likely to accelerate. Ultimately, BlackRock’s remarkable performance underscores a pivotal moment for Bitcoin. Their ability to attract and sustain such massive capital inflows demonstrates the enduring appeal and growing acceptance of digital assets within mainstream finance. The journey of Bitcoin ETFs is just beginning, and BlackRock is certainly leading the charge. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a spot Bitcoin ETF? A: A spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. It allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through a traditional investment vehicle without needing to buy and store the cryptocurrency themselves. Q2: Why is BlackRock’s IBIT so significant for spot Bitcoin ETF flows? A: BlackRock’s IBIT has recorded significantly higher inflows ($28.1 billion) than the total net inflows for the entire spot Bitcoin ETF category ($26.9 billion) this year. This indicates that without IBIT, the category would have seen net outflows, highlighting BlackRock’s crucial role in driving capital into these products. Q3: Who is Vetle Lunde? A: Vetle Lunde is an analyst at K33 Research , a firm that provides insightful analysis on digital asset markets. He is the source of the data and analysis regarding BlackRock’s impact on spot Bitcoin ETF flows mentioned in this article. Q4: How does BlackRock’s involvement impact the future of altcoin ETFs? A: According to analyst Vetle Lunde, BlackRock’s decision not to enter the spot altcoin ETF space could limit the growth of that market compared to spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock’s brand trust and distribution network are seen as crucial for significant market expansion. Q5: What are the key takeaways for investors from BlackRock’s performance? A: Investors should recognize BlackRock’s success as a strong validation of Bitcoin as an asset class. It suggests increasing institutional adoption and market maturity. Monitoring such large institutional movements can offer insights into broader market trends and potential future investment opportunities in digital assets. Did you find this analysis insightful?

That said, the $BTC price may need to return lower first in order to retest previous price structure. Back to test the trendline breakout? Source: TradingView The $BTC price is holding up nicely. There was always going to be a downward impulse after $BTC had risen over the weekend in spite of being in quite an overbought state. However, the bulls won’t be keen to let the price go too far down and allow it to take hold underneath the major trendline again. Therefore, some gentle to and fro into a narrowing corridor between resistance and the rising trendline is just what the doctor ordered. Of course, things are never that simple in trading, so both bears and bulls have to be alert for any eventuality. Nonetheless, as it stands, a reasonable scenario is for the price to chop around before subsequently retesting the major trendline, and also perhaps the neckline of the W pattern. By then, the 8-hour, and maybe even the 12-hour Stochastic RSI indicators will have had time to reset before rising again and signalling renewed upside price momentum. No major resistance levels left Source: TradingView The daily chart for the $BTC price reveals that there are several horizontal resistance levels between the current price and the 8-year ascending trendline at the top. With that being said, none of these can really be considered as major resistances. Therefore, when $BTC goes on its next rally the main issue could be if it gets into an overbought state, as is the case currently. As far as support goes, the major trendline has become a rising base to which the price can come back down to. In fact, the price will very likely come back to this trendline in order to test the recent breakout, as well as the neckline of the W pattern. Boom or bust is fast arriving for Bitcoin Source: TradingView Bitcoin has a date with destiny, and that date is soon to arrive. Space for manoeuvre is running out as the $BTC price is forced into a narrowing area that is the culmination of this current bull up to now, as well as the entirety of the previous bull and bear markets that stretched all the way from the top of the 2017 high. Eight years of running below an ascending trendline is either going to end soon, as the price explodes beyond it for the very first time, or it will continue if the price is rejected and falls back down into a new bear market. There is no other scenario. It’s boom or bust. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators have turned around and are ready to move up, while the Relative Strength Index signals caution, as a downtrend line carries the threat of bearish divergence. It’s an exciting time to be alive. Fiat currencies are fulfilling their destiny by heading towards zero at an accelerating rate, while sound assets are going in the opposite direction.

Blockchain tracking shows large wallets tied to Binance and XRP liquidity hubs increasing their allocations to XRP Tundra, the dual-chain DeFi project now closing its Phase 8 presale. The numbers tell the story. More than $2 million has already been committed, and bonuses remain live even as allocation windows tighten. At $0.132 per TUNDRA-S and a $0.066 reference for TUNDRA-X, the gap to confirmed listing prices — $2.5 and $1.25 respectively — gives professional buyers a clear incentive to move before the next phase resets the base. Retail traders are still on the fence. Many see XRP Tundra as just another presale, overlooking that it already operates like a funded early-stage venture — fully audited, dual-chain, and with verified listing prices set in advance. Two Tokens, One Play XRP Tundra’s architecture gives larger players exactly what they look for in a DeFi accumulation phase: dual exposure and built-in hedging. Every presale purchase delivers two assets in one transaction — TUNDRA-S, the Solana-based utility token designed for yield generation, and TUNDRA-X, the XRP Ledger governance and reserve counterpart. This dual-token structure connects two of the most liquid blockchains without cross-chain friction. TUNDRA-S powers staking and ecosystem rewards, while TUNDRA-X secures governance and reserve control, ensuring that liquidity remains verifiable on both sides. For whales, that means exposure to two ecosystems under one audited umbrella; for retail, it means an unusually efficient entry route that won’t exist once listings synchronize pricing. Every transaction during the presale still includes a 12% token bonus and free TUNDRA-X allocation — a pairing that effectively doubles portfolio surface area at the cost of a single asset. That simple equation explains the quiet but steady inflows: institutional money prefers predictable math. Dynamic Liquidity Protects Early Buyers The other factor driving early confidence is XRP Tundra’s technical framework. Instead of launching into an unprotected market, the project integrates Meteora’s DAMM V2 liquidity system — a dynamic automated market-maker engine engineered to block manipulation during the vulnerable early hours of trading. DAMM V2 begins with high adaptive fees that decay over time, deterring automated bots and early dumping while allowing legitimate trading once liquidity stabilizes. It transforms what is usually a free-for-all into a staged discovery process where price evolves naturally rather than being forced. For large participants, it means they can accumulate without triggering volatility; for smaller holders, it means their positions aren’t diluted by predatory algorithms. Permanent liquidity locks reinforce that protection. Funds committed to the pool can’t be withdrawn, removing the possibility of a liquidity rug and ensuring a tradable base long after launch. The design aligns perfectly with the project’s staking ambitions through Cryo Vaults — long-term rewards fed by real trading fees rather than speculative token minting. Independent verification backs the model. Cyberscope , Solidproof , and FreshCoins have completed full code audits, and Vital Block’s KYC certificate confirms team transparency — a combination that explains why professional traders are comfortable scaling in. Instant Rewards Fuel the Buying Rush Beyond liquidity, XRP Tundra’s Arctic Spinner has added a real-time incentive layer that keeps engagement high. More than $32,000 in on-chain rewards has already been distributed to participants through the verifiable spin-to-earn mechanism. Every qualifying purchase unlocks spins on the reward wheel, offering instant bonus tokens of up to 20 % based on transaction size. The system scales: smaller investors can earn through daily free spins, while larger allocations gain higher-probability rewards. The transparent smart-contract logic credits winnings immediately, creating a visible participation trail that doubles as marketing proof. For accumulating whales, Spinner bonuses act as a secondary yield mechanism — a way to compound holdings before staking even begins. For retail traders still waiting, it’s another reminder that activity pays and hesitation doesn’t. You Can Still Catch the Next Phase — Barely The price math is simple. A $1,000 purchase today secures roughly 7,575 TUNDRA-S before bonuses, a position valued near $18,900 at listing. Add the 12% presale bonus and the mirrored TUNDRA-X distribution, and early entries reach near-institutional scale. Presale phases don’t last; bonuses shrink, and the market notices. When Phase 9 opens, the next adjustment narrows that multiplier dramatically. That’s why large wallets are finalizing entries now — they’ve seen this pattern play out before in audited DeFi launches that later multiplied once liquidity went public. Retail investors still have a narrow window to match that positioning. The infrastructure is live, the audits are public, and the listing path is fixed. What’s missing is participation — and the projects that fill that gap early are usually the ones retail ends up chasing months later at ten times the cost.

Among them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is standing out as one of the top crypto opportunities of 2025. The platform is building a decentralized lending and stablecoin system designed to make crypto borrowing and lending easy, transparent, and rewarding. Analysts see its clear roadmap and strong presale performance as signs of a project ready to grow fast. With the current price set at $0.035 in Phase 6, many expect the token to deliver up to 21x returns once its ecosystem goes live. Presale Growth and Early Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in Phase 6 of its presale, where the token price is $0.035 with 170 million tokens allocated. The sale is nearly 80% complete, showing growing demand among early investors. More than 17,500 holders have already joined, helping the project raise over $18 million so far. The next stage, Phase 7, will lift the price to $0.040, marking a 15% increase from the current phase. Investors who joined earlier have already seen strong paper gains. A person who invested $5,000 worth of ETH during Phase 1, when MUTM was priced at $0.01, now holds a position valued at around $17,500. At the planned listing price of $0.06, that early investment will grow to $30,000. Once staking and the buy-and-distribute system start after launch, projections show this figure reaching over $100,000, marking the 21x return analysts highlight. Lending Innovation and Staking Rewards The platform will introduce two main lending models: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). These systems are designed to serve different user needs and attract a wide base of lenders and borrowers. In the P2C model, a user can lend $10,000 in USDT and receive mtUSDT in a 1:1 ratio. Based on pool usage, this amount can earn around 15% annual yield, adding up to $1,500 each year. Borrowers who deposit $2,000 in ETH as collateral will be able to borrow about $1,500, keeping exposure to ETH’s price movement while gaining instant liquidity. For users who prefer higher-risk and higher-reward opportunities, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer a P2P option. Here, lenders and borrowers will directly agree on rates and timeframes for tokens such as PEPE, DOGE, SHIB, or TRUMP. This setup isolates risk for each pair while giving lenders more control over returns. A key driver of token demand will come from the buy-and-distribute model. A portion of revenue from lending and borrowing activities will be used to repurchase MUTM tokens from the open market. These repurchased tokens will then be distributed to users who stake their mtTokens. This creates a continuous cycle of earnings for participants and ensures that active users benefit from the platform’s growth. Eventually it will increase the demand for MUTMs and the price will boost in the longer-run. Steady Rollout and Platform Development Recently the team has announced on X that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch its V1 lending and borrowing protocol on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. The testnet will include essential components such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bots. ETH and USDT will serve as the first supported assets to be used for activities like collateral, borrowing and lending. After testing is complete, the project will tentatively move into its beta launch, where real user interaction will begin before the mainnet rollout and token listing. This step-by-step process is designed to ensure that every feature functions smoothly. To protect both lenders and borrowers, the protocol will apply strict lending rules. Stable assets such as ETH and USDT will have loan-to-value ratios of up to 80%, with a liquidation level around the same range. For volatile assets, LTVs will range between 35% and 65%. A reserve factor from 10% to 44% will be used to balance safety and earnings. These features are designed to create a healthy lending environment that can handle market volatility while keeping liquidity stable. Final Verdict With the leaderboard and dashboard already live, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem is gaining visibility among investors tracking top crypto projects. Each day, the user who achieves the top rank will be granted a $500 MUTM bonus, as long as they complete at least one transaction within that 24-hour window. As Phase 6 nears completion, only a small number of tokens remain before the next price jump to $0.040. With only 20% of Phase 6 supply left, now is the moment for investors to secure their entry before prices rise again. Early buyers are positioning themselves ahead of the beta release and expected exchange listings. Market analysts agree that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another token chasing hype—it represents the next wave of lending-based utility tokens. As development milestones continue and the mainnet launch approaches, its fundamentals point toward a major price re-rating. With a projected 21x ROI on the horizon, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as one of the top crypto investments to watch in 2025.

As Citi and Coinbase Push for Global Blockchain Payments, $PEPENODE Emerges Among the Best Meme Coins to Watch October 28, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Citi will partner with Coinbase to integrate digital asset payment capabilities for its clients, marking a major shift in bridging traditional banking and blockchain finance. Initially, Citi will use Coinbase’s on/off ramps to streamline fiat payments and move on to supporting fiat-to-stablecoin payouts after that. With 300 global clearing networks, Citi aims to expand its reach into blockchain networks to offer borderless payments and thereby position itself as an essential link between TradFi and DeFi. On other news, Citi also plans to offer programmable, stablecoin-based payments for clients, mirroring its broader interest in blockchain settlement systems. Citi’s Ronit Ghose predicts that the $316B stablecoin market could cross $1T within five years as a result of broader adoption. As banks embrace on-chain payment systems, the shift toward interactive, high-yield ecosystems is accelerating. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) , a gamified mine-to-earn community-powered token is primed to lead this next wave of adoption. With a whooping 653% dynamic staking APY, PEPENODE is already making waves in its presale, having raised $1.9M to date. Discover $PEPENODE’s future price prediction here. Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Recovery to $121K, As Bitcoin Hyper Smashes Through $25M October 28, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Crypto analyst CryptoNeuvo’s popular Bitcoin Monday Update predicts $BTC to soon reclaim its pre-crash levels. The post highlights key liquidity zones, particularly around $121K, anchored in two major liquidity pools formed after the crash. The upcoming US-China trade discussions that could help ease trade frictions, along with a possible Fed rate cut, are expected to accelerate the market recovery. Tapping into this, the Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale just smashed through the $25M milestone. The project’s Bitcoin L2 is behind the viral buying frenzy, as it sets out to strengthen Bitcoin’s technological foundation by bringing more speed and programmability to the network. The utility integration and presale staking deals (now at 47% APY) make $HYPER one of the best meme coins to buy now. For a closer look at where it’s headed, read our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction .

53733571,615075,1761645639,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53733571.jpeg,Citigroup Teams Up With Coinbase To Develop New Stablecoin Solutions,https://bitcoinist.com/citigroup-teams-up-with-coinbase/,"Citigroup, one of Wall Street’s leading institutions, has announced a strategic partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to develop new stablecoin solutions aimed at institutional and corporate investors as part of Citi’s initiative to leverage blockchain technology for financial transactions. Citi’s ‘Network Of Networks’ Approach According to the announcement , the initial phase of this partnership will focus on facilitating fiat pay-ins and pay-outs. This is aimed to enhance Coinbase’s on/off-ramps—essentially the bridges between traditional fiat currencies and digital asset ecosystems—alongside improving payment orchestration. Further details on specific initiatives, including the exploration of alternative methods for converting fiat to on-chain stablecoin payouts , are expected to be revealed in the coming months. Yet, the goal, according to both parties, is to provide Citi’s clients with smoother transitions and 24/7 accessibility. Debopama Sen, Head of Payments Services at Citi, stated: The financial landscape is changing rapidly, and we’re excited to partner with Coinbase to explore new payment options for our global clients. With over 300 payment clearing networks across 94 markets, collaborating with Coinbase is a natural extension of our ‘network of networks’ approach, enabling our clients to make payments as if borders did not exist. Coinbase Becomes Go-To Partner For Financial Institutions This partnership further builds on Citigroup’s efforts to develop payment solutions, which also includes offerings like the Citi Token Services and 24/7 USD Clearing, providing real-time, continuous support for institutional clients. Coinbase, on the other hand, has become a preferred partner for traditional financial institutions, beyond Citi, looking to dive into digital asset technology. In a similar move, PNC Bank announced back in July its collaboration with Coinbase to provide crypto trading options for its customers. Utilizing Coinbase’s institutional “crypto-as-a-service” platform, PNC aims to allow clients to buy, hold, and sell cryptocurrencies, while also offering certain banking services through Coinbase. “Partnering with Coinbase accelerates our ability to deliver innovative crypto financial solutions to our clients,” commented William Demchak, CEO of PNC. “This collaboration meets the growing demand for secure and streamlined access to digital assets on PNC’s trusted platform.” This development occurs amidst significant shifts in cryptocurrency regulation in the US under President Donald Trump, who aims to position America as the “crypto capital of the world.” This regulatory environment is fostering greater integration between traditional finance and the cryptocurrency industry, further boosted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) swift change in approach toward crypto, which included dropping its enforcement cases against the exchange earlier this year. In line with the broader recovery of the market, the exchange’s stock, which trades under the ticker symbol COIN, is trading at $369.88, an increase of nearly 4% for Monday’s trading session.

The Manhattan-based company is responding to a cease-and-desist order received on Friday evening for alleged illegal sports betting. KalshiEX LLC, represented by Millbank LLP, accused the New York Gaming Commission early Monday morning of usurping the federal government’s regulatory authority over derivatives trading. The prediction marketplace operator seeks to prevent the regulator from pursuing enforcement action. It claims the commission has threatened it with imminent fines and penalties for its “unauthorized” sports-related event contracts. Cryptopolitan reported in late September that authorities in New Jersey, Nevada, and Maryland have also ordered the prediction platform to stop offering illegal sports wagering. Massachusetts took an even tougher stance, suing the platform for illegal and unsafe sports betting. In a 43-page filing, the state urged the court to block local users from accessing and participating in its sports prediction events. Kalshi asserts its operations are legal in New York The platform’s team stated that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s regulations preempt state authorities, and therefore, its operations are legal in the Empire State. It also pointed out that Congress established the CFTC to prevent the chaos that would result from subjecting exchanges to a patchwork of 51 different, potentially conflicting state laws. However, the regulator claimed in the cease-and-desist letter that Kalshi is not licensed by the commission to offer sports betting in New York, either at a casino or as a mobile sports betting operator. The commission, therefore, demanded that Kalshi stop immediately from illegally operating, advertising, promoting, administering, managing, or otherwise availing sports betting in New York. It concluded by stating that it reserves the right to investigate the matter further and to impose and collect civil penalties concerning Kalshi’s current and future sports wagering activities in the state. Meanwhile, Kalshi complains that these threats could harm the exchange, its customers, and business partners. The platform requests that the court enforce federal rules to preempt the state patchwork. Wallach says Kalshi avoids state court by filing first The founder and principal of Wallach Legal LLC, Daniel Wallach, stated that by filing first, Kalshi avoids state courts, where the cases would concern the legality of the contracts, rather than jurisdictional issues. He pointed out that the platform has taken the initiative to sue first in five out of six cases because most states require advance notice before filing lawsuits against businesses that repeatedly violate state laws. Wallach said Kalshi has effectively persuaded two courts preliminarily that the CFTC has exclusive authority over contracts traded on CFTC-designated exchanges. U.S. District Judge Andrew Gordon in Nevada accepted this argument in Kalshi’s case, but denied Crypto.com’s request for an injunction. Kalshi has seen varied outcomes in similar lawsuits across different states. It won preliminary injunctions in Nevada and New Jersey but lost in Maryland, where a judge ordered it to stop offering sports event contracts. However, officials have allowed the platform to continue operations in Maryland as the case is resolved. However, in Crypto.com’s case, Wallach explained that the court analyzed the lawsuit through Congressional intent. The court concluded that it did not intend the CFTC’s exclusive swaps jurisdiction to cover sports betting, citing lawmakers’ comments and legislative history. A Nevada Gaming Control Board notice stated that Crypto.com must geofence Nevada and close open sports-event positions for state residents by November 3 pending its appeal. The sports and gaming law authority expects Illinois and Arizona to be the next to litigate with Kalshi. He also predicts that more states will file cases against Kalshi, Crypto.com, and Robinhood in the coming months because court decisions in recent similar cases have favored the states.

Preparations Have Begun!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/us-president-donald-trumps-bitcoin-btc-and-cryptocurrency-moves-ban-on-the-way-preparations-have-begun/,"US President Donald Trump's support and affinity for cryptocurrencies attracted attention during the election campaign. Following his victory last November, Trump took his crypto interest a step further and launched his own memecoin. Trump's crypto moves have become a subject of debate, as he launched his memecoin called TRUMP a few days before officially taking office as president. While Trump and his family's cryptocurrency projects continue to attract criticism, the Democratic side in the US is preparing to make a significant move against Trump and his family's cryptocurrency projects. Speaking on MSNBC, US Democratic congressman Ro Khanna first expressed concerns about Trump and his family's apparent conflict of interest in cryptocurrencies through their crypto project, World Liberty Financial (WLFI). At this point, US lawmaker Khanna stated that he has prepared a bill banning cryptocurrency trading for the president and politicians. Ro Khanna plans to introduce a bill that would ban President Trump, his family, and members of Congress from trading cryptocurrencies. His bill would reportedly prevent elected politicians from owning, trading, or issuing cryptocurrency tokens. Khanna explained the rationale behind the proposed bill, alluding to Trump, by stating that a sitting president has enriched himself and his family with an unprecedented wealth accumulation in US history. Pardon of Binance Founder CZ is Complete Corruption! Khanna also alleged that the recent pardon of Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) was “blatant corruption.” He also argued that CZ was spared thanks to Binance's financial support for WLFI. “There's a foreign billionaire who was basically involved in money laundering. He later sought pardon from Donald Trump after funneling money to terrorists,” Khanna said about CZ. While Khanna did not disclose the details of the proposed law, he concluded by calling for “any elected official to be banned from owning cryptocurrency and accepting foreign currency.” *This is not investment advice.

In a video shared by Xaif, Eric Trump expressed his belief in blockchain’s superiority over traditional banking systems, emphasizing efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility. Xaif interpreted these remarks as a clear nod to XRP’s role in redefining cross-border financial infrastructure. Eric Trump’s Statement In Details In the clip, Eric Trump described his transition from a background in real estate and tangible assets to an appreciation for digital assets. He explained that his interest in cryptocurrency developed after observing how banks used their influence to restrict and control businesses for political reasons. According to Eric, blockchain technology proffers a solution by decentralizing financial power and enabling greater fairness and speed in economic transactions. Trump questioned the inefficiencies of the current financial system, pointing to slow processes such as loan approvals and limited operating hours. He argued that blockchain could perform all the functions of banks more efficiently. Xaif interpreted this as an implicit acknowledgment of XRP’s capabilities, given its established use in facilitating fast, low-cost, and borderless value transfers . JUST IN : “There’s not a single thing that banks do that can’t be done better, cheaper, more efficiently, and faster on the blockchain. No doubt, he’s hinting at $XRP They’ll never say it directly, but the smart ones already know where the future is headed. pic.twitter.com/VFnyfpwhfT — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 25, 2025 Blockchain Efficiency and the XRP Association Xaif’s view aligns with the broader perspective among digital asset proponents who see XRP as one of the most practical blockchain solutions for institutional finance. XRP’s design allows for real-time settlement and interoperability between different fiat currencies, addressing many of the inefficiencies Trump mentioned. Although Trump did not mention XRP by name, Xaif’s interpretation rests on the notion that few blockchain projects match XRP’s focus on banking utility and transactional efficiency. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 While Trump emphasized Bitcoin’s strength as a store of value, his discussion of blockchain as a system capable of replacing traditional banking functions aligns more closely with XRP’s design than with Bitcoin’s. Bitcoin remains primarily a decentralized asset for storing and transferring value, whereas XRP’s underlying technology supports scalable payments and liquidity management for financial institutions. Xaif’s Interpretation and Broader Market Implications By asserting that Eric Trump was alluding to XRP, Xaif underscored a growing sentiment that political figures are beginning to recognize blockchain’s transformative potential within the financial system. His statement that “the smart ones already know where the future is headed” suggests confidence in XRP’s long-term position within that evolution. In a market where explicit endorsements of specific digital assets remain rare, Xaif’s interpretation carries symbolic weight for XRP holders who view such comments as signs of broader acknowledgment. The conversation surrounding Eric Trump’s remarks reinforces ongoing discussions about blockchain adoption and the transition away from traditional banking structures.

Litecoin is already bullish, after briefly breaking above $105 and consolidating around the $102 mark in preparation of the SEC’s decision. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) reaches $1.96M in presale thanks to its mine-to-earn mechanics and community support. $PEPENODE could deliver an ROI of 585% in 2026, without counting the staking APY of 653%. A $135 price prediction for Litecoin appears more than feasible ahead of its spot ETF, which is ready to launch on Nasdaq today with the ticker LTCC. Litecoin has been experiencing a notable increase over the last week, following a 10.44% surge that took it from $ 90.50 on October 23 to a high of $105.25 today. The main catalyst is the SEC’s imminent favorable decision, which would greenlight Canary Litecoin, Canary HBAR, and Bitwise Solana ETFs today. Bloomberg analyst, Eric Balchunas, confirmed the news on X , saying: ‘Assuming there’s not some last min SEC intervention, looks like this is happening’. The news is understandably bullish for Litecoin, as the Nasdaq listing would open the asset to investors who don’t necessarily want to buy it. Long-term, this will boost liquidity, improve Litecoin’s legitimacy, and increase adoption at retail and, hopefully, institutional level. Projects like PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) also stand to gain thanks to its on-chain utility and meme value. PEPENODE allows early adopters to buy mining nodes and build their own virtual coin mining facility, minus the electricity costs and expensive mining equipment. Can Litecoin Push to $135? The momentum is there for a $135 push, especially considering the network activity, as shown by Santiment. Litecoin’s price spiked on October 9 and crashed soon after; the window was too short for investors to capitalize on it. There was an attempt, but it fizzled out as Litecoin was already in free fall. If investors had capitalized on it, the momentum might have held, increasing the opportunity window and potentially triggering a consolidation phase above $130. But we’re not in that timeline. Fortunately, we may be looking at a strong reset, as $LTC is already showing signs of consolidation above $101 after briefly popping its head above $105. And this time, investors are not willing to miss the opportunity window again. The 24-hour transaction volume is up 69.41%, a clear indication that momentum is building ahead of the SEC’s decision later today. We then have the Relative Strength Index, which currently stands at 64.77 points . For reference, the bull zone begins at a price above 50. The community is clearly hyped up, $LTC shows growing potential, and investors are ready. In this context, a breakout above $135 is more than achievable if LTCC performs well following its Nasdaq listing. If $LTC meets the bullish expectations, another project that stands to gain significant attention is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), with its presale already at $1.96M. How PEPENODE Rewards Early Adoption PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) encourages participation in its presale with the help of its innovative mine-to-earn mechanics. The project addresses the main problems associated with crypto presales today: the lack of participation incentives. In short, presales don’t incentivize investors to buy in early, which leads to poor presale performances, which inadvertently lowers the coin’s visibility post launch. PEPENODE’s mine-to-earn mechanics offer an exciting alternative in the form of virtual mining facilities. The concept is straightforward: purchase mining nodes, upgrade them, build your own virtual mining facility, activate it, and watch your rewards accumulate. The earlier you buy, the stronger your nodes, the faster you mine, and the more you can earn. This translates to higher post-TGE rewards, which include actual meme coins, such as $FARTCOIN and $PEPE. The 653% staking APY is an additional incentive for early adoption. $PEPENODE now sits at $0.0011227 and managed to raise $1,965,327 so far, while the presale is still going. Based on the project’s utility and meme value, the token still has plenty of growth potential. A realistic price prediction for $PEPENODE puts the coin at $0.0077 by the end of 2026; possibly even higher if the mine-to-earn mechanics catch on. This translates to an ROI of 585%, excluding the staking benefits or the meme coin rewards resulting from your coin-farming. Read our guide on how to buy $PEPENODE and visit the presale page to secure your nodes and start building your mining rig today. This isn’t financial advice. Always do your own research (DYOR) and invest wisely.

53733866,https://cryptonews.com/?p=444264,1761646225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53733866.jpeg,Copper Founder’s Bron Labs Lets Crypto Users Recover Lost Wallets With Guardian Approval,https://cryptonews.com/news/copper-founders-bron-labs-lets-crypto-users-recover-lost-wallets-with-guardian-approval/,"Dmitry Tokarev, the founder of crypto custodian Copper Technologies Ltd., has launched a new company, Bron Labs, aimed at addressing the issue of recovering lost wallets without compromising self-custody. Key Takeaways: Copper founder has launched Bron Labs, which helps users recover lost wallets without giving up control of their assets. Bron’s guardian-based recovery system lets users appoint two trusted guardians to approve recovery requests. The platform raised $15 million from investors including LocalGlobe, Fasanara Digital, and GSR. Bron Labs, based in London, offers a self-custodial platform designed to bring institutional-grade security to individual users. Tokarev told Bloomberg that the company raised about $15 million earlier this year from around 140 backers, including LocalGlobe, Fasanara Digital, and GSR. Bron Labs Solves the Seed Phrase Problem With Guardian-Based Wallet Recovery The platform targets professionals and executives who want the same level of protection as large financial institutions but at a fraction of the cost. The system tackles the seed phrase loss issue. Most digital wallets rely on a 12- or 24-word recovery phrase that acts as a master key. If a user loses it, their funds are gone forever. Bron’s alternative introduces a “guardian-based recovery” system. When users open a wallet, they appoint two trusted guardians who must approve any recovery request. Once approved, a mandatory 48-hour delay begins before funds can be accessed, providing an extra layer of protection against coercion or theft. The need for better security has grown as physical attacks on crypto holders have surged. According to data compiled by Bitcoin advocate Jameson Lopp, more than 50 “wrench attacks,” cases where criminals use violence or threats to steal crypto, have been publicly reported this year, up over 50% from 2024. Tokarev said that while institutional custodians don’t face such risks, “crime is on the rise, paranoia is at an all-time high” among retail holders. What’s The Difference? A private key unlocks one wallet address. A seed phrase (12–24 words) unlocks the ENTIRE wallet. Lose your private key? Restore it with your seed phrase. Lose your seed phrase? = NO recovery. Your seed phrase is the master key to everything – keep it… pic.twitter.com/0dYm9MttKJ — base58io (@base58io) October 27, 2025 Tokarev, who left his CEO role at Copper in October 2024 but remains its largest shareholder, said Bron’s mission is to “bridge” the gap between the convenience of self-custody and the safety of professional-grade solutions. Bron launches publicly this week with subscription plans ranging from $20 per month for individuals to $3,000 for small businesses. Early investors received a utility token that can substitute for subscription fees when held in a Bron wallet. The platform also includes biometric security and programmable transaction limits, allowing users to set restrictions on large or frequent transfers to deter hackers. Crypto-Related Physical Attacks Surge 169% in Six Months As reported, physical attacks targeting Bitcoin and crypto holders are rising at an alarming rate, according to new data tracked by CASA co-founder Jameson Lopp. Since late February, 35 new violent incidents have been reported globally, a 169% increase in just six and a half months. The uptick adds to an already troubling trend, as cryptocurrency markets continue their bullish run. In total, 48 attacks have occurred so far in 2025, marking a 33% increase over all of 2024. France alone has accounted for 14 of this year’s reported incidents. One of the most disturbing cases took place on September 6 in Cambridge, Canada, where a young man was abducted at gunpoint and forced to transfer funds into a cryptocurrency wallet.

The company is also targeting faster time-to-cash through conversions rather than outright building new facilities. In total, they plan to scale up mining, targeting 25 EH/s by late November 2025 and 35 EH/s in 2026. Their BUZZ HPC subsidiary will add 7.2 MW as a Tier-3 site, and Sweden upgrades nudge HIVE to approximately 6,000 NVIDIA GPUs by 2026. HIVE’s valuation also seems compelling, which is why I feel it’s fair to rate the stock a speculative “Buy” at these levels. HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. ( HIVE ) is a crypto miner and a renewable-power infrastructure company for artificial intelligence and high-performance computing (AI/HPC). In 2025, their company surpassed an operational mining speed of 22 EH/s using hydroelectricity from Paraguay’s Itaipú and other efficient sites in Canada and Sweden. HIVE is also converting its Swedish facilities from Tier-1 to Tier-3 to accelerate time-to-cash for AI applications. Also, HIVE is expanding its Toronto infrastructure, aiming to have 6,000 GPUs by 2026. And, as a whole, I consider HIVE a very compelling speculative “Buy” given its broader positioning in crypto mining and AI compute. Rapidly Scaling AI Miner HIVE Digital Technologies Ltd. ((HIVE)) is an operator of “green” data centers for Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ) mining and HPC/AI GPU cloud services. HIVE was founded back in 2017 and later rebranded from its previous name as Hive Blockchain Technologies in July 2023 when it expanded into AI/HPC. HIVE is currently headquartered in San Antonio, Texas. Source: Q1 F2026 Results Webcast. Retrieved October 2025. As a quick overview, HIVE runs data centers powered by renewable sources like geothermal or hydroelectricity. These sites are located across Canada and Sweden, and they have a planned expansion in Paraguay as well. For Bitcoin mining, HIVE has two sites in Canada. One of those sites is in New Brunswick with an operational mining speed of 3.2 exahash per second (EH/s) and 65 MW of capacity. The second site is in Lachute with an operational mining speed of 1.4 EH/s and 35 MW. As for Sweden, HIVE has a mining site with an installed hash of 1.9 EH/s and 40 MW. And its facilities in Paraguay are in the Yguazú , which recently reached 200 MW in capacity as of September 2025. But more importantly, this marked the completion of their Phase 2 expansion. Going forward, HIVE’s Phase 3 will add another 100 MW to its capacity. Specifically, HIVE’s Paraguayan site in Valenzuela is planned for Q4 2025. Moreover, HIVE’s profitability should theoretically also scale alongside the price of Bitcoin itself. And indeed, HIVE’s illustrative forecasts present $345 million in annual mining margin. Note that “mining margin” in this case is simply the revenue they generate by selling their mined Bitcoin minus electricity costs (excluding other direct costs like labor, for example). In this particular scenario, HIVE assumes a hypothetical Bitcoin price of $125.0 thousand, which doesn’t seem that far off from the current price of approximately $114.5 thousand . Source: Q1 F2026 Results Webcast. Retrieved October 2025. In other words, based on those scenarios, roughly every $10.0 thousand increase in the price of Bitcoin (above $100.0 thousand per Bitcoin) adds around $100.0 million in additional mining margin for HIVE. It’s also worth mentioning that this assumes a 25 EH/s capacity, and it’s tied to its electricity cost (roughly $0.05/kWh at the moment). Similarly, HIVE’s HPC/AI segment lists Tier 3 data centers repurposed for AI and GPU cloud computing. And these installations are in Stockholm, Sweden , with a utilized power of 0.8 MW. In Montreal and Toronto (Canada), it has another 1.4 MW and 5.5 MW, respectively. But given the high demand for AI compute, HIVE now plans to triple its AI infrastructure using NVIDIA GPUs to serve this surging demand. Mining and AI Infrastructure Expansion More recently, on October 27, 2025, HIVE announced two major updates . First, they achieved a new Bitcoin-mining milestone of 22 EH/s, which represents a 267% year-to-date growth for them. This increase was mainly attributed to HIVE’s Valenzuela facility in Paraguay. This alone added 100 MW via a hydro-powered campus that generates renewable energy from the Itaipú Dam, one of the largest hydroelectric plants in the world. Source: Q1 F2026 Results Webcast. Retrieved October 2025. HIVE disclosed that it’s currently producing approximately 9.5 Bitcoin per day with an efficiency of 17.8 J/TH. As of the latest update, they’re generating a 55% mining margin at a $0.05/kWh electricity cost. However, their new target is to reach 25 EH/s by late November 2025. And after that, HIVE aims for 35 EH/s during 2026 while keeping energy efficiency around 17.5 J/TH. Furthermore, the second update is related to an acceleration of its AI cloud expansion by converting Swedish data centers from Tier-1 to Tier-3 HPC facilities. Concretely, what they’re doing is upgrading their facilities’ redundancy, uptime, and security. Management also highlighted that conversion projects typically reach profitability within 9 months, which is much quicker than the average 2-3 years when building a new site. Thus, HIVE’s upgraded Swedish site will eventually host around 2,000 NVIDIA GPUs dedicated to AI training and inference workload in the EU. Likewise, this facility can also serve clients with ongoing AI operations in Stockholm. On top of that, HIVE’s BUZZ data center in Toronto will add another 2,000 GPUs by 2026. Plus, management mentioned they’ll do an additional New Brunswick expansion, which has already secured the necessary land rights and ideal electricity rates. This means that by 2026, HIVE could operate up to 6,000 GPUs while tapping into renewable AI compute. As a side note, BUZZ HPC is actually an AI-cloud subsidiary of HIVE. In September, BUZZ HPC acquired a 7.2 MW data center site in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). Source: HIVE’s website. Retrieved October 2025. Interestingly, this BUZZ HPC site will become their Tier 3 data center for AI workloads that will serve two purposes. BUZZ HPC will provide colocation services by renting out compute capacity and space. This subsidiary will also offer hosting in its in-house computing systems for AI. This installation uses liquid cooling for racks of 150 kW NVIDIA H100 and H200 GPUs. BUZZ’s partnership with Bell Canada, which links telecom infrastructure with GPU-based AI cloud capacity. But one statistic that stood out for me was that HIVE believes BUZZ’s AI/HPC business should grow 5x by 2026, which showcases how rapidly this new vertical is expanding. Valuation And Risk Analysis Now, from a valuation perspective, HIVE currently trades at a $1.4 billion market cap. Its most recent report from June 2025 shows its balance sheet held $24.6 million in cash and $30.6 million in marketable securities. That amounts to approximately $55.2 million in highly liquid assets against $34.7 million in financial debt (aside from other regular operating liabilities). Note that I exclude their Bitcoin holdings from this calculation because it seems more like working capital than “cash-like” given HIVE’s business. Source: Seeking Alpha. Moreover, their book value reached $560.5 million, indicating a reasonable P/B of 2.5. For comparison, their sector’s median P/B is much higher at roughly 4.0. So I do believe there’s still room for multiple expansion with HIVE. And according to Seeking Alpha’s dashboard on HIVE , the company is projected to generate $521.5 million in revenues by 2027. This would also imply a cheap forward P/S of just 2.7, which is again substantially lower than its peers’ median forward P/S of 3.6 . Having said that, HIVE is definitely not without its risks. Firstly, it’s obviously extremely exposed to any price fluctuations in Bitcoin. However, there’s also some risk with its hash price, which is a bit more subtle as it ties the price of Bitcoin relative to the network’s mining difficulty. Ultimately, if the unit economics deteriorate substantially, HIVE’s stock price would probably trend lower as well. Source: Seeking Alpha Charts. Similarly, management could face delays or even regulatory setbacks, and if they miss their EH/s targets, the market will likely react negatively. Lastly, if the demand for AI compute dissipates as fast as it spiked, it could leave HIVE in a very awkward position after building up infrastructure to serve this need. So, just make sure to remember that HIVE’s long-term prospects still rest on several potentially volatile assumptions. Conclusion: Growth “Buy” Overall, HIVE continues delivering on its expansion ambitions, and its recent update confirms it remains on track to reach 25 EH/s by year's end. I also believe the stock trades at a very compelling valuation given its growth potential with crypto and the recent surge in demand for AI compute. Naturally, these could be short-lived trends, so there’s definitely a speculative component to this bet. Nevertheless, I feel that, on balance, the risk-reward equation justifies a speculative “Buy” rating at these levels for long-term investors.",HIVE|HIVE:CA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-28 11:45:00

53736825,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=847258,1761652119,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53736825.jpeg,Policy bill on Bitcoin and crypto to reach French parliament,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/bitcoin-crypto-bill-to-french-parliament/,"A pro-Bitcoin and crypto bill is expected to enter the French parliament, backed by the UDR party and its leader Eric Ciotti. The bill sets ambitious goals for building a BTC treasury and expanding euro stablecoin adoption. The French UDR party and its leader, Eric Ciotti, will propose an ambitious pro-crypto bill with multiple growth points. One of the biggest items on the proposal is the establishment of a BTC reserve of 420,000 coins, making up 2% of the total BTC supply. The treasury would rival some of the biggest buyers, bringing it close to the reserves of Strategy (MSTR). The bill, according to reports, will accrue the reserve through the creation of a special entity, a Public Administrative Establishment (EPA), which will have to accumulate the reserve in the next 7-8 years. The reserve is presented as a diversification tool for foreign exchange reserves. The BTC would be acquired through public mining, tapping excess energy production, with favorable miner taxation. The company will have to contend with the ever-shrinking block reward, in addition to competing with other miners and their growing data centers. The other main source of coins would be BTC seized during legal proceedings. France has already gained some reserves in this manner. As Cryptopolitan reported , the state seized BTC from the now-defunct dark web site DFAS. The state will also buy additional BTC through government savings schemes, potentially setting aside 15M euro per day, or around 55,000 BTC per year. The purchases of the French state, if the bill is accepted, could rival even the biggest corporate buyers. France to encourage euro-denominated stablecoins The bill will also encourage the creation of euro-denominated stablecoins. This type of asset has been in the focus of major European banks , though without special support from governments. The bill points out that stablecoins can be an alternative to debit card payments and suitable for regulated everyday use. In addition to establishing the stablecoin as a legal payment, the bill sets a 200 euro ceiling for tax-exempt purposes. Stablecoins may also be used to pay taxes if the bill is accepted. The new bill specific to France may ease some of the MiCA regulations at the level of the European Union to facilitate stablecoin issuance by European banks and even companies. Most notably, the bill would oppose the creation of digital assets by centralized authorities, deemed as limiting financial freedom. Proposal integrates Bitcoin activity with the French financial system The new bill contains more sections on the favorable treatment of miners in terms of energy access and taxation. The state may change taxation and offer flexible regimes for mining data centers. Additionally, BTC may be considered sufficient collateral for some types of loans. To boost BTC acceptance, the bill also offers access to crypto through exchange-traded notes (ETN). Technologically, France has been one of the leading crypto regions. However, some of the more liberal use cases for blockchains have been limited in the country, as in the case of Polymarket . The current bill is more focused on the financial side of Bitcoin and stablecoins. While ambitious, the new bill by the UDR relies on limited political impact, and its acceptance is unlikely. However, the bill spells out key issues in crypto usage and adoption, paving the way for shifts in the acceptance of BTC and other technologies. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Bitcoin Rally: Can BTC Break Through Resistance Levels Soon? Source: tradingview Bitcoin has been on an upward trend, with its current price ranging from just over $108,000 to nearly $118,000. In the past month, Bitcoin's value has increased by about 5%, showing positive growth. It has a strong support level near $103,000 and is moving towards a resistance level just above $120,000.

Bitcoin ($BTC) is off to a great start this week, as it rebounded back to the $115K level. But while the market remains jittery as it awaits the latest US Fed rate announcement, it’s getting some much-needed respite after weeks of taking a beating. While that’s happening, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has blown past the $25.1M mark, making it one of the hottest presales at the moment. Bitcoin Returns to $115K Despite Market Jitters The world’s largest cryptocurrency is currently in recovery mode after dropping below $105K earlier this month. The weaker-than-expected US CPI data has increased the possibility of a new rate cut by the US Fed, which tends to improve the attractiveness of risk-on assets, such as crypto. While Bitcoin remains the most popular digital asset on the market, it has its drawbacks. One notable weakness is its slow transaction speed, which peaks at just seven transactions per second (TPS). In contrast, Solana can achieve speeds of up to 65,000 TPS . Slow transaction speeds cause network congestion in the Bitcoin blockchain, which ultimately makes transactions more expensive. Another issue is $BTC’s limited utility. As it is, you can’t use it for anything other than as a store of value. That means no staking if you want to earn passive rewards. Bitcoin Hyper: Sending the Bitcoin Ecosystem to Hyperspace Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a project that aims to solve Bitcoin’s fundamental problems with its Layer 2 (L2) network. Currently in development, the L2 will run on a Solana Virtual Machine, which will deliver fast transaction speeds and low costs to the Bitcoin ecosystem. In addition to that, it will feature a canonical bridge . Here, you’ll be able to send your $BTC from the main Bitcoin blockchain to the L2 so you can use it for various applications, including staking, trading, and interacting with dApps. Here’s a quick look at how the L2 will look like: Want a full lowdown on the project? Be sure to check out our page discussing ‘what is Bitcoin Hyper?’ $HYPER Tokens: Your Key to the Best Bitcoin Hyper Has to Offer To get the most out of Bitcoin Hyper, it pays to hold its native $HYPER token. More than a way to pay for transaction fees, being a $HYPER holder will provide you with various benefits. These include governance rights and access to exclusive features. For now, you can get $HYPER via the official Bitcoin Hyper presale page . Each one costs $0.013185, which you can also stake to earn passive rewards. Staking rewards are currently set at 47% p.a., but this can change as more tokens are locked in the staking pool. Learn how to grab $HYPER tokens in our Bitcoin Hyper buying guide . If you’re the sort of person who HODLs tokens, that’s another option too. This could be a fantastic idea considering $HYPER’s price has the potential to reach $0.20 by 2026, according to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction . Regardless of whether you’re an investor or someone who’ll use Bitcoin Hyper’s L2 when it launches, there’s no denying the project’s potential. Other investors think so too, as the token presale has already raised over $25.1M to date, making it one of 2025’s best crypto presales . But hurry, as the presale has regular price increases. With the next one coming tomorrow, this could be your last chance to grab tokens at a discounted price. Don’t be left behind — join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today. Disclaimer: Do your own research.

A significant development recently emerged from Binance Alpha, which has announced the Binance Alpha delisting of 18 tokens from its platform. This move, shared via their official X account, signals important changes for holders of these specific digital assets. For many, such news can be a cause for concern or confusion. However, understanding the implications and knowing the steps to take is key to navigating these shifts in the market. Let’s delve into what this announcement means for you and the broader crypto ecosystem. What Does the Binance Alpha Delisting Mean for You? When an exchange announces a delisting, it means that particular digital asset will no longer be supported for trading on that platform. In this instance, Binance Alpha will cease trading support for a diverse range of 18 tokens. The affected tokens include CA, HAT, Aimonica, House, LMT, degenai, ALON, RIF, LUCE, ASRR, YNE, MAXONSOL, GRIFT, URO, PAIN, vvaifu, HAPPY, and MCH. While trading ceases, the platform has clarified that selling these tokens will still be supported after the official delisting date. This provides a window for users to manage their holdings. It’s important to differentiate between delisting and outright removal. Delisting primarily impacts liquidity and accessibility on the specific exchange. Holders often retain ownership of their tokens and can typically withdraw them to another wallet or exchange that supports the asset. Why This Binance Alpha Delisting? Understanding the Reasons Token delistings are not uncommon in the fast-paced crypto market. Exchanges like Binance Alpha regularly review listed assets to ensure they meet specific criteria for quality, performance, and compliance. Several factors often contribute to a Binance Alpha delisting decision: Low Trading Volume and Liquidity: Tokens with consistently low trading activity can create a poor user experience and tie up exchange resources. Project Inactivity or Lack of Development: If a project shows little to no progress, development, or community engagement, it may be deemed unsustainable. Regulatory Concerns: Evolving regulations can sometimes lead exchanges to delist tokens that might pose compliance risks in certain jurisdictions. Security Issues or Vulnerabilities: Any identified security flaws in a token’s smart contract or network can lead to its removal to protect users. Violation of Listing Agreements: Projects must adhere to specific terms set by the exchange, and failure to do so can result in delisting. While Binance Alpha’s specific reasons for each of these 18 tokens were not detailed in the announcement, these general criteria typically guide such decisions. This proactive approach helps maintain a healthy and trustworthy trading environment for its users. Actionable Steps After the Binance Alpha Delisting Announcement If you hold any of the 18 tokens affected by the Binance Alpha delisting , it’s crucial to act promptly. Here’s a breakdown of what you should consider: Identify Your Holdings: First, check your Binance Alpha wallet to confirm if you own any of the delisted tokens. Review Delisting Schedule: Pay close attention to the exact delisting date and any specific deadlines for selling or withdrawing your assets. Consider Selling: Since selling will still be supported, you might choose to sell your tokens on Binance Alpha before the full cessation of services for those assets. This allows you to convert them into a more liquid asset like USDT or another supported cryptocurrency. Withdraw to Another Wallet: If you prefer to hold your tokens, or if you plan to trade them on another exchange, you should withdraw them to a personal wallet or another exchange that supports the token. Ensure you use the correct network and wallet address to avoid loss of funds. Research Other Exchanges: Investigate if other reputable cryptocurrency exchanges still list and support trading for your specific tokens. Proactive management of your portfolio is essential during such announcements to minimize potential losses and maintain control over your digital assets. The Broader Impact of Binance Alpha Delisting on the Market A Binance Alpha delisting of multiple tokens, especially from a prominent platform, can have ripple effects beyond the immediate holders. It often signals a tightening of listing standards across the industry, encouraging projects to focus more on fundamental value, security, and sustained development. For the broader market, these delistings contribute to a more mature and discerning ecosystem. Investors are increasingly looking for projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and clear use cases. Consequently, exchanges are responding by refining their offerings to provide more reliable and compliant investment opportunities. This trend encourages greater scrutiny from both investors and exchanges, ultimately pushing the entire cryptocurrency space towards higher quality and greater sustainability. While individual delistings can be disruptive for some, they often serve as a necessary cleansing process for the market. In conclusion, the recent Binance Alpha delisting of 18 tokens is a significant event that underscores the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights the importance of staying informed, understanding the implications of exchange announcements, and taking timely action to manage your digital assets effectively. By remaining vigilant and adaptable, you can navigate these changes successfully and continue to participate in the exciting world of crypto. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

The delisting affects 18 tokens: CA, HAT, Aimonica, House, LMT, degenai, ALON, RIF, LUCE, ASRR, YNE, MAXONSOL, GRIFT, URO, PAIN, vvaifu, HAPPY, and MCH. 3.

Always ensure you use the correct network and wallet address for withdrawals. 5. Why do crypto exchanges like Binance Alpha delist tokens?

His comments reveal how Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s team aims to stimulate the economy through increased government spending, adopting a different approach from the previous leadership, which was more concerned about inflation caused by the weak yen. _*]:min-w-0""> “A weak yen pushes up import costs and domestic prices, which in turn effectively weighs on the purchasing power of households and some companies,” Kiuchi explained during a press briefing. “But there are also merits such as the boost it gives to exporters’ profits and domestic investment,” he continued, noting that currency values should move steadily based on economic fundamentals. _*]:min-w-0""> New administration shifts economic focus _*]:min-w-0""> The weakening yen has created political challenges for government officials in recent years, as it makes imported goods more expensive and drives up overall inflation. Japan’s inflation rate has stayed above the Bank of Japan’s 2% goal for more than three years. _*]:min-w-0""> The central bank ended its massive ten-year stimulus program in 2024 and raised interest rates twice through January, following politicians’ demands for action against the yen’s sharp decline. Financial markets expect the bank to keep rates unchanged at 0.5% when its two-day policy meeting concludes Thursday. Investors are waiting for clearer signals about the new government’s plans before the bank potentially raises rates to 0.75%. _*]:min-w-0""> “We will continue to closely monitor the impact of currency moves on Japan’s economy,” Kiuchi stated . “As for the rising cost of living, we’ll deal with that by compiling a comprehensive economic package,” he added. _*]:min-w-0""> Takaichi , known for supporting increased government spending, is putting together an economic aid package that sources have told Reuters will likely top last year’s $92 billion to help families cope with inflation. _*]:min-w-0""> Market reactions and fiscal concerns _*]:min-w-0""> While maintaining fiscal responsibility in mind, Japan can enhance its long-term growth potential by fostering demand and sustaining a robust job market, Kiuchi explained. He said there are different opinions about how much extra demand Japan’s economy needs, which is why both the government and central bank are watching inflation and wage trends carefully. _*]:min-w-0""> Japanese stock prices have surged higher as investors anticipate significant spending from Takaichi, although some experts worry that her plans could stress the country’s already strained finances. _*]:min-w-0""> Credit rating agency Moody’s confirmed Japan’s A1 debt rating on Monday, pointing to increasing tax collections supported by steady domestic spending and solid economic growth measured in current prices. _*]:min-w-0""> However, the International Monetary Fund cautioned that any government spending should be focused and short-term. “Japan’s economy will go back to potential growth. They don’t need to provide (stimulus),” said Krishna Srinivasan, who heads the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department, in an interview with Reuters. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

On structure, he was explicit. “Just looking at Doge here, you can see how Doge has been forming a cup over here for close to four and a half, five years now […] it’s just been building a big giant base.” In his read, the rounded bottom is the defining pattern of this cycle for DOGE, and it remains intact despite recent volatility. He framed the sharp drawdown two weeks ago as necessary positioning rather than a break in trend: “You just had a great deleveraging event […] I’m not going to look at a lower low and think the trend is broken […] These are very healthy deleveraging before the next move up as far as I’m concerned.” He highlighted “a big giant wick” and “a lot of demand down below,” pointing to what he sees as resilient spot support through the base. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Waking Up: 4 Bullish Signals You Can’t Ignore Timing, not targets, was the centerpiece. He reiterated that Dogecoin typically follows Ethereum with a delay once ETH clears its own major resistance bands. “Whenever we get closer to the end of the rounded bottom […] that’s when Ethereum breaks out above the resistance zone and goes up a lot higher. Thus, Doge runs together with Ethereum,” he said, adding: “There is a lag. I would say the lag is probably maybe a couple months between Ethereum breaking up and Doge finally breaking above this rounded bottom here and going up.” He made a similar observation using risk proxies, noting that DOGE moves have historically trailed small-cap-led risk cycles by several months, though he cautioned that the exact interval can vary. Via X, he added “DOGE lags behind IWM [iShares Russell 2000 ETF] all-time-high breakout by about 2 to 4 months before it takes off.” Cantonese Cat also pushed back on the view that a sequence of lower lows automatically invalidates the DOGE setup, arguing that this occurred in prior cycles just before outsized rallies. “A lot of people look at this, ‘that’s a lower low […] the cycle is over.’ Well, it doesn’t work that way. That’s a lower low right there. Next thing you know, it just went a lot higher,” he said, tying the observation to the current “healthy deleveraging” and the persistence of the rounded-bottom structure. Related Reading: Volatility Loading: Dogecoin Eyes Explosive Path To $3 If the video offered the structural blueprint, his same-day post on X clarified his stance on headline targets. “I realize that it’s stupid to call for DOGE to $2 or $4 when price is at 20 cents. If I was smart like others, I should just call for DOGE to $2 or $4 when it’s $2 or $4.” The comment is consistent with his prior price predictions. Inside the video update, the analyst instead emphasized the sequence he expects to matter—ETH strength first, DOGE follow-through second, with the magnitude determined by how far the broader risk cycle runs once momentum rotates. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.20.

In late October, popular analyst Crypto Rover shared what appeared to be leaked documents suggesting BlockDAG might soon appear on Coinbase and Kraken. Not long after, another influencer, Martini Guy ₿, weighed in, saying it’s “a rumour worth tracking.” For a project that has already gathered over $430 million, sold 27 billion coins, and attracted 312,000 unique holders, even the possibility of Tier-1 exchange listings is major. Most new coins debut on small decentralised exchanges first. But if these leaks have merit, BlockDAG could skip straight to top-tier platforms. A Different Kind of Leak The documents making rounds online seem to show a Kraken Cooperation Agreement, including: $300,000 USDT for integration $200,000 USDT + $100,000 in BDAG for marketing $300,000 in liquidity support The alleged Coinbase MOU lists BDAG/USDT and BDAG/USD pairs, marketing collaboration, and inclusion in Coinbase Earn. If this turns out genuine, it suggests both exchanges are already setting up infrastructure for BDAG, an unusual move for a project still in its presale stage. Though none of these claims are confirmed, the market’s tone has clearly shifted. Traders now discuss when rather than if BlockDAG lists. That change in sentiment alone has pushed BDAG forward as the best crypto to buy right now. Why BlockDAG’s Fundamentals Back the Buzz Speculation fades fast, but technology endures. BlockDAG’s hybrid Proof-of-Work and Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) setup blends scalability with security, supporting up to 15,000 transactions per second. Its live Awakening Testnet already achieves 1,400 TPS, a practical display of speed, not just projections. The platform’s EVM compatibility allows Ethereum-based apps to launch smoothly, attracting developers ready to migrate. With 3 million users mining via the X1 app, BlockDAG has built a thriving ecosystem even before launch, a rare achievement. Its core appeal isn’t hype; it’s structure. With a sustainable, energy-efficient mining model that lets anyone join through their smartphone, BlockDAG bridges advanced tech with accessibility. Priced at $0.0015 in batch 31, far below its confirmed $0.05 launch price, BDAG is widely seen as the best crypto to buy while this entry point lasts. Traders Move From Speculation to Belief As chatter about the leaks spread, X (Twitter) and Telegram filled with screenshots, analyses, and debates. BDAG’s community channels saw sharp growth, with many holders reinforcing their positions. BlockDAG’s presale has already become one of the largest in recent years, but the rumour of Coinbase and Kraken listings took excitement to another level. Historically, confirmed Tier-1 listings drive liquidity and price surges. If BDAG debuts directly on these exchanges, it could replicate early-stage success stories like Ethereum and Solana. Timing plays in its favour, too. With Bitcoin holding above $100,000 and the total crypto market near $4 trillion, capital is shifting toward scalable layer-1s. Backed by strong funding, a near-ready mainnet, and potential listings, BlockDAG stands out as the best crypto to buy for those chasing asymmetric returns. Waiting for Confirmation Right now, BlockDAG sits between rumour and revelation. The leaks remain unverified, but they’ve already reshaped how the project is perceived, from niche to headline. Traders are alert, institutions are watching, and the industry is curious. If Coinbase and Kraken listings become reality, BlockDAG won’t just join another exchange list; it’ll redefine how credible tech, real traction, and smart timing can align. With $430 million raised, millions engaged, and presale momentum continuing, BlockDAG holds its place as the best crypto to buy before formal confirmation. Whether these leaks prove true or not, it’s clear: the project has captured global attention, and its next chapter might rewrite crypto history.

Claver's thesis is based on restructuring, ETF approvals, and institutional demand. Currently trading around $2.66, XRP is believed to be poised for a “supply shock.” Claver highlights the potential of XRP Ledger to modernize global payments, positioning it as a bridge to instant cross-border payments for banks and corporations. Skeptics argue that a $100 price implies a $6 trillion market capitalization, but Claver points to a multiplier effect: $550 billion in fresh liquidity could drive leveraged demand similar to Bitcoin's early surges. Ripple's $1.25 billion acquisition of prime brokerage Hidden Road bolsters this claim by giving giants like BlackRock access to regulated payments through XRPL. Another High Potential Coin to Watch While XRP is focusing on triple-digit gains, Minotaurus (MTAUR) is quietly continuing its upward trend. The token has risen from 0.00004 to 0.00012476 USDT (+212%), and a listing at 0.00020 USDT still offers 60% upside potential. The next step, at 0.00014 USDT, is less than 9 hours away. At today's price, 100 USDT yields approximately 801,923 MTAUR. Supported by a working blockchain maze game, SolidProof and Coinsult audits, and a 100,000 USDT raffle, over 2,852,355 USDT was raised towards the $6.44 million goal.

After several cycles of hype, vaporware, and failed launches, a new generation of Web3, AI, and real-world-integrated projects is preparing to enter the market — this time, with real technology, communities, and in some cases, tangible revenue. From TRUE World’s groundbreaking GameFi economy to next-gen DeFi infrastructure and AI-integrated ecosystems, these are the most anticipated crypto listings of 2025 — projects that could redefine investor expectations in the year ahead. 1. TRUE World ($TRUE) — Web3 Gaming Meets Real Business No upcoming listing has generated more excitement than $TRUE , the flagship token of TRUE World, built by TRUE LABS, a high-grade gaming studio with millions of users and confirmed annual revenue. This is the first-ever token launch backed by a functioning, profitable gaming ecosystem. TRUE tokenomics are designed for sustainability and deflation, with mechanisms that feed real-world revenue back into the economy: Buybacks and Burns: A portion of gaming revenue is used to buy and burn $TRUE from the open market. Utility-Driven Demand: Players use $TRUE for in-game upgrades, rewards, staking, and governance. Closed-Loop Growth: The more users play, the more value circulates within the system. TRUE represents the moment Web3 gaming grows up — a token born from a product, powered by measurable usage, and designed to scale. With Tier-1 exchange listings expected before the end of 2025, $TRUE is shaping up as one of the year’s defining launches. Watch for official announcements of $TRUE listing details at x.com/TRUExWorld 2. EigenLayer (EIGEN) — The Restaking Revolution Expands Following an explosive 2024, EigenLayer is expected to bring its native token, EIGEN, to exchanges in 2025. As the first large-scale restaking protocol on Ethereum, it allows users to re-use staked ETH to secure additional services and networks — a new class of “meta-staking.” With more than $15 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) and partnerships across the Ethereum ecosystem, EIGEN’s listing could dominate liquidity flows in early 2025. Its launch is widely viewed as a major event for the DeFi yield layer and institutional staking markets. 3. Karak (KARAK) — Restaking’s Challenger Layer Karak Network is quickly positioning itself as the primary competitor to EigenLayer, offering an alternative restaking model focused on modularity and cross-chain security. Expected to launch its token KARAK in 2025, the project aims to capture institutional and developer adoption through flexible security modules and multi-chain validator integrations. Its listing will test the depth of market appetite for restaking-based yield protocols, one of the hottest narratives of the year. 4. Movement Labs (MOVE) — Bringing the Move VM to Ethereum Movement Labs is developing a Layer-2 that integrates the Move Virtual Machine, originally designed for Aptos and Sui, into the Ethereum ecosystem. MOVE’s emphasis on safety, parallel execution, and developer-friendly programming could make it one of the most technically unique listings of 2025. With growing interest in cross-VM compatibility and modular Layer-2s, MOVE’s token debut will attract attention from both developers and investors. 5. Lens Protocol (LENS) — SocialFi Goes Mainstream Lens Protocol, the decentralized social network built by the Aave team, is preparing for its long-awaited token launch in 2025. Lens aims to redefine how social platforms operate by giving creators ownership of their content, audience, and monetization channels. With millions of registered profiles and a thriving builder ecosystem, the LENS token is expected to fuel governance, content monetization, and new SocialFi integrations — potentially making it the flagship token for decentralized social media. 6. zkSync (ZKS) — Scaling Ethereum with Zero Knowledge The zkSync ecosystem has matured rapidly, onboarding developers, dApps, and liquidity from Ethereum. Its upcoming token ZKS is expected to serve as the gas and governance token for the Layer-2, securing the network through staking and incentivizing participation in zk rollups. Given zkSync’s developer traction and strong community, ZKS could be one of the largest infrastructure listings of 2025. 7. StarkNet (STRK) — The zk-Rollup Powerhouse Finally Arrives After several test phases and developer airdrops, StarkNet’s STRK token is set to go fully public in 2025. Backed by StarkWare, one of the pioneers of zero-knowledge cryptography, STRK will drive governance and staking for the network’s ZK-powered scaling solutions. As enterprise demand for ZK tech expands, STRK could solidify StarkNet’s role as a key scaling layer for Ethereum. 8. SUBBD (SUBBD) — AI + Web3 Content Economy Emerging at the intersection of AI and creative media, SUBBD is building a decentralized platform for content monetization, distribution, and personalization. Its listing later in 2025 will spotlight the AI x creator economy narrative — rewarding users for content production, curation, and data sharing. While still early-stage, SUBBD’s partnerships and product roadmap suggest a serious attempt to merge machine learning and digital IP on-chain. 9. Orochi (ON) — Verifiable Data for Web3 Infrastructure Orochi (ON) focuses on verifiable data and computation layers for decentralized applications. With its airdrop and early-access listings already in motion, the full exchange rollout in 2025 could expand its reach. ON is expected to power staking, data validation, and decentralized node operations, catering to developers building scalable, data-driven dApps. As on-chain data integrity becomes central to DeFi and AI, Orochi could emerge as a critical backend solution. Final Take The 2025 listing wave reflects a maturing market — one that’s prioritizing real value, infrastructure, and economic sustainability. Gone are the days when a presale alone could drive hype. The next generation of tokens is anchored in working ecosystems, verifiable metrics, and cross-industry integration. Among them, TRUE stands as the clearest example of evolution: a Web3 gaming token backed by real business performance. But the broader lineup — from EigenLayer to zkSync and Lens — reveals how diverse, advanced, and interconnected crypto has become.

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/market-strategist-to-xrp-holders-biggest-chance-of-your-life-heres-what-is-coming/,"The XRP market is heating up, and technical signals suggest that something big could be on the horizon. After months of tight consolidation, the charts are showing patterns eerily similar to those that preceded XRP’s explosive rallies in 2017 and 2021. For patient holders, this may be one of those rare market moments where compression meets conviction, and as one analyst puts it, it could be “the biggest chance of your life.” Historical Patterns That Point to a Breakout In a detailed analysis shared on his X handle, STEPH IS CRYPTO highlighted striking similarities between XRP’s current weekly chart and its previous bull cycles. A ccording to Steph, “XRP is getting very close to the next major leg higher in the crypto market,” and the ongoing consolidation is almost a mirror image of the structure seen before its previous parabolic moves. He explained that in both 2017 and 2020–2021, XRP spent months trading sideways before erupting into massive uptrends. Back then, the price was compressed within a tightening wedge pattern for roughly 294 days and 238 days, respectively, before the eventual breakout. #XRP : BIGGEST CHANCE OF YOUR LIFE!!! pic.twitter.com/zM2QGpUeeQ — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 27, 2025 “Now in 2025,” Steph noted, “we are once again getting compressed by an upward support line and a downward resistance, nearing the apex.” This repeating pattern, he suggests, isn’t random but part of XRP’s cyclical behaviour — long consolidations followed by rapid expansions. Momentum Indicators Confirm Bullish Structure Steph backed his projection with data from key momentum indicators, noting that XRP is currently “perfectly holding above the 50-week simple moving average.” Historically, breaking below this level with two weekly closes has signaled the start of bear markets, something XRP has avoided so far. “If you lose the 50-week moving average,” he explained, “it’s a confirmation signal of a bear market. But right now, we are still holding that, so I’m still in favor of more upside.” He also referenced the EMA ribbons and the Stochastic RSI, tools that measure long-term momentum. The Stochastic RSI, in particular, is now sitting in oversold territory , a zone that marked historic buying opportunities in previous cycles. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 “In 2017 and 2020, XRP was significantly oversold on the weekly scale before explosive rallies,” Steph observed. “Right now, we’re seeing the same signal again.” Liquidity Data Favors a Move to the Upside Another critical piece of Steph’s analysis focuses on XRP’s liquidation heatmap, which shows where leveraged positions are most concentrated. Currently, the majority of liquidity sits above the current price. According to Steph, “price typically goes after the highest liquidity in the market,” meaning XRP could soon chase those upper-level orders — a setup for a potential short squeeze . He added that “there isn’t any reason for us to go much lower,” given how liquidity is distributed, reinforcing his view that upward pressure is building beneath the surface. Macro Events Could Be the Catalyst Steph also pointed to macroeconomic factors that could amplify XRP’s next move. This week’s Federal Reserve interest rate decision and upcoming U.S.–China trade discussions could inject volatility across markets. Historically, such events have triggered major liquidity shifts in crypto — especially when technical conditions like XRP’s are already primed for a breakout. A Moment of Opportunity Summing up his outlook, Steph stated confidently: “I think XRP is in a strong uptrend, and the next major move higher is only just a matter of time.” With technicals aligning, liquidity favoring the upside, and macro catalysts approaching, XRP appears poised at a defining moment. For investors who understand the rhythm of compression and expansion, this may not just be another rally — it could indeed be, as Steph describes, “the biggest chance of your life.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

With a strongly rallying altcoin market the memecoins are probably not going to sit idly by. $DOGE, $PEPE, and $PENGU have all found bottoms. Is now the time to get in? $DOGE consolidates at major support Source: TradingView $DOGE is looking good to go. The huge dip out of the ascending wedge exactly met the extent of the measured move, and was then bought up rapidly. The price has still not returned to the wedge, but has instead been consolidating along the $0.20 horizontal support line. This is major support as can be seen by looking left at previous price action. Therefore, with the Stochastic RSI indicators at the bottom and posturing to cross back up, building a position at this area is probably a decent bet. If the price does fall below the support and confirm below, this would be a time for caution. The next major price target is at $0.31 at the 0.382 Fibonacci level, while $0.475 at the 0.618 Fibonacci is just below the major local high. Potential big gains ahead for $PEPE Source: TradingView In the above daily chart it can be seen that the $PEPE price is consolidating along the $0.0000072 support line. If there is one more dip from here, the $0.000006 is major horizontal support that goes back to March 2024. The trick here is to buy in and set a stop loss that won’t be triggered before a rally up to the $0.000009 horizontal resistance. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index shows that the indicator line has broken through the downtrend line and has confirmed above. This looks bullish. Breaking through the overhead resistance is obviously the first target, and then the descending trendline. After that, it’s $0.0000125 at the 0.382 Fibonacci, and $0.0000155 at the 5.0 Fibonacci. $PENGU hits bottom of bull flag Source: TradingView The weekly view for $PENGU is a great looking chart. It appears that $PENGU might have hit bottom last week as the price retested the bottom of the bull flag. Underneath this is some good horizontal support. It might be expected that the price now starts to rise back towards the top of the bull flag with a potential breakout when it gets there. The measured move for the breakout is arrived at by taking a measurement of the pole of the bull flag and then transferring this to the bottom of the flag. $0.057 is the potential outcome. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are in a perfect position to start angling back towards their top limit, signalling large-scale price momentum as they pass above the 25.00 level.

Is It Actually a Victory?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/us-giant-sp-global-gives-bitcoin-bull-startegy-a-junk-rating-is-it-actually-a-victory/,"American credit rating agency S&P Global has given Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the largest institutional Bitcoin (BTC) investor, a B- rating, meaning junk. Accordingly, S&P Global Ratings issued a B- junk credit rating to Strategy, indicating that the company is in the “high risk” category. The agency cited the company's heavy reliance on Bitcoin, its weak capital structure relative to its risk profile, and its fragile US dollar liquidity as justification for its rating. S&P Global noted that Strategy's business model (buying and holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset financed through equity and debt) provides investors with indirect exposure to Bitcoin without actually holding it. However, S&P added that the Strategy's Bitcoin concentration continues to dominate its credit profile and introduces risks associated with regulatory actions and market volatility. S&P Global also said it is unlikely to upgrade Stategy's rating in the next 12 months. It added that it could downgrade the rating further if Bitcoin prices fall sharply or the company's access to capital markets weakens. Although S&P gave Global Strategy a rather negative rating, the company's founder, Michael Saylor, pointed out that Strategy was the first Bitcoin treasury company to receive a rating from a major credit rating agency. At this point, the cryptocurrency market is more concerned about Strategy's rating from such a major credit agency than the junk rating it received, calling it a “victory.” Economists believe that for a company in the US to receive a rating from a major rating agency, or even to even reach their analysts' desk, is considered a significant development. Economists also noted that many large funds and companies prefer to invest in companies with rated ratings. According to economists, despite Strategy receiving a junk credit rating from S&P Global Ratings, the rating has placed it in the investment-grade category. S&P Global Ratings previously gave the same B- rating to decentralized stablecoin issuer Sky Protocol (formerly MakerDAO). *This is not investment advice.

This proposal, aimed at addressing what some developers perceive as ‘spam’ data on the network, is sparking considerable controversy and raising fundamental questions about Bitcoin’s core purpose. The debate highlights the delicate balance between innovation and preserving the network’s foundational principles. What is This Bitcoin Soft Fork Proposal All About? The BIP-444 proposal suggests a temporary restriction on non-transaction data stored on the Bitcoin blockchain, limiting it to just 83 bytes. The primary goal, as reported by Cointelegraph , is to curb the influx of data deemed non-essential, thereby maintaining the network’s efficiency and integrity. Proponents argue this measure is crucial to ensure Bitcoin remains primarily a robust store of value, rather than evolving into a general-purpose data storage medium. This distinction is vital for many in the community who believe in Bitcoin’s original vision. Why Are Some Voices Strongly Opposed to This Bitcoin Soft Fork ? However, this seemingly straightforward solution has ignited a fiery debate. Concerns are mounting that such a restriction could inadvertently lead to increased centralization within the Bitcoin ecosystem. Critics fear that limiting data might empower certain entities, potentially allowing them to exert undue influence over the network’s future direction. One prominent voice against the proposal is Chun Wang , the founder of F2Pool , a major crypto mining pool with Chinese roots. Wang unequivocally stated his opposition, calling BIP-444 a ‘bad idea.’ He emphasized his unwillingness to support any soft fork, temporary or otherwise, expressing a sentiment that some developers are ‘increasingly moving in the wrong direction.’ This highlights a deep-seated apprehension about changes that could alter Bitcoin’s decentralized nature. The core of this opposition often stems from a belief in Bitcoin’s permissionless nature. Any restriction, even if well-intentioned, can be seen as a slippery slope towards censorship or control, which runs counter to the ethos of a truly decentralized network. Moreover, some argue that the market should naturally determine the value and use of block space, rather than imposing artificial limits. Is There a Middle Ground for the Bitcoin Soft Fork Debate? The proponents of BIP-444 are not backing down. They firmly believe their proposal serves to reaffirm Bitcoin’s original intent: to be a sovereign store of value and a medium for secure transactions. They contend that using the blockchain for excessive non-transactional data burdens the network, potentially increasing transaction fees and slowing down processing times for its primary use case. They express confidence that through continued dialogue and robust discussion, a consensus can ultimately be reached. This process of community-driven decision-making is a hallmark of Bitcoin’s development, often involving: Extensive technical reviews and peer discussions. Open forums and community calls to gather feedback. Rigorous testing and simulation of proposed changes. This iterative approach ensures that any significant changes are thoroughly vetted and broadly supported by the community. What Lessons Can We Learn from Past Bitcoin Soft Fork Discussions? The current debate around BIP-444 is not entirely new territory for Bitcoin. The network has a history of intense discussions regarding its future, perhaps most notably during the ‘block size wars’ years ago. These past debates underscore the community’s commitment to careful, deliberate changes and the challenges of achieving widespread agreement in a decentralized system. The outcome of this particular Bitcoin soft fork proposal will have significant implications. It will signal how the community intends to manage network resources and define Bitcoin’s evolving role in the digital economy. Understanding these discussions is crucial for anyone involved in the crypto space, as they directly influence the network’s scalability, security, and fundamental utility. Staying informed and participating in these conversations, where appropriate, offers valuable insight into Bitcoin’s future trajectory. The proposed Bitcoin soft fork , BIP-444, has undoubtedly ignited a crucial and complex debate within the community. It pits the desire to maintain Bitcoin’s identity as a pristine store of value against concerns about centralization and censorship. While disagreements are evident, the ongoing dialogue reflects the vibrant and decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s development. The path forward will likely involve continued technical analysis, open community discussion, and a collective effort to find solutions that uphold Bitcoin’s foundational principles while adapting to new challenges. This journey is a testament to the community’s dedication to Bitcoin’s long-term success. Frequently Asked Questions About the Bitcoin Soft Fork Proposal Q1: What is BIP-444? A1: BIP-444 is a proposed Bitcoin soft fork aimed at temporarily limiting non-transactional data on the Bitcoin blockchain to 83 bytes. Its purpose is to reduce network ‘spam’ and reinforce Bitcoin’s role as a store of value rather than a data storage medium. Q2: Why is BIP-444 considered controversial? A2: It’s controversial because critics, like Chun Wang , founder of F2Pool , argue it could lead to increased centralization and go against Bitcoin’s permissionless nature. They fear it could allow certain entities to dominate the network by dictating what data is permissible. Q3: What is a ‘soft fork’ in Bitcoin? A3: A soft fork is a backward-compatible change to the Bitcoin protocol. This means that nodes that haven’t upgraded to the new rules can still validate blocks created by upgraded nodes, though they might not fully understand the new rules. It requires a supermajority of the network to adopt. Q4: How do proponents justify BIP-444? A4: Proponents believe that limiting non-transactional data reaffirms Bitcoin’s primary function as a secure store of value and a medium for financial transactions. They argue that excessive data storage burdens the network and deviates from its core purpose, as reported by outlets like Cointelegraph . Q5: What is the significance of the community reaching ‘consensus’? A5: Reaching consensus is crucial in Bitcoin’s decentralized ecosystem. It ensures that significant protocol changes are widely accepted and supported by miners, developers, and users, maintaining the network’s stability, security, and democratic governance structure. If you found this exploration of the Bitcoin soft fork debate insightful, consider sharing it with your network.

The move follows months of consolidation between $3,700 and $4,700 since July and mirrors a descending channel breakout pattern similar to the one that fueled Bitcoin’s 2024 rally. The breakout has renewed confidence among traders, with ETH’s 7-day RSI at 63.8, suggesting strong but not overheated momentum. The MACD histogram at +17.2 further supports a bullish continuation, pointing to rising buying pressure and favorable short-term dynamics. Technical Targets: Resistance at $4,450–$4,529 Ethereum’s immediate target lies in the $4,450–$4,529 range — the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level from its prior macro swing. A daily close above $4,232 would confirm an established uptrend, while a rejection could pull ETH back toward $3,593 support, where demand has historically rebounded. A sustained move above $4,232 may trigger algorithmic buying, potentially extending the rally toward $4,500, a psychological barrier and round-number resistance. Fusaka Upgrade: Scaling Ethereum’s Layer 2 Ecosystem The upcoming Fusaka upgrade, scheduled for December 3, serves as a fundamental catalyst. It introduces PeerDAS, a data-availability innovation that will double blob capacity, thereby improving Layer 2 throughput and significantly reducing transaction costs. This upgrade will enhance Ethereum’s modular design, making it more efficient for rollups, DeFi protocols, and decentralized applications migrating to Layer 2 solutions. Analysts view Fusaka as a long-term scalability milestone that strengthens Ethereum’s position against competitors in the smart contract space. Where to Exchange ETH: Trade Efficiently with Clapp For investors and traders looking to capitalize on Ethereum’s renewed strength, Clapp.finance offers one of the most streamlined and reliable ways to buy, sell, or trade ETH — supporting both crypto-to-crypto and fiat-to-crypto transactions.

The platform is actively expanding across Europe, offering users peace of mind when managing both fiat and crypto holdings. Zero Deposit Fees, Unified Dashboard Clapp charges no deposit fees, whether funding with fiat or crypto. Everything — from fiat conversion to portfolio tracking — takes place within one integrated app, eliminating the need to juggle multiple exchanges or wallets. For ETH traders, this means faster execution, simpler management, and greater control over liquidity — all through a secure and regulated environment. Outlook: Eyes on $4,500 as Ethereum Builds Strength With Ethereum reclaiming its 200-day EMA and signaling renewed upward momentum, the path toward $4,450–$4,529 looks increasingly attainable. A confirmed close above $4,232 would likely catalyze further buying pressure, paving the way for a test of $4,500. If sustained, this rally could mark Ethereum’s strongest structural recovery of the year — powered by a combination of technical resilience, institutional accumulation, and protocol-level innovation through the Fusaka upgrade.

It appears the crypto stock correlation is strengthening once again, tightly linking the volatile world of cryptocurrencies with traditional U.S. equities. This insight challenges previous expectations and offers a fresh perspective for investors navigating both markets. What’s Driving the Renewed Crypto Stock Correlation? For a while, many in the crypto community hoped that increasing regulation would carve out a unique space for digital currencies, reducing their dependence on traditional markets. However, Citibank’s analysis, as reported by CoinDesk , indicates this hasn’t quite happened. Instead, U.S. stocks continue to act as a major macroeconomic driver for cryptocurrency prices. This means that when the stock market experiences significant shifts – whether positive or negative – cryptocurrencies often follow suit. The idea that crypto could be a completely uncorrelated asset class, offering a hedge against traditional market downturns, is being actively re-evaluated by financial institutions and individual investors alike. This makes understanding the nuances of the crypto stock correlation more critical than ever for portfolio management. The report suggests that the global financial ecosystem is becoming increasingly interconnected. As more institutional money flows into crypto, and as the regulatory landscape remains somewhat uncertain, the gravitational pull of established markets like U.S. equities becomes more pronounced. This interdependence is a key factor in the renewed strength of this correlation. How Does Volatility Play into the Crypto Stock Correlation? Volatility is a hallmark of the crypto market, but how does it interact with the strengthening crypto stock correlation ? Citibank’s report notes that Bitcoin’s (BTC) volatility is currently below its one-year average. Despite this, BTC remains sensitive to movements in both stock and gold markets. This suggests that even with lower inherent volatility, external market forces still exert considerable influence on its price action. Bitcoin’s Sensitivity: BTC price movements are still significantly impacted by shifts in U.S. stock indices and gold prices. This connection implies that major economic announcements or shifts in investor sentiment towards traditional assets can quickly ripple through the Bitcoin market. Ethereum’s Dynamic: Ethereum (ETH), on the other hand, is exhibiting greater short-term volatility. This characteristic suggests that ETH might react more sharply and immediately to news, trends, or specific market events compared to the more established Bitcoin. Gold’s Role: The correlation with gold has also remained high, although it has weakened slightly recently. This highlights a broader trend of digital assets responding to traditional safe-haven or inflation-hedge narratives, indicating a complex relationship that isn’t purely tied to growth stocks. Understanding these nuances is crucial for investors. The intertwining of these asset classes means a diversified portfolio needs careful consideration of how each component influences the others, especially when assessing risk and potential returns. Navigating the Strengthening Crypto Stock Correlation: What’s Next for Investors? The increasing crypto stock correlation presents both challenges and opportunities for market participants. For traditional investors considering crypto, it suggests that simply adding digital assets might not offer the broad diversification benefits once assumed. Instead, it might amplify exposure to existing market risks. For crypto enthusiasts, it means keeping an even closer eye on macroeconomic indicators and stock market trends, as these are no longer distant factors. Actionable Insights for Informed Decisions: Monitor Traditional Markets Diligently: Pay close attention to major U.S. stock indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Their performance, along with economic reports, can often foreshadow crypto market movements. Understanding these signals can help in timing entries and exits. Re-evaluate Diversification Strategies: If your primary goal for crypto investment is to diversify away from traditional equities, it’s time to re-assess. The strengthening correlation means that during a stock market downturn, your crypto holdings might not provide the expected buffer. Understand Asset-Specific Volatility: Recognize that while Bitcoin might show lower volatility compared to its historical average, other assets like Ethereum could present more immediate risks and rewards due to their higher short-term volatility. Tailor your risk management accordingly. Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: While regulation hasn’t decoupled the markets yet, future frameworks could still influence how crypto assets behave. Keep abreast of policy changes that might impact market structure. The notion of crypto as an entirely separate market is evolving. As institutional players like Citibank increasingly analyze these trends, the insights become more refined and impactful for everyone involved, from retail traders to large-scale institutional funds. In conclusion, Citibank’s report serves as a compelling reminder that the cryptocurrency market is not an island. The strengthening crypto stock correlation signifies a growing maturity and integration of digital assets into the broader financial landscape. While some hoped for complete decoupling, the current reality points towards a complex interplay where traditional market forces continue to exert significant influence. Investors must adapt their strategies, acknowledging this evolving relationship to make informed decisions in a rapidly changing financial world. This understanding is paramount for navigating the future of finance effectively. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the crypto stock correlation? A1: The crypto stock correlation refers to the observed tendency for cryptocurrency prices, particularly major ones like Bitcoin and Ethereum, to move in the same direction as traditional stock market indices, such as the S&P 500 or Nasdaq . A strengthening correlation means these asset classes are becoming more interconnected. Q2: Why is the crypto stock correlation strengthening again, according to Citibank? A2: Citibank ‘s report, as cited by CoinDesk , suggests that U.S. stocks remain a key macroeconomic factor driving cryptocurrency prices. Despite earlier expectations that regulation would create a unique, decoupled environment for crypto, this hasn’t fully materialized, leading to a renewed tightening of the link between the two asset classes. Q3: How does this strengthening correlation impact crypto investors? A3: For crypto investors, a stronger crypto stock correlation means that digital assets might offer less diversification against traditional market downturns than previously thought. Investors should closely monitor macroeconomic indicators and stock market performance, as these will likely have a significant influence on their crypto portfolios. It necessitates a re-evaluation of risk management and portfolio construction strategies. Q4: Is the correlation between cryptocurrencies and gold still high? A4: Yes, the correlation between cryptocurrencies and gold has remained high, according to Citibank. While it has weakened slightly in recent times, gold continues to be a relevant traditional asset class to consider when analyzing cryptocurrency market movements. Q5: What did Citibank note about Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) volatility? A5: Citibank noted that Bitcoin’s (BTC) volatility is currently below its one-year average but is still sensitive to movements in the stock and gold markets. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is exhibiting greater short-term volatility, suggesting it reacts more sharply to immediate market changes.

The network has already attracted collaboration from more than 100 institutions across global finance and technology — including BlackRock, Visa, and Amazon Web Services (AWS) — along with major capital markets, banks, and fintech players. Developers and enterprises can now deploy, test, and build applications on Arc as Circle aims to create a unified, programmable financial infrastructure for the global economy. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire described Arc as “purpose-built to connect every local market to the global economy,”highlighting its mission to enable faster, more inclusive, and internet-native financial systems. Institutions and Capital Markets Join the Testnet Arc’s early partners include some of the world’s largest financial institutions and asset managers — among them Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, Société Générale, Standard Chartered, State Street, and Apollo Global Management. These participants will experiment with tokenized assets, lending, and programmable FX settlement on the network. According to Robert Mitchnick, Global Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, the project offers “insight into how stablecoin-denominated settlement and onchain FX could enable more efficient capital markets.” Expanding the Onchain Payments Beyond capital markets, Arc’s testnet features integration with global payments and fintech leaders such as Mastercard, Nuvei, Brex, Cloudflare, FIS, and dLocal. The network aims to power cross-border payments, merchant settlements, and programmable finance — including use by AI-driven autonomous agents to send, exchange, and settle value in real time. Visa’s Head of Crypto, Cuy Sheffield, said the company is exploring how Arc’s design — integrating stablecoin-based gas fees and deterministic finality — could “help scale emerging onchain infrastructure.” The Road to Decentralized Governance While Circle is currently stewarding Arc’s early development, the company plans to transition toward distributed, community-driven governance. The network’s roadmap includes expanding validator participation and establishing transparent frameworks to ensure open, verifiable operations. Ultimately, Circle envisions Arc as a shared, neutral layer of economic infrastructure — a blockchain backbone for global finance that bridges regulated institutions, fintech innovators, and decentralized networks. With major players like BlackRock, Visa, and AWS already onboard, Arc’s testnet marks a decisive step toward making onchain finance mainstream. Price Action Shares of Circle Internet Group Inc. (NYSE: CRCL) climbed 7.2% over the past month, closing at $143.29 on Monday amid renewed investor optimism surrounding the company’s blockchain expansion efforts. The stock opened at $146.93, trading between a monthly low of $138.10 and a high of $147.44, with a current market capitalization of $32.95 billion. While the pre-market price shows a slight dip to $141.57 (-1.20%), Circle’s recent momentum reflects growing confidence in the company’s long-term strategy to become a core infrastructure provider for the digital asset economy. Arc’s launch marks a strategic evolution for Circle, best known as the issuer of USDC, one of the world’s leading stablecoins. The new blockchain aims to serve as a foundation for tokenized assets, onchain payments, and programmable finance, integrating directly with Circle’s existing products and services. Investors have interpreted the Arc testnet launch — and its backing by major financial institutions — as a signal that Circle is deepening its role in bridging traditional finance and blockchain technology. Analysts suggest that the company’s partnerships with BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs, and Société Générale through Arc could attract institutional liquidity and strengthen Circle’s positioning in the onchain settlement market. The broader crypto sector has also shown signs of renewed activity, with sentiment improving after the approval of multiple digital asset ETFs and growing institutional participation in blockchain infrastructure.

This bold move highlights a growing trend among traditional financial entities embracing Bitcoin as a core component of their portfolios.

The move follows a sharp drop in the company’s market capitalization-to-net asset value (mNAV) ratio — a key metric that compares a firm’s market value to the worth of its cryptocurrency portfolio. “We recognize that due to increasing market volatility and declining mNAV, our share price currently does not adequately reflect our intrinsic economic value,” the company said in an official statement. The buyback will be conducted on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, with a maximum volume of 150 million common shares, equivalent to 13.13% of all outstanding shares. To finance the program, Metaplanet’s board of directors approved a $500 million credit facility, which will remain active for one year. Falling Metrics and a High-Stakes Strategy The mNAV — or Market-to-Net Asset Value ratio — is considered one of the most important indicators for digital asset treasury (DAT) firms like Metaplanet. It measures how the company’s market capitalization compares with the total value of its crypto reserves. In mid-October 2025, Metaplanet’s mNAV fell below 1.0, meaning the company’s market value dropped below the worth of its Bitcoin holdings — signaling that shares were trading at a discount. The buyback aims to reduce the number of shares outstanding, which could boost earnings per share and improve market perception. However, since the repurchase will be funded through borrowing, analysts warn it also introduces additional financial risk if market conditions worsen. Stock Reaction and Bitcoin Ambitions Metaplanet’s stock hit its lowest level since early May on October 20, largely due to crypto market volatility. Since then, shares have rebounded, rising nearly 19% over five days following the buyback announcement. Metaplanet stock price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, in yen. Source: TradingView. Despite the turbulence, the company reaffirmed its ambitious plan to purchase 210,000 BTC by the end of 2027, a goal that would cement its position as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder. By taking this aggressive step, Metaplanet appears determined to restore investor confidence and prove the sustainability of its Bitcoin-backed model — even as markets test the limits of digital-asset-based finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-28 12:21:49
53737452,https://bitzo.com/2025/10/bnb-price-forecast-bullish-momentum-builds-after-12b-token-burn,1761654185,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/53737452.jpeg,BNB Price Forecast: Bullish Momentum Builds After $1.2B Token Burn,https://bitzo.com/2025/10/bnb-price-forecast-bullish-momentum-builds-after-12b-token-burn,"BNB Chain executed its 33rd quarterly burn on October 27, permanently removing 1.44 million BNB worth approximately $1.2 billion from circulation. The event reduced the total circulating supply to 137.7 million tokens, in line with BNB’s long-term deflationary strategy. Under BNB’s burn mechanism, 50% of all net transaction fees are allocated to periodic token burns until half of the total supply is permanently destroyed. This model is designed to steadily reduce available supply, strengthening long-term token value and aligning with the network’s goal of sustainable deflation. The latest burn represents about 0.7% of BNB’s market capitalization, a meaningful contraction that signals ongoing commitment to value preservation through disciplined supply control. Burns Signal Confidence and Reduce Sell Pressure Beyond their mechanical impact on token supply, burns serve a vital psychological function in the crypto market. By demonstrating consistent follow-through on its roadmap, BNB Chain reinforces investor confidence in the asset’s long-term fundamentals. Token burns effectively reduce potential sell pressure, particularly during market recovery phases when profit-taking typically increases. As fewer tokens circulate, each unit potentially holds greater scarcity value — a dynamic that can amplify bullish sentiment when coupled with rising demand. This transparency and predictability in BNB’s deflationary policy have been a stabilizing factor during broader market volatility. Technical Outlook: Trend Turns Constructive Source: coinmarketcap BNB’s technical structure is now favoring the bulls after the token reclaimed its 30-day simple moving average (SMA) at $1,135.9 and climbed above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $1,163.97. These recoveries suggest that the recent correction has likely run its course and that momentum is shifting back toward accumulation. The 14-day RSI at 52.53 shows moderate strength — far from overbought — giving BNB room to build further upside without triggering exhaustion signals. From a structural standpoint, the $1,160–$1,200 range remains a critical liquidity zone, having seen $319 million in liquidations during Bitcoin’s rally to $116K. A sustained move above $1,212.73 (the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement) would likely confirm bullish continuation, setting the next target near the $1,370 swing high. Where to Exchange BNB: Trade Efficiently with Clapp For traders and investors looking to act on BNB’s renewed strength, Clapp.finance provides an all-purpose exchange that simplifies both crypto-to-crypto and fiat-to-crypto transactions. Seamless Fiat Conversions Clapp enables users to buy BNB directly with euros via SEPA transfers, integrating fiat access into a single app without third-party intermediaries. Users can also convert BNB back into EUR and withdraw to their bank accounts instantly — a smooth and native off-ramp experience that many exchanges struggle to match. Smart Liquidity and Better Pricing Clapp’s smart liquidity aggregator sources the best rates from both centralized and decentralized exchanges. This ensures optimal pricing and minimal slippage for every trade, whether you’re entering or exiting a BNB position. Regulated and Transparent Framework Clapp operates as a licensed Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) in the Czech Republic and is expanding across Europe. This regulated foundation brings clarity and trust to fiat operations — a crucial advantage for users seeking a secure trading environment. No Deposit Fees and Unified Experience Unlike many exchanges, Clapp charges zero deposit fees, for both fiat and crypto transfers. Everything — from on-ramping and off-ramping to trading and portfolio tracking — happens inside one clean, user-friendly interface. Clapp combines the utility of a professional trading hub with the accessibility of digital banking, making it one of the most efficient ways to manage BNB positions and broader crypto portfolios. Outlook: Sustainable Bullish Setup Emerging BNB’s combination of deflationary tokenomics, strengthening technical structure, and broader market recovery paints a constructive medium-term picture. If the token closes above $1,160 and confirms a breakout beyond $1,212, momentum traders could eye $1,370 as the next resistance level. Conversely, failure to hold above the 30-day SMA may invite short-term retests of the $1,100–$1,120 support area. With consistent token burns reinforcing scarcity and confidence, and platforms like Clapp offering frictionless access to BNB trading, the asset appears well-positioned for continued strength in the months ahead.

Coinbase Prime staking services are undergoing a significant expansion, thanks to a deepened and strategic partnership with staking infrastructure provider Figment. This collaboration is set to unlock new opportunities for secure and diversified yield generation, marking a pivotal moment for institutional engagement with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) assets. Unveiling the Expanded Coinbase Prime Staking Offerings Coinbase Prime has officially broadened its partnership with Figment, extending its staking support beyond Ethereum (ETH). Institutional clients can now access staking services for a wider array of popular Proof-of-Stake (PoS) tokens. This includes high-demand assets such as Solana (SOL), Sui (SUI), and Avalanche (AVAX). This expansion means that institutions using Coinbase Prime can leverage Figment’s robust infrastructure directly through their existing custody accounts. The integration simplifies the complex process of staking, allowing clients to earn rewards on their digital assets with greater ease and security. This strategic move addresses the growing demand from sophisticated investors for more diverse yield-generating opportunities within the crypto market. Why Institutional Investors Are Turning to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) has emerged as a preferred consensus mechanism for many modern blockchain networks. Unlike Proof-of-Work (PoW), which relies on energy-intensive mining, PoS allows network participants to “stake” their cryptocurrency holdings. By doing so, they help validate transactions and secure the network, earning rewards in return. The appeal of PoS for institutional investors is clear: it offers a mechanism for passive income generation on digital assets. This approach provides a predictable yield, which can be particularly attractive in volatile markets. Moreover, PoS is often viewed as a more environmentally friendly alternative, aligning with broader ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investment considerations. The Synergy Behind Secure Coinbase Prime Staking The partnership between Coinbase Prime and Figment is built on a strong foundation of trust and proven performance. Together, these two industry leaders already manage a substantial portfolio, exceeding $2 billion in staked assets. Their collaborative expertise was recently highlighted by their work on the launch of Grayscale’s ETH staking ETF, demonstrating their capability in handling large-scale institutional products. Figment brings its specialized, institutional-grade staking infrastructure to the table, ensuring reliable and efficient operations. Coinbase Prime, in turn, provides the secure custody solutions and the integrated platform that institutional clients demand. This powerful synergy ensures that clients engaging in Coinbase Prime staking benefit from both cutting-edge technology and robust security measures. What Does This Expansion Mean for Your Portfolio? For institutional clients, this expanded partnership presents several compelling advantages. It significantly broadens the scope for portfolio diversification, allowing investors to allocate capital across a wider range of high-growth PoS assets. This diversification can help mitigate risks and optimize returns within a digital asset portfolio. Key benefits include: Enhanced Yield Generation: Directly earn staking rewards on a greater variety of digital assets. Institutional-Grade Security: Leverage Coinbase Prime’s industry-leading security framework for asset custody and management. Simplified Management: Streamlined access to staking services through an integrated platform, reducing operational complexities. Market Participation: Actively participate in the security and governance of leading blockchain networks. While the benefits are substantial, clients should always consider factors like network-specific lock-up periods and the inherent (though mitigated by reputable providers) risks associated with staking, such as slashing penalties. A Glimpse into the Future of Institutional Crypto Adoption This expansion by Coinbase Prime and Figment is more than just a new service offering; it signals a maturing institutional crypto market. As regulated platforms continue to enhance their offerings, the barrier to entry for traditional financial institutions decreases. This move is indicative of a broader trend where digital assets are increasingly being viewed as legitimate, yield-bearing components of sophisticated investment strategies. The ability to securely and efficiently stake a diverse range of PoS tokens through a trusted provider like Coinbase Prime paves the way for greater capital allocation into the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It underscores the growing confidence in blockchain technology and its potential to revolutionize traditional finance. The expansion of Coinbase Prime staking services through its partnership with Figment represents a significant milestone for institutional investors. By offering secure, diversified, and accessible staking opportunities for leading Proof-of-Stake tokens like Solana, Sui, and Avalanche, Coinbase Prime is solidifying its position as a premier gateway for institutional engagement in the digital asset space. This strategic move not only enhances yield potential for clients but also accelerates the broader institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, pointing towards a future where digital asset staking is a standard component of institutional portfolios.

The company, backed by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, uses a novel Satoshis per Share (SPS) metric to show investors exactly how much $BTC backs each share. Among the best altcoins to watch in this rotation are Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a Bitcoin Layer-2; PepeNode ($PEPENODE), a mine-to-earn meme project; and World Liberty Financial ($WLFI), the Trump-themed DeFi ecosystem. The Trump family has made another bold move in the corporate crypto world as the publicly listed treasury and mining firm American Bitcoin (ABTC) announced a 1,414 Bitcoin addition to its holdings. That’s roughly $163M at current prices and brings $ABTC’s total stash to about 3,865 BTC – approximately $446M. Backed by Donald Trump Jr and Eric Trump, American Bitcoin is the public-facing vehicle formed after a merger between Canadian miner Hut 8 Corp and Gryphon Digital Mining. In a media release , American Bitcoin emphasized that its business model goes beyond simply buying $BTC; it also mines the cryptocurrency directly, which the company says gives it a cost advantage over peers that purely purchase from the market. To drive the point home, ABTC relies on a metric called ‘Satoshis per share,’ or SPS. With 100M Satoshis per Bitcoin, ‘sats’ are the smallest unit of value in $BTC . By dividing the number of shares by the total number of sats in the Bitcoin it holds, ABTC can tell shareholders exactly how much $BTC their holdings represent. Following the announcement, ABTC’s stock rose by more than 11% in a single session , as the news resonated with investors hungry for exposure to public company-level crypto strategies. Bitcoin is up by around 4.7% in the past week, and sits just under $115K, near a two-week high. ABTC forms part of the growing push for crypto treasuries, and signals confidence in Bitcoin’s near-term trajectory. That trajectory bodes well for key altcoins as well. Even as ABTC amasses Bitcoin, tokens like $HYPER , $PEPENODE , and $WLFI are emerging as the best altcoins to buy right now . 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Next-Generation Bitcoin Layer-2 for Fast, Cheap $BTC Transactions Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) plans to introduce a next-gen Layer-2 ecosystem that will address Bitcoin’s biggest pain points – slow speeds, high costs, and smart-contract compatibility. And the project will do this by merging Bitcoin’s monetary dominance with Solana’s high-performance virtual machine (SVM) environment. The Hyper Layer-2 will use a Canonical Bridge architecture on the SVM that allows native $BTC to be minted, wrapped, and deployed across a fast, low-fee ecosystem. And with zero-knowledge proofs and final settlement on the original Bitcoin Layer-1, it will all be executed without compromising Bitcoin’s top-tier security model. Bitcoin Hyper enables real-time payments, DeFi participation, and on-chain micro-transactions that unlock Bitcoin’s liquidity for practical utility. The project’s hybrid framework positions it as a natural upgrade to Bitcoin, capable of scaling transaction speeds from Bitcoin’s current seven transactions per second to multiple thousands, courtesy of the SVM. Meanwhile, its native token, $HYPER, will power validator staking, bridge operations, and ecosystem governance. Discover more about this exciting Layer-2 project in our detailed Bitcoin Hyper review . The combination of new utility and proven reliability bode well for $HYPER’s performance, which is why it’s no surprise that the Bitcoin Hyper surpassed the $25M milestone yesterday. It’s also part of the reason our $HYPER price prediction shows that the token could potentially increase from its current price of $0.013185 to $0.08625 by the end of 2026 – for 554% gains. To get in now, check out our step-by-step guide to buying $HYPER . Being a presale, though, its price rises in stages, while the staking APY decreases as more holders stake their tokens. With little over one day left before the next price increase – and staking APY currently at 47% – there’s no time like the present to join the presale at its early-bird price. Ready to jump in? Visit the official Bitcoin Hyper presale website right away. 2. PepeNode ($PEPENODE) – ‘Mine-to-Earn’ for Bigger Gains and Meme Coin Rewards PepeNode ($PEPENODE) deploys an innovative ‘mine-to-earn’ infrastructure play that transforms how meme coin culture and the blockchain intersect. With a virtual server-room model, you’ll be able to use your $PEPENODE tokens to buy mining rigs and nodes to outfit your server rooms. And the more nodes you have, the more $PEPENODE you’ll mine. Rewards are also up for grabs courtesy of this gamified project – and they’re not limited to $PEPENODE. Rewards include other popular meme coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN. This novel platform brings together the fun of blockchain gaming and the raw potential of meme coins. For PepeNode investors, mine-to-earn opens the door for several ways to earn from the project: $PEPENODE token price increases: Our PepeNode price prediction shows the token could potentially go from $0.0011227 to $0.0077 by the end of 2026, a 585% increase. Staking and $PEPENODE rewards: The dynamic staking APY currently stands at 653%, while mine-to-earn rewards will be available after the project launches post-TGE. Other meme coin rewards: Earning $FARTCOIN and $PEPE adds another way to benefit from the project. Discover how to buy PepeNode in our easy-to-follow guide. The PepeNode presale has already raised $1.9M+, despite the presale only recently being launched. We expect that figure to ramp up considerably, placing $PEPENODE among the next altcoins to potentially explode. Fancy being a virtual crypto miner? Head to the official $PEPENODE presale today . 3. World Liberty Financial ($WLFI) – Centerpiece of Donald Trump’s Crypto Empire World Liberty Financial ($WLFI) – like all Trump projects – is as politically charged as it is business-motivated. Launched in parallel with Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies, World Liberty Financial includes the $WLFI token as well as stablecoins like $USD1. $WLFI blends meme-coin energy with a treasury-backed investment protocol tied to the Trump movement’s populist narrative. Its mission is to empower holders through decentralized finance, tokenized assets, and a particular brand identity. $WLFI recently gained viral traction after a White House-themed tweet referenced GameStop and crypto freedom and sent trading volume surging past $220M in a single day. Currently trading at $0.1465, $WLFI is up by more than 14% in the past week, reflecting an appeal that lies partly in its growing ecosystem and partly in political mood affiliation. Buy your $WLFI today through MEXC and other leading platforms. To recap: American Bitcoin’s $163M bet on Bitcoin highlights just how much institutional corporate interest there is in the crypto space. Projects like $WLFI show how that interest bridges from corporate projects to leading altcoins, and $HYPER and $PEPENODE stand to benefit. Always do your own research; this isn’t financial advice.

The company said on Tuesday that more than 100 institutions, including Visa, HSBC, BlackRock, and AI firm Anthropic, are already participating in the testing phase. The testnet will allow developers, financial institutions, and enterprises to deploy, test, and build applications on Arc, which Circle calls an “Economic OS” for the internet. Unveiled in August as an open Layer 1 network, Arc is designed to support developers and companies seeking to bring real-world financial activity on-chain. Circle said the blockchain’s purpose is to facilitate scalable, globally distributed economic activity across borders. The firm described Arc as a system capable of connecting every local market to the global digital economy. Star-Studded Lineup According to the official press release, the early ecosystem already includes organizations from across major regions such as the Americas, Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Participants in the testnet collectively manage trillions of dollars in assets and facilitate billions of transactions daily. Circle aims to position Arc as a foundation for stablecoin issuers and tokenized assets such as equities, credit, and money market funds. The firm also plans to use stablecoins as gas tokens on Arc and build native infrastructure for stablecoin swaps and foreign exchange liquidity. Stablecoin issuers from several regions are already joining the testnet, including Forte Securities (AUDF in Australia), Avenia (BRLA in Brazil), JPYC Inc. (JPYC in Japan), BDACS (KRW1 in Korea), Juno (MXNB in Mexico), Coins.PH (PHPC in the Philippines), and Stablecorp (QCAD in Canada). Circle added that it is in discussions with additional issuers of dollar-, euro-, and other fiat-backed stablecoins to expand Arc’s network. The testnet is also drawing interest from developer platforms and blockchain infrastructure providers. Participants include Alchemy, Chainlink, LayerZero, and thirdweb, alongside cross-chain protocols such as Across, Stargate, and Wormhole. Wallet and infrastructure partners include MetaMask, Fireblocks, Ledger, QuickNode, and Blockdaemon, who are helping make Arc accessible to both institutional and retail users. Major market participants in decentralized finance are also testing Arc’s capabilities. Protocols such as Uniswap Labs, Aave, Curve, and Euler Finance are integrating liquidity and lending tools, while centralized exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Robinhood, are exploring connectivity. The company said market makers such as GSR, Wintermute, Galaxy Digital, and Cumberland are also contributing liquidity support. Beyond digital asset trading, Circle is engaging with global payments and fintech firms to expand Arc’s real-world use cases. Companies like Mastercard, Visa, WorldPay, Brex, Nuvei, and Amazon Web Services are part of the testnet phase. Capital market firms, including Apollo, BNY Mellon, the New York Stock Exchange, and State Street, are also involved. Banks and asset managers participating include Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Standard Chartered, Invesco, and BlackRock. Distributed Governance While Circle is overseeing the initial phase, the company plans for Arc to eventually be operated by a global set of participants, including financial institutions, technology firms, and developers. The roadmap includes expanding validator participation, building transparent governance frameworks, and enabling community input. The long-term goal is for Arc to function as an open, neutral, and collectively managed layer of economic infrastructure for the internet. The latest follows its public listing in June 2025, when the company raised $1.1 billion and achieved a $6.9 billion valuation.

A truly significant Bitcoin price surge has pushed BTC past a remarkable milestone, climbing above the $115,000 mark. This impressive move has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, signaling a robust momentum in the digital asset landscape. According to diligent market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC has indeed risen above $115,000. Specifically, Bitcoin is currently trading at $115,074.35 on the Binance USDT market. This achievement is not just a number; it reflects a powerful shift and renewed confidence in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What’s Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Surge? Many factors contribute to such an impressive climb. Understanding these drivers helps us grasp the current market dynamics. Several key elements are likely playing a role in this sustained upward trajectory. Increased Institutional Adoption: More large financial institutions are entering the crypto space, viewing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset. Their investments inject significant capital and credibility into the market. Positive Macroeconomic Indicators: Favorable economic conditions or a flight to alternative assets during uncertainty can push investors towards Bitcoin. Halving Event Anticipation: While not immediate, the long-term effects and anticipation of Bitcoin’s halving events often contribute to bullish sentiment, as they reduce the supply of new Bitcoin. Growing Retail Investor Interest: As Bitcoin gains mainstream attention, more individual investors are entering the market, contributing to buying pressure. This confluence of factors creates a powerful environment for a continued Bitcoin price surge , drawing both seasoned and new participants into the ecosystem. Understanding the Significance of BTC Reaching $115,000 Crossing the $115,000 threshold is more than just a numerical achievement; it carries substantial psychological and market significance. Each new peak reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a dominant force in finance. Historically, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience and growth, overcoming numerous challenges. This latest surge above $115,000 demonstrates strong market conviction. It suggests that investors are not merely speculating but are confident in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. For many, this milestone validates their belief in cryptocurrency as a viable investment. It can also trigger a ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) among those who have yet to invest, potentially leading to further upward movement. Navigating the Market: Opportunities and Challenges in a Bitcoin Price Surge While a Bitcoin price surge brings exciting opportunities, it also comes with inherent challenges. Savvy investors always consider both sides of the coin. Opportunities: Capital Appreciation: Investors who hold Bitcoin can see substantial gains as its value increases. Increased Liquidity: Higher prices often mean more trading activity, making it easier to buy and sell Bitcoin. Mainstream Recognition: Each price milestone brings more media attention, further legitimizing Bitcoin in the global financial landscape. Challenges: Volatility: While prices are up, cryptocurrencies are known for rapid fluctuations. A sharp correction can occur at any time. Regulatory Scrutiny: As Bitcoin grows, governments and regulators may increase their oversight, which could impact its future. Profit-Taking: Some investors may choose to sell their holdings after significant gains, potentially leading to temporary price dips. It is crucial for investors to conduct thorough research and manage their risks effectively, especially during periods of rapid growth. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. What Comes Next for the Bitcoin Price Surge? Predicting the exact future of Bitcoin’s price is challenging, but we can analyze potential scenarios. The current momentum suggests a strong underlying demand. Will this Bitcoin price surge continue, or will we see a period of consolidation? Many analysts believe that Bitcoin’s journey towards wider adoption and higher valuations is far from over. However, market cycles often involve periods of consolidation or even corrections after significant rallies. This allows the market to stabilize before potentially moving higher. Long-term indicators remain positive, with increasing utility, technological advancements, and a growing global community supporting Bitcoin. Keeping an eye on global economic trends and regulatory developments will be key to understanding its future trajectory. The recent climb above $115,000 marks a significant moment for Bitcoin, reinforcing its status as a premier digital asset. This impressive Bitcoin price surge reflects growing confidence, institutional interest, and a robust market. While opportunities abound, prudent investors will remain aware of the inherent volatility and always prioritize informed decision-making. The journey of Bitcoin continues to be one of the most exciting narratives in modern finance, promising further developments and milestones ahead. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean for BTC to rise above $115,000? A1: This signifies a major bullish sentiment in the market, indicating strong buying pressure and investor confidence in Bitcoin’s value. It often reflects a combination of increased demand, positive market news, and broader economic factors. For many, it’s a validation of Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Q2: Where can I monitor Bitcoin’s current trading price? A2: You can monitor Bitcoin’s current trading price on various cryptocurrency exchanges and market data platforms. As mentioned, Binance is a popular platform where BTC is actively traded against USDT (Tether). Other reliable sources include CoinMarketCap , CoinGecko , and Kraken . Q3: Is a Bitcoin price surge sustainable in the long term? A3: While short-term price movements can be volatile, many analysts believe in Bitcoin’s long-term sustainability due to its fixed supply, growing adoption, and fundamental technology. However, market corrections are natural, and sustained growth depends on continuous innovation, regulatory clarity, and broader economic stability. Q4: What are the risks associated with investing during a Bitcoin price surge? A4: Key risks include high volatility, which can lead to rapid price drops. There’s also the risk of regulatory changes, potential security breaches on exchanges, and the possibility of market manipulation. It is crucial to conduct thorough due diligence and consider your risk tolerance before investing. Q5: How does institutional adoption impact the Bitcoin price surge? A5: Institutional adoption brings significant capital and legitimacy to the crypto market. When major financial players, like investment funds or corporations, allocate portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, it increases demand and reduces available supply, which can drive up prices and contribute to a sustained Bitcoin price surge .

The decision to add prediction markets arrives after leaders like Polymarket and Kalshi established their influence and gained acceptance as a form of trading, rather than gambling. The favorable regulation of prediction markets is part of the Trump administration’s positive attitude toward crypto usage and trading. Truth Predict to launch in the USA, followed by global expansion Truth Social will use Crypto.com Derivatives North America as a clearinghouse, tapping a CFTC-registered platform. The initial testing of Truth Predict, as the new market will be called, is expected to start soon. After testing is completed, the platform will launch for the US market, followed by global expansion. The partnership between Truth Social and Truth Predict will rival the widespread influence of Polymarket on X. Trump Media Group already partnered with Crypto.com in August, after the announcement of an eventual $6.4B CRO treasury . Truth Social to carry prediction market pairs for current events Truth Social users will be able to access prediction contracts linked to current events such as elections, interest rate decisions, inflation, asset prices, or major sports leagues. The platform will repeat the successful model of Polymarket and Kalshi, with live price feeds to allow users to react and trade instantly. “ We are thrilled to become the world’s first publicly traded social media platform to offer our users access to prediction markets,” said Devin Nunes, Chairman and CEO of Trump Media. “ For too long, global elites have closely controlled these markets – with Truth Predict, we’re democratizing information and empowering everyday Americans to harness the wisdom of the crowd, turning free speech into actionable foresight,” he said. Current events have become one of the growing markets, following the success that started with the US Presidential elections in 2024. Now, many platforms offer short-term or longer-term positions on news and outcomes, including statements, rapid resolution events, or general news. The Truth Predict platform is set to compete in the US market with the established entity that is Polymarket. For now, Polymarket is internationally accessible, though still not available for US-based traders. The new prediction platform will launch at a time when the first mover, Polymarket, is attempting an IPO with the potential for a $15B valuation. Its competitor, Kalshi, is looking at a $10B valuation. Polymarket remains the leader in prediction pairs, expanding its position after a recent peak for its main competitor, Kalshi. | Source: Dune Analytics Other smaller platforms have emerged, though currently, Polymarket remains in the lead with 51.1% of the prediction market.

The question on many investors’ minds is clear: will Binance Coin price prediction see BNB hit the ambitious $1000 mark in the coming years? This comprehensive article delves deep into the factors influencing BNB’s value, offering insights and projections for 2025, 2026, and up to 2030. Get ready to explore the exciting possibilities and potential challenges that lie ahead for one of the crypto market’s most prominent tokens. Understanding Binance Coin (BNB): More Than Just a Token Binance Coin (BNB) is not just another cryptocurrency; it’s the native token of the Binance ecosystem, one of the world’s largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges. Launched in 2017 as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, BNB later migrated to its own blockchain, the Binance Chain, and subsequently became the fuel for the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), now known as BNB Smart Chain. Its utility extends far beyond simple trading. Fee Discounts: BNB offers users discounted trading fees on the Binance exchange, making it attractive for active traders. Transaction Fees: It’s used to pay gas fees on the BNB Smart Chain, powering thousands of decentralized applications (dApps). Participation in Sales: BNB is often required for participation in token sales on Binance Launchpad. Payments & Travel: A growing number of merchants and travel platforms accept BNB as a payment method. Staking & Governance: Users can stake BNB to secure the network and participate in governance decisions. This diverse utility is a core driver behind the demand for BNB, directly impacting its value and influencing any accurate BNB price prediction . The Journey So Far: BNB’s Historical Performance From its initial coin offering (ICO) price of around $0.10, BNB has experienced a meteoric rise, punctuated by significant market corrections. It truly gained traction with the growth of the Binance exchange and the launch of BSC, which offered a faster and cheaper alternative to Ethereum for DeFi projects. BNB reached its all-time high of over $690 in May 2021, showcasing its immense potential. While it has since pulled back from those peaks, its resilience and ability to recover after market downturns speak volumes about its fundamental strength and investor confidence. What Drives the Price? Factors Influencing Binance Coin Price Prediction Predicting the future price of any cryptocurrency, especially one as dynamic as BNB, involves analyzing a multitude of factors. These range from ecosystem developments to broader market trends and regulatory shifts. Let’s break down the key elements. Binance Ecosystem Growth: The Core of BNB’s Value The health and expansion of the Binance ecosystem are paramount to the Binance Coin future . As Binance continues to innovate and expand its offerings, the utility and demand for BNB naturally increase. Binance Exchange Dominance: Binance remains the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, constantly attracting new users and maintaining high liquidity. New product launches, like Binance Pay, further integrate BNB into daily transactions. BNB Smart Chain (BSC) Adoption: BSC has become a formidable competitor in the Layer-1 blockchain space, hosting a vast array of DeFi protocols, NFTs, and GameFi projects. The more dApps and users on BSC, the greater the demand for BNB to cover transaction fees. Binance Launchpad & Launchpool: These platforms, which require BNB for participation, continue to be popular avenues for new project fundraising, creating consistent demand for BNB. The continuous innovation and expansion within this ecosystem are critical indicators for positive long-term price movements. Regulatory Landscape: A Critical Factor in Cryptocurrency Price Analysis Cryptocurrency markets operate within an evolving global regulatory framework, and Binance, given its scale, is often at the forefront of these discussions. Regulatory scrutiny can significantly impact investor sentiment and, consequently, BNB’s price. Global Compliance Efforts: Binance has faced regulatory challenges in various jurisdictions, leading to changes in its operational structure and increased focus on compliance. Successful navigation of these hurdles can build trust and stability. Impact of SEC Actions: Actions by regulatory bodies like the SEC in the United States, particularly regarding whether certain cryptocurrencies are deemed securities, can have far-reaching effects. Clarity or positive outcomes in such situations would be highly beneficial for BNB. A more defined and favorable regulatory environment globally would undoubtedly provide a significant boost to BNB’s valuation and contribute positively to any long-term cryptocurrency price analysis . Market Sentiment and Broader Cryptocurrency Price Prediction Trends No crypto asset exists in a vacuum. The overall sentiment of the broader cryptocurrency market, heavily influenced by Bitcoin’s performance, plays a crucial role in BNB’s trajectory. Bitcoin’s Influence: Bitcoin (BTC) often acts as the market leader. A strong bull run for Bitcoin typically pulls altcoins, including BNB, upwards. Conversely, a Bitcoin downturn can lead to broader market corrections. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rate decisions by central banks, and geopolitical events can all sway investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Institutional Adoption: Increased interest and investment from institutional players can inject significant capital into the market, driving prices higher across the board, including for BNB. Monitoring these broader trends is essential when formulating any realistic BNB price prediction . Technological Developments and Network Upgrades for Binance Coin Future The technical evolution of the BNB Smart Chain and the token itself is another vital factor. Continuous improvements enhance utility, security, and scalability. Token Burn Mechanism: Binance regularly conducts BNB token burns, permanently removing tokens from circulation. This deflationary mechanism reduces supply, which, assuming constant or increasing demand, can lead to price appreciation. BSC Upgrades: Ongoing upgrades to the BNB Smart Chain improve its performance, security, and interoperability, making it more attractive for developers and users. This sustained development is key for the long-term viability of the Binance Coin future . Binance Coin Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will BNB Hit $1000? Now for the big question: can BNB truly reach $1000? Let’s explore potential scenarios for the coming years, keeping in mind that these are projections based on current trends and historical data, not financial advice. BNB Price Prediction 2025 By 2025, we anticipate continued maturation of the crypto market. If regulatory clarity improves and the broader market enters a sustained bull phase, BNB could see significant gains. The ongoing growth of the BNB Smart Chain and Binance’s ecosystem would provide strong fundamental support. Optimistic Scenario: With strong market momentum and successful ecosystem expansion, BNB could comfortably break past its previous all-time high, potentially reaching between $750 – $900 . Conservative Scenario: In a more moderate market, BNB might trade in the range of $500 – $650 , still representing solid growth from current levels. BNB Price Prediction 2026 Moving into 2026, the market might experience a cooling-off period after a potential 2025 bull run, or it could continue its upward trajectory if adoption accelerates. The effectiveness of Binance’s regulatory compliance strategies will be critical. Optimistic Scenario: If the ecosystem continues to flourish and token burns effectively reduce supply, BNB could challenge the $1000 mark, potentially trading between $950 – $1200 . Conservative Scenario: A more tempered market might see BNB consolidate around $600 – $800 , establishing a new, higher support level. BNB Price Prediction 2027 2027 could be a year of consolidation or further growth depending on the overall market cycle. Innovation on the BNB Smart Chain will be key to maintaining relevance against competitors like Ethereum and Solana . Optimistic Scenario: Sustained utility and market strength could push BNB towards $1100 – $1500 , firmly establishing it above the $1000 threshold. Conservative Scenario: A prolonged bear market or significant regulatory headwinds could see BNB in the $700 – $950 range. BNB Price Prediction 2028 By 2028, we might be approaching another halving cycle for Bitcoin, which historically ignites new bull markets. This could be a pivotal year for BNB. Optimistic Scenario: Riding a new market bull wave, coupled with enhanced utility and reduced supply from burns, BNB could potentially surge to $1400 – $2000 . Conservative Scenario: Without a strong market catalyst, BNB might trade between $900 – $1200 . BNB Price Prediction 2029 Assuming a bull market peak in 2028 or 2029, BNB could reach unprecedented levels if its ecosystem continues to expand globally and regulatory challenges are effectively managed. Optimistic Scenario: BNB could see prices ranging from $1800 – $2500+ , demonstrating robust long-term growth. Conservative Scenario: A post-bull market correction could bring BNB back to the $1000 – $1500 range. BNB Price Prediction 2030 Looking out to 2030, the cryptocurrency landscape will likely be far more integrated into mainstream finance. For BNB to thrive, it must maintain its competitive edge, innovate consistently, and successfully navigate future technological and regulatory shifts. Optimistic Scenario: With mass adoption, continued utility, and a strong market, BNB could potentially stabilize at a higher baseline, possibly ranging from $2000 – $3000+ . Conservative Scenario: Even in a more challenging environment, sustained utility and Binance’s market position could keep BNB above $1200 – $1800 . Will BNB Hit $1000? A Closer Look The consensus from our Binance Coin price prediction suggests that hitting $1000 is not just possible but highly probable within the 2025-2027 timeframe under favorable market conditions. For BNB to reach and sustain $1000, several key factors need to align: Sustained Binance Ecosystem Growth: The continuous expansion of Binance’s services and the BNB Smart Chain’s dApp ecosystem is paramount. Positive Regulatory Environment: Clear and supportive global regulations would significantly de-risk the asset. Overall Crypto Market Bull Run: A strong, sustained bull market, often led by Bitcoin, would provide the necessary tailwinds. Effective Token Burns: Continued reduction in supply through BNB burns will enhance its scarcity and value. Year Minimum Price ($) Maximum Price ($) Average Price ($) 2025 500 900 700 2026 600 1200 900 2027 700 1500 1100 2028 900 2000 1450 2029 1000 2500 1750 2030 1200 3000 2100 Potential Challenges and Risks for BNB While the outlook for BNB appears promising, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent risks in the volatile crypto market. Regulatory Headwinds: Ongoing regulatory uncertainty and potential enforcement actions against Binance could negatively impact BNB’s price and utility. Competition: The Layer-1 blockchain space is highly competitive, with strong contenders like Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche constantly innovating. BNB Smart Chain must continue to evolve to maintain its market share. Centralization Concerns: Critics often point to the perceived centralization of Binance and BSC as a potential vulnerability, which could deter some decentralized finance enthusiasts. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price swings. Macroeconomic factors, black swan events, or sudden shifts in investor sentiment can lead to rapid price declines. Opportunities and Upside Potential Despite the challenges, BNB has significant opportunities for growth. Global Expansion: Binance’s continued efforts to expand into new markets and secure operating licenses worldwide will increase its user base and, by extension, BNB’s utility. Ecosystem Innovation: Further development of the BNB Smart Chain, including scaling solutions, interoperability features, and new dApp categories, will drive demand. Institutional Adoption: As more traditional financial institutions enter the crypto space, assets with strong fundamentals and utility like BNB could see increased institutional investment. Deflationary Mechanism: The consistent token burn schedule is a powerful deflationary force that, over time, can significantly reduce supply and increase scarcity. Actionable Insights for Potential Investors If you’re considering investing in BNB or are already a holder, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research beyond price predictions. Understand the technology, team, and market dynamics. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of market volatility. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of news related to Binance, regulatory developments, and the broader crypto market. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrencies are high-risk, high-reward assets. Diversify your portfolio. Utilize BNB’s Utility: If you’re an active trader on Binance, using BNB for fees can provide tangible benefits, regardless of its price movements. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Binance Coin (BNB)? Binance Coin (BNB) is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem, used for various utilities including paying transaction fees on the Binance exchange and the BNB Smart Chain, participating in token sales, and staking. What is the utility of BNB? BNB’s utility includes discounted trading fees on Binance, gas fees on the BNB Smart Chain, participation in Binance Launchpad projects, payment for goods and services, and staking for network security and governance. Will BNB reach $1000? Based on current trends, ecosystem growth, and market analysis, it is highly probable that BNB could reach or even surpass $1000 within the 2025-2027 timeframe, especially under favorable market conditions and continued innovation. Is BNB a good investment? BNB has shown strong historical performance and possesses robust utility within the largest crypto ecosystem. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant risk. Whether it’s a ‘good’ investment depends on your individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and market conditions. Always conduct your own research. Who founded Binance? Binance was founded by Changpeng Zhao (CZ) , who served as its CEO until November 2023. He remains a significant figure in the crypto industry. How does the BNB token burn work? Binance regularly conducts BNB token burns, which permanently remove BNB from circulation. These burns are based on the trading volume on the Binance exchange and are designed to reduce the total supply of BNB, making it a deflationary asset. Conclusion: The Road Ahead for Binance Coin The journey of Binance Coin has been remarkable, evolving from a simple exchange token to a foundational asset for a vast blockchain ecosystem. Our Binance Coin price prediction suggests a strong potential for BNB to reach and even exceed the $1000 mark by 2026-2027, driven by its expanding utility, Binance’s market dominance, and strategic token burns. While the path will undoubtedly be filled with volatility and regulatory challenges, BNB’s fundamental strengths position it as a formidable player in the crypto space. As with any investment, prudence and thorough research are key. The future of BNB, like the broader crypto market, is a tapestry woven with innovation, adoption, and evolving global dynamics. For those willing to navigate its complexities, BNB presents a compelling opportunity.

For anyone watching the dynamic cryptocurrency space, this positive US stock market performance often sparks an immediate question: What does this mean for digital assets? The interconnectedness between traditional finance and the crypto market is growing, making these movements crucial for investors to understand. What’s Fueling This US Stock Market Performance? Today’s opening saw significant gains across the board. The S&P 500 climbed 0.32%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged an impressive 1.86%. Not to be left out, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 0.63%. These figures reflect a broader positive sentiment, likely influenced by a combination of factors such as: Optimistic Economic Data: Recent reports often point towards resilient economic growth. Strong Corporate Earnings: Many companies are exceeding profit expectations, boosting investor confidence. Shifting Interest Rate Expectations: Hopes for stable or even decreasing interest rates from central banks like the Federal Reserve can make riskier assets more appealing. Understanding these drivers behind the positive US stock market performance helps us anticipate potential ripple effects. How Does Traditional Market Strength Influence Crypto? Historically, the cryptocurrency market, especially assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum , often showed inverse correlation or moved independently of traditional markets. However, with increasing institutional adoption and broader investor participation, this dynamic has shifted. Cryptocurrencies are now frequently viewed as risk-on assets, meaning they tend to perform well when overall market sentiment is positive and investors are willing to take on more risk. When the US stock market performance is strong, it often signals a “risk-on” environment. Investors feel more confident about the economy and are more likely to allocate capital to assets perceived as having higher growth potential, including digital currencies. Conversely, during periods of traditional market downturns, investors typically flock to safer assets, pulling funds from more volatile sectors like crypto. This evolving relationship means that observing the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 is no longer just for traditional investors. It provides valuable context for anyone active in the crypto space. Decoding US Stock Market Performance for Crypto Investors What specific takeaways should crypto enthusiasts consider from a robust opening in the US stock market? A rising tide often lifts all boats, and this principle can apply to digital assets. When major indexes like the Nasdaq Composite show significant gains, it can particularly benefit tech-focused cryptocurrencies or those with strong development ecosystems. For Bitcoin , often seen as a bellwether for the broader crypto market, a positive sentiment in traditional equities can reinforce its position as a legitimate asset class. Ethereum and other altcoins may also see increased interest as capital flows from traditional markets seek higher returns in the digital asset space. However, it is crucial to remember that crypto markets still retain their unique volatility drivers, including regulatory news, technological advancements, and specific project developments. Investors should not solely rely on the US stock market performance but use it as one of several indicators to gauge overall market appetite for risk. This holistic approach helps in making informed decisions. Navigating the Interconnected Landscape The ongoing integration of cryptocurrencies into the broader financial landscape means that traditional market signals are becoming increasingly important. While crypto assets still offer distinct characteristics and growth narratives, their short-term price movements can often be influenced by macro-economic trends and investor sentiment originating from markets like the US stock exchange. For savvy investors, this means: Monitoring Key Economic Indicators: Keep an eye on inflation data, employment figures, and central bank announcements. Diversification: A well-diversified portfolio can mitigate risks associated with sudden shifts in market sentiment. Staying Informed: Continuously educate yourself on both traditional and crypto market dynamics to adapt quickly. The positive US stock market performance today serves as a reminder of the complex web connecting different asset classes. Understanding these connections is key to navigating the future of finance. Conclusion: Today’s strong opening for major US stock indexes underscores a prevailing optimistic sentiment in traditional financial markets. This positive momentum often creates a favorable backdrop for cryptocurrencies, as investors become more willing to embrace risk. While crypto markets maintain their unique characteristics, their increasing correlation with traditional equities means that observing indicators like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones is becoming an indispensable part of a comprehensive investment strategy. As the lines between traditional and digital finance continue to blur, a nuanced understanding of their interplay will empower investors to make more strategic and informed decisions in the evolving landscape. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How does the US stock market performance affect Bitcoin? A1: Bitcoin often acts as a “risk-on” asset. When the US stock market performs strongly, indicating positive investor sentiment and economic confidence, investors are more likely to allocate capital to assets like Bitcoin , leading to potential price increases. Conversely, market downturns can lead to withdrawals from riskier assets. Q2: What is “risk-on” sentiment in markets? A2: “Risk-on” sentiment describes a market environment where investors are optimistic about economic growth and are willing to invest in assets perceived as higher risk but offering potentially higher returns. This contrasts with “risk-off” sentiment, where investors prefer safer, less volatile assets. Q3: Are crypto and traditional stocks always correlated? A3: No, the correlation isn’t constant. While there has been an increasing correlation, especially since 2020, crypto markets can still decouple due to unique factors like regulatory news, technological breakthroughs, or specific project developments. However, major macro trends often influence both. Q4: Which US stock indexes are most relevant for crypto investors to watch? A4: Crypto investors should particularly watch the Nasdaq Composite , which is heavily weighted towards technology stocks, as it often shows a stronger correlation with tech-driven crypto assets. The S&P 500 is also crucial as a broad market indicator, reflecting overall economic health and investor sentiment. Q5: What should crypto investors watch for in US stock market performance ? A5: Investors should monitor sustained trends rather than daily fluctuations. Look for consistent upward or downward movements, significant shifts in economic data (like inflation or employment), and central bank policy announcements from entities like the Federal Reserve . These broader signals often precede shifts in crypto market sentiment. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Speaking to Bloomberg on Monday, the Republican member of the Senate Banking Committee said lawmakers must act “by the first part of January, February” to advance the crypto market structure bill before election politics take over. “I’m not optimistic about us moving much further on anything around digital assets, stablecoins, or crypto in this Congress,” Tillis said, noting that the 2026 midterm elections would likely stall progress. His comments come as Washington remains paralyzed by a government shutdown that began on October 1 , triggered by disputes over healthcare funding and subsidy cuts. The U.S. government shutdown will drag on until at least November 16, Polymarket bettors predict in a new poll. #Polymarket #GovernmentShutdown https://t.co/MvTd3lJQSB — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 21, 2025 Senate, House Divide Stalls U.S. Crypto Framework as Shutdown Drags On While the Senate continues to meet, House Speaker Mike Johnson has delayed most floor business, leaving several crypto-related bills, including the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, or CLARITY Act , in limbo. The CLARITY Act, passed by the House of Representatives in July with strong bipartisan support in a 294–137 vote, seeks to define which digital assets fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and which are overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It aims to bring long-needed clarity to how digital assets are classified, creating a clear distinction between decentralized “digital commodities” and more centralized “restricted digital assets.” The bill has been a key focus of congressional discussions this year, following the earlier passage of the GENIUS Act , a stablecoin bill signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. Together, the two measures represent the most comprehensive push yet to create a federal framework for the crypto industry. However, progress in the Senate has slowed sharply since early October, after a Democratic proposal outlining rules for decentralized finance (DeFi) was leaked to the press, drawing backlash from industry leaders. Senate Democrats propose a Treasury restricted list for DeFi with KYC on frontends, halting GOP talks as industry warns proposal pushes innovation offshore. #Defi #Democrats #USSenate https://t.co/s56jqsDts1 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 10, 2025 Talks between Republicans and crypto-friendly Democrats have since stalled, with both sides preoccupied by the ongoing government shutdown. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a leading Republican on the Banking Committee, previously said she expected the Senate’s version of the bill , the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, to become law by 2026. But Tillis’s remarks show a growing sense of urgency among lawmakers who fear the legislative window is closing fast. Senate Democrats and Republicans are expected to meet separately with crypto executives this week to revive discussions. Meanwhile, other crypto-related bills, such as the Anti-Central Bank Digital Currency Surveillance State Ac t, which would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a retail CBDC, are also awaiting Senate consideration. Representative Ro Khanna has proposed new legislation to ban lawmakers from owning or launching cryptocurrencies following President Trump’s controversial pardon of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, adding further complexity to Congress’s crypto agenda. @RepRoKhanna plans to introduce a bill banning lawmakers from owning or creating cryptocurrencies, following @realDonaldTrump 's pardon of CZ. #Crypto #Binance https://t.co/r0eJThPuTF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 28, 2025 Bipartisan Crypto Reform Talks Intensify as Lawmakers Push for Year-End Deal On October 20, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand led a closed-door roundtable with key industry figures , including Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz, Kraken CEO Jesse Powell, Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov, and Solana Policy Institute President Kristin Smith.

For decades, payments have moved through slow, batch-based processes. This has become inefficient in a digital economy that now demands speed, transparency, and real-time settlement offered by XRP. At SWIFT’s SIBOS 2025 conference , this long-standing tension was placed under a microscope. In a video clip shared on X by SMQKE, Celent analyst Alenka Grealish explained how blockchain-based assets like XRP and Stellar Lumens (XLM) are becoming central to the “flywheel adoption” of next-generation payment systems. The Unsustainable Divide Between Legacy and Modern Systems Grealish began by describing a fundamental problem that plagues global finance today: “If the front office is automated, there’s low latency, then you switch gears—banks operate still typically in terms of batch processing, store and forward.” She noted that “payments messaging, clearing, and settlement are often decoupled,” adding that the result is a process that “can take days.” This separation between instant digital commerce and delayed financial settlement, she said, is “an unsustainable dichotomy.” SWIFT SIBOS: “XRP AND XLM WILL PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE FLYWHEEL ADOPTION OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES” XRP + XLM SWIFT knows. Listen closely. pic.twitter.com/7pPHcmW2oz — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 27, 2025 To bridge this gap, Grealish explained that a growing number of financial institutions and consortia are now “harnessing blockchain, smart contracts, and digital assets to align the performance of banking payment systems” with the instant capabilities of the digital economy. The Flywheel of Blockchain Adoption Grealish used an industrial metaphor to describe the accelerating momentum behind blockchain: “Think of the old industrial flywheels—once they start turning, there’s momentum. It’s hard to stop them.” According to her, the adoption of blockchain and digital assets has already reached the stage of feasibility and is now moving into “economic viability.” She said, “We’re seeing these use cases get into the bottom of that first turn—economic viability.” At SIBOS, this shift was reflected in several key developments: interbank payments, delivery-versus-payment (DvP) models, cross-border transactions, and even remittance systems are being re-engineered using distributed ledger technology. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP, XLM, and Stablecoins: Driving the Internet of Value In one of the most striking parts of her speech, Grealish highlighted the specific digital assets playing an active role in this transformation. “We’re seeing cryptocurrencies like XRP, Stellar Lumens, stablecoins, and USDC playing an important role in getting that wheel to turn—deliver the Internet of Value .” These assets, she said, are not being viewed as speculative investments but as functional tools that enable faster, cheaper, and more transparent settlements. By acting as bridges between currencies and networks, XRP and XLM are helping banks move closer to real-time payments and seamless global liquidity. The Legitimization of Digital Assets Grealish also addressed the growing institutional acceptance of cryptocurrencies, noting that “cryptocurrencies are gaining legitimacy as a new asset class.” She explained that while Bitcoin introduced the concept of the Internet of Value, it was blockchain and distributed ledger technology that evolved into the true disruptors. With central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) now entering the conversation, she believes mainstream adoption is set to accelerate: “The introduction of central bank digital currencies will accelerate mainstreaming with digital assets.” Looking Ahead: From Experiment to Integration The takeaway from SIBOS 2025 is clear—digital asset adoption has moved beyond experimentation. Institutions are now focused on integration, liquidity management, and compliance frameworks that will allow these technologies to scale globally. SMQKE’s video of Grealish’s remarks captured this shift perfectly. The industry conversation is no longer about whether blockchain will work—it’s about which assets, systems, and partnerships will drive the next phase of financial modernization. As the flywheel gathers momentum, XRP and XLM stand at the forefront of the Internet of Value, linking traditional finance to the future of instant global settlement.

And while their combined market capitalization remains less than $1.5 billion, numerous analysts and industry participants believe the rally could be just getting started. TRUMP and MELANIA Steal the Show Official Trump (TRUMP) and Melania Meme (MELANIA) are among the top-performing cryptocurrencies today (October 28). The price of the former briefly touched $8, tapping a 20-day high. Shortly after, it retraced to the current $6.96 (according to CoinGecko’s data), representing a 10% daily increase. TRUMP Price, Source: CoinGecko MELANIA has posted even more impressive gains. It exploded to a two-week high of almost $0.15 before slipping to $0.12, marking a 25% pump for the day. MELANIA Price, Source: CoinGecko While the exact reason for the surge in meme coins associated with POTUS and his wife remains unclear, some might speculate that the upcoming US-China trade talks could be a factor. Trump and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, are expected to meet later this week and agree on a deal that will exclude hefty tariffs and foster a positive relationship between the two global superpowers. The crypto community is looking forward to that meeting, and a favorable outcome will likely boost the entire digital asset sector, including meme coins like those mentioned. Further Pumps Incoming? TRUMP and MELANIA saw the light of day towards the end of January this year when the billionaire officially became the 47th President of the USA. The assets entered the crypto world with a storm, and at one point, their combined market cap neared $10 billion. Currently, they are far from the glory days: TRUMP’s capitalization is around $1.3 billion, while MELANIA’s stands at less than $100 million. Some analysts, though, think the tokens may close the gap to the record levels in the near future. X user Captain Faibik envisioned a “big pump incoming” for TRUMP, setting a price target above $11. For their part, MrsBeast DeFi predicted a 10x rally for MELANIA.

Momentum (MMT), a leading decentralized exchange and liquidity hub built on the innovative Sui (SUI) ecosystem, has officially revealed its highly anticipated MMT tokenomics . This announcement, detailed in an official Medium post, marks a significant milestone for the project and its community, setting the stage for a truly decentralized future. What’s the Buzz About MMT Tokenomics? Momentum’s MMT tokenomics are designed with a clear focus on community empowerment and sustainable growth. The total supply of MMT tokens is capped at one billion, ensuring a clear and predictable economic model. A remarkable 42.72% of this total supply has been strategically allocated to the community. This substantial allocation underscores Momentum’s commitment to decentralization and active community participation. It means a significant portion of the token’s future is in the hands of its users and supporters. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key allocations: Community: 42.72% Early Investors: 24.78% Team: 18% Ecosystem: 13% Public Sale: 1.5% Understanding the MMT Token Release Schedule Transparency and long-term vision are central to the MMT tokenomics . Of the total supply, 20.41% will be released at the Token Generation Event (TGE). This initial release ensures sufficient liquidity and accessibility for early participants. However, a crucial aspect of Momentum’s strategy involves a structured vesting schedule for team and investor tokens. These tokens will not be unlocked at the TGE. Instead, they will undergo linear vesting, commencing after a 12-month cliff period. This thoughtful approach helps prevent immediate selling pressure from core contributors and early backers. It aligns the interests of the team and investors with the long-term success and stability of the Momentum platform. Why is Community Allocation Crucial for MMT’s Success? The generous 42.72% community allocation within the MMT tokenomics is not just a number; it’s a powerful statement. A large community share fosters genuine decentralization, allowing token holders to actively participate in governance and decision-making processes. When the community holds a significant stake, it cultivates a strong sense of ownership and dedication. This can lead to increased engagement, innovative proposals, and a more resilient ecosystem. It’s a win-win, promoting both the platform’s growth and the collective benefit of its users. Furthermore, this allocation can attract a broader user base, eager to contribute to and benefit from a truly community-driven project. It empowers individuals to shape the future direction of Momentum on the Sui blockchain. Momentum’s Vision: Building on the Sui Ecosystem Momentum’s role as a decentralized exchange and liquidity hub on the Sui ecosystem is pivotal. Sui is known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, making it an ideal foundation for innovative DeFi applications. Momentum aims to leverage these capabilities to offer users a seamless and efficient trading experience. By building on Sui, Momentum can provide robust liquidity solutions, empowering users with greater control over their digital assets. The carefully crafted MMT tokenomics are designed to support this ambitious vision, ensuring the platform has the resources and community backing needed to thrive. This strategic positioning allows Momentum to contribute significantly to the growth and maturity of the broader Sui DeFi landscape. Users can look forward to a dynamic and responsive platform, driven by a strong community. Conclusion: A New Era for Decentralized Finance on Sui The unveiling of Momentum’s MMT tokenomics marks an exciting chapter for the project and the entire Sui ecosystem. With a substantial allocation dedicated to the community, a transparent vesting schedule, and a clear vision for growth, Momentum is poised to become a significant player in the decentralized finance space.

The Trump family-backed firm, co-founded by Eric and Donald Trump Jr., revealed it had acquired 1,414 BTC worth more than $160 million, a move that has brought back bullish sentiment around the TRUMP memecoin. $TRUMP rallied to a one-month high of $8.06 after the announcement, pushing its market capitalization to $1.36 billion and surpassing popular rivals such as PENGU , BONK , SPX , and FLOKI .

Adding to the momentum, LunarCrush data shows that social engagement surrounding $TRUMP has soared, recording over 5.9 million in social activity in the past week.

Trump Price Prediction: Bullish Wedge Points to 104% Gains On the technical front, the TRUMP/USDT daily chart shows a strong bullish breakout from a descending channel that has contained price action since mid-July. After several weeks of consolidation near the lower boundary, buyers stepped in aggressively, pushing the token up by over 18% in a single day to reclaim the $7.40 level. This breakout suggests a potential end to the downtrend and the start of a short- to medium-term reversal phase. Source: X/ @Allice_Crypto The projection based on the height of the channel points to an upside target of around $15, representing an estimated 104% gain from current levels. If price sustains above the upper boundary and confirms the breakout with volume, TRUMP could rally toward that target in the coming weeks. However, failure to hold above $7 may trigger a retest of the breakout zone near $6 before resuming its upward trajectory. Overall, momentum favors bulls, with the next key resistance near $10. Pepenode Hits $1.96M Presale with 650% Staking APY—Worth the Hype? TRUMP memecoin’s resurgence is bringing investors’ attention back to the memecoin ecosystem, and new launches still in the presale stage are presenting good buying opportunities now. One hot project investors are pouring money into is Pepenode ($PEPENODE) , which has already raised $1.96 million. Pepenode combines Pepe meme culture with a gamified Mine-to-Earn model, allowing users to build and expand their own virtual mining operations through an interactive blockchain game. To participate, users buy $PEPENODE tokens , which grant access to meme nodes, the core components of their mining infrastructure. Gameplay generates additional $PEPENODE tokens that players can reinvest to enhance current nodes or expand their mining capacity. Early investors can also stake their $PEPENODE holdings to earn over 650% APY, positioning it among the top-yielding staking opportunities available today. Currently, PEPENODE sells for $0.0011138 per token and can be purchased directly through the official PEPENODE presale website using ETH, USDT, USDC, or bank cards.

Moreover, it strongly reinforces Monad’s unwavering commitment to fostering a robust and truly decentralized ecosystem, starting with its foundational token distribution. Why Monad’s Approach Matters for Decentralization Monad is not just another blockchain; it is engineered to overcome existing scalability limitations within the Ethereum ecosystem, offering unparalleled throughput and efficiency. Its unique parallel execution environment aims to deliver 10,000 transactions per second, without compromising decentralization or security.

By distributing tokens to a diverse group of users, Monad actively minimizes the risk of centralized control, thereby enhancing the network’s resilience and long-term viability. This thoughtful approach highlights Monad’s dedication to building a community-driven platform from the ground up. Why is Bot Filtering Crucial for a Fair Monad Airdrop? One of the most significant challenges in any large-scale token distribution, especially an airdrop, involves combating sybil attacks and pervasive bot activity. Monad is tackling this issue head-on by implementing rigorous filtering mechanisms. The primary goal is straightforward: to accurately identify and remove automated accounts that attempt to manipulate the system, thereby ensuring that real, human users receive their rightful share of the Monad airdrop . This meticulous bot filtering process is absolutely vital for maintaining the integrity of the distribution. Without it, airdrops can become significantly diluted, and the intended community members might receive far less than they truly deserve. By focusing on legitimate participation, Monad aims to foster a stronger, more engaged community right from the outset. This commitment to fairness represents a cornerstone of its long-term vision. Ensuring Equity: Bots frequently create multiple wallets to claim more tokens, which significantly distorts fair distribution. Rewarding True Supporters: Effective filtering ensures that tokens are directed to genuine community members who actively contribute value. Preventing Market Manipulation: Large, unfairly acquired token holdings can potentially lead to increased volatility and instability post-launch. Navigating the Monad Airdrop: What Comes Next? With the reveal phase now well underway, many participants are naturally wondering about the subsequent steps for the Monad airdrop . While specific timelines will be officially communicated by Monad, typically, after allocation amounts are revealed and comprehensive bot filtering is complete, the project transitions towards the claim process. This involves participants carefully verifying their eligibility and subsequently claiming their tokens through a designated, secure portal. It is always strongly recommended to remain vigilant and to interact exclusively with official Monad channels for any airdrop-related activities. Phishing scams are unfortunately common during such high-profile events. Always double-check URLs and official announcements. Monad will provide clear, precise instructions on how to proceed, ensuring a secure and straightforward claiming experience for its community members. Actionable Steps for Monad Airdrop Participants To truly make the most of this exciting development, active participation and informed decision-making are absolutely key. Firstly, keep a very close eye on all official announcements from Monad through their official website and trusted social media channels. Understanding the tokenomics and the project’s comprehensive roadmap can also significantly help you appreciate the long-term value of your potential allocation. Remember, the fundamental goal of an airdrop extends beyond just a free distribution; it is primarily about decentralizing ownership and actively building a robust community. By engaging with the Monad ecosystem, whether through social channels, participating in testnets, or utilizing future DApps, you directly contribute to its growth and overall success. The Monad airdrop is truly just the beginning of what promises to be an impactful and transformative journey. In conclusion, the commencement of the Monad airdrop reveal marks a pivotal and exciting moment for the project and its burgeoning community. By diligently prioritizing fair distribution and implementing robust bot filtering, Monad is actively setting a strong and sustainable foundation for its future. Participants should remain well-informed, prioritize security, and be prepared to enthusiastically engage with the next crucial steps in this thrilling process. This careful and deliberate approach underscores Monad’s profound dedication to building a truly decentralized, vibrant, and highly performant blockchain ecosystem.

The company plans to pour $200M into the Linea ecosystem. SharpLink Gaming announced plans to deploy $200M in ETH on the Linea ecosystem. The deployment of ETH capital will include EtherFi and Eigen Cloud. With this move, SharpLink will receive DeFi yield and incentives while tapping into Ethereum’s emerging AI market. NEW: SharpLink plans to deploy $200M of $ETH on @LineaBuild through a collaboration with @ether_fi , @eigenlayer , and @Anchorage . Through this partnership, SharpLink will now access enhanced $ETH -denominated yield from: – Native staking yield – Direct incentives from Linea and… pic.twitter.com/1bRXO1vZ6l — SharpLink (SBET) (@SharpLinkGaming) October 28, 2025 SharpLink will deploy the ETH through its custodial storage with Anchorage Digital Bank, setting up an example for other ETH treasuries. SharpLink Gaming is the second-largest corporate holder with 859.40K ETH valued at around $3.56B, second to BitMine, which now holds over 3M ETH. The expectation is that large-scale ETH owners, including treasury companies and ETFs, may stake a part of their tokens for passive income. The earmarked ETH will be deployed to Linea over a multi-year commitment period. The Linea L2 network will thus start carrying institutional finance, unlocking the value of ETH to make the treasury even more valuable through on-chain yield. Linea locks in over $1B Linea already holds over $1B in deposited value on multiple apps. Linea will help SharpLink tap native Ethereum yield from staking, rewards from Eigen Cloud deposits and services, as well as direct Linea and EthereFi partner incentives. ‘As one of the largest public holders of ETH, we manage our treasury with institutional rigor and discipline. This deployment enables us to access the best of Ethereum’s staking, restaking, and DeFi yield, while maintaining the institutional safeguards our stockholders expect,’ said Joseph Chalom , co-CEO of SharpLink. With this move, SharpLink singles out Linea as capable of carrying institutional-grade finance. Eigen Cloud, currently the top re-staking protocol, carries over 60% of all deposited ETH into similar apps. The recent SharpLink move also follows attempts to make Ethereum a programmable environment, capable of carrying more complex apps with staking-based security. Joseph Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum, founder of ConsenSys, and Chairman of SharpLink, stated that ETH holdings could be made more productive through EtherFi as the primary staking solution. ETH treasuries break above 6M Ethereum treasury companies have not stopped expanding their reserves, reaching a total of 6.06M ETH. The total represents 5.01% of the entire Ethereum supply. SharpLink gaming expanded its treasury by 2.5% in the past month, while BitMine added another 25% to its holdings in a more aggressive acquisition strategy. Currently, SharpLink gaming has a mNAV value of 0.86, meaning its shares are trading below the value of its ETH holdings. SBET shares traded at $14.21, down from a peak above $79. While the initial hype for DAT company shares has diminished, the capabilities of ETH are still growing, based on lending, DeFi and other forms of available yield. Don’t just read crypto news.

This upgrade moves MetaMask beyond its traditional Ethereum-only framework, letting users manage Ethereum, EVM-compatible networks, Solana, and soon Bitcoin under one unified account. Consequently, users will no longer need to switch between different wallets or maintain several seed phrases to manage assets across ecosystems. One Account for All Chains The new multichain functionality has been automatically rolled out in MetaMask Mobile version 7.57 and the Extension version 13.5. Existing users can access the update without any manual action. Besides simplifying wallet management, the new model uses the BIP-44 derivation path, enabling one recovery phrase to organize multiple accounts securely. Moreover, MetaMask confirmed that existing EVM and Solana addresses would remain valid and automatically pair based on their creation order. If users previously created more Solana accounts than EVM ones, the system will generate new EVM addresses accordingly. This shift means fewer accounts to track and smoother cross-chain operations an important step toward a more interoperable crypto experience. However, hardware wallets remain limited to EVM support for now, with Solana integration expected in later updates. This enhancement positions MetaMask as one of the first major wallets to bridge both EVM and Solana ecosystems natively, signaling a growing demand for unified crypto experiences. Mask Token Speculation and Launch Rumors While users welcomed the upgrade, speculation around MetaMask’s rumored token, MASK, resurfaced. A website claiming to be the claims portal for the token briefly appeared online before redirecting to MetaMask’s homepage. Though no official confirmation has been made, anticipation remains high among community members who expect a native token rollout to follow soon. Solana’s Institutional Boost with Bitwise ETF Meanwhile, Solana’s market performance remains under the spotlight as the Bitwise Solana Staking ETF (BSOL) launches on the New York Stock Exchange. According to CryptosRus, JPMorgan expects between $3 billion and $6 billion in inflows within the first year, potentially replicating the early success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg stated that the Litecoin ETF will follow Ethereum as the next altcoin-based ETF to become effective, which has brought strong projections that LTC could soar 50% to $150.

Analysts have now revealed that LTC is showing strength on the weekly timeframe as the trend appears ready to flip upward, targeting $150 in the short term.

After months of sideways movement between the $80-$120 range, the price has recently broken above a key resistance zone around $100-$103, suggesting renewed bullish momentum. The Ichimoku cloud indicator shows that the price has decisively broken above the cloud, which is a strong bullish signal indicating a potential trend reversal. Source: X/ CryptoBull_360 The cloud ahead extends into December, providing a projected path that could take Litecoin toward the $140 level in the near term. In the mid-term, the Litecoin price prediction suggests an ambitious target of approximately $300 by late 2025 or early 2026, representing a potential gain of over 100% from current levels. However, traders should be cautious of a potential retest of the breakout zone near $100 before the rally continues. The volume profile on the chart reveals that there was significant accumulation in the $60-$80 range during 2024, which often acts as strong support during pullbacks.

The uplisting, expected to be completed next month pending approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and shareholders, would make KR1 the first dedicated digital asset company to trade on the LSE’s primary market. KR1 to Expand Blockchain Staking Operations Following LSE Listing KR1 co-founder Keld Van Schreven told the Financial Times that the move represents “a starter gun for this new asset class on the LSE,” adding that it could pave the way for more blockchain companies to follow.

The company has completed more than 100 digital asset investments and plans to expand its staking operations through a new share placement program following the LSE listing. Van Schreven said the firm is “doubling down on staking” as institutional demand for blockchain validation services continues to grow. The decision comes amid a broader shift in the UK’s stance toward crypto regulation. After years of caution, the country is taking active steps to position itself as a hub for digital assets. The FCA has recently lifted its four-year ban on crypto-based exchange-traded notes , allowing asset managers to list such products on the London Stock Exchange.

UK Boosts Crypto Oversight with New Approvals, Stablecoin Caps, and Expanded Tax Powers The FCA has also accelerated its approval process for crypto firms . Since April, five companies, including BlackRock and Standard Chartered, have received registration under the agency’s anti-money laundering regime, bringing the approval rate up to 45%, a sharp increase from less than 15% in previous years. https://twitter.com/cryptonews/status/1970043161339953513 The regulator says it is committed to ensuring the UK’s digital asset framework matches international standards as it prepares to roll out a full regulatory regime next year. Meanwhile, the Bank of England is advancing plans to regulate stablecoins, proposing “temporary” limits on holdings of systemic tokens used for payments , capped between £10,000 and £20,000 for individuals and £10 million for businesses. Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden said the limits are designed to protect credit availability and would be lifted once the transition to digital money no longer poses risks to the real economy.

Tax authorities are also intensifying oversight. HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) has sent 65,000 “nudge letters” to crypto investors suspected of underreporting gains, a 134% increase from last year. The agency is using data from exchanges to identify potential tax evasion and will gain even broader powers under the Crypto-Assets Reporting Framework (CARF), a global standard taking effect in January 2026. Under CARF, exchanges will be required to report detailed transaction data to tax authorities, with the first submissions due in 2027. Can the UK Turn Regulation Into Its Competitive Edge in Crypto? Despite tighter compliance measures, Britain’s crypto market remains one of the most active globally. The UK currently ranks 11th in the Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index and serves as Coinbase’s second-largest market after the United States.

In a post on X, the firm noted that a “risk-on” tone has returned across global markets since the release of September’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which showed inflation cooling modestly while economic growth remains resilient. Comparison of Bitcoin’s price performance relative to CPI readings over the last year. Source: Cryptoquant The 0.3% September CPI rose from 0.2% the previous month, and this is slightly below consensus expectations, helping fuel a rally across equities and risk assets. “Markets loved it. S&P 500 and Nasdaq both ripped to new all-time highs,” CryptoQuant wrote. “Bitcoin followed through.” Stocks soar, metals steady, Bitcoin lags behind The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite surged to record highs after the CPI release. Source: CryptoQuant Following the CPI release, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite surged to record highs, extending 2025’s strong equity performance. On the other hand, gold and silver traded flat, reflecting a pause in demand for traditional safe havens. “With inflation easing, the rush to safety paused,” CryptoQuant noted. “The metals market is quietly saying: ‘We’ll wait.’” According to the data report, Bitcoin prices went up not long after the CPI print, then it saw a drop before pulling back and going up higher. CryptoQuant stated that the pattern is a “classic announcement volatility: fast move, fast unwind, then the real trend builds.” In CryptoQuant’s analysis report , Bitcoin was roughly 8% below its all-time high (ATH). However, as of the time of reporting, it had dropped to 9.26% and still lags behind equities in terms of recent momentum. However, the analytics firm suggested that the sentiment shift in traditional markets could spill over into crypto. “Risk appetite is back,” it said, “but not fully into crypto yet.” Risk-on narrative returns The inflation print appears to have revived investors’ willingness to come back into growth and speculative assets, which is a change from the defensive tone that dominated markets earlier in the quarter. According to reports, the CPI data provided an extra boost to an already optimistic market mood, lifting both equities and cryptocurrencies in anticipation of a more accommodative monetary policy path. CryptoQuant’s data suggests that institutional inflows have yet to match the pace seen during the previous market cycle. Waiting for conviction The interplay between macroeconomic trends and digital assets has grown increasingly tight. As CryptoQuant pointed out, cooling inflation plus strong growth is the perfect mix for stocks. However, it also observed that the crypto market is yet to fully catch up. It also shows that institutional and retail investors, while showing signs of a revival in their spending, are still approaching the asset class with caution, despite improving macro conditions. While Bitcoin continues to mirror risk-on patterns, recent market events show that it’s still very much prone to liquidity dynamics and the pace of Federal Reserve policy shifts. As CryptoQuant put it, “The story of this CPI print” is that inflation is cooling, stocks are at record highs, metals are steady, and Bitcoin is lagging but building.

ETHZ partners with DeFi and tokenization firms, actively deploys ETH for yield, and has resolved most legacy capital structure issues while managing new dilution risks. At $20.65 per share, ETHZ trades at a 22% discount to its $26.46 NAV per share, making it one of the attractive crypto treasury companies at the moment, with share buybacks underway. ETHZ is rated a Buy for leveraged Ethereum exposure, but investors should monitor dilution risks and crypto volatility for the long-term outlook. ETHZilla Corporation ( ETHZ ), the former clinical-stage biotech company that faced cash constraints and poor liquidity and had to slow down R&D activities significantly, has become one of the fastest-growing Ethereum USD ( ETH-USD ) strategy companies. ETHZilla now holds 102,326 ETH worth $421 million at the current ETH spot price of ~$$4,100. It seems ETHzilla doesn't plan to be just a holder of ETH on the balance sheet but a company that is active in all segments of the Ethereum ecosystem. There has been some announced progress on that front. ETHZilla entered a partnership with a company known as Satschel to accelerate ETHZilla's institutional-grade tokenization capabilities and another deployment of $47 million to a liquid restaking platform known as Puffer. So basically, the company is transitioning into becoming an Ethereum infrastructure and applications services provider. The company completed its rebrand from 180 Life Sciences and ticker ATNF to ETHZilla in August. ETHZilla has swiftly accumulated about 102,326 ETH and now holds Ethereum worth about $409 million as of the current ETH spot price near $4,100 and now ranks as the 5th largest corporate holder of ETH. I would say it has been a busy year as the intersection of institutional finance and crypto continues to deepen, with several publicly traded companies announcing crypto treasury strategies. A handful of these firms had struggled in their core businesses. Crypto treasury strategy became a lifeline for some of them. On the flip side, some companies that pivoted to a crypto treasury strategy did so with a mix of opportunistic timing and financing (using convertible debt to fund crypto asset buys and protect equity) and an approach that goes beyond just accumulating the crypto asset but harnesses all available DeFi and staking opportunities in the asset's on-chain ecosystem to further create value. The flexibility crypto treasury companies have to actively deploy their crypto assets for yield generation, which further compounds returns, is what the spot crypto ETFs currently lack, and I think this has been one of the reasons why crypto treasury stocks (especially of companies that primarily hold altcoins that produce yield through staking and other DeFi activities) have been seeing increasing interest among investors. And this is where ETHZilla stands out. ETHZilla primarily holds ETH and is touting full integration in the Ethereum ecosystem as a selling point. Below is an excerpt from ETHZilla’s website on its strategy: To achieve our mission, ETH must be more than just held: it must be staked, restaked, and strategically deployed throughout the on-chain economy. By partnering with some of the world's top yield generation experts, we plan to put our ETH to work, supplementing staking yields with additional on-chain strategies. ETHZilla also owns an iGaming subsidiary , acquired from Elray Resources in September 2024 in an all-stock deal involving the issuance of 1,000,000 Series B Convertible Preferred Shares and warrants to purchase 3 million ATNF common shares, as the company was still trading under the ATNF ticker at that time. The preferred shares were later converted into 1.3 million common shares, which were subsequently repurchased and cancelled under a Settlement Agreement. ETHZilla structured a $1 million buyback to retire those shares and completed the cancellation back in August, as disclosed in this 8-K filing . The warrants associated with Elray were exercised, and the resulting shares also fell under the same settlement and repurchase structure, effectively neutralizing the original contract and thus cushioning any dilution risk that would have had. The 3 million warrants were not part of the repurchase program and were later exercised on a cashless basis at an exercise price of $1.68 per share and sold in July/August on the open market between $3 and $4.84. These transactions are worth mentioning here for clarity on how the company has handled its legacy capital structure issues since the pivot to the ETH treasury strategy. While the capital structure headwinds from the legacy business have largely been cleared, fresh and significantly larger dilution vehicles have been introduced since the pivot to becoming an Ethereum company. These potential dilution pressures include the $506.25 million in outstanding convertible debentures—$156.5 million convertible debentures were first issued and later amended to raise an additional $350 million. The debentures carry an annual coupon of 2%, mature in 2028, and include investor protection clauses like an exchange cap limiting immediate conversions above 19.99% of the outstanding shares without shareholder approval and a floor price adjustment that prevents conversions below $0.3. I believe the exchange cap has helped mitigate a hostile equity takeover or heavy dilution in the near term since the initial debenture issuance, as the convertible debentures are deeply “in the money” at the current stock price (conversion price $3.05). It is also worth mentioning that the notes contain a downward-only reset provision on the conversion price, beginning in May next year. This means that if the stock price drops below conversion price of $3.05, the conversion price for the notes can be reset to a lower figure (potentially closer to the market price), allowing the investor to convert into more shares to cover the same principal amount, thus increasing dilution pressure on existing shareholders while the debenture holder has a better conversion ratio (more shares). Then there was a $425 million PIPE raise of common stock and pre-funded warrants, though the dilution from these has also largely been absorbed into the current share count. And then not forgetting the $10 billion ATM which is potentially a source of continuous, incremental dilution. With potential dilution from the legacy transactions mostly resolved and that from the debentures partially constrained by some investor protection clauses, then the PIPE impact appears also already absorbed into the current share base, it’s safe to say ETHZ holds the potential to pursue accretive ETH purchases in the near term. The company is also actively executing share buybacks and earlier this week sold a portion of its ETH holdings worth $40 million to buy back 600,000 ETHZ shares for $12 million as part of an earlier announced $250 million stock repurchase plan. ETHZ is Attractive, But For How Long? It is becoming increasingly rare to find crypto treasury stocks trading below their crypto holdings (especially in a bull market) or even at par with their crypto asset holdings these days, as investors who understand how crypto treasury stocks accrue value and how they tend to trade at high premiums to net asset value [NAV] are often the early birds. Then there is also the insider activity, where companies’ insiders take positions before announcing a crypto treasury pivot. I'm not making this up. The SEC has had to apply more scrutiny recently, and 200 companies are being looked into as the SEC has cited unusual trading patterns among crypto treasury companies. At ETHZ’s current market price, how early are we to the potential for rerating to reflect future premium-to-NAV gains? For comparison, I’d be looking at SharpLink Gaming, Inc. ( SBET ) and Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. ( BMNR ), both early adopters of an Ethereum treasury strategy and large holders of ETH that are not a crypto exchange or a crypto mining firm. Among these Ethereum treasury plays, ETHZ trades at one of the most attractive discounts to NAV. Using its reported 16.02 million shares outstanding (that's the current shares outstanding following last week's 10-for-1 split), 102,326 ETH worth $421.7 million at ETH’s current spot price, and $2.22 million in cash, total asset value comes to roughly $423.9 million. This gives an NAV per share of about $26.46 (which is obtained by dividing total assets of $423.9 million by 16.02 million total shares outstanding). At the current share price of $20.65, a $26.46 NAV per share implies ETHZ trades at roughly a 22% discount to NAV (calculated by taking the difference between NAV per share and the current share price, dividing that difference by the NAV per share, then expressing the result as a percentage). BNMR holds about 3.24 million ETH which converts to $13.34 billion, and $1.47 million in cash across 284.74 million shares, which gives a NAV per share of roughly $46.84. With a current share price of $53.71, BNMR trades at a 14.7% premium to NAV. SBET holds 859,853 ETH worth $3.54 billion and $5.07 million in cash across 193.13 million shares, implying an NAV per share of about $18.38. At its current price of $14.31, SBET also trades around a 22% discount to NAV. With well-managed dilution and the share buyback currently active, I believe ETHZ will remain attractive in the near term. Investors must track both ETH exposure (which drives NAV growth) and share dilution (which affects how much NAV each share represents). ETH price determines total value, but dilution determines your slice of it. This is why I have earlier broken down the current capital structure of ETHZilla and how much dilution pressure it faces in the near term. I've also used the phrasing “in the near term” throughout this piece because I believe further dilution and volatility effects are inevitable in the long term, given the direct exposure to crypto’s price swings these crypto treasury companies face while lacking a backstop business in most cases or at best still fledgling and in an experimental development stage, like in the case of ETHZilla and the DeFi and tokenization opportunities it says it is pursuing in the Ethereum ecosystem. Risks While at the current stock price, it is unlikely for ETHZ to fall to the $3.05 conversion price to trigger the downward-only reset, this possibility shouldn’t be ruled out because an implosion in the crypto market will most likely mean a similar decline for ETHZ stock. I've also mentioned the dilution risks that investors face with ETHZ, as a $10 billion ATM program is active and could lead to incremental share issuance over time. Takeaway Overall, ETHZ remains an attractive buy for investors seeking leveraged exposure to Ethereum with some capital structure protections in place.",ETH-USD|SBET|BMNR|ETHZ,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-28 15:36:41

Institutional Treasury Meets DeFi Innovation SharpLink’s ETH will be deployed through Anchorage Digital Bank, its qualified custodian, and allocated into a combination of staking, restaking, and AI-yield strategies built on Linea’s zkEVM architecture. The strategy combines Ethereum staking rewards, EigenCloud restaking incentives, and native Linea yield programs, offering the company diversified ETH-denominated returns. SharpLink’s Co-CEO Joseph Chalom describes the initiative as a defining moment in institutional crypto treasury management. “As one of the largest public holders of ETH, we manage our treasury with institutional rigor. This deployment allows us to access Ethereum’s best staking and DeFi yields, while maintaining the security and compliance expected by our stockholders,” he said. Chalom added that the partnership reflects SharpLink’s broader strategy to responsibly enhance yield and unlock scalable treasury performance while advancing Ethereum’s global adoption. Linea: Building Ethereum’s Institutional Layer Linea — developed by Consensys , the firm behind MetaMask and Infura — is positioned as Ethereum’s high-performance, zkEVM Layer-2 designed for enterprises and institutions. According to Joseph Lubin, Consensys’ Founder and CEO (and Ethereum co-founder), Linea is part of a long-term vision to make ETH more “productive” for institutional capital. “Through this collaboration, SharpLink’s ETH will earn enhanced native yield through Linea’s ecosystem partners, ether.fi and EigenCloud. It’s a model we believe other institutions will adopt,” Lubin said. AI-Powered Yields and Verifiable Infrastructure Sreeram Kannan, Founder and CEO of Eigen Labs, emphasized that this partnership lays the groundwork for a new “verifiable economy” where AI, DeFi, and trustless infrastructure intersect. “SharpLink’s commitment positions them at the foundation of a verifiable economy — one that supports AI workloads, insured DeFi, and trustless infrastructure secured by ETH,” Kannan noted. By leveraging EigenCloud’s Autonomous Verifiable Services (AVSs), SharpLink’s deployed ETH will not only earn staking returns but also secure decentralized AI models and computational workloads. Paving the Way for Institutional DeFi Anchorage Digital CEO Nathan McCauley framed the collaboration as the dawn of Ethereum’s “institutional era.” — “At Anchorage Digital, we’re proud to power SharpLink’s staking solution on Linea — proving that innovation and compliance can move in lockstep,” he said. This $200 million ETH deployment is expected to be the first phase of a multi-year commitment, with SharpLink and Consensys planning to co-develop programmable liquidity tools, tokenized equity models, and institutional-grade DeFi products. The message is clear: Ethereum’s next growth phase is not just decentralized — it’s institutional, verifiable, and AI-driven.

The move underscores growing institutional confidence in XRP and highlights Ripple’s broader push to integrate digital assets into traditional finance. Evernorth’s big bet on XRP Evernorth Holdings, a Ripple-backed digital asset treasury firm, has accumulated approximately 388.7 million XRP tokens, valued at just over $1 billion at current market prices. According to data from CryptoQuant, the company purchased the tokens at an average price of $2.44 per XRP, giving it more than $50 million in unrealised gains as the token trades around $2.60.

Birla now heads Evernorth as its CEO, guiding its mission to serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the XRP ecosystem. Ripple’s top executives — including Brad Garlinghouse, Stuart Alderoty, and David Schwartz — are expected to advise the new venture, while co-founder Chris Larsen is among its investors. Plans to go public on Nasdaq Evernorth’s ambitions extend beyond simply managing crypto assets. The company plans to go public through a $1 billion SPAC merger with Armada Acquisition Corp II, trading under the ticker XRPN once the deal closes. Backed by Ripple, SBI Holdings, Pantera Capital, Kraken, and GSR, the merger aims to position Evernorth as the largest publicly listed XRP treasury firm in the world. The SPAC route offers a fast track to Wall Street, giving traditional investors an equity-based entry point into the XRP market. Evernorth’s model mirrors MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy , where a company’s balance sheet is actively used to manage and grow digital assets. Notably, Evernorth’s large-scale purchase comes at a time when institutional interest in XRP is rapidly growing. The buying activity has helped push XRP prices up 1.5%, contributing to a 10% weekly gain. By potentially absorbing up to 2% of XRP’s liquid supply within a year, Evernorth could reduce volatility and enhance liquidity depth — both critical for institutional adoption. More XRP treasuries on the horizon Evernorth is not the only firm betting big on XRP. Several other treasury initiatives have recently surfaced, with commitments ranging from $10 million to $500 million. Ripple-affiliated entities are reportedly backing another $1 billion XRP treasury project structured through a SPAC and supported by Ripple’s own reserves. At the same time, institutional investment products are gaining traction. The XRPR ETF, launched by REX-Osprey, has surpassed $100 million in assets under management, making it the first US ETF to offer direct XRP exposure.

Could Ethereum, the undisputed king of smart contracts, truly reach the coveted $10,000 mark? This is the burning question on every crypto enthusiast’s mind. Our comprehensive Ethereum Price Prediction for 2025, 2026, and up to 2030 dives deep into the factors that could propel ETH to unprecedented heights, or present formidable challenges along the way. Get ready to explore the future of this blockchain giant and understand its astonishing potential. Understanding Ethereum’s Foundational Strength and Market Position Ethereum stands as a titan in the cryptocurrency world, renowned for its pioneering smart contract capabilities. More than just a digital currency, Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that has become the backbone of Web3, powering everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and expansive metaverse projects. Its robust ecosystem, backed by a vast and dedicated developer community, grants it a unique and formidable market position. The network’s transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, famously known as ‘The Merge,’ marked a pivotal moment. This upgrade dramatically reduced Ethereum’s energy consumption, making it a more sustainable blockchain. It also laid the groundwork for future scalability enhancements, addressing long-standing concerns about transaction speed and cost. Ethereum’s significant market capitalization consistently places it as the second-largest cryptocurrency, reflecting its enduring influence and critical role in the digital economy. Factors Influencing ETH Price : What Drives Value? The value of ETH, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency, is influenced by a complex interplay of technological advancements, market demand, macroeconomic trends, and regulatory developments. Understanding these drivers is crucial for any accurate ETH Price assessment. Technological Advancements and Upgrades: The ongoing evolution of Ethereum is a primary driver. The ‘Serenity’ roadmap, encompassing upgrades like Sharding, Danksharding, and Proto-Danksharding, aims to drastically improve transaction throughput and reduce gas fees. These enhancements are vital for Ethereum to handle a global scale of transactions. Furthermore, the proliferation of Layer 2 scaling solutions such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon, which process transactions off-chain before settling them on the mainnet, significantly boosts Ethereum’s overall capacity and user experience. Network Demand and Adoption: The growth of Ethereum’s ecosystem directly impacts demand for ETH. The decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, with its burgeoning total value locked (TVL) and innovative protocols, relies heavily on Ethereum. The thriving NFT market, along with emerging use cases in gaming, metaverse, and enterprise solutions, continuously increases the utility and demand for ETH. As more users and developers choose Ethereum for their projects, the intrinsic value of ETH rises. Macroeconomic Environment: Broader economic conditions play a significant role. Factors like global inflation rates, interest rate policies by central banks, and overall investor sentiment towards risk assets can heavily influence cryptocurrency markets, including ETH. A robust global economy with high liquidity often correlates with increased investment in digital assets. Regulatory Landscape: Clarity or uncertainty in cryptocurrency regulations worldwide can profoundly affect investor confidence and institutional adoption. Favorable regulatory frameworks can attract more mainstream investment, while restrictive policies could stifle growth. The evolving stance of governments on digital assets remains a key variable. Supply Dynamics (EIP-1559 and Staking): Ethereum’s economic model, particularly after the implementation of EIP-1559, includes a mechanism to burn a portion of transaction fees. This burning can make ETH deflationary under certain network conditions, reducing its circulating supply over time. Additionally, the Proof-of-Stake model encourages users to ‘stake’ their ETH to secure the network, effectively locking up a significant amount of the supply and further reducing liquidity. Competition: While Ethereum holds a dominant position, it faces fierce competition from other smart contract platforms like Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche. These ‘Ethereum killers’ often boast faster transaction speeds or lower fees, pushing Ethereum to continuously innovate and maintain its competitive edge. Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 : What to Expect in the Mid-Term? As we look towards 2025, Ethereum is anticipated to be well into its next phase of development, with many of the planned scalability upgrades showing tangible results. The successful implementation of sharding, or at least significant progress, is expected to dramatically enhance the network’s capacity and reduce transaction costs, making it even more attractive for widespread adoption. By 2025, we could see a significant acceleration in institutional adoption. As regulatory frameworks become clearer in major economies, large financial institutions and corporations may feel more comfortable integrating Ethereum into their operations or offering ETH-related products to clients. This influx of institutional capital could provide a substantial boost to the Ethereum Price Prediction 2025 . Furthermore, the continued growth of the Web3 ecosystem – including advanced DeFi protocols, innovative NFT applications, and burgeoning metaverse platforms – will drive consistent demand for Ethereum’s network services. Assuming a generally bullish or stable macroeconomic environment, investor confidence in Ethereum’s long-term vision could strengthen, pushing its value upwards. However, potential delays in upgrade implementation or unexpected macroeconomic downturns could temper these predictions. The market will closely watch for signs of sustained scalability and user growth. Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2025 $3,500 $5,000 $7,500 Navigating the Path to Ethereum $10k : Challenges and Opportunities The journey to Ethereum $10k is filled with both immense opportunities and significant hurdles. Achieving this milestone would solidify Ethereum’s status as a global digital asset and a foundational technology for the internet’s next evolution. Opportunities for Growth: Mass Adoption of Web3 Technologies: As Web3 matures, Ethereum’s role as the primary smart contract platform positions it to capture immense value from new decentralized applications, digital identity solutions, and tokenized economies. First-Mover Advantage and Network Effect: Ethereum’s established ecosystem, developer tools, and user base create a powerful network effect that is difficult for competitors to replicate. This entrenched position fosters continued innovation and attracts talent. Continued Innovation in Layer 2 Scaling: Beyond core protocol upgrades, the ongoing development and optimization of Layer 2 solutions will ensure Ethereum remains scalable and cost-effective, even under immense demand. Potential as a Global Settlement Layer: Ethereum could evolve into a universal settlement layer for various digital assets and financial transactions, further cementing its utility and demand. Challenges to Overcome: Scalability Bottlenecks: Despite upgrades, sustained high demand could still test Ethereum’s transaction capacity, potentially leading to increased gas fees and slower processing times if solutions don’t keep pace. Competition from ‘Ethereum Killers’: Rivals like Solana, Cardano, and Avalanche continue to innovate, offering alternative platforms that could siphon off developers and users if Ethereum fails to deliver on its scalability promises. Regulatory Uncertainty: Unfavorable or overly restrictive regulations in key markets could hinder Ethereum’s growth, impacting institutional investment and user adoption. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Major price corrections or ‘black swan’ events could delay the path to $10k. Security Risks: While the Ethereum protocol is robust, smart contract vulnerabilities on dApps built on Ethereum remain a concern, potentially leading to exploits and loss of funds, which could impact user trust. Long-Term Crypto Price Forecast : Ethereum 2026-2030 Looking further into the future, towards 2026 and beyond to 2030, Ethereum’s trajectory could be truly transformative. By this time, the network is projected to be a fully mature, highly scalable, and energy-efficient blockchain, capable of supporting a vast array of global applications. This long-term Crypto Price Forecast hinges on Ethereum fulfilling its ambitious roadmap and solidifying its role as a fundamental piece of the global digital infrastructure. If Ethereum successfully implements its full suite of upgrades, it could firmly establish itself not just as a leading smart contract platform, but also as a digital store of value, potentially rivalling Bitcoin in certain aspects, or as a global utility token powering a decentralized internet. The deflationary pressure from EIP-1559, coupled with the increasing amount of ETH locked in staking, could lead to a significant reduction in circulating supply, contributing to long-term price appreciation. Mass adoption across various industries, from traditional finance to gaming and supply chain management, would further validate Ethereum’s utility. The period between 2026 and 2030 is critical for Ethereum to demonstrate its resilience, adaptability, and ability to handle the demands of a truly global, decentralized economy. Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $4,500 $6,500 $9,000 2027 $6,000 $8,500 $12,000 2028 $7,000 $10,000 $15,000 2029 $8,500 $12,500 $18,000 2030 $10,000 $15,000 $25,000+ Potential Scenarios for Ethereum’s Future Forecasting the future of a dynamic asset like Ethereum involves considering various scenarios, each with its own set of assumptions and outcomes. The Bullish Scenario: Ethereum Ascendant In this optimistic outlook, Ethereum successfully implements all its planned upgrades on schedule, achieving unparalleled scalability and efficiency. Regulatory environments become largely favorable, fostering widespread institutional adoption and mainstream integration of Web3 technologies. Global economic conditions remain strong, driving significant investment into digital assets. Under this scenario, ETH not only comfortably surpasses $10,000 but could reach $20,000 or even higher by 2030, becoming a cornerstone of the global digital economy. The Neutral Scenario: Steady, Sustainable Growth This scenario envisions a more moderate path. Ethereum continues its development, but perhaps with some delays in major upgrades. Adoption rates are steady but not explosive, with mixed signals from regulators globally. The macroeconomic environment experiences periods of both growth and contraction. In this case, ETH sees gradual appreciation, maintaining its position as a leading cryptocurrency, but perhaps not reaching the most ambitious price targets as quickly. It might hover around the $8,000-$12,000 range by 2030. The Bearish Scenario: Challenges and Stagnation The bearish view anticipates significant technical setbacks, such as major bugs or persistent delays in scaling solutions, leading to user frustration and increased gas fees. Competition from other blockchains intensifies, successfully siphoning off developers and users. Unfavorable or fragmented global regulations stifle innovation and institutional interest. A prolonged global economic downturn further dampens investor sentiment. In this scenario, ETH struggles to maintain its market dominance, and its price might remain below or only slightly above its current all-time highs, potentially facing downward pressure towards the $2,000-$5,000 range. Actionable Insights for Investors Navigating the volatile yet promising world of cryptocurrency requires a strategic approach. For those considering Ethereum, here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing, thoroughly understand Ethereum’s technology, its roadmap, the competitive landscape, and the inherent risks. Relying solely on price predictions is insufficient. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount regularly (e.g., weekly or monthly). This strategy helps mitigate the impact of market volatility by averaging out your purchase price over time. Practice Robust Risk Management: Only invest capital you can afford to lose. Cryptocurrency markets are highly speculative. Diversify your portfolio across different asset classes, and avoid putting all your funds into a single asset. Stay Informed and Adapt: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Continuously follow developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, broader market trends, and regulatory news. Be prepared to adapt your investment strategy as circumstances change. Understand the Fundamentals: Focus on Ethereum’s utility, network effects, developer activity, and technological progress rather than short-term price fluctuations. These fundamentals are often better indicators of long-term value. Challenges and Risks Ahead While Ethereum’s future appears bright, it is not without its challenges and inherent risks that investors must acknowledge: Scalability Limitations: Despite ongoing upgrades, there’s always a risk that transaction capacity might not keep pace with exponential demand, leading to network congestion and high fees, which could deter users and developers. Security Vulnerabilities: While the core Ethereum protocol is highly secure, smart contracts deployed on the network can have vulnerabilities. Exploits of these contracts can lead to significant financial losses and erode trust in the ecosystem. Regulatory Headwinds: The lack of a clear, unified global regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies poses a continuous risk. Adverse regulatory decisions or outright bans in major jurisdictions could significantly impact ETH’s market value and adoption. Intense Competition: The blockchain landscape is highly competitive. New Layer 1 blockchains are constantly emerging, often boasting faster transaction speeds or lower costs. While Ethereum has a strong network effect, it must continue to innovate to maintain its lead. Market Volatility and External Shocks: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, subject to rapid and unpredictable price swings. Global economic downturns, geopolitical events, or unexpected technological disruptions can all trigger significant market corrections. Centralization Concerns: While Ethereum strives for decentralization, concerns sometimes arise regarding the concentration of staking power or the influence of major development teams. Addressing these concerns is vital for long-term network health. FAQs about Ethereum’s Future Here are some frequently asked questions about Ethereum’s potential and its future trajectory: Q: What is Ethereum’s primary role in the crypto market? A: Ethereum serves as the leading smart contract platform, foundational for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 applications. It enables developers to build and deploy a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps). Q: What was ‘The Merge,’ and why is it important for Ethereum? A: ‘The Merge’ was Ethereum’s historic transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This shift dramatically reduced Ethereum’s energy consumption by over 99% and paved the way for future scalability upgrades, making the network more sustainable and efficient. Q: Who created Ethereum? A: Ethereum was conceived by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013. He published a whitepaper outlining the concept, and development was crowdfunded in 2014 by the Ethereum Foundation , a non-profit organization. Q: Can institutional adoption truly impact ETH price? A: Yes, absolutely. Significant institutional interest and investment from major financial players like JPMorgan Chase , BlackRock , and other asset managers can bring substantial capital, increase legitimacy, and drive up demand and price for ETH. Their participation signals a maturation of the crypto market. Q: What are Layer 2 solutions, and how do they help Ethereum? A: Layer 2 solutions, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon, are scaling technologies that process transactions off the main Ethereum blockchain (Layer 1) before bundling them and submitting them back for final settlement. This significantly increases transaction throughput, reduces gas fees, and improves Ethereum’s overall scalability and user experience. Many of these solutions are developed by prominent blockchain companies like ConsenSys . Conclusion: The Road Ahead for Ethereum Ethereum’s journey to potentially reach and surpass the $10,000 mark by 2030 is certainly plausible, driven by its relentless innovation, expanding ecosystem, and growing utility across the digital economy. While the path will undoubtedly be marked by volatility and challenges, Ethereum’s foundational strength, its commitment to scalability through ongoing upgrades, and its dominant position in the Web3 landscape paint a compelling picture for its future. The question is not just if ETH can reach $10,000, but rather how its transformative power will continue to reshape our digital world. Investors should remain informed, exercise caution, and always conduct their own thorough research to navigate this exciting, yet unpredictable, market.

The company plans to issue $50 million in convertible bonds, with the express purpose of funding additional Bitcoin purchases . This bold strategy, as reported by BitcoinTreasuries, highlights a growing trend of corporations actively integrating cryptocurrencies into their financial frameworks. Understanding Convertible Bonds for Bitcoin Purchases Many people wonder how companies raise capital for large-scale investments. Convertible bonds offer a unique solution. They are essentially a type of debt instrument that a company issues, much like a regular bond. However, these bonds come with a special feature: the bondholder has the option to convert them into a predetermined number of the issuing company’s common shares at a later date. Why would a company choose this route, especially for Bitcoin purchases ? Convertible bonds often come with lower interest rates compared to traditional debt. This makes them an attractive option for raising capital while managing borrowing costs. For Universal Digital, this mechanism provides a flexible way to secure significant funds for increasing its Bitcoin holdings without immediate equity dilution or the higher interest associated with conventional loans. Universal Digital’s Strategic Push for More Bitcoin Universal Digital’s decision to issue $50 million in convertible bonds specifically for more Bitcoin purchases signals strong confidence in the long-term value of the cryptocurrency. This move positions the company among a growing list of publicly traded entities that view Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic treasury reserve asset. The funds raised will enable Universal Digital to expand its existing crypto portfolio. This approach allows the company to capitalize on potential future price appreciation of Bitcoin, thereby enhancing shareholder value. It also demonstrates a clear commitment to digital assets as a core component of their financial strategy. What Are the Benefits and Challenges of Such Bitcoin Purchases? Embracing a strategy like Universal Digital’s comes with both compelling advantages and inherent risks. Understanding these aspects is crucial for appreciating the full scope of this financial maneuver. Access to Capital: Convertible bonds provide a direct pipeline to capital for substantial Bitcoin purchases , without the immediate need to sell existing assets or issue new shares. Flexibility: The dual nature of debt and equity offers flexibility. If the company’s stock performs well, bondholders might convert, reducing debt. If not, the debt remains. Signaling Confidence: Such an investment signals to the market that Universal Digital has strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future, potentially attracting investors who share this outlook. Potential for Returns: Should Bitcoin’s value increase significantly, the company’s treasury would see substantial gains, directly benefiting its financial health. However, challenges also exist: Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can be highly volatile. A downturn could negatively impact the value of the company’s holdings. Dilution Risk: If bondholders convert their bonds into shares, it could dilute the ownership stake of existing shareholders. Interest Obligations: Despite potentially lower rates, the company still has interest payments to make, regardless of Bitcoin’s performance. Regulatory Scrutiny: Investing heavily in crypto can attract increased attention from financial regulators, requiring careful compliance. The Broader Impact on Institutional Bitcoin Purchases Universal Digital’s strategy is more than just a company-specific event; it contributes to a larger narrative about institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. As more publicly traded companies explore innovative financing methods for Bitcoin purchases , it lends further legitimacy and stability to the digital asset market. This trend could inspire other corporations to consider similar strategies, potentially driving greater demand for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Moreover, it signifies a maturing market where traditional financial instruments are being adapted to accommodate the unique characteristics of cryptocurrencies, paving the way for wider acceptance and integration into global finance. A Glimpse into the Future of Corporate Crypto Holdings Universal Digital’s decision to fund its Bitcoin purchases through convertible bonds is a compelling example of how companies are adapting to the evolving financial landscape. It demonstrates a sophisticated approach to capital raising, aimed at strengthening their position in the digital economy. This strategy underscores a belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value and its role as a strategic asset for forward-thinking corporations. As the line between traditional and digital finance continues to blur, we can expect to see more innovative approaches like this. Companies are increasingly seeking ways to harness the potential of cryptocurrencies while navigating market complexities. Universal Digital’s move sets a precedent, offering valuable insights into the future of corporate treasury management in the age of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Universal Digital ? Universal Digital is a Canadian publicly traded company that is actively involved in the digital asset space, making strategic investments in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Q2: What are convertible bonds ? Convertible bonds are a type of debt instrument that can be converted into a specified number of common shares of the issuing company at the bondholder’s option. They offer flexibility for both the issuer and the investor. Q3: Why is Universal Digital using convertible bonds for Bitcoin purchases? Universal Digital is using convertible bonds to raise $50 million for additional Bitcoin purchases because it allows them to secure capital with potentially lower interest rates and offers a flexible financing option without immediate equity dilution. Q4: How does this strategy impact Universal Digital’s existing shareholders? Initially, it provides capital for growth without immediate dilution. However, if bondholders choose to convert their bonds into shares, it could lead to dilution for existing shareholders in the future. Conversely, if Bitcoin’s value increases, it could significantly boost the company’s overall value. Q5: Is this a common strategy for companies making crypto investments? While not yet mainstream, it is an increasingly recognized strategy, especially among companies with a strong conviction in digital assets. It represents an innovative blend of traditional finance and cryptocurrency investment, setting a precedent for future institutional BitcoinTreasuries strategies.

But it gained 3% over the past week to trade around $18.5. Alphractal founder Joao Wedson now believes that a possible upside breakout before year-end could emerge despite broader market weakness in 2025. LINK May Be Near a Local Bottom The MVRV Z-Score, an important on-chain metric used to assess whether an asset is undervalued or overvalued, has historically provided strong buy signals for LINK whenever it turned negative. However, the metric is currently trending downward, which points to a more cautious investor mood amid muted demand for cryptocurrencies this year. LINK remains far below the euphoric MVRV levels seen in its previous cycle, which has left traders wondering when enthusiasm will return. Meanwhile, the Buy/Sell Pressure Delta has proven to be another reliable indicator for the crypto asset. At present, it sits in negative territory, which often points to a local price bottom and potential for a rebound. Despite this, Wedson stresses the importance of cross-verifying this signal with other on-chain models that map out critical support and resistance zones. Following the sharp October correction, large short liquidation clusters have built up around $26.4 and $28.3. These levels could trigger a rapid upward move if price momentum revisits those zones. On the technical front, its Dynamic Moving Average (MA) and Price Ratios remain supportive. Since 2024, every instance where the token fell below its key moving averages has marked a solid accumulation phase. Encouragingly, LINK is currently holding above the 720-day MA. Should it break below that threshold, Wedson explained that it is best to wait at least two weeks before concluding whether it’s a genuine breakdown or a temporary bull trap. In summary, while speculative on-chain data for LINK is still somewhat weak, it remains net positive. Selling pressure has largely dominated, yet such phases often precede recovery. With major shorts now exposed and price stability above key MAs, a decisive move above $25 might serve as the spark that reignites investor optimism. Ready For Liftoff? Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared a cautiously optimistic outlook as he described it as “a pretty decent-looking coin” in his recent post on X. He noted that LINK’s price action is likely to remain range-bound between $17 and $20 in the short term. Following this consolidation, the asset could be gearing up for another leg higher once accumulation within this zone is complete. Another analyst compared Chainlink’s price movements with the M2 Money Supply, using an approximate 320-day offset, and said that a new phase of the bull market could begin toward the end of November or early December, which could potentially last until May 2026. According to the analyst, LINK’s best reflects the correlation with M2 using this offset, though the pattern is considered relevant for the broader crypto market as well. He noted that the largest liquidation event occurred just before a major M2 expansion, which supports the narrative that the next bull market phase could be particularly intense. However, the analysis also pointed out that volatility and uncertainty are expected to persist until the end of November.

Basically, the South Korean central bank is concerned about stablecoins failing to maintain their peg with the won, according to a report published on October 28. Stablecoins must be backed by trust Even as the South Korean stablecoin market has witnessed notable growth over the past years, much of it has been led by private companies, which the central bank believes could open the door to financial instability. The Bank of Korea warned that private issuers often lack the institutional trust and “high level of publicness” required to safeguard value stability during times of market uncertainty or when undergoing operational disruption. Without a credible public institution backing the asset, these tokens could depeg and undermine the very trust that makes currency work in the first place, it warned. The central bank wants licensed banks to take the lead in issuing won-backed digital assets as they are already embedded in the centralised monetary framework. As such, they are better positioned to manage reserves and ensure liquidity is maintained, all the while upholding public accountability in case redemption rate spike or the market loses faith in the stablecoin. “Currency operates not on technology, but on trust,” the bank said in the report. Depegging was singled out as a structural risk, not just a technical issue. Even widely adopted stablecoins like USDC and USDT have struggled with under pressure. The Terra-Luna collapse and USDC’s drop to $0.88 during the SVB crisis were both cited as reminders that reserve quality and issuer credibility matter as much as the blockchain they operate on. In the central bank’s words, “if the value of the reserve assets declines due to risky investments, the promise cannot be kept.” Beyond market risk, consumer protection remains another blind spot. Stablecoin holders are not covered under South Korea’s deposit insurance system, nor can they rely on the central bank for emergency liquidity if an issuer collapses. The central bank notes that this lack of a legal safety net makes retail users vulnerable to sudden losses, particularly if the issuer fails to honour redemptions. There’s also concern that allowing non-bank firms to issue stablecoins could dilute financial discipline. Companies in tech or retail could effectively issue private money to serve their own platforms, distorting competition and increasing economic concentration. The bank warned of a scenario where “big tech integrates financial and payment services into their own commerce networks,” potentially locking in users and merchants to proprietary tokens. Such developments, it said, would undermine the separation between industrial and financial capital that underpins Korea’s economic system. Bank of Korea is not against stablecoin innovations Despite the criticism, the central bank is not opposed to innovation itself and has made clear that it “does not seek to block innovation.” To support stablecoin oversight, the central bank wants multiple agencies working together, and it’s already running a pilot called Project Hangang , which is a pilot program testing bank-issued tokens within a controlled blockchain network. These tokens offer the programmability and settlement speed of stablecoins while constrained within a regulated environment. At the moment, the stablecoin market in South Korea is dominated by private projects like KRWIN and KRW1 that are pegged to the local currency. Amidst this backdrop, South Korea’s Financial Services Commission is expected to submit a new stablecoin framework to the National Assembly before year-end, as part of the second phase of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act.

This prediction market, called “Truth Predict,” will be available through Trump’s social media network, Truth Social. Trading on the platform will be conducted through Crypto.com's North American derivatives platform. Following testing, Truth Predict is planned to launch initially in the US and then globally. Trump Media CEO and former Republican House of Representatives member Devin Nunes said in a statement: “We are opening these markets, long controlled by global elites, to the people. With Truth Predict, we are democratizing information, empowering Americans to harness the wisdom of the crowd, and transforming free speech into foresight.” Related News: Here Are the 15 Altcoins with the Highest Weekly Active User Count The move is seen as part of Trump Media's strategy to generate revenue from its retail investor base. The company recently partnered with Crypto.com to create a crypto treasury for purchasing and storing CRO tokens. Trump Media's entry into the prediction market comes at a time when trading volume on platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi is reaching record levels. According to Bloomberg, Polymarket is preparing for a new round of funding at a $15 billion valuation, while Kalshi is facing bids exceeding $10 billion. Trump's support for crypto assets has created new opportunities for companies in the sector. The stablecoin law and pro-digital asset appointments enacted after the president's re-election have boosted crypto markets. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek was one of the first crypto executives to visit Trump at Mar-a-Lago shortly after his election. The company donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, while its parent company later contributed $10 million to a political action supercommittee called MAGA Inc. Last October, Crypto.com faced a regulatory challenge from the SEC, but it withdrew the lawsuit following Trump's election victory. In March 2025, the SEC closed its investigation into the company. *This is not investment advice.

The launch of the Bitwise SOL Staking ETF (BSOL) has captured significant attention, demonstrating a powerful demand for innovative crypto products. This new ETF, designed to offer exposure to Solana’s staking rewards, quickly proved its appeal, showcasing remarkable investor interest right out of the gate. What’s Driving the Buzz Around the Bitwise SOL Staking ETF? Imagine launching a new product and seeing it soar in popularity within minutes. That’s exactly what happened with the Bitwise SOL Staking ETF. Listing just recently, this groundbreaking fund achieved an astonishing milestone: over $10 million in trading volume within its initial 30 minutes. This isn’t just a number; it’s a clear signal of strong investor confidence and a growing appetite for structured crypto investments. So, what exactly is a SOL staking ETF ? In simple terms, it’s an exchange-traded fund that holds Solana (SOL) and participates in its staking mechanism. Staking involves locking up cryptocurrency to support the network’s operations and, in return, earning rewards. The ETF structure allows traditional investors to gain exposure to these staking rewards without directly managing the complexities of cryptocurrency wallets or staking protocols. This blend of traditional finance and innovative crypto yield generation is proving to be a powerful magnet for capital. A Closer Look at the Market’s Reaction to the Bitwise SOL Staking ETF The rapid influx of capital into BSOL highlights a significant shift in how investors are approaching the crypto market. The sheer volume achieved by the Bitwise SOL Staking ETF in such a short period is a testament to the pent-up demand for regulated, accessible crypto investment products. It suggests that many investors, both institutional and retail, are eager to participate in the growth of leading cryptocurrencies like Solana, especially when presented in a familiar ETF wrapper. Furthermore, the performance of other newly listed crypto ETFs provides valuable context. For instance, the Canary HBAR ETF (HBR) also saw considerable activity, posting $4 million in trading volume during its first 30 minutes. The LTC ETF (LTCC), while trailing, still garnered $400,000 in the same timeframe. While these figures are noteworthy, they underscore the exceptional performance and investor enthusiasm specifically directed towards the Bitwise SOL Staking ETF, positioning it as a standout performer in this new wave of crypto investment vehicles. Why is the Bitwise SOL Staking ETF a Game Changer for Investors? The introduction of the Bitwise SOL Staking ETF represents a pivotal moment for both the Solana ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency market. For investors, it offers several compelling advantages. Firstly, it provides a regulated and straightforward pathway to participate in Solana’s staking rewards, which historically have been accessible primarily through direct crypto holdings. This ease of access can attract a wider pool of investors who might be hesitant about the technicalities of self-custody or decentralized staking platforms. Secondly, the ETF structure offers liquidity and transparency. Investors can buy and sell shares of the SOL staking ETF on traditional exchanges, just like stocks. This enhances market efficiency and provides a clear valuation. The fund’s ability to generate staking rewards adds an attractive yield component, potentially offering a dual benefit of capital appreciation from SOL’s price movements and ongoing income from staking. This innovative approach could set a new standard for crypto investment products, blending growth potential with passive income opportunities. Moreover, the success of the Bitwise SOL Staking ETF could pave the way for more similar products across various proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies. This institutional validation not only legitimizes the underlying assets but also helps mature the crypto market, integrating it further into traditional financial frameworks. The demand seen for this ETF indicates a strong belief in Solana’s future and the utility of its staking mechanism. Navigating the Future: Opportunities and Challenges for SOL Staking ETF Investors While the initial success of the Bitwise SOL Staking ETF is undeniably exciting, potential investors should consider both the opportunities and challenges. The primary opportunity lies in gaining exposure to Solana’s growth trajectory and its attractive staking yields through a regulated and convenient vehicle. This could be particularly appealing for those looking to diversify their portfolios with exposure to cutting-edge blockchain technology. However, it’s crucial to remember that investing in a SOL staking ETF still carries inherent risks associated with the underlying cryptocurrency market. Volatility in Solana’s price can impact the ETF’s value. Furthermore, regulatory landscapes around crypto ETFs are still evolving, which could introduce uncertainties. It’s always wise for investors to conduct their due diligence and understand the product’s prospectus thoroughly before making investment decisions. Looking ahead, the strong performance of BSOL could accelerate the development and approval of more staking-enabled crypto ETFs. This trend suggests a future where traditional finance and decentralized finance become increasingly intertwined, offering investors more sophisticated and accessible ways to engage with the digital asset economy. The Bitwise SOL Staking ETF is not just a product; it’s a harbinger of a new era in crypto investing. The debut of the Bitwise SOL Staking ETF marks a significant milestone in the evolution of cryptocurrency investments. Its astounding $10 million trading volume in just 30 minutes underscores a robust market demand for regulated and accessible crypto products that offer both exposure to digital assets and the potential for staking rewards. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, innovative offerings like the Bitwise SOL Staking ETF will play a crucial role in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the decentralized world, opening new avenues for growth and participation for a broad spectrum of investors.

SoftBank Group, Westinghouse, and Hitachi are among the firms interested, which are worth around $400 billion. The $550 billion investment package was part of a trade deal that Japan agreed to with the U.S. in September amid the heightened trade war. Tokyo announced that the investment package would comprise equity, loans, and loan guarantees from the state-owned Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI). Westinghouse, GE Vernova, and Hitachi plan to build modular reactors Thanks to Japanese Minister of State for Economic & Fiscal Policy Akazawa, Ambassador to the United States Yamada and the entire Japanese delegation for their partnership in reaching this historic agreement. With this deal, Japan will provide President Trump with $550 billion… pic.twitter.com/QciyN9S2qK — Howard Lutnick (@howardlutnick) September 5, 2025 Japan’s finance ministry stated in September that JBIC will provide financial support for overseas expansions by Japanese firms focused on the country’s economic security. The ministry also confirmed that it has revised regulations on financial institutions, which allows it to expand the scope of its investment in developed countries. According to the fact sheet, Westinghouse plans to build pressurized water reactors and small modular reactors in projects worth up to $100 billion. The firm’s initiative will involve Japanese suppliers like Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Toshiba, and IHI. The factsheet also revealed that a consortium, which includes GE Vernova and Hitachi, is considering the construction of small modular reactors. SoftBank is also considering investing in a $25 billion project to develop large-scale power infrastructure. Carrier also hinted that it could supply thermal cooling systems to power infrastructure. Panasonic is expected to build energy storage systems. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick disclosed last month that Washington would initially split profits equally on projects funded through the investment package. He revealed that once Tokyo earns back its full investment, the U.S. will shift to receiving 90%, while Japan will take the remaining 10%. The U.S. official also acknowledged that an investment committee will oversee the investment and suggest which projects to fund. Japan’s Prime Minister wants to strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance Tokyo’s Finance Minister, Satsuki Katayama, revealed on Tuesday that the country will disclose the detailed plan of its investment package in the U.S. Katayama also acknowledged that he had established a good relationship with Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi during the meeting. “I just finished a phone call with President Trump. I conveyed to him that strengthening the Japan-U.S. Alliance is the top priority for my administration’s foreign and security policy. We confirmed our shared commitment to further elevating the Alliance to new heights.” – Sanae Tikaichi , Prime Minister of Japan. Lutnick mentioned on Monday that Japan’s investment package would focus on areas such as power and pipelines. He argued that those areas are fundamental to the U.S.’s national security and have virtually no risk. He also confirmed in an interview with the Nikkei Business Daily that 10 to 12 Japanese companies involved in areas such as power supply and shipbuilding are already planning to explore investment opportunities in the U.S. He revealed that the first project is expected to be identified as early as the end of 2025. Lutnick also maintained that the 15% levies on Tokyo’s semiconductors and pharmaceuticals will remain. Japan’s top trade negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, said earlier this month that the country’s U.S. investment fund won’t affect currency markets. He acknowledged that Tokyo will operate with caution to make sure that the yen doesn’t depreciate, which might cause a surge in import prices for Japan. Akazawa also believes that Washington doesn’t care about the breakdown of the investment package, saying that it’s up to Japan to decide on the breakdown as long as the funds are available as needed. Japan’s trade negotiator previously argued that only 1-2% of the investment fund will be actual investment, with the rest coming from loans and loan guarantees. He acknowledged that he based his assessment on past projects supported by JBIC and NEXI.

Solana (SOL) has been flying high since its inception, living up to its reputation as the coin that does lightning-fast transactions and scorching price rallies, one that habitually gives reward to dip buyers by bursting out in pyrotechnic order. But now focus is rapidly moving to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a fresh cryptocurrency which is sending shockwaves through the market with its innovative DeFi protocol and record-breaking presale achievements. Now in Phase 6 and more than 80% sold out, MUTM costs a mere $0.035, one of the most widely discussed early deals for the year. With momentum building up steam and time running out for early players to get in, the majority of analysts are convinced that MUTM may very well be the fastest-growing crypto for 2025, the type of project which makes early entries gigantic profit tales. Solana (SOL) on the Bullish side with a Surge in Momentum Solana (SOL) is sort of up again on its feet again after a round of correction and a solid base in the $190 range after its bullish beauty stage at the beginning of the year. The current price movement shows that the buyers are slowly and steadily entering the market, which is a sign of growing confidence in the market. A bullish push above $200 could be a sign of a turnaround on the upward trend and this action will propel SOL to the $215-$225 range as the trend gains momentum. Sentiment will turn back to consolidation to recovery and in that case again, Solana will be among the best cryptos to invest in by the quick-money-hungry investors in 2025. To his great surprise, when Solana begins to recover and pick up steam, suddenly most investors begin to take a second look at Mutuum Finance (MUTM), who is becoming a star in DeFi that is making an attempt to go mainstream amongst early adopters. Mutuum Finance Breaks Records in Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in rapid transition to be one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in today in the upcoming DeFi platform. The presale project still continues its way forward surpassing over 17,500 investors, raising over 18.15 million so far. The current stage 6 price is at $0.035 and it is the lowest stage of entry before the price goes up to $0.04 in stage 7. As the bull market expansion is expected in the future, this is the best time to invest in knowing that once the bull market has grown, the early investors stand a great chance to invest in before the next growth in the price of the MUTM as one of the best cryptos to invest in currently. Platform Features Launch In the near future, the mutual economy giant will be catapulted when the V1 of its lending and borrowing protocol moves to the Sepolia testnet towards the end of Q4 2025. The milestone will allow users to experiment and experience the actual real-time responsiveness and usability of the platform. The work is going on full blast, and presale is gaining phenomenal momentum, Phase 6 already being completed to an 80% level, and another price jump is on the verge of happening. Interest on Mutuum Finance Dynamic Borrowing Mutuum Finance is founded on a dynamic interest rate system which changes dynamically with the utilization ratio, i.e. the ratio of borrowed funds to the entire amount of liquidity. In case of liquidity, the interest rate is low which encourages borrowing and holding of assets in circulation. When the liquidity is in high demand, the rate is higher, which encourages the loans to be repaid, and also attracts new deposits by lenders seeking better returns. Through letting the market determine the rates, Mutuum Finance creates a self-stabilizing and stable environment in which capital efficiency and stability favors each other. This kind of innovative system also deepens its status as one of the most beneficial cryptocurrencies to invest in currently among the investors who wish to gain value through the real-world DeFi service and long-term development. Solana is bouncing back at $190 and targeting a bullish breakout above $200, but the true breakout star is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). At $0.035 with 80% of Phase 6 sold and $18.15M raised, MUTM’s DeFi revolution and rapidly selling presale make it one of the top new cryptos to buy now for soaring 2025 profits.

There has also been a rise in accumulation among key investors within the period, reflecting strategic positioning by these market participants. Analysts See A $5,000 ETH On The Horizon Ethereum has broken above $4,000, and the next significant milestone could be the $5,000 level, according to several forecasts emerging within the vibrant crypto community. According to new data that has surfaced, the leading altcoins’ path toward the anticipated $5,000 mark appears increasingly plausible as the market regains traction. Even though ETH has had several attempts to break this level and failed each time, analysts are confident that it will happen this ongoing cycle, particularly before the year ends. In an X post, Crypto-Gucci.eth, a crypto pundit, highlighted that the altcoin now has a 52% chance of hitting and breaking the $5,000 threshold in 2025. However, this calculation is from PolyMarket, a world-leading prediction market. Given the high probability of ETH reaching $5,000 in 2025, the expert is confident that the level seems to be extremely cheap for ETH to achieve by the end of the year. “Not going to lie, this may be the easiest bet of the year,” the expert added. Other major targets, such as $6,000 and $7,000, now have a 25% and 14% chance of Ethereum reaching these levels this year, respectively. As ETH solidifies its place as the top smart contract platform, it is gaining traction for what might be one of the biggest rallies in its history . Ethereum Whales Are Persistently Piling In As predictions of ETH’s price reaching the $5,000 price mark this bull market cycle grows, key investors appear to be heavily positioning themselves for this anticipated robust rally that might change the course of the market. On-chain data from Alphractal, a leading analytics platform, reveals that the number of large holders or whales has been steadily increasing. This steady accumulation since April is being observed among wallet addresses holding between 10,000 ETH and 100,000 ETH. According to the platform, these investors were the ones who accumulated the most during ETH’s last bull run. Alphractal shared this optimistic action by major investors after examining the Address Supply Bands chart. It is worth noting that these large investors have had the strongest link with changes in Ethereum’s price in the past, as seen in 2017 and 2021. During these periods, ETH’s price experienced a surge after the supply of these investors went up. With the group loading up again, Alphractal believes that the result will not be different in 2025. At the time of the report, over 31 million ETH is attached to the group, marking its highest level ever recorded. A buying pressure of this magnitude implies that these major investors have a great deal of faith in ETH’s future and potential.",Ethereum|Address Supply Bands Chart|Alphractal|Crypto-Gucci.eth|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Polymarket,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-28 16:00:36

The table spans 2013–2025 and shows November as the statistical outlier in Bitcoin’s calendar—both for eye-popping gains and for sharp drawdowns in certain years. Bitcoin November Preview “November is Bitcoin’s best month based on historical performance. By far,” Daan wrote on X, pointing to an average November change of +46.02% across the dataset. That figure is visibly distorted by November 2013’s +449.35% surge, the single largest monthly move on the board. He added: “The average gain over all these months is +46.02%. But this is heavily skewed by a single monthly gain in November 2013. Bitcoin went up +449.35%!! that month.” The raw counts back up the reputation without the hyperbole. Out of the 12 Novembers listed (2013–2024), 8 finished green—2013 (+449.35%), 2014 (+12.82%), 2015 (+19.27%), 2016 (+5.42%), 2017 (+53.48%), 2020 (+42.95%), 2023 (+8.81%), and 2024 (+37.29%)—while 4 were negative—2018 (-36.57%), 2019 (-17.27%), 2021 (-7.11%), and 2022 (-16.23%). Related Reading: Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Returns To Neutral As BTC Breaks $115,000 The median November change sits at +10.82%, a more conservative central tendency that dampens the 2013 effect. Excluding 2013 entirely, the simple average for November drops to roughly +9.35% across the remaining 11 years, underscoring how one month can skew mean-based seasonality. Context from the broader table matters. November’s average is the highest of any month on Coinglass’s grid, ahead of October’s +20.30% average, while December shows a far more mixed profile with a +4.75% average but a -3.22% median—an imbalance consistent with outlier-driven months. September, long maligned by traders, retains a negative average (-3.08%) over the full period. The 2024 row itself captures the push-and-pull of this cycle’s narrative: double-digit gains in February, March, May, October, and November, offset by meaningful drawdowns in April, June, and August, and a negative December print to close the year (-2.85%). Lessons From Prior Cycles Daan’s framing extends beyond simple seasonality. “November & December is when the 2013, 2017 & 2021 cycles topped out. It’s also where the 2018 & 2022 cycles bottomed out,” he noted. That observation lines up with the historical inflection points most market participants remember: the late-2013 mania and subsequent crash, the December 2017 peak, the November 2021 all-time high, and the December 2018 and November 2022 washouts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Hasn’t Died—It’s Evolving, Says Galaxy Research Head The Coinglass grid cannot timestamp intramonth highs or lows, but the clustering of major pivots into the final two months of the year is consistent with the market’s folklore and with the returns pattern that shows both exceptionally strong up months and some of the cycle’s most punishing down months in this window. The practical takeaway—again in Daan’s words—is not categorical bullishness, but regime risk: “All in all, an eventful last 2 months of the year generally speaking. Whether it’s on the bullish or bearish side, volatility and big market pivots have been the theme into the end of the year.” The heat map supports that characterization. November’s distribution spans the widest extremes on record—from +449.35% at the top to -36.57% on the downside—with a two-thirds hit rate for green months and a median gain in the low double digits. December, by contrast, has produced both cycle tops and cycle bottoms despite a modest average, a reminder that average and median statistics can obscure the path risk that defines Bitcoin’s fourth quarter. Seasonality is not destiny, and the sample is limited. Still, the data-backed message is clear: as November approaches, Bitcoin’s historical pattern has been less about quiet trend continuation and more about variance—the kind that has marked both euphoric blow-offs and capitulation lows. At press time, BTC traded at $114,487.

Yet, every so often, a digital asset begins to show technical and fundamental signs of something far larger than an ordinary upswing. For XRP , those signs are emerging again, and the sentiment surrounding it has reached a fever pitch. Analysts and traders are increasingly pointing to what could be one of the most powerful phases in XRP’s market history. Cameron Scrubs Sparks Excitement with Bold XRP Prediction Prominent crypto trader Cameron Scrubs has ignited renewed enthusiasm within the XRP community following his latest post on X, where he declared that XRP is “about to go on a generational run.” Scrubs hinted that the current market structure is even “crazier than 2024,” implying that the token’s ongoing setup mirrors, if not exceeds, the explosive price behavior seen during last year’s rallies. His sentiment echoes a growing narrative among seasoned traders who see technical and macro alignment pointing toward a substantial breakout. XRP is about to go on a generational run… I literally can’t describe the feeling I get looking at this chart right now, it’s even crazier than 2024. Onward! — Cameron Scrubs (@imcameronscrubs) October 27, 2025 Technical Indicators Signal a Major Upside XRP’s recent price behavior reflects growing momentum. The token has established a clear pattern of higher lows, indicating sustained buying pressure despite periodic corrections. Analysts note that the $2.70 resistance level remains the key threshold to watch — a decisive breakout above this zone could open the floodgates for an extended rally toward the $3.50–$4.00 range. Volume dynamics have also shifted notably. On-chain data and order book analysis suggest that institutional and algorithmic traders are increasingly active in XRP markets, with large limit orders accumulating below key resistance points. This pattern historically precedes major price expansions when liquidity is forced upward. Institutional Momentum Strengthens Ripple’s Position Beyond market charts, Ripple’s recent business moves have reinforced confidence in XRP’s long-term utility. The completion of the Hidden Road acquisition, now rebranded as Ripple Prime, expands Ripple’s reach into institutional prime brokerage — integrating XRP and its RLUSD stablecoin for real-time settlements and collateral management. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This development effectively gives institutional investors direct access to regulated, on-chain liquidity infrastructure powered by XRP. Such accessibility positions Ripple as one of the few blockchain firms capable of bridging traditional finance with digital asset liquidity — a critical element for sustained market adoption. Legal Clarity and Capital Inflows Fuel Optimism Following years of courtroom uncertainty, the Ripple vs. SEC case has now concluded, removing one of the largest regulatory overhangs in crypto history. With both parties withdrawing their appeals and the appellate court approving the withdrawals, XRP has regained its status as one of the most legally transparent digital assets in the U.S. This clarity has reignited institutional interest. Multiple XRP-focused investment vehicles have begun accumulating the token at scale, demonstrating that large entities are positioning for long-term exposure rather than speculative trading. These developments have reintroduced significant liquidity into the ecosystem — a foundational driver for any sustained bull run. The Outlook: A Generational Opportunity in Motion If history is any guide, the convergence of technical readiness, institutional integration, and regulatory stability often marks the start of transformative market cycles. For XRP, those elements are now aligning. Cameron Scrubs’ conviction may reflect more than trader optimism — it underscores a broader realization that XRP’s infrastructure and utility are maturing precisely as the next wave of global digital finance adoption begins. Whether this truly becomes a “generational run” will depend on how quickly momentum turns into sustainable capital inflow. But for now, all signals point in one direction — onward.

The legal filings allege that Clearview AI has been illegally collecting the images and videos of European Union residents, violating GDPR. According to noyb, Clearview’s actions breach both civil and criminal provisions under Austrian law, meaning its company executives could face personal legal consequences, including potential jail time. Austrian privacy group files criminal complaint against Clearview An Austrian privacy rights group, noyb, announced on Tuesday that it has filed a criminal complaint against Clearview AI, accusing the U.S.-based facial recognition company of illegally collecting and processing images and videos of European Union residents. The group alleges that Clearview’s vast biometric database, which was built by scraping publicly available images from websites and social media platforms, violates the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ). “Clearview AI amassed a global database of photos and biometric data, which makes it possible to identify people within seconds,” Max Schrems, noyb’s founder and a well-known privacy advocate, said. “Such power is extremely concerning and undermines the idea of a free society, where surveillance is the exception instead of the rule.” Schrems previously led two landmark cases that struck down transatlantic data-transfer agreements between the EU and the U.S. He said that Clearview’s continued disregard for EU rulings and unpaid fines is due to regulators struggling to enforce sanctions or collect penalties. AI firm faces multiple GDPR battles across Europe Clearview AI, which mainly markets its 60-billion-image database for facial-recognition tools to law enforcement agencies, has long defended its practices, claiming that it only gathers publicly available data. However, authorities in France, Greece, Italy, and the Netherlands have found Clearview in violation of GDPR for scraping and storing the biometric data of millions of EU citizens without consent. Together, these countries have imposed nearly €100 million ($116.62 million) in fines. Clearview also faced a U.S. class-action lawsuit, which was settled in March over similar accusations of unauthorized data scraping. In the United Kingdom, Clearview is currently contesting a £7.5 million fine issued by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). The company argues that the UK’s GDPR does not apply because its services are provided only to foreign law enforcement agencies and the company operates outside British jurisdiction. In October, a UK court dismissed Clearview’s first appeal, ruling that its facial-recognition system does indeed fall under the jurisdiction of the UK GDPR because clients use it to identify individuals and analyze behavior. The case is now set to return to a lower tribunal, although Clearview still has the option to seek permission to appeal the jurisdiction ruling. Clearview has maintained in previous statements that its technology operates within legal boundaries. Still, critics argue that the company’s technology poses major risks to privacy and civil liberties because it enables mass surveillance without oversight or consent. Get seen where it counts.

Coinbase , one of the largest and most trusted crypto exchanges globally, has officially announced the upcoming Coinbase DBR listing . This development is generating significant buzz, promising new opportunities for traders and potentially boosting the visibility and liquidity of the DBR token. For anyone keen on expanding their digital asset portfolio, understanding the implications of this listing is absolutely crucial. What Exactly is DBR, and Why Does This Coinbase DBR Listing Matter? DBR, or Dola Borrowing Right , is a unique token associated with the Dola Finance ecosystem. It grants holders the right to borrow the DOLA stablecoin from the protocol, effectively acting as a utility token within its decentralized finance (DeFi) framework. Its core purpose is to facilitate borrowing and lending activities, making it an integral part of the Dola Finance infrastructure. The significance of a Coinbase DBR listing cannot be overstated. When a major exchange like Coinbase adds a new asset, it typically leads to several positive outcomes: Increased Accessibility: Millions of new users gain easy access to DBR, simplifying the process of buying and selling. Enhanced Liquidity: More traders mean higher trading volumes, which generally leads to more stable prices and easier execution of large orders. Greater Visibility and Credibility: A Coinbase listing acts as a stamp of approval, often increasing a project’s perceived legitimacy and attracting institutional interest. Unpacking the Benefits of the Coinbase DBR Listing for Traders For individual investors and traders, the Coinbase DBR listing presents several potential advantages. Firstly, it offers a fresh avenue for diversification within their crypto holdings. As DBR has a specific utility within the DeFi space, it can appeal to those looking for tokens with fundamental use cases beyond pure speculation. Moreover, the increased exposure from Coinbase often results in significant price movements, both before and after the actual listing. Savvy traders might look for opportunities to capitalize on these fluctuations. However, it is always important to approach such events with a well-researched strategy, as volatility can cut both ways. What makes this particular Coinbase DBR listing interesting is DBR’s role in the broader DeFi landscape. Its connection to the Dola Finance protocol means that its success is intertwined with the stability and growth of that ecosystem.

Monitor Market Sentiment: Keep an eye on crypto news and social media for community sentiment surrounding the Coinbase DBR listing . Remember, while listings on major exchanges can bring significant gains, they also come with inherent risks. The market can be unpredictable, and prices can move rapidly in either direction. Always invest only what you can afford to lose.
