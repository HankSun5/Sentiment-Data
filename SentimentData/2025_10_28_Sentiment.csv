53713893,https://cryptonews.com/?p=443930,1761604200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53713893.jpeg,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of SOL, XRP, BNB by the End of October 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/chinas-deepseek-ai-predicts-the-price-of-sol-xrp-bnb-by-the-end-of-october-2025/,"DeepSeek AI—which has recently been proclaimed the most popular chatbot online for crypto trading after turning $10,000 into $22,500 in just nine days—now predicts that Solana, XRP, and BNB could set major new highs while this quarter is still young. The optimism comes despite the abrupt end of the “Uptober” rally after former President Donald Trump announced sweeping 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, rattling global markets and triggering one of the sharpest single-day crypto sell-offs in recent years. As the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting nears, investors have turned cautious, awaiting potential signals of monetary easing. Nonetheless, crypto dab hands read the pullback as a constructive reset that removes excess leverage and sets the stage for renewed momentum. Solana (SOL): DeepSeek Predicts a New All-Time High Solana ($SOL) continues to cement its role as a top-tier smart contract platform, boasting almost $110 billion in market capitalization and over $11.7 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its DeFi ecosystem. Source: DeepSeek AI Speculation is mounting that a U.S. spot Solana ETF could soon be approved, potentially drawing institutional inflows akin to those seen after Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches. With its exceptional transaction speeds, minimal fees, and growing relevance in stablecoin and real-world asset tokenization, Solana remains one of the most adoption-ready blockchains in the market. Following a January peak of $250 and a dip to $100 in April, SOL now trades around $202, with an RSI of 52 and climbing as it appears to be starting a new major rally after growing 2% in the last 24 hours. After breaking from a bullish flag formation, DeepSeek estimates Solana could climb as high as $1,200by month-end, possibly quarupling its previous record of $293.31. Given there’s only four days left of the month, it’s certainly a stretch target, but perhaps China’s most intelligent crypto trading chatbot knows something we dont? XRP ($XRP): DeepSeek Sees a Potential Run Toward $10 DeepSeek AI’s predictive models indicate Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could experience a strong rally, rising between $5 and $12 by year-end, potentially more than quadrupling its current value $2.69. Ripple’s landmark legal victory against the SEC earlier this year ended a multi-year battle, restoring investor confidence and propelling XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 in July. Over the past year, XRP has soared 415%, quadrupling both Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance during the period. Multiple bullish flag patterns forming in 2025 signal growing upward momentum. Upcoming catalysts, such as ETF approvals, new enterprise integrations, or global regulatory clarity, could send XRP beyond $5, with $12 serving as a stretch target in an aggressive bull scenario. Binance Coin (BNB): DeepSeek AI Predicts Expanding Market Dominance Initially launched as a utility token for Binance, Binance Coin ($BNB) has evolved into a core component of a vast ecosystem encompassing NFTs, decentralized applications, and payment platforms. BNB’s deflationary token burn program continues to reinforce long-term price stability by gradually reducing circulating supply. Beyond Binance’s ecosystem, BNB’s growing acceptance across retail, travel, and gaming sectors has strengthened its position among the world’s top five cryptocurrencies by market cap. Earlier this month, BNB broke out of a bullish pennant, hitting a record $1,369.99 before correcting 17% to $1,148. Should bullish sentiment resume, DeepSeek AI projects an advance toward $1,800, or even as high as $2,500, with key support between $580 and $1,000 if a sudden downturn occurs. Maxi Doge (MAXI): The Next-Gen Meme Coin With Degen Appeal Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , the newest sensation in the meme coin space, has kicked off its presale, already raising over $3.7 million from eager investors hoping to ride the next viral wave. Branded as Dogecoin’s pumped-up degen cousin, Maxi Doge embraces the humor, energy, and chaos of crypto’s degen culture, fostering a vibrant community through memes, contests, and social engagement. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI offers faster, cleaner, and more efficient transactions than Dogecoin’s legacy network. Of its 150.24 billion total supply, 25% is allocated to the “Maxi Fund” for marketing, partnerships, and ecosystem development. Staking is live, offering up to 80% APY, decreasing as more users join.

53713860,614540,1761604248,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53713860.jpeg,Ripple Prime: How The Company Just Set A Major Record That Boosts The XRP Ledger,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-prime-boosts-the-xrp-ledger/,"Ripple has announced the completion of its acquisition of Hidden Road, officially rebranding the global non-bank prime broker as Ripple Prime. This is a historic moment for the company, as it makes the payment firm the first crypto-based company to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime brokerage platform. The acquisition is also a major record that significantly expands Ripple’s institutional presence and further improves the XRP Ledger’s ecosystem through new integrations and utility for the company’s stablecoin, RLUSD. Ripple Prime Acquisition To Boost The XRP Ledger In a recent post on the social media platform X, Ripple announced that it has completed the acquisition of Hidden Road. The company’s acquisition of Hidden Road positions it as a pioneer in combining traditional finance with digital assets at scale. Hidden Road is one of the fastest-growing prime brokers in the world. The company offers a range of institutional services such as clearing, financing, and brokerage across foreign exchange, digital assets, derivatives, swaps, and fixed income. Now that the rebranding to Ripple Prime is complete, the new name embodies the payment firm’s strategy to build the foundation for institutional digital asset adoption. One of the most significant outcomes of Ripple Prime’s launch is its impact on the adoption and utility of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. According to the company’s announcement post on its website, RLUSD is now being actively used as collateral for several prime brokerage products. Derivatives clients have begun holding their balances in RLUSD, and this is expected to keep growing with institutional confidence. Ripple emphasized that RLUSD’s regulatory compliance and governance framework have made it one of the most trusted stablecoins in the market. Earlier this year, Bluechip rated RLUSD as the number one stablecoin for stability, governance, and asset backing, assigning it an A grade. The firm further reinforced its institutional credibility by appointing The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) as RLUSD’s primary reserve custodian. At the time of writing, RLUSD is the 12th biggest stablecoin in market cap, with a $902 million market cap, now inching towards the billion-dollar mark. The Firm’s Expanding Institutional Footprint And Future Outlook Ripple Prime is part of the company’s expansion strategy to capture a notable share of the global financial market. The company’s acquisition of Hidden Road makes it its fifth acquisition in two years. The acquisition trend started with the purchase of Metaco in May 2023, and then the purchase of Standard Custody in June 2024. Since then, the payment firm has continued to strengthen its institutional offerings with acquisitions like Rail in August 2025 and GTreasury just last week. Each acquisition has been strategically done in order to upgrade Ripple and XRP’s position as the leading provider of enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. “As we continue to build solutions towards enabling an Internet of Value – I’m reminding you all that XRP sits at the center of everything Ripple does.” CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in a post on X.",Ripple|BNY Mellon|Brad Garlinghouse|Hidden Road|Metaco|ripple|ripple news|Ripple Prime|RLUSD|stablecoin|The Bank of New York Mellon|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|WALLET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-27 22:30:48
53714042,https://cryptonews.com/?p=443810,1761604500,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53714042.jpeg,"Bullish Crypto to Buy Today, October 27 – Pi, XRP, Virtuals",https://cryptonews.com/news/bullish-crypto-to-buy-today-october-27-pi-xrp-virtuals/,"Though initially bullish, early October’s so-called “Uptober” rally in the crypto market proved short-lived. Prices reversed sharply just days later after President Trump announced a sweeping 100% tariff on Chinese imports. Now all eyes are on the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting this week, where traders will be expecting proof that the US central bank is switching to more dovish economic policies. Despite the recent downturn, many analysts regard the dip as a natural phase of consolidation meant to flush out excess leverage and weaker hands before the mother of all bull runs. Here are three highly bullish altcoins that could go to the moon if and when the next crypto bull run takes off. Pi Network ($PI): Could the Bullish Mobile Crypto Mining Pioneer Hit $1 Before 2026? Pi Network reshaped the digital currency landscape by introducing a “tap-to-mine” system that allows users to earn tokens directly from their mobile devices, with no costly mining rigs or significant energy consumption required. Currently, Pi’s RSI sits a 55, which is above neutral and indicates some buying momentum that raised the price of the token 12% in the last 24 hours as it shows the first sign of a potentially rapid recovery. A falling wedge pattern identified earlier in 2025 signals the potential for a breakout before year-end. Should bullish sentiment return, Pi could climb to $1 by Christmas, quadrupling from its current price of around $0.24 and reaching its highest level in seven months. The Pi development team continues to push toward version 23, a milestone update expected to pave the way for the long-awaited mainnet debut. If this rollout catalyzes user adoption, the token could aim for $2.50 during the next market uptrend. With its user-friendly interface, dedicated Layer 1 blockchain, and rapidly expanding community, Pi Network stands poised to capture significant momentum as mainstream crypto usage accelerates globally. Ripple (XRP): Positioned to Lead Global Payments in 2025 Ripple’s native asset, XRP ($XRP) , powers a fast, low-cost payment system designed as a next-generation alternative to traditional networks such as SWIFT. With strategic partnerships including the UN Capital Development Fund and major U.S. financial institutions, XRP has solidified its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market value, currently exceeding $158 billion. The introduction of Ripple’s own stablecoin, RLUSD, underscores its intention to claim a sizable share of the expanding stablecoin industry. Over the past year, XRP has skyrocketed 415%, peaking at $3.65 in mid-July, a level unseen in seven years, while Bitcoin climbed just 70% over the same span. Currently, with a relative strength index (RSI) near 54 and having now converged back with it 30-day moving average, XRP has locked in recent gains ahead of the next breakout. Chart analysis reveals two bullish flag formations over the summer, implying further room for upside if ETF approvals land soon. Passage of comprehensive U.S. crypto legislation could further propel XRP toward the $5–$10 zone. Virtuals Protocol: Democratizing AI Ownership Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) is redefining what it means to own artificial intelligence. Built on blockchain, the project enables anyone to create and invest in autonomous AI agents, digital beings that can think, act, and earn across games, social platforms, and virtual worlds. Each AI agent has its own “Agent Token,” paired with VIRTUAL as the base asset. Holders of VIRTUAL can stake tokens to support new agents, share in their economic output, and take part in shaping the protocol’s governance. As agents generate revenue, a portion cycles back into buy-backs and burns of VIRTUAL, driving scarcity and long-term value for holders. In this ecosystem, your digital counterpart doesn’t just represent you; it can work , earn , and grow alongside you, presenting a rare opportunity to invest in the next frontier of AI-powered digital economies. In the last 24 hours, Virtuals rose 12%, keeping in step with Pi as the smart money rotates into smaller-cap altcoins ahead of the next gold rush. Virtuals is currently oversold with an RSI of 72, so some short-term depreciation may happen as traders collect recent profits, but this will consolidate Virtuals’ position. Snorter ($SNORT): A Meme Coin with Real Utility and a Promising Presale Snorter ($SNORT) is a new presale that has just wrapped up, netting over $5 million in the course of five months. It’s both a meme coin and a trading bot, in an offering that combines entertainment value with genuine trading utility.

Das Unternehmen mit Verbindung zu den Trump-Brüdern setzt auf langfristiges Wachstum. Trotz der unsicheren Märkte bleibt die Firma optimistisch, dass Bitcoin weiter steigen wird. Während andere Unternehmen vorsichtig bleiben, geht American Bitcoin aufs Ganze. Das von Eric und Donald Trump Jr. unterstützte Unternehmen hat seine Bestände erneut vergrößert. Damit zeigt die Firma deutlich, dass sie an eine starke Zukunft der bekanntesten Kryptowährung glaubt – auch wenn der Markt schwankt. American Bitcoin kauft wieder groß ein American Bitcoin (ABTC) hat 1.414 neue BTC erworben – im Wert von rund 163 Millionen US-Dollar. Das teilte das Unternehmen am Montag mit. Insgesamt besitzt ABTC nun 3.865 BT im Gesamtwert von etwa 446 Millionen Dollar. Diese wurden sowohl durch Käufe als auch durch eigene Mining-Aktivitäten gewonnen. JUST IN: Trump Family's American Bitcoin buys 1,414 Bitcoin worth $163 MILLION pic.twitter.com/1hQjpdvy3N — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) October 27, 2025 Die Firma hat ihren Sitz in Miami, Florida, und ist eine Tochter des kanadischen Unternehmens Hut 8 Corp. American Bitcoin ist erst seit April aktiv und wird von Eric Trump und Donald Trump Jr. unterstützt. Ihr Ziel: Bitcoin als langfristige Anlage etablieren und die eigene Position am Markt ausbauen. Bitcoin steigt wieder über 115.000 Dollar Der Preis lag am Montag bei über 115.500 Dollar – so hoch wie seit zwei Wochen nicht mehr. Damit scheint sich die Kryptowährung etwas vom jüngsten Rückgang erholt zu haben. Das bisherige Rekordhoch liegt bei rund 125.000 Dollar, das im August erreicht wurde. Analysten sehen die aktuelle Erholung auch als Folge besserer Handelsaussichten zwischen den USA und China. Viele Anleger hoffen nun, dass sich der Aufwärtstrend fortsetzt. Auch andere digitale Währungen legten leicht zu. Aktie von ABTC legt deutlich zu Die Aktie von ABTC stieg um über elf Prozent auf rund 6,20 Dollar. In den Wochen zuvor war sie unter sechs Dollar gefallen, weil der Kryptomarkt allgemein schwächelte. Nun scheint das Vertrauen der Anleger zurückzukehren. Viele Marktbeobachter loben die mutige Strategie des Unternehmens. Dennoch warnen einige, dass das Risiko groß bleibt, wenn der BTC-Kurs erneut sinkt. ABTC setzt dennoch weiter auf Expansion – und damit auf den Erfolg der eigenen Überzeugung. Vorteil durch eigenes Mining Laut Firmenchef Asher Genoot unterscheidet sich ABTC von anderen Investoren, weil das Unternehmen selbst BTC produziert. „Wenn wir unsere Coins direkt minen , können wir sie günstiger erzeugen als beim Einkauf am Markt“, erklärte Genoot. Dieser Ansatz hilft, die Kosten zu senken und langfristig unabhängiger zu werden. So will das Unternehmen auch in schwachen Marktphasen Gewinne sichern. Das macht ABTC zu einem der aktivsten Player im Bereich der Krypto-Treasuries. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Trump-Unternehmen setzen auf Wachstum American Bitcoin entstand, als die Trump-Brüder ihr eigenes Unternehmen mit Hut 8 fusionierten. Kurz danach folgte der Zusammenschluss mit Gryphon Digital Mining. Durch diese Fusion wurde ABTC zu einem wichtigen Akteur in der nordamerikanischen Mining-Branche. Mit dem Schritt will das Unternehmen nicht nur investieren, sondern auch die Zukunft der digitalen Finanzwelt mitgestalten. Der Name Trump sorgt dabei für zusätzliche Aufmerksamkeit – und für Diskussionen über die Rolle großer Investoren im Kryptomarkt. Krypto-Unternehmen im Aufwind Immer mehr Firmen weltweit legen ihre Ersparnisse in BTC an. Laut bitcointreasuries.net haben über 200 Unternehmen mittlerweile eigene BTC Reserven. Den Anfang machte Strategy (früher MicroStrategy) , das schon 2020 auf BTC setzte und heute rund 73 Milliarden Dollar in BTC hält. Strategy meldete am Montag ebenfalls einen neuen Kauf: 390 BTC für 43 Millionen Dollar. Diese Nachricht stärkte das Vertrauen vieler Anleger, dass der Kryptomarkt trotz Schwankungen weiter wächst. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Optimismus bei Anlegern bleibt groß Laut einer Umfrage von Myriad glauben mehr als 70 Prozent der Befragten, dass BTC bald wieder 120.000 Dollar erreichen wird. Nur wenige erwarten einen Rückgang auf 100.000 Dollar. Diese Zuversicht teilt auch American Bitcoin. Das Unternehmen setzt weiter auf Wachstum, günstige Mining-Kosten und eine starke Marktposition. Trotz Risiken zeigt ABTC, dass Mut und Strategie im Krypto-Markt belohnt werden können. BTC Hyper: Wenn BTC immer stärker unterstützt wird Die USA zeigen sich zunehmend offen gegenüber BTC – große Unternehmen, Banken und sogar Teile der Regierung erkennen seinen Wert und seine Stabilität an. Diese wachsende Unterstützung sorgt dafür, dass BTC weiter akkumuliert wird und sein Preis langfristig stabiler wird. Doch während immer mehr Menschen und Institutionen Bitcoin halten, bleibt seine Nutzung im Alltag noch eingeschränkt. Genau hier kommt Bitcoin Hyper ins Spiel: Es nutzt die Sicherheit des Bitcoin-Netzwerks und kombiniert sie mit der Geschwindigkeit von Solana. So wird Bitcoin endlich schneller, günstiger und alltagstauglicher. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! $HYPER: Vom Halten zum Nutzen von BTC $HYPER ist der Motor von Bitcoin Hyper – der Token, der Transaktionen ermöglicht, Staking antreibt und den Zugang zu modernen Anwendungen schafft. Wenn BTC durch politische und institutionelle Unterstützung weiter wächst, entsteht auch mehr Bedarf, ihn wirklich zu nutzen. Hyper bietet dafür die Lösung: Es macht BTC nicht nur sicher, sondern auch praktisch einsetzbar.

Release Date Set For Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons , Combs is scheduled to be released on May 8, 2028. Combs was found guilty on two prostitution-related charges back in July of this year following a highly publicized trial that saw the rapper-turned-mogul acquitted on racketeering and sex trafficking charges. Combs, who was sentenced to 50 months behind bars on October 3, has also been ordered to pay a $500,000 fine and serve five years of supervised release. SBF Continues Appeal In Landmark Fraud Case Just last week, lawyers for Combs filed a notice to appeal in New York federal court in a bid to overturn his conviction and reverse his over four-year prison sentence. Meanwhile, Combs’ former jailmate, Bankman-Fried, is also appealing his 2023 conviction on fraud charges tied to his time as CEO of doomed crypto exchange FTX. Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for orchestrating the high-profile crypto scheme that saw FTX investors drained out of over $8 billion. Several former associates of the former “king of crypto” were also charged in connection with the digital asset scheme, including his former girlfriend-turned-Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Earlier this month, the disgraced FTX founder took to social media to allege that “Biden’s anti-crypto SEC/DOJ went after me” and had arrested him back in 2022 as a means of preventing his testimony on Capitol Hill the next day. gm @GETTRofficial https://t.co/GsY3bFkgKM — SBF (@SBF_FTX) October 15, 2025 “They had me arrested weeks before the crypto bill I was working on was set for a vote—and the night before I was set to testify before Congress,” a post on Bankman-Fried’s official Gettr account says. Bankman-Fried’s next hearing regarding his appeal is slated for November 3.

Bulls are attempting to build momentum for a potential impulse move higher, aiming to confirm a sustained bullish structure after the recent consolidation phase. Related Reading: Ethereum OG Drives $500M Liquidity Flow Into ConcreteXYZ & Stable Vaults – Details On-chain data continues to reveal a clear and repeating pattern tied to investor behavior and market cycles. Historically, when the percentage of Bitcoin supply in profit climbs above 95%, the market tends to enter an overheated phase, often leading to sharp corrections. These pullbacks serve as natural cooling periods, resetting sentiment and liquidity before the next major leg up. Interestingly, each correction cycle has shown consistent bottoming zones around the 75% threshold, where long-term holders reaccumulate and market confidence begins to rebuild. More specifically, data highlights profit supply lows of 73% in September 2024, 76% in April 2024, and a recent rebound from 81%, signaling a potential mid-cycle recovery phase. Bitcoin Supply in Profit Rises to 83.6% — Momentum Rebuilds Ahead of Key Threshold According to top analyst Darkfost, the percentage of Bitcoin supply in profit has started to climb again, currently standing at 83.6%. This steady rise indicates that a growing share of Bitcoin holders are once again sitting on unrealized gains — a trend that often reflects improving sentiment and renewed market confidence. Darkfost notes that this level can be interpreted as encouraging, suggesting that investors are willing to hold their BTC instead of realizing profits, anticipating further upside in the near term. Historically, such behavior has been characteristic of mid-cycle recovery phases, when fear starts to fade and accumulation resumes across both retail and institutional segments. This stage of the cycle is considered healthy for rebuilding momentum, as it allows the market to stabilize after large corrections. Holders who previously capitulated often reenter at this stage, while long-term participants strengthen their positions, creating a more resilient market structure. However, Darkfost cautions that once the supply in profit surpasses 95%, it typically signals overheated market conditions — a point where euphoria tends to replace rational conviction. In such phases, Bitcoin historically faces increased volatility and sharp corrections as overleveraged traders and short-term speculators take profits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase Signals Accumulation Before Next Growth Wave BTC Retests $115K Resistance: Bulls Regain Momentum Bitcoin (BTC) is showing renewed bullish momentum, trading around $115,443 and successfully reclaiming key short-term support levels after weeks of consolidation. The daily chart highlights a strong recovery structure, with BTC breaking above both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, signaling a shift in short-term market sentiment. The next critical test lies at $117,500, a historical resistance zone that previously rejected multiple attempts in September and early October. A clear breakout and daily close above this level would likely confirm an impulse continuation toward $120K–$125K, opening the door for a more sustained uptrend. Related Reading: Chris Larsen Cashes Out: $764M In XRP Profits Since 2018 Momentum indicators suggest strengthening buying pressure, while the recent bounce from the 200-day moving average near $107K underscores the market’s resilience. This level acted as a springboard for the current rally, aligning with the broader pattern of accumulation seen on-chain, where investor profitability is rising steadily. However, BTC remains within a range-bound structure, and rejection at $117.5K could trigger short-term consolidation back toward $111K–$112K. Overall, Bitcoin’s technical outlook appears constructive — if the bulls can sustain above $115K and confirm strength above $117.5K, the market could transition into a new bullish leg, supported by improving investor sentiment and on-chain health.

53715659,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87756,1761607821,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Expert Reveals Why Focuses on XRP,https://timestabloid.com/expert-reveals-why-focuses-on-xrp/,"Dom Kwok, co-founder of EasyA, recently argued that XRP offers a stronger chance of achieving a 100x price increase than Bitcoin (BTC). His position emerged during a community discussion, where he addressed comments from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, who had dismissed claims that leading crypto assets such as BTC and Ethereum (ETH) have become too expensive for retail investors. Bitcoin and Ethereum are Becoming Out of Reach Kwok countered Armstrong’s remarks by stating that Bitcoin and Ethereum have reached price levels that limit participation from everyday investors. With Bitcoin trading around $115,000 and Ethereum near $4,230 , he noted that the cost of owning a whole unit of either asset is now beyond what most people can afford. This, he said, is one reason EasyA’s focus has shifted toward alternative cryptocurrencies. He explained that new investors generally think in terms of the number of tokens they can own, not just the percentage increase they might earn. actually, $BTC and $ETH ARE too expensive for most people. this is why we focus on the alts so much @easya_app . https://t.co/23nizbLqf0 — Dom “Fish Head” | EasyA (@dom_kwok) October 19, 2025 For instance, someone entering the market with $1,000 would rather acquire a larger amount of a lower-priced coin than purchase a small fraction of Bitcoin. This preference, he noted, continues to drive the popularity of altcoins and broadens overall crypto participation. Kwok emphasized that affordability and psychological factors play major roles in investor behavior. While Bitcoin remains dominant, he argued that the growing demand for altcoins like XRP reflects a shift toward assets that appear more attainable. Why Kwok Believes XRP Offers Higher Upside Following Kwok’s comments, community member Daniel Harris supported the view that XRP provides greater return potential. Harris illustrated his point by comparing a hypothetical investment of $1,000, at a Bitcoin price of $120,000, that amount would buy only 0.0083 BTC, while at $2.60 per XRP, it would secure 416.67 XRP. He then questioned which investment would yield more value over the next three years, suggesting his confidence lay with XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Kwok agreed with Harris’s reasoning, arguing that XRP’s lower price gives it more room for growth relative to Bitcoin. However, community analyst Eri challenged the argument, clarifying that returns depend strictly on percentage gains, not the number of tokens owned. She noted that if both assets rise by 100%, investors earn the same percentage return, regardless of price per coin. Kwok maintained his position, contending that while the mathematical principle is correct, probability favors XRP. He reasoned that a 100x increase from $2.40 to $240 is statistically more feasible than Bitcoin climbing from $100,000 to $10 million. Historical Data Supports Volatility Difference Market data appears to support Kwok’s point regarding growth potential. During the November 2024 market rally, Bitcoin gained 59%, rising from $68,770 to $109,356 by January 2025. In the same period, XRP surged 580%, climbing from $0.50 to $3.40. Similarly, between late June and July 2025, Bitcoin advanced 22%, while XRP appreciated 83%, again showing its tendency to outperform during bullish cycles. Analysts attribute this to XRP’s smaller market capitalization, which allows sharper price movements both upward and downward. While experts disagree on the factors determining long-term performance, Kwok’s perspective underscores a broader sentiment among investors seeking high-growth assets. His argument highlights how accessibility, price psychology, and market structure influence investment choices. Though XRP’s higher volatility presents greater risk, it also provides a stronger short-term potential for outsized returns compared to Bitcoin’s more stable but slower-moving growth trajectory.

The fraudulent scheme uses fake emails that appear to come from Booking.com, inviting recipients to a non-existent “Exclusive Crypto Travel Summit” in Dubai. A Deceptive Invitation The phishing attempt, which Ong shared on social media, presented itself as a legitimate conference announcement, with the fake email claiming that Booking.com and Coinbase have formed a strategic partnership to launch a crypto travel service. It listed an impressive roster of keynote speakers, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, for an event supposedly happening in November 2025. A key red flag is that the RSVP deadline for this future event was set in the past, for September 30, 2025, which pointed to recycled or hastily constructed scam content. Ong advised anyone receiving such an email to delete it immediately and urged Booking.com to escalate the issue to its security team. The official Booking.com account later acknowledged the issue in a reply to Ong’s post, saying, “We regret to hear that you are receiving fake emails,” and requested details via direct message to investigate. A Persistent Threat in Crypto This incident is not an isolated one but part of a wider pattern of scams targeting crypto users. In September, Binance issued two separate warnings about different types of fraud. In the first one, the exchange alerted the public about fake “listing agents” who were purportedly promising projects a spot on the platform for a fee. A few days later, company CEO Richard Teng detailed a phone scam where impersonators posed as customer support agents. He said that the fake helpers then guided users through changing their account’s API settings, a process that allowed the scammer to steal funds. The community’s reaction to Ong’s warning was one of recognition and frustration. One social media user, SkylineETH, commented on the increasing complexity of these schemes, writing, “appreciate the warning, these scams keep leveling up.” Another user, Kevin Lee, expressed a common concern, questioning if there was a better way to handle email security to avoid even clicking ‘unsubscribe’ links in suspicious newsletters. This sentiment was echoed by Ong, who noted that the adversarial nature of the crypto world requires people to carefully check every email they receive.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.6004 Market cap $636.84M Trading volume (24-hour) $14.86M Circulating supply 1.063B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3505 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.6225 24-hour low $0.5986 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 7.30% (High) 50-day SMA $0.6785 14-Day RSI 44.26 (Neutral) Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 51 (Neutral) Green days 17/30 (57%) 200-day SMA $0.7058 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: The daily trend weakens after rejection at $0.62, showing a fragile bullish structure. A short-term selloff under $0.60 could retest $0.585–$0.56 before bouncing attempts. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart Tezos (XTZ) currently trades at $0.5986 on October 27, dropping 2.52% for the day after testing the $0.62 resistance level. The daily Bollinger Bands show tightening volatility, with the middle band near $0.6084 acting as a pivot. A price rejection from that zone suggests that selling pressure may intensify if bulls fail to hold above $0.60. The lower Bollinger band near $0.5446 remains a potential downside magnet should momentum weaken further. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD line has turned slightly positive at 0.0048, yet the histogram shows waning bullish momentum, hinting at a possible crossover reversal if weakness persists. Meanwhile, the RSI at 40.42 leans toward bearish territory, implying sellers have regained short-term control after a mild recovery phase. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart reinforces near-term selling signals. After briefly holding above $0.61, Tezos has dipped to $0.599, falling under the Alligator’s green and red lines, which now tilt downward, a sign of weakening trend strength. The blue Alligator line, currently around $0.6056, now acts as immediate resistance. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI at 56.53 recently pulled back from overbought levels, signaling a cooling of bullish momentum before potential re-entry zones. The PVT also trends lower, reflecting declining volume participation during this dip. If the price sustains below $0.60, short-term sellers may push it to $0.59 or $0.585. A recovery above $0.606 could re-energize bulls, opening a path toward $0.62–$0.625. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6546 SELL SMA 5 $0.6434 SELL SMA 10 $0.6352 SELL SMA 21 $0.6354 SELL SMA 50 $0.6785 SELL SMA 100 $0.7502 SELL SMA 200 $0.7058 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6370 SELL EMA 5 $0.6622 SELL EMA 10 $0.7014 SELL EMA 21 $0.7448 SELL EMA 50 $0.7582 SELL EMA 100 $0.7328 SELL EMA 200 $0.7415 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos remains at a delicate turning point, as a sustained trade above $0.60 could invite a short-term rebound toward $0.62, but losing this level exposes it to another leg down toward $0.56. Momentum traders should wait for clearer confirmation before entering, as the market leans slightly bearish but is still structurally consolidative. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

PBC Governor Pan Gongsheng said at a conference in Beijing that the central bank will maintain its crackdown on domestic crypto activity and speculation, emphasizing that “the PBOC’s policies and measures to curb cryptocurrency-related risks remain effective.” According to Pan, the Central Bank will collaborate with law enforcement to crack down on relevant activities within mainland China, safeguarding economic and financial stability. China’s plan to closely monitor digital asset developments abroad comes as its Ministry of State Security warns that a foreign company is using crypto as a front to collect sensitive biometric information, including iris scans. It believes their activity will compromise individual privacy and national security. While the ministry did not name the specific firm, the described tactics are similar to those employed by World, the blockchain project founded by OpenAI’s Sam Altman. PBOC flags stablecoins as a global financial risk In its press release, China’s Ministry of State Security affirmed that biometric recognition technology has rapidly evolved, pushed by its effectiveness and convenience. Still, it cautioned that with the rise of biometric scans , there is the added risk of data leaks and misuse. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:c5864a60-a266-4164-8716-f54a5ef5582c-30"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-18"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> The ministry went on to cite examples of alleged data breaches, starting with a foreign company whose fingerprint-based payment platform was directly connected to its internal data system, allowing hackers to repeatedly gain access and steal personal information. Stablecoins remain a major concern, according to the governor, who notes that they “can’t meet the basic requirements like customer identification and anti-money laundering.” Stablecoins are “increasing the vulnerability of the global financial system and undermining the monetary sovereignty of some less developed economies,” Pan said, according to the report. Pan added that the PBOC will continue to closely monitor and evaluate the progress of stablecoin developments in overseas markets. Asia pushes ahead with regulated stablecoin launches The Governor’s comments came on a day when Japanese startup JPYC released what it described as the world’s first yen-backed stablecoin, also named JPYC, with plans to issue up to $66 billion-worth (10 trillion yen) of tokens over three years. South Korea’s first fully regulated won-backed stablecoin was released last month when digital custodian BDACS and Woori Bank jointly launched KRW1 on the Avalanche blockchain. Bank of China’s Hong Kong shares surged earlier last month on reports that it plans to apply for a license for its own stablecoin, and Standard Chartered has said it is exploring the idea. Many users are bullish about the growth trajectory of stablecoins, with a significant majority believing that the market cap for stablecoins will exceed $360 billion by February. Chinese firms are expanding into offshore stablecoin ventures, with Jack Ma’s Ant Group applying for the “ANTCOIN” trademark in Hong Kong, which covers stablecoins, token issuance, and transfers. Meanwhile, JD.com plans to seek overseas licenses to use stablecoins for cross-border B2B payments before extending this to consumers. “The role of Chinese regulators in shaping global stablecoin regulation has developed against a backdrop of relative financial stability and the absence of sanction-related pressure,” Ray Youssef, CEO of crypto app NoOnes, said He added that China’s stance on stablecoins, which in many ways mirrors that of the EU, could eventually shift in the opposite direction—similar to Russia, where the government now uses stablecoins and corporations for international payments and foreign trade. He also noted that the restrictions being introduced will not weaken Hong Kong’s position as a global financial hub, as Beijing has always relied on the city as a free economic sandbox that ultimately benefits the mainland Chinese economy.

This announcement was released on Monday, October 27, following reports that the US-based startup has signed deals for significant infrastructure initiatives that require a vast power supply. The situation illustrates a growing trend among large data centers in the US, which are vowing to push the boundaries of what is possible in the country, despite the electric grid already facing significant challenges. The development follows Apple’s announcement that it has begun shipping advanced AI servers from its factory in Houston, Texas. According to the Cupertino-based tech company, these servers play a crucial role in their pledge to invest approximately $600 billion in the US, particularly in advanced manufacturing, suppliers, and other initiatives. After this move, US President Donald Trump praised Apple’s decision and urged the tech giant, along with other technology firms, to expand their production operations in the United States. Sources close to the situation mentioned that the tech giant first shared its intention to create US servers in February this year before making significant moves later. *]:pointer-events-auto scroll-mt-[calc(var(--header-height)+min(200px,max(70px,20svh)))]"" dir=""auto"" data-turn-id=""request-WEB:3a662ddd-653c-4276-8dcd-24b26a4294a0-32"" data-testid=""conversation-turn-6"" data-scroll-anchor=""true"" data-turn=""assistant""> Commenting on the company’s success in the AI landscape, Apple Chief Operating Officer Sabih Khan said the new servers will power Apple Intelligence and Private Cloud Compute services, set to be unveiled soon. He added that Apple is already using its own silicon technology to run these Apple Intelligence servers . OpenAI emphasized that electrons are the new oil In a blog post dated Tuesday, October 28, OpenAI expressed that electricity is not just a utility but a crucial resource important for creating AI infrastructure that will enable them to maintain their leadership in the key technology. According to the tech company, leadership in the AI sector is as significant as electricity itself. Regarding its earlier recommendation on a solution to boost the US’s position in the AI race, OpenAI submitted an 11-page document to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, urging the country to focus on constructing approximately 100 gigawatts of new energy capacity each year. A gigawatt is a unit of power that measures large collections of AI chips. According to an analysis from a reliable source based on data from the Energy Information Administration, 10 gigawatts is approximately equivalent to the annual power consumption of around 8 million homes in the US. In terms of power capacity, OpenAI noted that China added approximately 429 gigawatts of new power capacity, while the US added only 51 gigawatts. Concerning this gap, the tech company cautioned that this difference is establishing an electron gap, putting the US at risk of lagging behind. “Electrons are the new oil,” OpenAI emphasized. Meanwhile, Nvidia made public its plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI as the AI lab aims to develop multibillion-dollar data centers while utilizing Nvidia’s AI processors. To achieve this, OpenAI stated that the company intends to construct and use Nvidia systems that require around 10 gigawatts of power. Nvidia’s CEO highlights the strong relationship between OpenAI and Nvidia During an interview in San Jose, California, Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang told a reporter that 10 gigawatts equals approximately 4 million to 5 million graphics processing units (GPUs). According to Huang, this figure is the total number they plan to ship this year. Notably, it is twice as much as last year. “This is a huge project,” Huang said during the interview, which was conducted alongside Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, and company president Greg Brockman. A source with knowledge of the situation hinted that Nvidia’s initial investment of $10 billion will be made after the first gigawatt is completed. Additionally, the investments will be made at current valuations; however, the source requested anonymity as the details are private. Following the report, shares of Nvidia surged by almost 4%, adding roughly $170 billion to the company’s market value and bringing its valuation close to $4.5 trillion. The partnership is massive in size, said Huang, offering further evidence of the strong relationship between OpenAI and Nvidia, two of the key players that have driven the recent growth in AI. Interestingly, the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs increased when OpenAI released ChatGPT in 2022, and OpenAI continues to rely on the company’s GPUs to develop its software and ship it to users.

With macroeconomics and digital assets increasingly intertwined, staying ahead of these signals is more important than ever. A Tipping Point at the Fed The spotlight falls on the Fed’s meeting scheduled for October 28–29, 2025, where a 25-basis-point cut to the federal funds rate (targeting 3.75-4 %) is widely expected. This move follows a September reduction and reflects the central bank’s efforts to address a softening labour market alongside stubborn inflation. But with the US government shutdown hampering access to key jobs data, the Fed is steering into unfamiliar terrain, with analysts warning of a “dirty windshield” on policy decisions. Why this matters: A rate cut typically injects liquidity, weakens the U.S. dollar, and creates favorable conditions for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. But it also raises the specter of economic weakness, if the Fed cuts into a downturn, markets may quickly pivot from enthusiasm to caution. Economic Indicators & Market Sentiment Behind the scenes, other data points are shaping the narrative. September’s Consumer Price Index rose by 0.3 % month-on-month and 3.0 % year-on-year, slightly below expectations, suggesting inflation is moderating. Meanwhile, reports highlight that important employment figures may be delayed due to the shutdown, increasing uncertainty in policy-making. For equity and crypto markets, this convergence means investors must calibrate risk appetite carefully. The Fed’s decision coincides with major tech earnings and global policy developments, adding complexity to what otherwise might be a straightforward easing narrative. Crypto’s Next Move: Bullish Tailwinds or Volatility Trap? The crypto market is keenly attuned to these macro shifts. Major digital assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum have already ticked higher ahead of the expected cut. Historical patterns suggest that easing cycles tend to favour crypto, but the stage today is more nuanced. According to an analysis, this isn’t a dramatic panic-cut environment like 2020, but rather a “blended scenario” where crypto may benefit over time if economic conditions remain stable. Key pointers for crypto investors: A weaker dollar after rate cuts supports crypto inflows. The Fed’s tone, and whether it signals further easing or caution, can trigger sharp swings. If the labour market or inflation surprises on the upside, risk assets may face correction rather than rally.

53716494,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87758,1761609623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Analyst: Cardano (ADA) Will Retire A Lot of Us, Here’s Why",https://timestabloid.com/analyst-cardano-ada-will-retire-a-lot-of-us-heres-why/,"Crypto commentator OxManuel has expressed strong optimism about Cardano’s long-term potential, suggesting that the project’s growth trajectory could bring substantial financial returns to current investors. In a recent post on X, he described Cardano as a network with the potential to transform the financial status of its holders, arguing that it is only a matter of time before this value is fully realized. Assessing Cardano’s Current Position As of the latest data, Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.6741 , giving it a market capitalization of approximately $24.17 billion. The asset ranks as the 10th-largest cryptocurrency and has recorded very modest gains, about 0.88% within the last week. According to OxManuel, this valuation leaves significant room for upward movement. He reasoned that a 10-fold price increase from current levels would place Cardano’s total valuation around $240 billion, with each ADA token worth about $6.80. This would represent a new all-time high for the network and, in his view, generate enough financial upside for many long-term holders to achieve financial independence. Cardano $ADA will retire a lot of us It's only a matter of wen $ADA at 10x is only 240 billion market cap pic.twitter.com/QN5pBBhGib — OxManuel (@ManuelOnchain) October 26, 2025 Evaluating the 10x Projection To assess whether such an increase could truly allow holders to retire, it is useful to consider the potential returns on investment. The financial threshold for retirement varies widely based on lifestyle and location. For individuals in regions with lower living costs, a retirement fund of around $500,000 could be sufficient, while residents of more expensive cities may require $1 million or more. Under OxManuel’s projection, an investor would need to hold roughly $50,000 worth of ADA at the current price to reach a $500,000 portfolio if the token appreciates tenfold to $6.80. That amount translates to approximately 73,500 ADA today. Conversely, accumulating $1 million under the same conditions would require an initial stake of $100,000, or about 147,000 ADA at current prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This calculation demonstrates that a 10x rally could provide substantial returns for those with meaningful holdings, though it would not guarantee financial independence for every investor. Market Opinions on ADA’s Potential Cardano has attracted a wide range of price projections from market analysts and influencers. In September 2025, well-known analyst Ali Martinez predicted that ADA could climb to around $6.25 before the end of the ongoing market cycle, describing the current trend as the early stage of a potentially strong rally. Other figures in the Cardano community have made even bolder forecasts. Longtime Cardano advocate Dan Gambardello has suggested that ADA could reach $7.50 during this cycle, outlining an exit strategy for holders looking to take profit during such a move. In a separate analysis, he also argued that a $10 price target remains realistic, citing the project’s historical growth patterns and expanding ecosystem as key factors. While the exact timeline and extent of Cardano’s future growth remain uncertain, the increasing confidence among analysts reflects a strong belief in the project’s fundamentals. Should ADA approach the projections set by OxManuel and others, many early investors could see significant wealth gains. Nonetheless, as with all crypto assets, the outcome will depend on broader market conditions, adoption trends, and Cardano’s continued ability to deliver on its development roadmap.

A surge in demand tied to privacy, cross-chain integration and bold market calls are pushing ZEC into the spotlight. Related Reading: $10K Is Coming: Arthur Hayes’ Zcash ‘Vibe Check’ Sparks 30% Moonshot Rally Driven by Privacy Narrative and Major Price Call Zcash’s recent rally is nothing short of dramatic. In the past month, ZEC’s price surged roughly 380 % and smashed through its May 2021 closing level of around US$319. This breakout has drawn fresh attention to the coin’s core value proposition, transaction anonymity, at a time when regulatory scrutiny and surveillance concerns are rising globally. Adding fuel to the fire, Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of BitMEX, publicly predicted that ZEC could ultimately reach US$10,000. Markets responded swiftly; within 24 hours of Hayes’s “vibe check” post on X, ZEC jumped over 30 %. The privacy-coin resurgence appears well underway. Meanwhile, technical analysts argue the rise is more than hype. ZEC’s chart now showcases breakout patterns, rising volumes, and a shift in smart-money positioning. However, caution remains. Many analysts note that although the price is reflecting a strong narrative, actual usage of shielded transactions remains limited. ZEC's price trends to the upside on the daily chart. Source: ZECUSD on Tradingview Zcash (ZEC) Ecosystem Integrations Add Strength Behind the price action lies concrete ecosystem development. Zcash integration into other chains, such as its wrapped version on Solana, is reviving interest, while new solutions seek to restore ZEC’s full privacy features across cross-chain networks. For example, the project Encifher is enabling encrypted versions of ZEC (eZEC) using fully homomorphic encryption on Solana so that users can transact privately while still engaging with DeFi. Other catalysts include the anticipated halving event, which is due to cut miner rewards in mid-November, tightening supply. Added to that, institutional frameworks such as the debut of a trust vehicle for ZEC are reportedly expanding exposure. All told, these structural shifts support the narrative.

But what if there was a simple tool to gauge this collective emotion? Enter the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a powerful indicator designed to provide a snapshot of market sentiment. Currently, this crucial index stands at a neutral 50, a slight dip from yesterday but maintaining its balanced stance. This neutral position invites us to look closer at what drives market emotions and how investors can navigate these fluctuating sentiments. What Does a Neutral Crypto Fear & Greed Index Really Mean? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits at 50, it signifies a state of equilibrium. The scale ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed). A neutral reading means neither fear nor greed dominates the market. It suggests that investors are not making decisions based on overwhelming emotion. Instead, they might be waiting for clearer signals, or perhaps the market is consolidating before its next significant move. This neutrality can be a period of indecision, where both bulls and bears are holding their breath. For savvy investors, it presents a unique opportunity to reassess strategies without the pressure of extreme market conditions. Decoding the Metrics: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The reliability of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index comes from its comprehensive methodology. It doesn’t rely on a single factor but aggregates data from various sources to paint a holistic picture of market sentiment. According to Alternative.me , the platform that calculates this index, six key factors contribute to its score: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them to average values. High volatility often signals fear. Trading Volume (25%): Analyzes current trading volume and market momentum. High buying volume in a rising market indicates greed, while selling volume in a falling market points to fear. Social Media Mentions (15%): Scans social media for crypto-related keywords and analyzes their sentiment. A surge in mentions, especially with positive sentiment, can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): Gathers investor sentiment through weekly polls. (Note: This component is currently paused.) Bitcoin’s Market Cap Dominance (10%): An increasing dominance of Bitcoin often suggests fear, as investors might be fleeing altcoins into the perceived safety of BTC. Google Search Volume (10%): Tracks Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” might indicate fear, while “buy Bitcoin” suggests greed. Each of these components provides a valuable piece of the puzzle, contributing to the overall Crypto Fear & Greed Index score and offering a nuanced view of market psychology. Navigating the Neutral Zone: Actionable Insights for Investors When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is neutral, it’s not a signal to panic or to rush into impulsive decisions. Instead, it’s a moment for thoughtful consideration and strategic planning. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Vigilant, Not Complacent: A neutral reading doesn’t mean the market is stagnant. It’s a temporary balance that can shift quickly. Continue to monitor market news and price movements. Deep Dive into Research: Use this calmer period to research promising projects, understand their fundamentals, and assess their long-term potential without the distraction of extreme price swings. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you’re looking to invest, a neutral market is an excellent time to implement or continue a DCA strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount regularly, reducing the impact of volatility. Re-evaluate Your Portfolio: A neutral market provides a stress-free environment to review your asset allocation. Ensure your portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals. This balanced state of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a valuable window for investors to refine their approach and make data-driven decisions. Beyond the Numbers: The Broader Impact of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The significance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index extends beyond individual investment decisions. It serves as a powerful barometer for the collective psychological state of the cryptocurrency market. Understanding this broader context can provide a competitive edge. Historically, extreme readings on the index have often preceded significant market reversals. For instance, periods of extreme fear (low scores) have frequently been followed by market bounces, while extreme greed (high scores) often signals an impending correction. While not a definitive predictor, it highlights the importance of contrarian thinking. The main benefit of this index is its ability to help investors avoid emotionally driven decisions. By presenting a quantifiable measure of sentiment, it encourages a more rational and disciplined approach to the volatile crypto landscape. However, it’s crucial to remember that the index is just one tool among many; it should always be used in conjunction with fundamental and technical analysis. Summary: Embrace the Equilibrium The Crypto Fear & Greed Index holding at a neutral 50 is a compelling reminder that the crypto market is a dynamic interplay of data and human emotion. While not as dramatic as extreme fear or greed, this balanced state offers a unique opportunity for investors to practice discipline, conduct thorough research, and refine their strategies. Embracing this equilibrium allows for a more measured and informed approach, helping you navigate the exciting yet unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies with greater confidence. Use this period to your advantage, making decisions based on analysis rather than sentiment alone. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the current sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. It ranges from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), providing an aggregated view of how investors are feeling. How is a neutral reading (like 50) interpreted?

Their growing adoption, however, has also highlighted a pressing need for robust oversight. South Korea is now taking a decisive and significant step in this direction. A new bill is set to be proposed in the National Assembly, aiming to bring these digital assets under the country’s existing Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. This move represents a crucial development in South Korean stablecoin regulation , signaling a proactive approach to managing the evolving digital financial landscape. Understanding the Proposed South Korean Stablecoin Regulation What exactly does this proposed legislation entail? According to Yonhap News, Lawmaker Park Seong-hoon of the People Power Party is sponsoring an amendment to the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act . The core of this proposal is to legally define stablecoins as a ‘means of payment’ under Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the act. This simple yet profound reclassification places stablecoins on the same regulatory footing as traditional government notes, banknotes, and coins. Legal Definition: Stablecoins will be recognized as a legitimate ‘means of payment’. Regulatory Parity: They will be subject to the same rules as conventional currencies. Legislative Effort: This move seeks to close existing legal gaps. This specific proposal for South Korean stablecoin regulation aims to ensure that these digital assets operate within a clear, established legal framework, preventing their use in unregulated or illicit financial activities. Why is South Korean Stablecoin Regulation Becoming a Priority? The impetus behind this urgent stablecoin regulation is multifaceted, primarily driven by concerns over financial integrity and consumer protection. As stablecoins gain traction, so too does the potential for their misuse. The proposed bill is a direct response to the risks associated with an unregulated stablecoin market, which could be exploited for various illicit activities. Preventing Illicit Activities: A primary goal is to combat money laundering. Combating Tax Evasion: The regulation will make it harder to evade taxes using stablecoins. Closing Legal Loopholes: It addresses ambiguities in current financial laws regarding digital assets. Ensuring Financial Stability: By integrating stablecoins into existing frameworks, the government aims to mitigate systemic risks. This proactive approach by South Korea reflects a growing global trend among regulators to bring digital assets under stricter supervision, ensuring transparency and accountability in the rapidly evolving digital economy. The absence of clear rules has long been a challenge, and this move provides much-needed clarity. What Are the Broader Implications of This Stablecoin Regulation ? The new South Korean stablecoin regulation could have significant implications for both the domestic and international cryptocurrency markets. For users, it offers a heightened sense of security and legitimacy, knowing that their stablecoin transactions are backed by legal oversight. For stablecoin issuers and related businesses, however, it will introduce new compliance burdens and operational requirements. Potential Benefits: Increased Trust: Greater confidence among users and institutions in stablecoin transactions. Enhanced Consumer Protection: A clearer legal recourse in case of disputes or fraud. Market Integration: Smoother integration of stablecoins into the broader financial system. Potential Challenges: Compliance Costs: Stablecoin issuers may face significant costs to meet new regulatory standards. Innovation Impact: Some fear that stringent rules could stifle innovation in the crypto space. Market Dynamics: The regulatory shift could alter market liquidity and the competitive landscape for stablecoins in South Korea. Balancing these benefits and challenges will be crucial as the legislation moves forward, shaping the future of digital finance in the region. How Does South Korean Stablecoin Regulation Compare Globally? South Korea is not alone in its pursuit of comprehensive stablecoin regulation. Jurisdictions worldwide are grappling with how to effectively oversee these digital assets. The European Union, for instance, has introduced its landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, which includes extensive provisions for stablecoins. In the United States, discussions are ongoing, with various proposals aimed at defining and regulating stablecoin issuers. This global push highlights a shared understanding among policymakers that stablecoins, due to their potential for widespread use and their peg to traditional currencies, require a distinct regulatory framework. South Korea’s move to categorize them under existing foreign exchange laws demonstrates one approach to this challenge, leveraging established legal mechanisms rather than creating entirely new ones. This proactive approach to South Korean stablecoin regulation positions the nation among the leaders in establishing a secure and regulated digital asset environment. A Future of Regulated Digital Finance The proposed bill for South Korean stablecoin regulation marks a pivotal moment for the country’s digital asset landscape. By formally recognizing stablecoins as a ‘means of payment’ and bringing them under the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act, South Korea is taking a decisive step towards enhancing financial stability and integrity. While it promises greater security and transparency, it also presents challenges for innovation and market participants. The outcome of this legislative effort will undoubtedly set a precedent for how other nations might approach the complex task of integrating digital currencies into traditional financial systems, paving the way for a more secure and regulated future for digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act ? The Foreign Exchange Transactions Act is a South Korean law that regulates transactions involving foreign currencies and international payments. Its purpose is to maintain stability in the foreign exchange market and ensure sound international financial transactions. Who is Lawmaker Park Seong-hoon ? Lawmaker Park Seong-hoon is a member of South Korea’s National Assembly, representing the People Power Party . He is the legislator proposing the bill to regulate stablecoins under the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. What are stablecoins ? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset or a basket of assets, such as fiat currency (e.g., the US dollar) or gold. They aim to combine the benefits of cryptocurrencies, like fast transactions and global reach, with the stability of traditional assets. Why are stablecoins being regulated differently from other cryptocurrencies? Stablecoins are often regulated differently due to their direct peg to traditional assets, which gives them a more direct link to the conventional financial system. This link means they can pose different risks, particularly concerning financial stability, consumer protection, and their potential use in illicit activities, necessitating specific regulatory frameworks. What are the main concerns driving this stablecoin regulation ? The primary concerns driving this regulation include preventing money laundering, combating tax evasion, and closing legal loopholes that could allow stablecoins to be used for illicit financial activities. Regulators also aim to protect consumers and maintain overall financial stability. Did you find this article insightful?

Imagine a world where your workweek is significantly shorter, allowing more time for personal pursuits, learning, or even delving deeper into the crypto market. This isn’t a distant fantasy, but a near-term reality, according to none other than Zoom CEO Eric Yuan. His bold predictions at the Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 conference offer a glimpse into an astonishing future where artificial intelligence doesn’t just assist us, but fundamentally redefines how we work, leading to a much-anticipated workweek reduction . Eric Yuan’s Vision: The Dawn of a Shorter Workweek At the prestigious Bitcoin World Disrupt 2025 conference, Eric Yuan , the visionary founder and CEO of Zoom, captivated attendees with his optimistic outlook on the future of work. His core message was clear: AI technology , particularly through the advent of intelligent assistants, is poised to usher in an era where a five-day workweek becomes a relic of the past. Yuan’s conviction stems from Zoom’s deep embrace of AI, a commitment he underscored by stating his investment focus as simply, “AI, AI, and AI.” This isn’t just a buzzword for Yuan; it’s the subject of multi-hour strategy meetings, reflecting a profound belief in AI’s potential to revolutionize how we interact, collaborate, and ultimately, achieve a better work-life balance. His insights provide a compelling narrative for how technology, often seen as demanding more of our time, can actually give it back. Zoom AI Features: Digital Twins and Enhanced Collaboration Central to Yuan’s vision are innovative Zoom AI features , most notably the “digital twin.” This groundbreaking concept allows an AI avatar to speak on your behalf, representing you in meetings and discussions. Yuan himself demonstrated this technology’s prowess by deploying his AI avatar during an earnings call with investors, showcasing its ability to push the “boundaries of communication.” Imagine a scenario where you can delegate routine, informational, or even initial negotiation calls to your AI counterpart, freeing up your precious time for strategic thinking or more complex tasks. Beyond digital twins, Yuan believes AI can significantly enhance Zoom’s broader suite of solutions, from online whiteboards to collaborative documents.

Consider email management: an AI assistant could check your messages, prioritize them, identify urgent communications, and even draft preliminary responses, ensuring you only focus on what truly requires your human touch. Another fascinating scenario involves complex business negotiations. Instead of executives spending hours in protracted Zoom calls, their digital twins could first “work together on the plan,” as Yuan suggested, refining proposals and identifying common ground before human intervention. This proactive AI assistance promises to cut down on unproductive time, allowing professionals to engage in more meaningful, high-level decision-making. The goal is to offload the repetitive and time-consuming, amplifying human capacity for creativity and strategic thought. Unlocking the Future of Work with AI Productivity The culmination of these advancements is a paradigm shift in the future of work , directly leading to increased AI productivity . Yuan’s ultimate prediction is that by automating and assisting with numerous tasks, “we do not need to work five days a week anymore, right?… Five years out, three days or four days [a week]. That’s a goal.” This vision suggests a future where efficiency gains from AI aren’t just about doing more, but about doing less of what’s mundane, and more of what truly matters. The implications are vast, promising a healthier work-life balance, reduced burnout, and potentially a surge in innovation as individuals gain more time for personal development and creative pursuits. This isn’t merely about technological advancement; it’s about reimagining human potential in an AI-augmented world. Benefits and Implications of an AI-Driven Workweek: Increased Efficiency: AI automates repetitive tasks, allowing humans to focus on strategic, creative work. Improved Work-Life Balance: A shorter workweek frees up time for personal interests, family, and well-being. Focus on High-Value Tasks: Professionals can dedicate more energy to problem-solving and innovation. Enhanced Collaboration: AI tools facilitate smoother, more intelligent team interactions.

Tillis, who serves on the Senate Banking Committee, warned that partisan trench warfare and the 2026 midterm elections could render digital asset reforms dead on arrival if action isn’t taken soon. The Senator’s remarks come at a crucial moment for the US crypto industry, which has long been yearning for clear federal guidance. Meanwhile, there is growing bipartisan momentum behind regulating digital assets. However, lawmakers remain split on issues such as market structure, stablecoin regulation, and the division of jurisdiction among financial regulatory agencies. If Congress is going to do anything with crypto, “it has to be done by the first part of January, February, or you’re done” in the session that runs through January 2026, Tillis said in an interview with Bloomberg earlier this week. It is a cautionary message that senators’ colleagues and increasingly restless industry officials are sounding with rising urgency, worried that election-year politics will drown out policy discussions. Campaigning for the 2026 elections will be in full swing next year, and there is little appetite among lawmakers to undertake intricate policy changes in how government funds are allocated. A high-profile bill potentially snared in the question is the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21)—which was a re-envisioned market structure bill passed by the House in July. It seeks to clarify where oversight authority rests with the SEC and CFTC, which in turn is expected to bring regulatory clarity for cryptocurrency exchanges and token issuers. The bill has not yet been approved by the Senate Banking Committee, of which Tillis is a member. And suppose they don’t act quickly, in a news cycle that’s crowded with other political priorities and an increasingly polarized Congress. In that case, there may be little to no legislative movement. Crypto progress gets bogged down in partisan gridlock and leadership delays Tillis’s comments were made as the US Congress was dealing with the fallout from a partial government shutdown that began on October 1, over how to fund healthcare and social spending programs. The shutdown has already led to several pieces of legislation being put on hold, among them the proposed CLARITY Act that would clarify digital asset classifications and effectively expand investor protections. House Speaker Mike Johnson has similarly held floor sessions hostage, raising questions about a Legislature that’s been hesitant to move in the best of times anyway. When the Senate is in session, numerous committees have a backlog of work, including upcoming nominations and bills that address crypto and fintech. The Responsible Financial Innovation Act — a Senate-approved crypto framework bill authored by Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis of the Senate Banking Committee, and a proponent for digital asset regulation for years — could be signed into law by 2026, according to Lummis. Yet in recent days, comments from Tillis suggest that the politics of this issue are shifting, and they are moving towards caution and delay . Meanwhile, change is afoot at key financial agencies, adding another layer of unpredictability. Crypto industry lobbies for Congress to act as foreign competitors race ahead Crypto industry leaders have been urging Congress not to delay much longer, cautioning that the US risks being overtaken by other jurisdictions with more streamlined regulations — such as the European Union, which has recently introduced its Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regime. The United States is leading, but there’s a risk it could fall behind in financial technology, according to Kristin Smith , the former chief executive of the Blockchain Association, who told Ms. Waters. Some of America’s largest corporations, such as Coinbase and Ripple, have intensified their lobbying efforts in Washington to forge a bipartisan deal. They claim companies are being driven offshore, and a lack of policy clarity is smothering investment in blockchain research. More broadly, consumer advocates and some Democratic lawmakers are concerned about investor protections and financial stability in the aftermath of high-profile collapses, such as FTX and Celsius. This has led to demands that we introduce a set of new rules and prudential standards before we enact any new legislation.

This critical assessment primarily stems from the company’s substantial Strategy Bitcoin reliance , coupled with weak capitalization relative to its risk profile and fragile U.S. dollar liquidity. This decision serves as a stark reminder of the inherent volatility and risks associated with heavy exposure to digital assets for corporate balance sheets. What Does a B- Junk Rating Mean for Strategy Bitcoin Reliance ? When S&P Global Ratings , one of the world’s leading credit rating agencies, assigns a ‘junk’ status, it signals a heightened risk of default. A B- rating is several notches below investment grade, indicating that the company is currently vulnerable and depends on favorable business, financial, and economic conditions to meet its financial commitments. For a company like Strategy, this rating can significantly impact its ability to borrow money, attract investors, and even conduct everyday business operations. Increased Borrowing Costs: Lenders will demand higher interest rates due to the perceived risk. Investor Hesitation: Many institutional investors are restricted from holding ‘junk-rated’ assets. Reputational Damage: A junk rating can signal financial instability to partners and customers. Why is High Bitcoin Exposure a Risky Strategy? S&P’s primary concern revolves around Strategy’s heavy Bitcoin reliance. While Bitcoin has shown immense growth potential, its price volatility is a double-edged sword for corporate treasuries. Companies holding significant amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets are directly exposed to these wild price swings, which can dramatically impact their financial health and liquidity. The agency specifically pointed to: Market Volatility: Sudden drops in Bitcoin’s value can erode a company’s asset base quickly. Liquidity Concerns: Converting large amounts of Bitcoin to U.S. dollars can be challenging during market downturns, affecting a company’s ability to meet short-term obligations. Capitalization Weakness: The fluctuating value of crypto assets can make a company’s capitalization appear strong one day and weak the next, complicating risk assessment. This isn’t an isolated incident; S&P Global Ratings previously assigned the same B- rating to Sky Protocol, indicating a growing trend of scrutiny for companies with substantial crypto holdings. Navigating the Challenges: What Can Companies Learn? The situation with Strategy highlights a critical challenge for businesses embracing cryptocurrencies: balancing innovation with financial prudence. While integrating digital assets can offer strategic advantages, it demands robust risk management frameworks. Companies need to consider the potential impact of crypto volatility on their core operations, cash flow, and overall financial stability. For businesses with significant Strategy Bitcoin reliance , proactive measures are essential: Diversification: Spreading investments across various asset classes to mitigate concentration risk. Hedging Strategies: Employing financial instruments to protect against adverse price movements. Stronger Liquidity Buffers: Maintaining ample U.S. dollar reserves to withstand market shocks. Transparent Reporting: Clearly communicating crypto holdings and risk management practices to investors. This rating serves as a wake-up call, emphasizing that while crypto assets present exciting opportunities, they also introduce unique financial risks that traditional rating agencies are now rigorously evaluating. A Critical Look at Corporate Crypto Exposure The decision by S&P Global Ratings to assign a junk rating based on Strategy Bitcoin reliance underscores a broader re-evaluation of corporate exposure to volatile assets. As more companies explore adding cryptocurrencies to their balance sheets, the standards for financial stability and risk management will undoubtedly evolve. Investors and stakeholders will increasingly demand clarity on how these digital assets are managed and what safeguards are in place to protect against market downturns. This isn’t about dismissing Bitcoin’s potential, but rather about ensuring that corporate financial health remains paramount. In conclusion, S&P’s B- junk rating for Strategy is a potent signal to the market. It highlights the significant financial risks associated with heavy Strategy Bitcoin reliance and calls for a more cautious and diversified approach to digital asset integration within corporate finance. Companies must prioritize robust risk management and maintain strong traditional liquidity to navigate the inherently volatile crypto landscape successfully. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a junk credit rating? A junk credit rating, also known as a speculative-grade or high-yield rating, is assigned by credit rating agencies like S&P Global Ratings to bonds or companies considered to have a higher risk of default than investment-grade entities. It indicates a greater chance the issuer will fail to meet its financial obligations. You can learn more about this on Wikipedia’s page on Junk Bonds . Why is Bitcoin reliance considered risky by S&P? S&P considers heavy Bitcoin reliance risky primarily due to the cryptocurrency’s extreme price volatility. Significant fluctuations can rapidly diminish a company’s asset value, impact its capitalization, and create liquidity challenges, making it harder to convert crypto assets to traditional currency to cover operational costs. This concept is often linked to Bitcoin volatility . Who is Strategy? In this context, Strategy refers to a specific company that received the B- credit rating from S&P Global Ratings. While specific details of the company ‘Strategy’ are not provided in the original report, the rating applies to its overall financial health and operational approach, particularly concerning its asset holdings. For general information on how companies manage their finances, you can refer to Corporate finance on Wikipedia . What are the implications for Strategy after receiving a junk rating? A junk rating can have several negative implications for Strategy, including higher borrowing costs, difficulty in accessing capital markets, potential restrictions for institutional investors, and reputational damage. It signals increased financial risk to all stakeholders and could hinder growth and operational flexibility. This relates directly to concepts of Credit risk . Are other companies facing similar ratings due to crypto holdings? Yes, the report mentions that S&P Global Ratings previously assigned the same B- rating to Sky Protocol, indicating a broader trend. As the cryptocurrency market matures, rating agencies are increasingly scrutinizing the financial stability of companies with significant exposure to volatile digital assets. This suggests that more companies with similar asset strategies might face similar evaluations. For background on general crypto protocols, see Cryptocurrency protocol on Wikipedia .

For many investors, understanding these shifts is crucial, especially when it comes to the battle between Bitcoin and altcoins. Recently, the Altcoin Season Index delivered a significant update, falling three points to a reading of 27. This drop isn’t just a number; it’s a crucial signal about the current state of the market and whether altcoins are truly in their prime. What Does the Altcoin Season Index Reveal? The Altcoin Season Index , provided by CoinMarketCap , is a vital tool for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. It helps us gauge whether the market currently favors altcoins or Bitcoin. But how exactly does it work? It analyzes the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins and wrapped coins are excluded from this analysis to provide a clearer picture. The performance of these top altcoins is then compared directly against Bitcoin’s performance. An “altcoin season” is officially declared when a substantial 75% of these top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over the 90-day period. A reading closer to 100 on the index signifies stronger overall altcoin performance, indicating a vibrant altcoin season. Conversely, a lower number, like the current 27, suggests Bitcoin is largely dominating. Why Did the Altcoin Season Index Drop to 27? The recent three-point decrease, bringing the Altcoin Season Index down to 27, indicates a noticeable shift in market sentiment. This suggests that fewer than 75% of the top altcoins are currently outperforming Bitcoin over the last 90 days. Several factors can contribute to such a decline: Bitcoin Dominance: Often, when Bitcoin experiences a strong rally, capital tends to flow from altcoins into Bitcoin, increasing its market dominance. Risk Aversion: During periods of market uncertainty or consolidation, investors might flock to Bitcoin, perceived as a safer asset compared to the often more volatile altcoins. Lack of Catalyst: A general absence of significant positive news or fundamental developments for a broad range of altcoins can lead to underperformance. Profit-Taking: After periods of altcoin gains, investors might take profits, rotating funds back into Bitcoin or stablecoins. Navigating the Market: Altcoins vs. Bitcoin Dominance Understanding the current standing of the Altcoin Season Index is crucial for making informed investment decisions. A low index score, such as 27, implies that Bitcoin is currently the stronger performer. This doesn’t necessarily mean altcoins are ‘bad’ investments, but it does highlight a prevailing market trend. For Altcoin Holders: This period might call for caution. It could be a time for re-evaluating portfolios, perhaps consolidating positions or looking for altcoins with strong fundamentals that might weather a Bitcoin-dominated phase better. For Bitcoin Enthusiasts: A lower index often correlates with periods where Bitcoin is leading the charge, potentially offering more stable gains or acting as a store of value. Diversification: Regardless of the index, maintaining a diversified portfolio is always a sound strategy. This balances exposure across different assets and reduces overall risk. What Challenges and Opportunities Does This Altcoin Season Index Present? A dip in the Altcoin Season Index brings both challenges and potential opportunities for savvy investors. While the immediate outlook might seem bearish for altcoins, it’s essential to look beyond the surface. Challenges: Increased volatility for many altcoins; slower growth or even declines for less established projects; difficulty in identifying outperformers when the broader market favors Bitcoin. Opportunities: Potential accumulation phase for strong altcoins at lower prices; focus on projects with upcoming mainnet launches, significant partnerships, or technological breakthroughs; opportunities for short-term trading strategies if volatility is high; re-evaluating fundamental analysis for long-term altcoin investments. The recent fall of the Altcoin Season Index to 27 serves as a clear indicator of the shifting tides in the cryptocurrency market. It signals a period where Bitcoin is asserting its dominance, prompting investors to reassess their strategies. While the allure of altcoin seasons is strong, understanding the underlying market dynamics, as reflected by this index, is paramount. Whether you’re an altcoin enthusiast or a Bitcoin maximalist, staying informed and adapting your approach is key to navigating the exciting, yet unpredictable, world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index is a metric that gauges whether market conditions currently favor altcoins or Bitcoin by comparing the 90-day price performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) against Bitcoin. 2. How is an “altcoin season” officially declared? An altcoin season is declared when 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped coins) outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. 3. What does a low Altcoin Season Index score, like 27, indicate? A low score, such as 27, indicates that Bitcoin is currently dominating the market, with fewer than 75% of altcoins outperforming it over the last 90 days. 4. Does a low Altcoin Season Index mean I should sell all my altcoins? Not necessarily. While it suggests Bitcoin dominance, it can also present opportunities for accumulating strong altcoins at lower prices. It’s crucial to reassess your portfolio and investment strategy. 5.

Bitcoin retraced roughly 12% from its yearly peak, while Ethereum fell below key support levels, placing short-term pressure on major assets. Yet, amid this correction, investor interest began to revive, driven by emerging narratives across AI, DeFi, memecoins, and decentralized perpetual exchanges. Sectoral growth and renewed speculative interest became the defining features of the quarter. HTX, a global leading exchange, recently released its Q3 report for HTX Select (formerly known as the “Crypto Gem Hunt”), revealing that 38 quality assets were listed during the quarter. Several of these tokens delivered multi-fold gains after listing, underscoring HTX Select’s role as a key driver of wealth creation for platform users. Quarter Highlights: ASTER and AVNT Lead the Performance Charts HTX Select’s official data showed that Q3 listings delivered robust results, across multiple sectors spanning memecoins, DeFi, AI, Layer 1 and Layer 2 infrastructure, and derivatives DEX. Standout performers such as ASTER, AVNT, and M recorded an exceptional price increase, significantly boosting trading activity and new user growth on the platform. DeFi and Perp DEX projects emerged as the quarter’s strongest sectors. ASTER , a next-generation decentralized perpetual futures and spot trading platform, captured wide attention among professional traders through its innovative “no-MEV, low-slippage” architecture. The platform’s native token surged 525% post-listing, positioning itself as a leading name in the on-chain derivatives segment. In the broader DeFi landscape, Avantis (AVNT) stood out with its algorithmic yield aggregation model, soaring more than 14x from its initial listing price and becoming the top performer on HTX in Q3. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) , focusing on decentralized asset management and yield-bearing debt markets, introduced a novel “liquidity bond pool” model. WLFI gained steady institutional traction throughout the quarter. Meanwhile, FUNToken (FUN) , rooted in Web3 entertainment, features gaming and decentralized payments with a gamified, AI-powered rewards system. FUN rose 166.7% within the last quarter, showcasing solid user engagement and stable growth. The memecoin and AI sectors also regained momentum. MEMECORE (M) demonstrated the enduring viral power of memecoins, rising 435% following its listing thanks to strong branding and social resonance. Sahara AI (SAHARA) aims at decentralized AI compute sharing and model training to build a decentralized AI ecosystem. SAHARA climbed 135.2%, benefiting from the global resurgence of AI narratives. Layer 1 infrastructure assets also maintained long-term potential. 0G is a high-performance modular blockchain featuring parallel execution and designed to support AI and DeFi workloads. The token rallied from 2.4 USDT to 6 USDT, a 150% gain after its debut on HTX. 2025 HTX Q3 – Top Gainers on HTX Refined Strategy: Positioning for the Next Market Cycle HTX continues to strengthen its reputation as the go-to platform for discovering new quality digital assets, staying true to its core philosophy of “ Buy New Crypto Only on HTX .” The exchange’s listing strategy remains centered on early identification, early exposure, and early participation, enabling users to seize early-stage project opportunities. Amid rising enthusiasm for Chinese-language memecoin projects, HTX secured the initial listing of the viral “ Binance Life ” token for spot trading and launched a dedicated Chinese market section, catalyzing a new wave of “Chinese narrative” momentum across the industry. Looking ahead to Q4, the platform expects to roll out TGE listings across several infrastructure projects such as MONAD, extending its leadership in early-stage listings. HTX remains committed to swiftly listing high-quality assets at the earliest opportunity, leveraging its professional selection mechanism to help users secure a first-mover advantage in the new market cycle. From the Crypto Gem Hunt to today’s HTX Select, the evolution represents more than a name change for HTX. The platform will continue to discover and curate promising crypto assets globally. As the market transitions into a new cycle, HTX remains committed to empowering users to capture the next wave of digital wealth creation.

And in this case, most of that liquidity does not seem to be going into blue-chip token initiatives but rather into soon-to-launch presale initiatives that offer more appealing short-term growth prospects. The one name that keeps recurring among investors as well as analysts is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rapidly expanding DeFi project already in Phase 6 of presale with over 75% of the tokens sold off already at $0.035 per token. Mutuum Finance is being talked about as the top crypto to buy as capital is moving away from legacy networks such as Cardano to next-gen DeFi platforms. Cardano (ADA) Experiences Whale Dump and Short-Term Weakness Cardano (ADA) faces severe selling pressure following on-chain data showing that whales dumped more than 350 million ADA, a development which has accelerated concerns of short-term weakness in the market. The selling comes with a noticeable drop in on-chain activity, giving further significant push to bear pressure already existing surrounding ADA. Though not all signals are negative, the pending Hydra 1.0 upgrade may ameliorate some of this downside risk by greatly enhancing scalability and network speed, hence reviving investor confidence. However, as ADA is weathering this stormy period, all but the most stalwart investors already are turning to alternatives elsewhere for more near-term upside, most notably towards newer opportunities such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is rapidly making waves as funds move into high-growth projects highlighted in crypto news. Presale Momentum Increases Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a favorite among investors in its phased presale model. Phase 6 is racing along rapidly with tokens at $0.035, a cheap entry point before a 14.3% increase to $0.04 in Phase 7. The initial iteration of the Mutuum Finance protocol for lending and borrowing is preparing to launch in Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025 with liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. The initial borrow and lend support will be ETH and USDT. Customers can stake in peer-to-contract pools to earn passive income or enter peer-to-peer markets for custom terms. mtTokens accrue interest and can be exchanged for the amount, offering a two-layered system to ensure maximum flexibility and security. These risk-protection systems are highly sought by investors, making MUTM the top crypto to buy for short-term ROI. Millions of tokens have already been sold, which demonstrates strong investor interest and early liquidity formation before mainnet launch. This trend demonstrates further holders in favor of the Mutuum Finance roadmap and vision for providing real utility rather than hype speculation. Mutuum Finance Buybacks to Power Price It is among the most powerful long-term growth drivers by the buy and distribution mechanism on the platform, whereby fees are utilized to purchase MUTM tokens in the open market. Token redistribution is sent to mtToken stakers, which creates effective buying pressure as network demand rises. The token demand function is made a function of true utilization of the platform by the cycle model, stimulating holding and activity. These employ functions follow the path of top-performing projects like Chainlink (LINK) in 2021 and 2020, where there was unprecedented appreciation driven by demand for oracles in DeFi. MUTM prioritizes long-term sustainable returns over hype that may fuel even better performance with the maturing of the crypto news space. ADA Whales Sell 350M Tokens, Capital Flows Into MUTM Cardano (ADA) under selling pressure as whales dump 350M ADA, unleashing short-term bearishness. Most of this capital is headed to up-and-coming DeFi prospects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), confirming it as a top crypto to buy. Phase 6 presale MUTM is at $0.035, more than 80% sold, and $18M+ raised. Its two-pronged lending model and Q4 2025 Sepolia testnet deployment offer adaptability and passive return. Possessing 4 billion tokens in circulation and a buyback system that incentivizes stakers, MUTM has real utility and growth potential, making it the top crypto to buy as capital departs from ADA. For investors monitoring the crypto news, this is the prime opportunity to act.

While BTC struggles to stabilize after clearing key liquidity levels, ETH is attempting to reclaim crucial resistance, setting the stage for what could be the next major directional move in the crypto market. Market Weakness Persists After $116,000 Liquidity Sweep Can Özsüer, in his latest BTC 1H Current Chart update shared on X, highlighted that the hourly chart of Bitcoin shows little to no bullish reflection at the moment. He pointed out that market sentiment has weakened, particularly after the $116,000 liquidity zone was cleared, which further dampened the outlook across the broader crypto market. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Pre-Rally Setup: Holding The $3,600 Zone Could Spur An Upward Trend According to Özsüer, the overall setup remains fragile, and taking scalp long positions in such conditions could be risky until a clearer reversal structure begins to form. Özsüer identified the $111,000 level as a potential zone for an initial reaction buy, suggesting that some short-term support could emerge around this point. However, he cautioned that if this level fails to hold, Bitcoin could experience a sharper decline toward the trendline support near $109,000. He further advised that traders should construct their strategies carefully, focusing on the zones within what he referred to as “box number 1.” This area could provide a technical framework for identifying potential entry points and managing risk effectively. To conclude, Özsüer noted that the cleanest and safest approach would be to align trading plans around optimal price levels while ensuring that positions remain protected above the defined support structure. Bullish Momentum Builds If $4,200 Is Reclaimed While Bitcoin faces a potential drawdown, crypto analyst Ted Pillows revealed that ETH is currently engaged in a critical fight to reclaim the $4,200 resistance zone. The success of this immediate technical battle is crucial, as it will determine the asset’s trajectory in the days to come. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘True Bull Run’ May Yet To Begin — Analyst Explains Why Ted pillows outlined the condition for a continuation of the rally; if Ethereum is able to decisively reclaim and hold the $4,200 level, traders should “expect more bullish continuation.” Conquering this resistance would likely signal a clear path to the next higher price targets. Conversely, should ETH fail to secure the $4,200 zone, the price will likely retreat. The analyst predicts that this failure would trigger a necessary retest of the $4,000 level before the market can attempt any further upward moves, indicating that $4,000 acts as the crucial defense line against a deeper correction.

A recent report from South Korea paints a stark picture of these dangers, revealing that Kyunghyang Shinmun has highlighted a shocking trend: forced liquidations from domestic South Korean crypto loans have soared past 20,000 in just four months. This dramatic increase, triggered by sharp price declines, underscores the volatile nature of the crypto market and the inherent perils of leveraged lending. What’s Driving the Surge in South Korean Crypto Loans and Liquidations? The numbers are truly eye-opening. Data compiled from the office of Shin Jang-sik , a Rebuilding Korea Party lawmaker, illustrates a rapid expansion in the country’s crypto lending sector. Consider these facts: From June to September, the number of users engaging with South Korean crypto loans jumped from approximately 2,400 to a staggering 35,500. The total value of these loans skyrocketed tenfold, increasing from about 110 billion won ($81.5 million) to an astonishing 1.14 trillion won ($844.4 million) within the same period. Most critically, forced liquidations surged dramatically, from 574 in June to a peak of 17,299 in July alone. Understanding Forced Liquidations: A Core Risk of Crypto Lending So, what exactly is a forced liquidation? In simple terms, it happens when the value of the collateral you’ve put up for a loan falls below a certain threshold. Crypto loans often require users to deposit digital assets, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, as collateral to borrow stablecoins or fiat currency. If the market price of your collateral drops significantly, the lending platform automatically sells your assets to cover the loan, preventing further losses for the lender. This process, known as a margin call followed by liquidation, can lead to substantial losses for borrowers, often wiping out their initial investment. Why Are South Korean Crypto Loans Seeing Such Extreme Volatility? The rapid increase in forced liquidations among South Korean crypto loans can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market means prices can swing wildly in short periods. When major cryptocurrencies experience sharp downturns, as they have recently, the collateral backing these loans quickly loses value, triggering automatic sales. Secondly, the allure of high returns and the perceived ease of access to crypto lending platforms may lead some borrowers to take on excessive leverage without fully understanding the associated risks. Many users might be seeking quick profits or liquidity without selling their underlying assets, hoping to capitalize on potential price increases. However, this strategy can backfire dramatically during market corrections, leading to swift and painful liquidations. Furthermore, the burgeoning popularity of crypto in South Korea, coupled with a relatively nascent regulatory framework, could contribute to a landscape where risks are not always fully transparent or understood by all participants. Navigating the Challenges and Protecting Your Crypto Assets For individuals participating in the crypto lending space, especially those with South Korean crypto loans , understanding and mitigating risks is paramount. Here are some key considerations: Diversify Your Portfolio: Avoid putting all your assets into highly volatile cryptocurrencies. Understand Leverage: Be cautious with high leverage ratios, as they amplify both gains and losses. Monitor Market Conditions: Stay informed about market trends and be prepared for sudden price drops. Set Stop-Losses: Some platforms allow you to set automatic sell orders to limit potential losses. Choose Reputable Platforms: Research the security and transparency of lending services. Seek Financial Advice: If unsure, consult with a financial advisor who understands crypto investments. The recent surge in forced liquidations from South Korean crypto loans serves as a powerful reminder of the double-edged sword that is cryptocurrency lending. While offering opportunities for liquidity and potential gains, the inherent volatility and the risks of leverage demand extreme caution. As the market continues to evolve, both users and regulators must prioritize education and robust risk management to foster a safer and more sustainable digital asset ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions About South Korean Crypto Loans What is a forced liquidation in crypto loans? A forced liquidation occurs when the value of the cryptocurrency collateral you’ve provided for a loan drops below a specific threshold. The lending platform then automatically sells your collateral to cover the loan, preventing further losses for the lender. This process results in the borrower losing their collateral. Why have South Korean crypto loans seen so many liquidations recently? The surge in liquidations is primarily due to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. When crypto prices decline sharply, the value of the collateral backing these loans decreases, triggering automatic liquidations. High leverage and a desire for quick returns also contribute to increased risk. Who is Shin Jang-sik and what is their role? Shin Jang-sik is a lawmaker from the Rebuilding Korea Party in South Korea. Their office compiled and reported the data regarding the surge in forced liquidations from domestic cryptocurrency lending services, highlighting the growing concerns within the sector. How can borrowers protect themselves from forced liquidations? Borrowers can protect themselves by understanding the risks of leverage, monitoring market conditions closely, diversifying their crypto portfolio, and avoiding over-leveraging. Choosing reputable lending platforms and potentially setting stop-loss orders can also help mitigate risks. What is the Kyunghyang Shinmun ? The Kyunghyang Shinmun is a major daily newspaper in South Korea. It was the publication that initially reported on the significant number of forced liquidations from South Korean cryptocurrency lending services, bringing this critical issue to public attention.

53718211,614619,1761613238,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53718211.jpeg,SSR Oscillator Signals Liquidity Waiting To Enter Bitcoin – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/ssr-oscillator-signals-liquidity-enter-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin (BTC) remains in a consolidation phase following the October 10 market crash, with bulls now pushing prices back above critical resistance levels. The recovery toward the $115K region has renewed optimism across the market, as the monthly close approaches and traders anticipate a possible shift in momentum. According to several analysts, this phase may represent the calm before the storm, a typical pattern seen before large directional moves. On-chain data and liquidity metrics suggest that capital is accumulating on the sidelines, ready to rotate into Bitcoin once clear bullish confirmation appears. If BTC manages to break above its previous all-time high (ATH), analysts believe it could trigger a new impulsive phase, similar to the post-accumulation surges observed in earlier bull cycles. Funding rates remain stable, suggesting that leverage is still moderate — a positive sign for a potential sustainable rally. Furthermore, liquidity concentration near key resistance zones indicates that a decisive breakout could quickly attract institutional and retail inflows. As volatility compresses and the market digests recent shocks, Bitcoin appears to be building strength for its next major move, with liquidity and sentiment aligned for a possible bullish continuation into November. Bitcoin Liquidity Builds as Stablecoin Supply Ratio Hits Cycle Lows According to Glassnode data , the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) Oscillator remains near its cycle lows, signaling a period of high stablecoin liquidity relative to Bitcoin’s market capitalization. In simple terms, this means there is a substantial amount of buying power sitting in stablecoins — the digital cash reserves of the crypto ecosystem — waiting for the right moment to re-enter the market. Historically, such conditions have often preceded major bullish phases for Bitcoin. When stablecoin liquidity is high, it implies that investors are holding capital in readiness rather than fleeing the market entirely. Once market confidence strengthens, these reserves typically flow back into risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, creating a wave of bid-side pressure that fuels upward momentum. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading just above $115K, still recovering from the October 10 crash that disrupted short-term sentiment. Yet, despite recent volatility, liquidity indicators such as the SSR suggest that the market’s underlying structure remains healthy. Stablecoins now represent a significant portion of total crypto liquidity, and their abundance indicates that participants are positioned to buy the dip once conviction returns. Analysts interpret the current SSR trend as a bullish latent signal, reflecting a macro setup similar to those seen before previous expansion phases. If Bitcoin manages to stabilize and reclaim higher levels, the excess liquidity sitting in stablecoins could act as a catalyst for a strong impulse move, driving BTC toward a new cycle high. In this context, the SSR’s position near historical lows might represent not just a sign of caution, but an early signal that the next major liquidity-driven rally could already be forming beneath the surface. BTC Retests Resistance as Bulls Regain Control Bitcoin (BTC) continues its recovery, trading around $115,300 after a strong rebound from the $108K region earlier this month. The 12-hour chart reveals a clear upward structure forming, with bulls now challenging the $117,500 resistance level, a zone that has repeatedly acted as both support and rejection in recent months. BTC is currently trading above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, signaling renewed short-term strength, while the 200-day MA around $113K has turned into a solid support base. A sustained breakout above $117.5K could open the door for a move toward $120K–$123K, confirming a short-term impulsive phase and potentially restoring investor confidence after weeks of consolidation. Volume has been rising alongside price, suggesting genuine buying interest rather than speculative spikes. However, BTC’s momentum remains sensitive to macroeconomic factors and liquidity conditions. A rejection at this level could lead to another retest of $111K, maintaining the consolidation range. Overall, Bitcoin’s current technical structure looks constructively bullish. If price manages to close above $117.5K with strong volume, it would likely confirm the end of the post-crash stagnation and set the stage for a new leg higher, supported by improving liquidity and market sentiment.

The ETF is set to trade on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), marking a significant milestone for Solana, the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Bitwise confirmed news of the launch on X on Monday, calling it a “historic step” in bringing Solana into mainstream investment portfolios. BSOL will not only own Solana tokens directly but also stake them on-chain to earn extra yield from network rewards, the firm said. Bitwise anticipates that staking returns will yield approximately 7% per year, and rewards are automatically reinvested into the fund to enhance performance. Staking will be managed by Bitwise’s infrastructure partner Helius Technologies for reliability and regulatory compliance, according to the firm. The management fee of the ETF is 0.20%. However, Bitwise has stated that it will temporarily waive fees for an initial three-month period or until the fund reaches $1 billion in assets under management, whichever comes first. Analysts say BSOL’s fee structure and built-in staking feature could attract both institutional and retail investors seeking exposure to Solana’s ecosystem without the complexities of self-custody or the cumbersome process of staking directly. The launch is a game changer for digital finance, said Kristin Smith, president of the Solana Policy Institute. U.S. shutdown amplifies crypto ETP wave The launch of BSOL has arrived just as a new group of crypto-focused ETFs has begun to flood the U.S. market. Canary is also expected to list its Litecoin (LTC) and Hedera (HBAR) ETFs on Nasdaq on the same day, with the Grayscale Solana Trust ETF set to go live later in the week, according to reliable sources. The launches occur as a U.S. government shutdown drags on, which means the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) remains operational but with reduced staffing. Typically, the SEC’s staff vets and approves ETF filings, but under the shutdown plan, most are put on hold. Yet, the companies have managed to find legal means to move forward despite these limitations. Asset managers can file an S-1 registration statement without a delaying amendment, according to recent SEC guidance issued earlier this month, and their registration becomes effective automatically 20 days later. Due to this process, crypto ETF issuers such as Bitwise and Canary Capital have been able to move forward with their listings, even when the SEC was operating at a limited capacity. Pre-shutdown, the SEC had signed off on new listing standards to cover commodity-based trust shares across three large exchanges, a decision that basically paved the way for crypto ETFs. Investors position for Solana’s next growth wave The Bitwise Solana Staking ETF is more than just another crypto investment vehicle; it’s a bridge between decentralized finance and Wall Street. By incorporating staking into a regulated ETF wrapper, Bitwise is combining passive income streams with institutional-level access. So that investors can participate in Solana’s growth trajectory and yield potential without getting lost in the complexities of private key management or interacting directly with on-chain staking. It also paves the way for large institutions, which are typically held at arm’s length by compliance hurdles, to hold or stake cryptocurrencies directly. Solana has increased by more than 40% in the past month, driven by rising on-chain activity, a growing developer ecosystem, and increasing institutional demand. Analysts believe the BSOL launch contributes to the legitimacy of Solana as a top-tier blockchain network, particularly with the adoption of ETFs ramping up. Industry specialists say that Bitwise’s move could provide the catalyst for a wave of single-asset crypto ETF launches, similar to how Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs changed the digital-asset investment landscape earlier in 2021. As the crypto ETF environment continues to grow, issuers will find themselves even more competitive. Cheapness, stakeholder yield, and liquidity will determine what products capture investor attention. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

As the digital market heats up again, coins like FLOKI and Shiba Inu have been stirring massive excitement. FLOKI’s market cap pushes past $713 million while Shiba Inu trades near the $0.000010 range, teasing a 40% breakout potential. Yet, among these familiar names, a new contender is catching every bull’s eye – MoonBull. MoonBull presale’s fifth stage is live, offering an entry point that feels like catching lightning in a bottle. Crypto traders who missed early meme moonshots are calling this their “second chance” moment. With its structured $MOBU presale model, early investors could potentially see explosive returns as each stage climbs higher toward launch. MoonBull ($MOBU) Presale Ignites Investor Frenzy: The Best Meme Coin to Buy Under $1 MoonBull ($MOBU) isn’t just another meme coin chasing hype – it’s rewriting the rulebook. Built on Ethereum, it merges viral energy with tokenomics engineered for sustainability. That’s why so many believe it’s the best meme coin to buy under $1 today. The current MoonBull presale (Stage 5) is live at just $0.00006584, with over $500K already raised and 1500+ holders. The presale structure spans 23 stages, where prices rise gradually, making each stage scarcer than the last. Early birds stand in the sweetest spot. If someone invests $25,000 now, they could be sitting on nearly $2.3 million when the final listing hits $0.00616 – that’s real financial freedom, not peanuts. The current ROI already stands above 9256%, proving why investors are charging in like bulls before the gate closes. MoonBull’s ecosystem pumps value into liquidity, burns, and holder rewards. Two percent of every trade goes straight to liquidity, two percent to reflections, and one percent burns forever – a trio that keeps the market stable and rewards steady. Plus, the staking system offers a 95% APY, starting at Stage 10, where holders can stake, earn daily, and still keep full control. The $MOBU presale isn’t just a sale – it’s a movement. Voting Power: Every Holder’s Voice Counts MoonBull’s governance kicks off at Stage 12, where 1 $MOBU = 1 vote. This setup lets every holder shape campaigns, burns, and development choices directly. It’s democracy on the blockchain, pure and simple. With full transparency and a locked liquidity pool, MoonBull builds trust that’s rare in meme coin territory. That’s why the buzz is strong – the best meme coin to buy under $1 doesn’t just promise gains, it delivers participation. Floki ($FLOKI) Faces 78% Drop From All-Time High FLOKI, inspired by Norse legend and community-driven strength, remains a tough bull in a wild market. With its price currently around $0.00007365, FLOKI boasts a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $45 million. Its market cap stands at $713 million, ranking it #136 globally. While trading activity recently dipped by over 32%, FLOKI still holds strong support and massive engagement, proving its staying power amid market swings. The coin’s all-time high reached $0.0003449, meaning it’s trading about 78% below that level – but bulls know that also means room to run. FLOKI’s steady 14% rise over the past week outpaces much of the Ethereum ecosystem, hinting that momentum could be warming up again. For investors looking at the best meme coin to buy under $1, FLOKI still has the community might – but MoonBull’s presale energy may soon eclipse it. Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Price Action: 40% Breakout May Be Next Shiba Inu (SHIB) keeps its massive fanbase buzzing like penguins spotting fish in the ice. Currently trading near $0.00001018, SHIB shows strong range support between $0.00000950 and $0.00001000. Analysts expect a breakout toward $0.00001450, a potential 40% surge if the resistance at $0.00001250 cracks. The community engagement is booming again, with posts from Shib Spain sparking optimism across social feeds. Trading volume remains tight as sellers cool off and buyers accumulate. SHIB’s structure mirrors its previous accumulation cycles – the calm before a big moonshot. Yet, while Shiba Inu’s bullish chart draws eyes, MoonBull’s presale momentum and growth mechanics make it the best meme coin to buy under $1 for anyone chasing the next explosive wave. Conclusion Based on the latest research and market trends, both FLOKI and Shiba Inu display renewed strength. FLOKI’s recovery from a market cooldown shows resilience, while Shiba Inu’s tight support range hints at a bullish reversal ahead. Yet these coins, though powerful veterans, move at a steadier pace. In contrast, MoonBull’s live presale, with massive ROI potential, structured growth, and a community-driven model, positions it as the best meme coin to buy under $1 in 2025. MoonBull’s presale is lighting up crypto circles, offering a chance at financial transformation before the big launch. Stage 5 is the golden gate – once it’s gone, the prices rise. With its liquidity rewards, reflections, and staking APY of 95%, MoonBull presale is built for believers ready to ride the next moon wave. Don’t stand on the sidelines – join the herd before the stampede begins.

Realistically, no meme coin is close to hitting $1 soon because of their massive token supplies.

Its presale structure, deflationary tokenomics, and governance model offer a balanced mix of innovation and community empowerment. FLOKI and SHIB remain solid for traders who prefer established meme projects, yet MoonBull’s momentum suggests it could become the next breakout star. Will Pepe ever hit $1? Pepe Coin’s chances of hitting $1 are slim given its huge supply, but its popularity in 2023–2024 helped fuel the meme-coin revival. Still, new entrants like MoonBull are designed with more sustainable mechanics that could deliver stronger long-term growth under the best meme coin to buy under $1 category. What is the best crypto presale to invest in 2025? The MoonBull presale is currently one of 2025’s most talked-about crypto events.

53719063,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/crypto-casinos-face-new-uk-regulations-october-2025-compliance-updates-reshape-industry,1761614576,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/53719063.jpeg,Crypto Casinos Face New UK Regulations: October 2025 Compliance Updates Reshape Industry,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/crypto-casinos-face-new-uk-regulations-october-2025-compliance-updates-reshape-industry,"Recent investigations have revealed how crypto casinos have enabled money laundering in the United Kingdom. All efforts to stop such activities in the UK have proven fruitless, including stiff penalties that have been issued to mainstream gambling companies, citing anti-money laundering (AML) failures. While licensed and legal companies are transparent in their operations, most online crypto casinos are not held up to the same standard. Obviously, when playing on a casino site you want to have full assurance that it’s compliant with the law. The flipside is grim and risks you partaking in a fraudulent establishment, which risks not only funding an illegitimate entity, but also your actual money. The KYC, AML, and CDD are examples of requirements that are deliberately overlooked by rogue players, leaving the regulators with little legal refuge to administer oversight. The problem stems from the fact that, though the United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) is aware of the challenges and has asked casinos to allow the watchdogs to fully audit their operations if they seek to enter the market, no crypto casino has complied, and there hasn't been a single licensed crypto casino in the country just yet. Such casinos that operate in such a manner are not obligated to the regulator. The Agile Crypto Offshore Sector The investigation carried out by Betconix arrived at a not-so-surprising conclusion. As it's not breaking news that crypto gambling is attractive due to its decentralisation, which allows criminal activities and disreputable sources of funding to not be tracked as easily. While direct crypto deposits are prohibited, Neteller and Skrill are still exempted. In the meantime, offshore gambling platforms are confidently pushing their products more aggressively while offering local players “hotter offers”. While the UK has made significant strides in making the gambling industry safer, it faces the question that the industry in every country has to address: how do they beat the offshore market at its own game? So due to all these, regulators are ramping up different strategies to stop violations. In 2025, Spreadex, AG Communications, and TGP Europe faced penalties of over £1 million for anti-money laundering violations. New UK regulations for crypto casinos, which will take effect on the 31st of October 2025, require the following • Mandatory Deposit Limits for Customers: Crypto casino operators must motivate all new customers to set a financial limit before they make their first deposit. This regulation also ensured that customers must be able to easily review and change this limit at will. • Enhanced fund protection transparency: The terms and conditions of the casino must expressly state whether customer funds are protected in the event of insolvency, the level of protection, and the method used to achieve it. This information must be available for all customers to see when they make their first deposit. • Stricter AML and KYC procedures: The United Kingdom Gambling Commission (UKGC) has increased the level of scrutiny on AML. Crypto casino operators are now expected to function like financial institutions, with real-time, risk-based, and fully embedded AML systems, not just “box-ticking” compliance. This also includes verifying the source of the crypto funds that the individual intends to gamble with. • Increased enforcement: The United Kingdom Gambling Commission is increasing enforcement actions, with warnings that fines go as high as 15% of Gross Gambling Yield (GGY) for serious AML failures, and operators are being held accountable for not evolving their detection systems quickly enough. • Real Value Conversion: Operators are required to convert cryptocurrencies to their local fiat value in player accounts to provide greater transparency and mitigate the volatility risks that are associated with cryptocurrency price fluctuations. What this means for the industry These changes mean that UK crypto casinos must significantly and swiftly update their platforms and compliance procedures. The focus is shifting towards customer protection, financial transparency, and advanced fraud detection. In other words, treating crypto gambling operations with the same level of scrutiny as traditional financial services. What Operators Should Do To avoid losing their license or being fined, operators should: • Carry out regular risk profile appraisal through CDD & report to the licensing board.• Conduct a risk assessment for each third-party payment service provider they integrate.• Monitor and report any suspicious activity.• Be on the lookout for vulnerable players & report to the UK's Financial Intelligence Unit when needed.• Use closed-loop payment setups that make crypto transactions easier to follow Other Necessary Information • Crypto gambling is attractive for laundering due to decentralisation, anonymity, and quick fund movement.• Neteller and Skrill e-wallets are the only accepted platforms that the UKGC allows indirect deposit from. Direct crypto deposits are prohibited.• Offshore platforms exploit licensing loopholes to market unregulated casinos to UK users.• Operators face heavy fines for failing to verify player identities and transaction sources.• New regulations are underway as a response to AI-driven fraud.

Debopama Sen, Citi’s head of payments, said that corporate clients increasingly seek faster, programmable, and more efficient payment options available around the clock. “We’re exploring solutions to enable onchain stablecoin payments for our clients,” Sen said. “Stablecoins will be another enabler in the digital payment ecosystem and it’ll help grow the space, it’ll help grow functionality for our clients.” Stablecoins Becoming Central to Wall Street Strategy The move comes just months after the passage of the U.S. GENIUS Act, which established a legal framework for stablecoin issuance and operations, effective in 2027. Citi is joining other major financial institutions — including JPMorgan and Bank of America — that are developing or testing their own stablecoin-related services. Even JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, long critical of cryptocurrencies, recently confirmed that the bank “plans to be involved” in the stablecoin sector. Citi’s Market Forecast Reflects Rapid Growth In September, Citigroup sharply raised its projection for the stablecoin industry, forecasting a market size of up to $4 trillion by 2030 — a dramatic increase from the current valuation of around $315 billion. The stablecoin market’s growth has been explosive, expanding from less than $5 billion in 2020 to more than $315 billion today, according to DefiLlama data. Investor Enthusiasm Grows After Circle’s IPO Investor interest in the sector has surged following Circle’s public listing earlier this year. The USDC issuer’s shares jumped 167% on their debut, pushing its market capitalization to approximately $35 billion. With regulatory clarity and growing institutional participation, Citigroup’s upcoming stablecoin payment platform could mark the beginning of a new era for global finance — one where traditional banking and blockchain technology converge.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Press Releases|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-10-28 01:35:22

This announcement came after dYdX encountered an outage on October 10 caused by a misordered code process . According to dYdX’s post-mortem report, the outage was triggered by a “misordered code process” during a deployment, which halted the dYdX Chain for roughly eight hours. The downtime was prolonged by delays among validators restarting their oracle sidecar services, leading to stale price data once the network came back online. DYdX encounters a chain halt, interfering with its operation Decentralized exchange dYdX shared a report and an update with the community, outlining their intention to support traders who were victims of a chain halt that paused operations for several hours during the market crash last month. Although no on-chain funds were lost, the glitch caused dYdX’s matching engine to execute trades and liquidations at incorrect prices, leaving several traders with unexpected losses. Notably, the eight-hour outage occurred during the biggest liquidation event in crypto history. Consequently, the interruption led dYdX to suggest that the community handle reimbursements from its insurance fund. The decentralized exchange explained that when the chain started again, the matching engine handled trades and liquidations at incorrect prices due to outdated oracle data. Meanwhile, despite dYdX confirming that no user funds were lost on-chain, some traders encountered significant losses related to liquidations while the system was down. Regarding the situation, the dYdX governance community is set to vote on whether impacted traders should be compensated from the protocol’s insurance fund. This occurred after the crypto market experienced a crash that wiped out approximately $19 billion in positions, marking the largest liquidation event in crypto history. Apart from dYdX, this incident also challenged Binance’s trading services as the exchange experienced substantial price swings, user concerns, and regulatory scrutiny. Traders expressed dissatisfaction with Binance due to technical issues that prevented them from closing their positions. This involved issues with the interface that displayed multiple tokens with prices below zero and the depeg of Ethena’s USDe synthetic stablecoin. Binance commits $728 million to support investors affected by an outage Following the outage, sources noted that Binance did not accept responsibility for the losses incurred by traders. However, the cryptocurrency exchange developed a support initiative worth $400 million for those affected. This initiative comprises $300 million in token vouchers and $100 million for impacted participants in the sector. Regarding the token vouchers, eligible users were set to receive token vouchers valued between $4 and $6,000. To qualify, Binance set conditions for traders to have experienced forced liquidations on their futures or margin positions from Friday 00:00 UTC and Saturday 23:59 UTC. Moreover, users needed to have encountered a loss of at least $50 in crypto, and those losses should account for at least 30% of their total net worth. On the other hand, to support memecoin traders who suffered losses due to the crash, Binance also introduced a $45 million BNB token airdrop to boost market confidence. Overall, the exchange pledged $728 million to aid traders affected by the sell-off. Still, Binance claimed that it is not responsible for users’ losses.

A staggering 6,365 BTC, valued at approximately $727 million, recently moved from the prominent exchange Coinbase to an unknown new wallet. This significant movement, reported by Whale Alert , has ignited widespread speculation across the market. What could be the implications of such a massive Bitcoin transfer , and what does it tell us about the current state of the crypto landscape? Unpacking the Mysterious Bitcoin Transfer When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, it’s often referred to as a ‘whale’ movement. In the crypto world, ‘whales’ are individuals or entities holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market dynamics with their trades. Who are these whales? Their identities typically remain anonymous, thanks to the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions. Why is this important? Large movements of assets, especially from a major exchange like Coinbase, can signal upcoming market shifts, whether bullish or bearish. This particular Bitcoin transfer is noteworthy not just for its size but also for its destination: an ‘unknown new wallet.’ This adds a layer of mystery, prompting questions about the motives behind the move. What Drives Such a Massive Bitcoin Transfer? A substantial Bitcoin transfer like this can stem from various reasons, each carrying different implications for the market. It’s crucial to consider these possibilities rather than jumping to conclusions. Some common explanations for such large movements include: Institutional Investment: Large financial institutions often acquire Bitcoin directly from exchanges or through over-the-counter (OTC) desks and then move it to secure cold storage. Exchange Rebalancing: Exchanges themselves might move funds between their hot and cold wallets for security or operational purposes. Custodial Services: A large custodian might be consolidating funds or preparing for a client’s significant withdrawal. Preparations for Sale: While less common for such large amounts to move directly to an unknown wallet for immediate sale, it’s a possibility that a whale is preparing to offload a portion of their holdings. Understanding the potential drivers behind this Bitcoin transfer helps us gauge its true impact. Tracking Large Bitcoin Transfers: Tools and Transparency The ability to track these colossal movements, like this recent Bitcoin transfer , is a testament to the transparency inherent in blockchain technology. Services like Whale Alert continuously monitor public blockchains for significant transactions, providing real-time updates. However, while the transaction itself is public and verifiable, the identity of the wallet owner remains private. This dichotomy of transparency and anonymity is a core feature of cryptocurrency. For investors, tracking these movements offers valuable insights: It helps in understanding potential supply shocks. It provides clues about institutional interest or disinterest. It can sometimes precede significant price volatility. The journey of this 6,365 BTC highlights both the openness of the blockchain and the enduring mystery of its participants. Navigating the Implications of Major Bitcoin Transfers For everyday crypto enthusiasts and investors, a massive Bitcoin transfer can be a cause for both excitement and apprehension. It’s important to approach such news with a balanced perspective. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow reliable sources like Whale Alert for real-time data. Avoid Panic: Not every large transfer signifies a market crash. Many are for legitimate, non-speculative reasons. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Large whale movements primarily impact Bitcoin, but a diversified portfolio can cushion potential shocks. Look for Patterns: Over time, you might identify patterns in whale movements that correlate with market behavior. Ultimately, this Bitcoin transfer serves as a reminder of the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency markets. In conclusion, the movement of 6,365 BTC from Coinbase to an unknown wallet is more than just a large transaction; it’s a significant event that underscores the evolving landscape of digital assets. While the immediate implications remain a subject of debate, it highlights the growing institutional involvement, the power of blockchain transparency, and the continuous need for vigilance in the crypto space. Such substantial movements are a regular feature of a maturing market, reminding us of Bitcoin’s enduring value and the watchful eyes of the crypto community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “whale” in the context of cryptocurrency? A: In cryptocurrency, a “whale” refers to an individual or entity that holds a very large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. Their transactions, like a significant Bitcoin transfer , can have a substantial impact on market prices and sentiment due to the sheer volume of assets they control. Q2: How do services like Whale Alert track these movements? A: Whale Alert and similar services continuously monitor public blockchain ledgers for transactions that exceed a certain threshold. Since all transactions on a public blockchain are recorded and visible, these services can detect and report large movements in real-time, even if the identities of the senders and receivers remain pseudonymous. Q3: What is Coinbase and why is its involvement significant? A: Coinbase is one of the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency exchanges globally, particularly popular in the United States. Its involvement in a large Bitcoin transfer is significant because it’s a major gateway for both retail and institutional investors, suggesting the transaction likely originated from or passed through a highly liquid and regulated environment. Q4: Does a large Bitcoin transfer always mean a price drop? A: Not necessarily. While some large Bitcoin transfer events can precede price volatility, they don’t automatically signal a price drop. As discussed, many reasons for such transfers are benign, such as moving funds to cold storage for security, institutional rebalancing, or OTC deals. The market’s reaction often depends on the context and prevailing sentiment. If you found this analysis insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

The push to launch digital asset funds by institutional players comes amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown. The Canary Capital LTC and HBAR funds are expected to launch this week; however, the exact timeline has not yet been confirmed. Preparations are being made to establish the funds this week despite the shutdown, since the SEC’s contingency plan permits only a handful of employees to address emergencies, including ETF approvals. Balchunas expects Canary Capital LTCC and HBAR ETF approvals this week Canary just filed 8-As for Litecoin and HBAR ETFs joining Bitwise who filed one for Solana.

Stay tuned.. pic.twitter.com/4lj8NPn9s7 — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 27, 2025 According to an S-1 filing submitted by Canary earlier this month, each fund will include a 0.95% management fee. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas argued that the fee was higher compared to existing spot Bitcoin ETFs. Balchunas also acknowledged that it’s typical for funds entering newer or more specialized markets to have steeper fees. He argued that if there are flows, the issuers will no doubt come and fill the sector with cheaper products. Canary Capital revealed that the proposed ticker symbols are HBR for the Hedera ETF and LTCC for the Litecoin ETF. “Canary just filed 8-As for Litecoin and HBAR ETFs joining Bitwise who filed one for Solana. These are the ones rumoured to be poss looking to launch (along w Grayscale Solana) this week despite shutdown. Not a done deal but clearly preparations being made. Stay tuned.” – Eric Balchunas , Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the current government shutdown, market optimism about a potential Litecoin ETF launch remains high. On the Polymarket market predictions platform, traders have assigned an 88% probability of the ETF getting approved by the end of 2025. Once a Litecoin ETF is approved, it could mark a major milestone for Litecoin, potentially reinforcing market demand and initiating a price rally. At the time of publication, Litecoin is exchanging hands at around $102.47, up 3.15% in the last 24 hours. LTC has also surged by more than 8.7% in the past 7 days, but has dropped 2.3% in the last 30 days. Polymarket also gave a 60 to 80% chance of an HBAR ETF approval by the end of the year. Hederal is now included in six U.S. ETF filings, including Grayscale, Canary, REX-Osprey, and KraneShares, and others, signaling that institutional adoption is near. The Nasdaq has also previously filed a Form 19b-4, which is required for the listing and trading of shares of the HBAR fund once it is approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The agency had pushed the ETF’s review date to November 8 to provide additional time for the SEC to conduct its administrative reviews and internal assessments. Earlier last week, Hedera’s chief policy officer, Nilmini Rubit, was invited by the Institute of International Finance to accompany their delegation at Nasdaq’s Ring the Bell ceremony. Hedera acknowledged that such events reflect the growing intersection between traditional finance and emerging technologies. NYSE approves Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF Big week incoming — Bitwise (@BitwiseInvest) October 27, 2025 Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley on Monday hinted at a potential big week for the crypto sector. His remarks follow Bitwise’s previous filing of an updated application for a Solana ETF, seeking to add staking functionality. On Monday, the New York Stock Exchange approved the listing of Bitwise’s Solana Staking ETF on NYSE Arca. The crypto-focused asset manager has now expanded its offerings to Solana with staking capabilities to provide investors direct exposure to blockchain-native staking rewards. The initiative follows the growing interest in Solana by institutional players, driven by the network’s high-performance capabilities. The Bitwise SOL ETF will still require SEC approval before trading on the New York Stock Exchange’s umbrella electronic trading platform, NYSE Arca. Bitwise said the initiative aims to bridge the gap between digital assets and conventional markets to make cryptocurrencies more accessible to retail investors.

The agency assigned Strategy a “B-” issuer credit rating, stating that “the company’s concentration in bitcoin is key to its strategy and will likely continue to weigh on our ratings,” citing its extreme concentration in Bitcoin, limited business diversification, weak capitalization, and low U.S. dollar liquidity. Bitcoin accumulation model raises liquidity and capital risks S&P analysts pointed out that Strategy’s corporate identity now revolves almost entirely around its Bitcoin accumulation business. The company now has 640,808 Bitcoins in its treasury, valued at approximately $74 billion, making it the largest Bitcoin treasury company in the world. It has been able to accumulate these through years of equity and debt issuance. While this has made the firm a proxy for Bitcoin exposure, it has also introduced volatility and liquidity risk into its capital structure. The report noted that Strategy “has a long Bitcoin position and a short U.S. dollar position.” However, its debt and preferred equity obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars, and this creates an inherent currency mismatch that could prove fatal during crypto market downturns. S&P’s analysts described this approach as “prudent” in terms of managing near-term maturities, noting that the company has no major debt due within the next 12 months, but warned that the strategy exposes it to the risk of being forced to sell Bitcoin “at depressed prices” during a market stress event. The firm’s outstanding convertible debt is roughly $8 billion, of which $5 billion remains out of the money, maturing between 2028 and 2031. In addition, the company owes more than $640 million annually in preferred dividends. Capital markets access remains a lifeline S&P, however, acknowledged Strategy’s strong access to capital markets as a key strength supporting the stable outlook. The firm’s stock, which has surged in tandem with Bitcoin’s price this year, has a stock market capitalization near $80 billion, “while it has issued almost $15 billion in combined notional value of convertible debt and preferred equity,” according to S&P. S&P’s base-case assumption is that the company will continue to meet obligations by raising capital through these instruments rather than liquidating its Bitcoin reserves. The company recorded a negative $37 million in cash flow from operations during the first half of 2025, while the modest software business barely broke even. Nearly all reported earnings, over $8 billion before tax, came from unrealized gains, which also came from Bitcoin’s fair value appreciation rather than recurring revenue or cash-generating operations. Saylor’s vision meets Wall Street’s reality In a post on X , Michael Saylor, Strategy’s cofounder and chairman, described S&P Global’s rating of the company as the “first-ever rating of a Bitcoin treasury company.” However, the designation of junk status shows the skepticism with which traditional credit markets still view Bitcoin-backed corporate finance, especially those operating a model similar to Strategy. The company continues to expand its holdings despite market warnings and increasing doomsday rhetoric from long-term skeptics such as Peter Schiff. This week, it announced a new Bitcoin purchase worth $43.4 million, extending its streak of aggressive accumulation. On Thursday, October 30, Strategy will be releasing its third-quarter earnings, and as expected, investors will be watching closely for signs of cash flow resilience and balance sheet management.

This event has not only shattered expectations but also set a new benchmark for project funding within the rapidly evolving Sui ecosystem. Imagine a sale so popular it was oversubscribed by more than ten times – that is precisely what Momentum (MMT) accomplished. Understanding the Momentum Community Sale Triumph Momentum (MMT) is making significant waves as a decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity hub operating within the innovative Sui (SUI) ecosystem. Its recent community sale, hosted on the ICO platform Buidlpad , concluded with a truly remarkable outcome. The sale successfully raised an astounding $49.68 million, dramatically surpassing its initial target of $4.5 million by an incredible 1105%. Oversubscription: The demand was so immense that the sale was oversubscribed by more than 10 times. Funds Raised: A staggering $49.68 million was secured. Target Exceeded: This figure is 1105% higher than the original $4.5 million goal. This level of interest highlights a strong belief in Momentum’s vision and its potential to contribute to the Sui network’s growth. How Did the Momentum Community Sale Operate? The mechanics of the Momentum community sale were designed to be accessible while also managing participation. Eligible individuals had several options for subscription, making it convenient for a diverse group of investors. Participants could subscribe using: BNB (Binance Coin) SUI (the native token of the Sui blockchain) USD1 (a stablecoin) A key attractive feature for investors was the token unlocking schedule. All tokens purchased during the sale will be 100% unlocked at the Token Generation Event (TGE). This immediate access is often preferred by participants looking for liquidity from the outset. To ensure fair distribution and prevent single entities from dominating the sale, individual contribution limits were established. These limits ranged between $50 and $20,000, varying based on the participant’s tier. This tiered approach often rewards early supporters or those with higher engagement within the platform’s ecosystem. What Drives Such High Demand for Momentum (MMT)? The overwhelming success of the Momentum community sale is not just a fluke; it reflects several underlying factors. Momentum’s position as a decentralized exchange and liquidity hub is crucial. DEXs are fundamental to the DeFi landscape, offering peer-to-peer trading without intermediaries. By building on Sui, Momentum taps into a blockchain known for its high throughput and low latency, making it an attractive platform for DeFi applications. The Sui ecosystem itself has garnered significant attention and investment, promising scalability and an enhanced user experience. Projects like Momentum that aim to provide essential infrastructure on such a promising blockchain naturally attract strong interest from both retail investors and institutional players looking for early opportunities. This synergy between a robust project and a growing ecosystem creates fertile ground for successful fundraising. The Broader Impact on the Sui Ecosystem The successful conclusion of the Momentum community sale sends a powerful signal to the broader cryptocurrency market, especially concerning the Sui ecosystem. It demonstrates robust investor confidence in projects building on Sui, validating the network’s potential as a thriving hub for decentralized finance. This significant capital injection into Momentum means the project is well-resourced to develop its DEX and liquidity offerings, which will, in turn, enhance the overall utility and attractiveness of the Sui blockchain. As Momentum expands its functionalities, it will likely draw more users and liquidity to Sui, fostering a more vibrant and dynamic DeFi environment. This success can also inspire other developers and projects to choose Sui, creating a positive feedback loop for growth and innovation within the ecosystem. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Momentum? With a successful community sale under its belt, Momentum is now poised for its next phase of development and growth. The 100% token unlock at TGE suggests a focus on immediate liquidity and market participation. Investors will be eagerly watching for the Token Generation Event and subsequent listings on exchanges, which will provide the first public trading opportunities for MMT tokens. The substantial funds raised will enable Momentum to accelerate its development roadmap, potentially introducing new features, expanding its liquidity pools, and forging strategic partnerships. Its continued progress will be key to solidifying its position as a leading DEX and liquidity hub within the competitive Sui ecosystem. The phenomenal success of the Momentum community sale underscores the vibrant potential within the crypto space, particularly for innovative projects on promising blockchains like Sui. Raising nearly $50 million and being oversubscribed tenfold is a clear indicator of strong market confidence and a testament to Momentum’s compelling vision. As the project moves forward, its journey will undoubtedly be one to watch for anyone interested in the future of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Momentum (MMT)? Momentum (MMT) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity hub specifically designed to operate within the Sui (SUI) ecosystem, aiming to provide efficient trading and liquidity solutions. What is the Sui (SUI) ecosystem? Sui is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain designed for speed, scalability, and low-cost transactions. It aims to support a wide range of decentralized applications, from DeFi to gaming. What is Buidlpad? Buidlpad is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) platform that facilitates token sales for new cryptocurrency projects, connecting them with potential investors. Why was the Momentum community sale so successful? The Momentum community sale was highly successful due to strong investor confidence in the project’s vision as a DEX on the promising Sui blockchain, combined with effective marketing and attractive sale terms like 100% token unlock at TGE. What does “oversubscribed 10x” mean? “Oversubscribed 10x” means that the total demand for tokens in the sale was ten times greater than the actual number of tokens made available for purchase. For example, if $4.5 million worth of tokens were offered, investors wanted to buy $45 million worth. How will tokens purchased in the sale be distributed? Tokens purchased in the Momentum community sale will be 100% unlocked at the Token Generation Event (TGE), meaning participants will receive full access to their purchased tokens immediately upon the project’s official token launch.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs).

Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart On the daily chart for October 28, WIF/USDT trades at $0.555, up 0.54% as it holds a steady range between $0.55 and $0.56. The Bollinger Bands are tightening, with the middle band (basis) near $0.543, suggesting a potential volatility squeeze that often precedes a decisive move. The upper band around $0.642 represents the next resistance level, while the lower band at $0.444 remains a distant support zone. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The volume has dropped to 13.6M, indicating less trading, but steady buying pressure is building up. The MACD has just turned positive, showing early signs of trend reversal after a prolonged bearish phase. This alignment, alongside narrowing bands, signals that WIF could be preparing for a momentum breakout if the price closes above $0.56–$0.57. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, WIF shows subtle accumulation signs around $0.556, marking a 0.72% uptick as it continues to move slightly above the Alligator’s blue baseline ($0.548). The green and red Alligator lines have flattened, indicating a neutral short-term structure awaiting breakout confirmation. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview The Balance of Power (0.50) reflects equilibrium between buyers and sellers, consistent with a consolidation phase, while the PVT (75.37M) indicates steady positioning, suggesting that holders are not yet exiting. Should WIF push beyond $0.558–$0.56, momentum could quicken toward $0.57–$0.58 resistance. Conversely, a fall under $0.548 might trigger short-term profit-taking back to $0.54.

WIF is coiling for a directional move after several sessions of low volatility. Holding above $0.55 supports a bullish continuation toward $ 0.60 and beyond, but a dip under $0.54 would delay the breakout. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

Bitcoin, Ethereum Have Surged In The Last 24 Hours Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have witnessed a rally during the past day, breaking away from the slump the market had earlier fallen into. At the height of this surge, Bitcoin broke past $116,000, while Ethereum touched $4,250. Related Reading: XRP Flashes TD Buy Signal: Start Of Fresh Rally? The assets have since seen a small retracement. The chart below shows how BTC’s latest trajectory has looked. At its current price of $115,400, Bitcoin is up about 4% on the weekly timeframe. Similarly, Ethereum at $4,160 is in a profit of 3.4%. Most other digital assets have seen similarly positive returns, although there are some outliers like Tron, which is down more than 7%. The market-wide recovery during the past day has meant that a large amount of short liquidations have piled up on the derivatives exchanges. Crypto Market Liquidations Have Totaled At $467 Million According to data from CoinGlass, about $467 million in cryptocurrency-related derivatives contracts have been liquidated over the last 24 hours. A contract is said to be “liquidated” when its platform forcibly shuts it down after it accumulates losses of a certain degree (as defined by the exchange). Given that coins across the board have rebounded, the contracts crossing this threshold would mostly be the short ones. And indeed, the data would confirm so. As is visible above, liquidations related to bearish cryptocurrency bets have reached $358 million in this window, representing 76.6% of the total flush in the sector. Bitcoin led the liquidations with $177 million in contracts involved, while Ethereum contributed the second most with $130 million in contracts. Out of the rest, Solana witnessed the largest flush at $34 million. In some other news, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have observed a notable amount of inflows over the past month, as CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has pointed out in an X post.

Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows how the 30-day netflow for these vehicles has fluctuated since: As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin spot ETFs have seen inflows of $4.7 billion during the past month. Ethereum spot ETFs, which gained approval in mid-2024, have also enjoyed inflows in this period, although their value of $983 million is significantly less than BTC’s.

Related Reading: Solana Jitters Don’t Scare Whales As They Persistently Load Up On SOL – A Rally Ahead? While U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs logged a two-week outflow streak of approximately $555 million, a major corporate buyer stepped in, purchasing 19,271 ETH ($78.3 million) and lifting its total holdings to more than 859,000 ETH. Institutional Accumulation vs ETF Outflows Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded their second consecutive week of redemptions between Oct. 20-24, with about $243.9 million exiting in the latest week alone. Notable outflows came from major funds. Fidelity’s FETH saw about $95.2 million in redemptions, BlackRock’s ETHA around $89.1 million, and Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH each posted further outflows. Similarly, corporate treasuries are doubling down. The company behind the recent $78 M buy added to its ETH holdings just as the Ethereum price reclaimed above $4,200, signalling strong conviction in ETH as a long-term asset. The data suggest a clear market bifurcation, with ETF demand from retail and institutions weakening even as direct corporate treasury accumulation accelerates. Crucially, institutions now hold nearly 4.94 % of all ETH in circulation through treasuries alone, supporting the structural shift in ownership. Ethereum Price Chart Setup: $4,300 Resistance in Focus Technically, the Ethereum price is testing a critical juncture. After bouncing from $3,880 and clearing resistance around $4,200, ETH now sits poised at the upper boundary of a narrowing wedge between $4,100-4,250. A sustained breakout above $4,300 could trigger a sharp move toward $4,600-$5,000. Conversely, failure to break resistance could see a pullback toward $3,700. Derivatives and liquidity data amplify the stakes. ETH futures open interest surged 11.7 % in a 24-hour window, and leverage build-up indicates strong positioning ahead of a directional move. Given the structural backdrop of intense treasury accumulation and weakening ETF flows, the $4,300 mark is not just a technical level, it may represent the tipping point where institutional accumulation meets broader market sentiment. Bottom Line With institutions loading up and retail/ETF flows weakening, the Ethereum price trajectory depends on whether it can decisively breach $4,300. A close above that level could validate the accumulation narrative and unlock higher targets, while a rejection risks reigniting consolidation or even a deeper correction.

A significant stride in this direction has been made by Creditcoin, a Layer 1 blockchain, which recently announced a monumental upgrade. This move sees Creditcoin completing its Creditcoin multichain transition through a strategic integration with Wormhole, a leading cross-chain infrastructure provider. This development is set to revolutionize how users interact with CTC tokens across different networks. What Does the Creditcoin Multichain Transition Mean for You? On October 28, Creditcoin ( CTC ) officially adopted the Native Token Transfer (NTT) standard from Wormhole ( W ). This technical advancement is a game-changer for token transfers. Historically, moving tokens between different blockchains often required a “wrapping” process, which could be cumbersome and sometimes less secure. With NTT, this is no longer an issue. The new standard facilitates easier, native token transfers between major networks, including Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BNB Chain) . This means that if you hold CTC tokens, you can now transfer them between these ecosystems seamlessly, without the need for complex intermediate steps. This significantly streamlines the user experience and boosts liquidity across these vital blockchain environments, truly embodying the spirit of a Creditcoin multichain ecosystem. How Does Wormhole’s Portal Platform Boost Creditcoin? Further enhancing this transition, Creditcoin has secured a listing on Portal , Wormhole’s official bridge platform. This listing is more than just a presence; it’s a direct gateway for users. It allows you to directly transfer and trade your CTC tokens on both Ethereum and BNB Chain. But there’s a crucial advantage here: all these transfers share a single, unified liquidity pool. What does a single liquidity pool mean for you? It ensures greater efficiency and potentially better pricing for trades, as liquidity isn’t fragmented across multiple pools. This centralized liquidity mechanism helps to minimize slippage and provides a more robust trading environment. For anyone looking to move or trade CTC, Portal offers a direct, efficient, and user-friendly solution, making the Creditcoin multichain experience truly integrated. The Future is Multichain: What About Spacecoin? The impact of this integration extends beyond just Creditcoin itself. Spacecoin (SPACE), a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Creditcoin blockchain, is also poised to benefit. Spacecoin is scheduled to adopt the Wormhole NTT standard for multichain transfers following its upcoming token generation event (TGE). This planned adoption highlights a broader vision for the Creditcoin ecosystem: to foster a network of interconnected dApps that can seamlessly operate across multiple blockchains. For Spacecoin users, this will mean enhanced flexibility and accessibility, allowing them to participate in the Spacecoin ecosystem from their preferred network. It’s a testament to the forward-thinking approach of the Creditcoin multichain strategy, building a more interconnected and user-friendly DeFi landscape. Navigating the Benefits of Creditcoin’s Multichain Integration The completion of Creditcoin’s multichain transition with Wormhole brings a multitude of benefits to its users and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Here are some key advantages: Enhanced Liquidity: By connecting to Ethereum and BNB Chain, CTC tokens gain access to vast liquidity pools, potentially improving trading volumes and price stability. Unprecedented User Convenience: The elimination of the wrapping process simplifies token transfers, making it easier for both new and experienced users to manage their assets. Broader Accessibility: Users from different blockchain ecosystems can now more easily access and participate in the Creditcoin network and its associated dApps like Spacecoin. Strengthened Ecosystem Growth: This interoperability fosters innovation and encourages more developers and projects to build on Creditcoin, knowing their assets can move freely. While cross-chain solutions always involve considerations for security, Wormhole’s robust infrastructure and the NTT standard are designed to provide a secure environment for these crucial transfers. This integration marks a pivotal moment for the Creditcoin multichain future, promising a more connected and efficient DeFi experience. In conclusion, Creditcoin’s successful multichain transition, powered by Wormhole’s innovative NTT standard, is a significant milestone. It not only simplifies token transfers and boosts liquidity for CTC across major networks like Ethereum and BNB Chain but also paves the way for a more integrated and accessible decentralized finance ecosystem. This strategic move solidifies Creditcoin’s position as a forward-thinking Layer 1 blockchain, ready to meet the demands of a truly interconnected crypto world. The future of Creditcoin multichain is here, offering unparalleled convenience and opportunities for its community. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Creditcoin? Creditcoin is a Layer 1 blockchain built specifically for credit transactions, aiming to establish a decentralized credit system. It enables transparent and verifiable credit history for unbanked and underbanked individuals worldwide. You can learn more about Creditcoin here . Q2: What is Wormhole’s Native Token Transfer (NTT) standard? The Native Token Transfer (NTT) standard is a protocol developed by Wormhole that allows tokens to be transferred natively between different blockchains without requiring a separate “wrapping” process. This simplifies cross-chain operations and maintains the original token’s identity. Q3: How does this integration benefit Creditcoin users? This integration significantly benefits Creditcoin users by enabling seamless and native transfers of CTC tokens between major networks like Ethereum and BNB Chain . It enhances liquidity, improves trading efficiency via a single liquidity pool on Portal, and simplifies the overall user experience by eliminating the need for token wrapping. Q4: What is Spacecoin’s role in this transition? Spacecoin (SPACE) is a decentralized application (dApp) built on Creditcoin. It is also scheduled to adopt the Wormhole NTT standard following its Token Generation Event (TGE), extending the benefits of multichain transfers to its own ecosystem and further strengthening the interoperability of the Creditcoin network. Q5: How does the single liquidity pool on Portal work? The single liquidity pool on Portal means that all CTC tokens transferred or traded across Ethereum and BNB Chain are drawing from the same pool of assets. This centralizes liquidity, which can lead to more efficient trades, reduced slippage, and a more stable market for the token, regardless of which supported chain it’s being accessed from.

That step is part of a broader effort to enhance shareholder value and narrow the discount between the firm’s share price and its net asset value (NAV). According to the company, the ETH was sold on October 24, as disclosed in a press release the same day.. Since then, ETHZilla has repurchased approximately 600,000 of its ordinary shares for around $12 million. The buybacks fall under a board-approved $250 million authorization plan issued in August. In addition to returning significant capital to the trust at this price, the plan gives ETHZilla the flexibility to buy back shares opportunistically when its stock trades below NAV, effectively acknowledging that the company believes its market value doesn’t fully account for the value of its Ether holdings. After the news was released, ETHZilla rose 14.5% during Monday’s trading session and then increased by 9% in after-hours trading to above $22.50 per share, according to Google Finance. Even with the jump, the price is still well off a previous high set around $107, when the company initially disclosed plans to raise funds for its Ethereum treasury project. Buybacks aim to close the discount to NAV ETHZilla’s management team presented the deal as a strategic repositioning aimed at delivering value to shareholders. In a statement, McAndrew Rudisill, Chairman, noted that the company plans to continue selling Ether while repurchasing shares, as ETHZ trades at a significant discount to NAV. This will reduce the number of shares in circulation, thereby strengthening the net asset valuation. Currently, the firm still has roughly $400 million in Ether remaining on its balance sheet even after the sale. That means the $40 million sale was roughly 10% of its crypto reserves, making plenty of headroom for future buybacks. ETHZilla’s investor roster has also garnered attention. In August, Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund bought a 7.5 percent stake in the company, Business Insider reported. It was viewed as a sign of increasing institutional interest in Ethereum-based treasuries and digital asset-backed companies. ETHZilla rebranded earlier this year to focus specifically on investments in the Ethereum ecosystem, subsequently pivoting into digital asset management and blockchain investment. Its treasury model reflects traditional investment trusts, but with the added benefit of on-chain transparency and direct exposure to crypto assets. Market reacts to crypto treasury going mainstream The sale demonstrates how blockchain-based treasuries are increasingly acting as capital managers, not just accumulating and holding crypto assets. By converting some of its ETH into equity buybacks, ETHZilla is combining DeFi strategies with corporate finance tools. Analysts said the move could help stabilize the company’s market performance, noting that it reflects a disciplined approach to its balance sheet strategy. They added that by selling a small portion of its Ether holdings to narrow the NAV gap, ETHZilla may attract traditional investors seeking crypto exposure with lower volatility. However, critics note potential risks. Unloading large quantities of Ether would be liable to incur market timing risk for the company should the price of ETH make a fast recovery. It also raises the question of whether Crypto Treasuries should be held by long-term investors or liquidity managers working toward short-term equity targets. ETHZilla’s tactic aligns with methods commonly used in mainstream finance. Firms like Grayscale and Strategy have long grappled with such NAV dislocations tied to crypto prices. ETHZilla’s practice of selling ETH to finance buybacks could, should it succeed, become a model for how other crypto-backed companies treat valuation gaps. The company stated that it would continue to buy back shares “until the discount to NAV is normalized.” This suggests that more Ether sales are on the horizon in the months to come as ETHZilla attempts to balance a strong position in crypto with its stock price.

BitMine Immersion Technologies (NYSEAMERICAN: BMNR) stock rose 6.96% to $53.83, up $3.42 from its previous close of $50.41. The stock price oscillated between $51.77 and $53.94 during the day, as Ethereum (ETH) rebounded to $4,209, up $142.34 or 3.44%. On-chain data aggregate by Arkham intelligence, BitMine holds 3.313 million Ethereum, worth over $13.8 billion, 192 Bitcoin, worth over $22 million, and $305 million in cash on hand. Over the past week, the organization has added 77,055 ETH, making it the largest Ethereum treasury company to date. The NYSE American-traded firm is the second-largest cryptocurrency treasury overall, after Strategy, which has more than $73 billion in Bitcoin. BitMine links the ETH surge to global factors Ethereum has been experiencing a recent surge, along with the rest of the crypto market. ETH price increased by 3% in the past week to a current price of $4,209. CoinGecko data reveals that ETH surged to $4,246 overnight, the highest level recorded in the previous two weeks. Thomas J. Lee, the chairman of BitMine and co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, attributed ETH’s recent upswing to increased trade relations between the U.S. and Canada after a sharp decline and crypto market plunge earlier this month. “The progress in trade talks between the U.S. and China is a positive for Ethereum and crypto broadly. These are global assets, and rising tensions triggered the largest ever deleveraging in crypto a few weeks ago.” Thomas J. Lee, Chairman of BitMine and co-founder and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. Lee claimed that although ETH’s and crypto market fundamentals are “uncorrelated” with stocks, Fundstrat’s research over the last 15 years has demonstrated that ETH generally performs better when stocks increase. He added that the rise in stocks indicates that the crypto market is correlated with “risk-on” assets through the related leverage channel. BitMine strengthens institutional confidence in ETH On October 10, BitMine made headlines when it paid around $103.68 million for 23,823 Ethereum. The substantial investment demonstrated a longer-term outlook for the entire market, despite short-term price fluctuations. Tom Lee claimed that ETH will be a key component of blockchain adoption. He said that the recent acquisition of the company aligns with a broader discourse around institutional confidence. BitMine demonstrated that institutional players are adopting a longer-term perspective, focusing more on structural growth and technological advancements. BitMine stated that it plans to push ETH’s financial industry maturation and amass 5% of ETH’s total supply. Additionally, BitMine stated that the purchase demonstrates institutional holders’ high level of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term prospects. Companies increasing their Ethereum holdings are becoming increasingly popular. Strong spot ETH inflows and institutional interest have made major contributions to corporate treasuries this summer. Rival SharpLink Gaming declared that it had recently acquired 39,008 ETH, bringing the total amount of ETH held by the company to 837,230. The total amount of Ethereum (ETH) held in treasuries by publicly traded corporations is worth approximately $18.22 billion. As previously reported by Cryptopolitan on September 6, BitMine increased its treasury by $358 million, solidifying its position as one of the biggest institutional Ethereum investors. The $358 million infusion further fueled ETH’s price rally. BitMine received two large ETH transfers from Galaxy Digital and FalconX, bringing its total holdings to 1,947,299 ETH, valued at approximately $8.69 billion. These transfers added roughly 80,000 ETH to BitMine’s wallets. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

A substantial SOL transfer , amounting to 1,097,555 SOL and valued at approximately $221 million, has been moved from an unknown wallet to Coinbase Institutional . This colossal movement, first highlighted by Whale Alert , raises crucial questions about its implications for the Solana ecosystem and the broader crypto market. What Does This Significant SOL Transfer Imply? When a large amount of cryptocurrency like this SOL transfer occurs, it often sparks discussions about market sentiment and future price action. Whale movements, especially those involving institutional platforms, can be a bellwether for what’s to come. This particular transaction involves Solana (SOL), a high-performance blockchain known for its speed and scalability. Institutional Interest: A move to Coinbase Institutional suggests a sophisticated entity is behind the transaction. Institutions often engage in strategic moves, which could range from accumulation to reallocation. Market Impact: While not immediately indicative of a sell-off, such a large SOL transfer can influence market perception. Traders and investors closely watch these movements for clues about potential supply and demand shifts. Liquidity Provision: Coinbase Institutional acts as a prime broker for many large investors. This could mean the SOL is being prepared for trading, staking, or other institutional services. The Role of Coinbase Institutional in Crypto Movements Coinbase Institutional is a crucial player in the institutional crypto landscape. It provides a suite of services tailored for large-scale investors, including trading, custody, and prime brokerage. For a substantial SOL transfer to land here, it indicates a serious intent from the sender. Unlike retail exchanges, institutional platforms cater to hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. Their involvement often lends credibility and stability to the assets they handle. This particular SOL transfer highlights the growing confidence of large investors in the Solana network and its potential. Understanding Solana’s Position After a Major SOL Transfer Solana has established itself as a formidable blockchain, often touted as an ‘Ethereum killer’ due to its high transaction throughput and low fees. A significant SOL transfer like this one reaffirms its status as a top-tier asset attracting substantial capital. The Solana ecosystem continues to expand, with numerous DeFi projects, NFTs, and dApps building on its robust infrastructure. While a single large transaction doesn’t define the entire network’s health, it certainly underscores its appeal to major players. This kind of institutional engagement can lead to increased adoption and further development within the Solana community. How to Interpret Whale Movements and SOL Transfers Interpreting whale movements, especially a significant SOL transfer , requires a nuanced approach. It’s rarely a straightforward signal. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Don’t Panic: A large transfer to an institutional platform doesn’t automatically mean a dump is imminent. Often, it’s part of a broader, long-term strategy. Look for Context: Is there accompanying news? Are other whales making similar moves? The broader market context is vital. Consider Institutional Strategies: Institutions might be accumulating for staking, providing liquidity for new products, or rebalancing portfolios. Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools like Whale Alert provide transparency, but combining this with other on-chain metrics can offer a clearer picture. Ultimately, this $221 million SOL transfer is a reminder of the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market and the increasing involvement of institutional capital. It reinforces Solana’s position as a key asset on the radar of major investors. This substantial SOL transfer to Coinbase Institutional is more than just a large sum of money moving around; it’s a testament to the evolving landscape of digital assets. It signals a maturation of the crypto market, where institutional players are becoming increasingly comfortable with significant positions in assets like Solana. As we move forward, monitoring such movements will remain crucial for understanding the undercurrents shaping the future of decentralized finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does a “whale alert” signify in cryptocurrency? A “whale alert” typically signifies a transaction involving a very large amount of cryptocurrency, usually by an individual or entity (a “whale”) holding significant crypto assets. These alerts are often tracked because such large movements can potentially impact market prices or signal upcoming market shifts. 2. Why is the SOL transfer to Coinbase Institutional significant? The SOL transfer is significant because Coinbase Institutional caters to large, sophisticated investors like hedge funds and corporations. A move to this platform suggests that a major player is positioning themselves, potentially for strategic trading, long-term holding, or offering institutional services, rather than a simple retail transaction. 3. What is Solana (SOL) ? Solana (SOL) is a high-performance blockchain platform designed for decentralized applications and crypto projects. It is known for its high transaction speed, low costs, and scalability, making it a competitor to other major blockchains like Ethereum. 4. Does a large SOL transfer automatically mean the price will drop? Not necessarily. While a large transfer can sometimes precede a sell-off, especially if moved to a retail exchange, a transfer to an institutional platform like Coinbase Institutional often suggests strategic intent. It could be for custody, staking, or even accumulation, not just immediate selling. It’s important to consider the broader market context. 5. Who or what is Whale Alert ?

This week, the firm submitted its sixth amendment to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , marking another significant step in a highly anticipated process for crypto investors. What Does VanEck’s Latest Spot Solana ETF Amendment Mean? VanEck’s recent submission, the sixth of its kind, involves specific phrasing adjustments within the application document. These revisions often address feedback or clarify details requested by the SEC. While seemingly minor, each amendment reflects an ongoing dialogue between the asset manager and the regulatory body. It demonstrates VanEck’s commitment to meeting all necessary requirements for the approval of a spot Solana ETF . The SEC’s rigorous review process for any new financial product, especially those involving novel assets like cryptocurrencies, is standard. This iterative amendment process is a common part of navigating complex regulatory frameworks, ensuring all legal and compliance aspects are thoroughly covered before a product can be offered to the public. Why Are Spot Solana ETFs So Important for Investors? A spot Solana ETF holds actual Solana tokens directly, rather than derivatives. This direct exposure offers several compelling benefits for investors: Accessibility: It simplifies investment in Solana for traditional investors who may be hesitant to buy and store cryptocurrencies directly. They can gain exposure through familiar brokerage accounts. Regulatory Clarity: An SEC-approved ETF provides a regulated investment vehicle, potentially increasing investor confidence and reducing perceived risks associated with unregulated crypto exchanges. Market Legitimacy: The approval of a spot Solana ETF would signal growing institutional acceptance of Solana as a legitimate asset class, potentially attracting more mainstream capital and enhancing market liquidity. Diversification: For institutional portfolios, it offers another avenue for diversification within the digital asset space, complementing existing Bitcoin or Ethereum allocations. This increased institutional interest could drive significant inflows into the Solana ecosystem, benefiting its overall growth and development. Navigating the Regulatory Labyrinth for a Spot Solana ETF The path to launching a spot Solana ETF is complex and fraught with regulatory challenges. The SEC’s primary concerns typically revolve around investor protection, market manipulation, and custody of the underlying assets. While the SEC has recently approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, the landscape for other altcoins like Solana remains under intense scrutiny. VanEck’s persistent efforts highlight the significant hurdles involved. Each amendment serves to strengthen the application, addressing potential regulatory sticking points. The SEC evaluates various factors, including the market’s maturity, surveillance sharing agreements, and the overall liquidity of the underlying asset. The agency aims to ensure that any approved product offers adequate safeguards for investors. VanEck’s sixth amendment for its spot Solana ETF application underscores the ongoing push for broader institutional access to digital assets. While the approval timeline remains uncertain, each filing brings the industry a step closer to a more integrated future for cryptocurrencies within traditional finance. This persistent effort by asset managers like VanEck is crucial for paving the way for new investment opportunities and enhancing the legitimacy of the entire crypto market. The journey is long, but the dedication to bringing a spot Solana ETF to fruition is undeniable. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a Spot Solana ETF? A spot Solana ETF is an Exchange Traded Fund that directly holds Solana (SOL) tokens. This allows investors to gain exposure to Solana’s price movements through a traditional brokerage account without needing to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency itself. 2. Why is VanEck submitting multiple amendments for its application? The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has a rigorous review process for new financial products, especially those involving cryptocurrencies. Each amendment typically addresses feedback from the SEC, clarifies specific details, or strengthens the application to meet regulatory requirements concerning investor protection, market manipulation, and custody. 3. How does a Spot Solana ETF differ from a Solana Futures ETF? A spot Solana ETF invests directly in actual Solana tokens, meaning its value is tied to the current market price of Solana. A Solana Futures ETF, if it existed, would invest in futures contracts that bet on Solana’s future price, not the underlying asset itself. The SEC has historically been more comfortable with futures-based crypto ETFs due to established regulatory frameworks around futures markets. 4. What are the potential benefits of a Spot Solana ETF for the Solana ecosystem? Approval of a spot Solana ETF could significantly increase institutional and retail investor access to Solana . This increased demand could lead to greater liquidity, price stability, and overall market legitimacy for Solana, potentially driving further development and adoption within its ecosystem. 5. When might a Spot Solana ETF be approved? Predicting the exact approval timeline for a spot Solana ETF is challenging. The SEC’s review process is thorough and depends on various factors, including ongoing discussions with applicants like VanEck , broader regulatory sentiment, and market conditions. While there’s no fixed deadline, each amendment signals continued progress. Did you find this update on VanEck’s spot Solana ETF application insightful?

The cryptocurrency world often moves at lightning speed, and news can emerge from unexpected corners. Recently, the crypto community was met with a significant development: the official X account for Four.Meme (FORM) , a prominent memecoin launchpad operating on the BNB Chain, faced a sudden and rather X suspension . This unexpected move has left many wondering about the reasons behind it and what it means for the project and its dedicated followers. What Triggered the Four.Meme X Suspension? According to reports, the official X account for Four.Meme was suspended due to violations of the platform’s operating principles. While X (formerly Twitter) has specific guidelines designed to maintain a safe and respectful environment, the exact nature of Four.Meme’s alleged transgression remains undisclosed by X. Potential Violations: Common reasons for account suspensions on X include spamming, platform manipulation, engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior, or sharing content that violates X’s terms of service, such as hate speech or glorification of violence. Community Speculation: In the absence of official statements from X, the Four.Meme community has been rife with speculation. Some suggest it could be related to aggressive promotional tactics, while others point to potential bot activity or mass reporting campaigns against the account. Understanding the specific violation is crucial for both Four.Meme and other projects looking to maintain a strong social media presence. The lack of transparency from X often leaves projects and their communities in the dark regarding the specifics of the Four.Meme X suspension . Immediate Fallout: How the Suspension Impacts Four.Meme An X suspension, especially for a project like Four.Meme that relies heavily on social media for community engagement and announcements, can have immediate and significant consequences. X serves as a primary hub for real-time updates, marketing, and direct interaction with the user base. The suspension means: Loss of Direct Communication: Four.Meme has lost its main channel for instant updates, announcements, and direct interaction with its vast global audience. This can lead to misinformation and uncertainty among investors and supporters. Community Disruption: Projects like Four.Meme thrive on active communities. Without their official X presence, followers may feel disconnected, leading to a potential dip in engagement and sentiment. Credibility Concerns: A suspension can unfortunately raise questions about a project’s legitimacy or operational practices, even if the violation was minor or unintentional. Maintaining trust is paramount in the crypto space, and the Four.Meme X suspension tests this. Therefore, Four.Meme must swiftly address this communication gap and reassure its community, perhaps through alternative platforms. Navigating Social Media Risks: Lessons from the Four.Meme X Suspension The Four.Meme X suspension offers valuable lessons for all cryptocurrency projects regarding their social media strategy. In an era where digital presence is everything, understanding and mitigating platform risks is essential for long-term success and credibility. Here are some actionable insights: Diversify Communication Channels: Relying solely on one platform is risky. Projects should establish multiple communication avenues, such as official Telegram groups, Discord servers, Medium blogs, and even email newsletters, to ensure redundancy. Understand Platform Policies: Regularly review and strictly adhere to the operating principles of all social media platforms used. What might be acceptable on one platform could lead to a suspension on another. Build Stronger Internal Teams: Having dedicated community managers and social media strategists who are well-versed in platform guidelines can help prevent inadvertent violations and respond quickly to issues. Foster Organic Engagement: Focus on building a genuine community through valuable content and authentic interactions, rather than relying on tactics that could be flagged as spam or manipulation. This proactive approach helps projects like Four.Meme maintain resilience even when faced with unexpected challenges like an unexpected X suspension. What’s Next for Four.Meme After the X Suspension? The road ahead for Four.Meme involves regaining its footing and rebuilding its communication strategy. This could include appealing the suspension, establishing a new official X account (if permitted), or migrating its primary social media presence to other platforms. Reassuring the community and maintaining transparency will be key to navigating this challenging period after the Four.Meme X suspension . The incident underscores the volatility of relying on centralized platforms for decentralized projects. It’s a stark reminder that even well-established projects can face unforeseen hurdles in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. The Four.Meme X suspension serves as a powerful reminder for all projects in the crypto space: while social media offers unparalleled reach, it also comes with inherent risks. Diversifying communication, understanding platform rules, and fostering genuine community engagement are not just best practices—they are necessities for survival and growth. As Four.Meme navigates this challenge, the broader industry watches, ready to learn from its experience. Frequently Asked Questions About the Four.Meme X Suspension Here are some common questions regarding the recent X suspension of Four.Meme: Q1: What is Four.Meme (FORM)? A1: Four.Meme (FORM) is a memecoin launchpad project primarily operating on the BNB Chain . It aims to facilitate the creation and launch of new memecoins within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Q2: Why was Four.Meme’s X account suspended? A2: The official X account for Four.Meme was suspended for violating X’s operating principles . The specific nature of the violation has not been publicly disclosed by X, leading to speculation within the community. Q3: How does an X suspension impact a cryptocurrency project? A3: An X suspension can severely impact a crypto project by cutting off a primary channel for real-time announcements, community engagement, and marketing. It can lead to a loss of direct communication, community disruption, and potential concerns about the project’s credibility among investors and supporters. Q4: What are Four.Meme’s alternative communication channels after the X suspension? A4: Following the X suspension, Four.Meme would typically rely on alternative platforms such as Telegram groups, Discord servers, official Medium blogs, or their website for announcements and community interaction.

The clear leader in this resurgence was BlackRock’s ETHA, which alone attracted an impressive $71.83 million in net inflows. This strong performance by one of the world’s largest asset managers highlights the institutional confidence building around Ethereum.

The strong performance of Spot ETH ETFs , especially with BlackRock leading the charge, could set a precedent for future institutional involvement. As more financial giants offer similar products, competition may increase, potentially leading to more innovative offerings and lower fees for investors.

Investors should always conduct their own due diligence. The recent net inflows offer a compelling narrative of renewed confidence and strategic positioning by major players. It suggests that despite past volatility, the long-term investment thesis for Ethereum, facilitated by accessible products like Spot ETH ETFs , remains robust. In summary, the significant return to net inflows for Spot ETH ETFs , spearheaded by BlackRock, is a powerful indicator of strengthening investor confidence and institutional adoption. This development not only provides a fresh wave of capital into the Ethereum ecosystem but also solidifies the role of regulated crypto investment products in the evolving financial landscape.

JPYC Is The First Yen-Backed Stablecoin In The World JPYC announced on Monday the launch of its yen-backed stablecoin , also called “JPYC.” A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to a fiat currency, and at present, the sector is heavily dominated by tokens tied to the US Dollar, with USDT and USDC alone accounting for the majority of the market. Japan is now also dipping into the space with this new stablecoin. According to JPYC, the token will be backed 1:1 by domestic deposits and Japanese government bonds (JGBs). Users can buy or sell the asset through JPYC EX, the Japanese startup’s official platform. The company is offering zero fee on issuance and redemption for now, instead turning to the interest from the JGBs as a source of income. The token is initially becoming available on Ethereum, Avalanche, and Polygon, with support for additional blockchains planned. According to Reuters , JPY is aiming to issue 10 trillion yen worth of the stablecoin over the next three years. At the current rate, this target is equivalent to about $65.5 billion. USDC, the second-largest fiat-tied token in the sector, has a market cap of about $76.3 billion right now. Thus, if JPYC meets its ambitious target, it could potentially rival the USD-ruled stablecoin market. The JPYC launch isn’t the only stable-related development that has occurred in Japan recently. As reported by Bitcoinist, three Japanese megabanks are planning to issue a yen-backed token by the end of 2025. The banks in question are Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp., and Mizuho Bank. Together, they serve over 300,000 clients. Institutional interest in cryptocurrencies has been rising in the East Asian country recently as the government is considering a regulatory rule change that would allow banks to hold Bitcoin and other digital assets for investment purposes, and register themselves as “crypto exchange operators,” becoming able to offer trading services to customers. While Japan has been moving in a crypto-positive direction, China has remained cautious, offering impediments to stablecoin plans in Hong Kong, according to Financial Times . The Chinese city launched its stablecoin legislation earlier in the year and received enquiries from multiple tech giants for an issuer license. Mainland regulators, however, have urged the companies to halt their plans, raising concerns about the growth of currencies controlled by the private sector. Globally, digital assets pegged to fiat currencies have continued to enjoy capital inflows recently despite Bitcoin and altcoins facing volatility. As the chart shared by institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora shows, the sector has seen its market cap break a record of $308 billion. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $115,200, up nearly 4% over the last week.",Stablecoin|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Japan|Japan Stablecoin|stablecoin|Stables|Yen Stablecoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-28 03:00:01

The price of Bitcoin rose about 1.6% on Sunday, while Ethereum gained roughly 2.8%. Short-term swings appear driven more by headlines than by a single company’s actions. It’s Orange Dot Day. pic.twitter.com/5FSGmxwoNS — Michael Saylor (@saylor) October 26, 2025 Holdings, Valuation And Track Record Based on reports, at prices a little over $115,000 per BTC, Strategy’s Bitcoin stash is valued at around $72 billion. That valuation implies a paper gain of more than $25 billion over a total cost basis of about $47.4 billion since the program began in 2020. Reports have logged 83 separate purchase events in that time, a pattern that has left investors with a clear view of the firm’s playbook: buy repeatedly and report afterward. Some of the buying was concentrated in September, when the firm added thousands of coins in a few large moves. Recently, however, allocations have looked smaller and more frequent. That shift suggests a preference for steady accumulation rather than single big bets. Buying Behavior And Market Response Strategy shares have been trading above the company’s net asset value. That fact suggests investors are comfortable owning MSTR as a way to gain Bitcoin exposure without buying the token directly. The company’s method — announce purchases after the fact and let the market reflect the holdings — has been consistent and predictable.

According to reports, Scott Bessent told CBS News he expected the threat of 100% tariffs and an immediate export control regime to have receded. Earlier in October, China announced tighter limits on rare earth exports used in chip manufacturing. On October 11, US President Donald Trump said he would impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods and planned export controls on certain software to take effect on November 1. Those days of sharp rhetoric caused heavy losses across markets and triggered one of the largest liquidation events in crypto this year.

An address, reportedly linked to WorldLibertyFinancial (WLFI), a decentralized finance (DeFi) project, executed a substantial token burn. This event involved a staggering 175 million WLFI tokens, valued at an impressive $26.72 million, on October 27 around 7:30 p.m. UTC. Crypto analyst Emmett Gallic brought this intriguing occurrence to light on X, prompting discussions across the digital asset community. What Exactly is WorldLibertyFinancial (WLFI)? WorldLibertyFinancial, or WLFI, is a DeFi project that has garnered interest, partly due to its alleged connections to the Trump family. DeFi aims to decentralize traditional financial services, offering users new ways to manage and grow their assets without intermediaries. Projects like WLFI often involve various mechanisms, including token burns, to manage their token supply and ecosystem dynamics. The reported association with a high-profile family adds an extra layer of intrigue to any developments surrounding the project. Understanding the nature of WLFI helps contextualize the impact of such a large-scale event. Unpacking the $26.7 Million WLFI Token Burn The recent WLFI token burn saw 175 million tokens permanently removed from circulation. This action is significant, not just because of the substantial dollar value involved, but also for what it might signal about the project’s strategy. Token burns are a common practice in the crypto space, often used for specific purposes. Deflationary Mechanism: Burning tokens reduces the total supply, which can, in theory, increase the scarcity and value of the remaining tokens. Price Support: By reducing supply, a burn can sometimes help to stabilize or even boost a token’s price, especially if demand remains constant or grows. Signaling Confidence: A large burn can signal to the market that the project team is committed to the token’s long-term value and stability. This particular WLFI token burn , reported by Emmett Gallic, immediately raised questions about its motivations and potential effects. Why Would an Address Burn Such a Large Amount of WLFI? There are several reasons why a project, or an address associated with it, might initiate a massive WLFI token burn . Typically, these actions are strategic and aim to benefit the ecosystem in some way. However, without official statements from WorldLibertyFinancial, the exact intentions remain open to interpretation. Consider these common scenarios: Boosting Investor Confidence: A burn can be a strong signal to investors that the project is serious about maintaining token value. Ecosystem Health: It might be part of a broader plan to optimize the tokenomics of the WLFI ecosystem. Responding to Market Conditions: Projects sometimes burn tokens in response to market fluctuations or community feedback to create a more robust economic model. The sheer scale of this burn suggests a deliberate and impactful decision. Investors and enthusiasts will be closely watching for any further communications from the WLFI team. What Are the Implications for WorldLibertyFinancial and Its Community? The immediate and long-term implications of this substantial WLFI token burn are multifaceted. For existing holders, a reduction in supply could theoretically lead to increased value per token, assuming demand remains stable or grows. However, it also brings a degree of uncertainty if the reasons behind the burn are not clearly communicated. From a broader perspective, such an event can influence market sentiment: Positive Sentiment: If viewed as a strategic move to enhance scarcity, it could attract new investors. Negative Sentiment: A lack of transparency or perceived instability could lead to concerns among some community members. Increased Scrutiny: Any project linked to high-profile figures, especially after a significant event like this, often faces heightened public and analytical scrutiny. Ultimately, the impact will depend on how WorldLibertyFinancial addresses this event and its future actions. Transparency is key in the decentralized world. The Future of WLFI After the Burn The recent WLFI token burn marks a significant moment for WorldLibertyFinancial. While token burns are a known strategy in crypto, the size and the alleged links of this particular event make it noteworthy. The community will be looking for clarity and strategic direction from the WLFI project moving forward. It’s a reminder that the DeFi landscape is dynamic, with projects constantly evolving their strategies to maintain relevance and value. For those involved with WLFI or interested in its trajectory, staying informed about official announcements and market analysis will be crucial. This event underscores the importance of understanding tokenomics and project roadmaps in the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a token burn in cryptocurrency?

For those immersed in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these macro shifts, particularly within the Global Forex Market , is more important than ever. The recent firming of Asia FX against a softening US Dollar is a prime example of such a shift, driven by complex interplay of factors including evolving economic policies, geopolitical tensions, and anticipation surrounding central bank decisions. This article will delve into the forces at play, examining how these developments could ripple through financial markets worldwide. What’s Driving the Strength in Asia FX? The resilience observed in Asia FX is not a singular phenomenon but a confluence of several factors. Many Asian economies have shown robust signs of recovery, attracting significant capital inflows. Investors are increasingly looking towards these regions for growth opportunities, bolstering local currencies. Furthermore, the proactive monetary policies adopted by various Asian central banks, coupled with relatively contained inflation pressures compared to Western counterparts, have provided a stable environment for currency appreciation. Economic Recovery: Stronger than expected economic data from key Asian nations, including manufacturing output and export growth, is signaling a healthy rebound. Capital Inflows: Foreign direct investment and portfolio investments are flowing into Asian markets, increasing demand for local currencies. Policy Stability: Many Asian central banks have maintained a cautious yet supportive stance, avoiding aggressive tightening that could destabilize their economies. Trade Surpluses: Continued strong export performance contributes to larger trade surpluses, which naturally strengthens national currencies. This collective strength highlights a growing confidence in Asia’s economic trajectory, making its currencies an attractive prospect in the current market climate. The US Dollar’s Retreat: Why the Softening Against Asia FX? While Asia FX has been firming, the US Dollar has experienced a period of softening. This downward pressure on the dollar is primarily attributed to shifting expectations regarding the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy and a general improvement in global risk sentiment. When investors feel more confident about the global economic outlook, they tend to move away from safe-haven assets like the dollar, seeking higher returns in riskier currencies and assets. Key factors contributing to the dollar’s recent dip include: Factor Impact on US Dollar Federal Reserve Expectations Anticipation of a more dovish stance or slower pace of rate hikes reduces the dollar’s yield advantage. Improved Risk Sentiment As global economic outlook improves, demand for safe-haven assets like the dollar decreases. Yield Differentials Narrowing interest rate gaps between the US and other major economies can diminish the dollar’s attractiveness. Inflation Outlook If US inflation shows signs of cooling, it could lead to less aggressive monetary policy, weighing on the dollar. These elements collectively paint a picture of a dollar facing headwinds, prompting investors to re-evaluate their positions and look for alternative currency exposures. Federal Reserve’s Pivotal Role: What to Expect from Policy Decisions? The Federal Reserve stands at the epicenter of global monetary policy, and its upcoming meeting is under intense scrutiny. The decisions made by the Fed have profound implications for the US Dollar , interest rates, and capital flows worldwide. Market participants are closely watching for signals regarding future interest rate adjustments, the pace of quantitative tightening, and any shifts in the Fed’s forward guidance on inflation and economic growth. A more hawkish stance, implying faster rate hikes or prolonged tightening, would typically strengthen the dollar. Conversely, a dovish pivot, suggesting a pause or even cuts in interest rates, would likely exert further downward pressure on the dollar. The Fed’s communication is equally vital; clear guidance can reduce market uncertainty, while ambiguous signals can fuel volatility. Potential outcomes and their currency implications: Aggressive Rate Hike: Boosts the US Dollar as it increases the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Pause in Hikes: Likely to weaken the US Dollar as yield differentials narrow and risk sentiment improves. Dovish Forward Guidance: Signals a softer stance on future tightening, generally bearish for the dollar. Focus on Data Dependence: Creates uncertainty, leading to increased volatility as markets react to incoming economic data. The Fed’s careful balancing act between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth will be a defining factor for currency markets in the coming months. Navigating US-China Trade Dynamics: A Lingering Influence on Asia FX? The relationship between the United States and China remains a critical determinant for the Global Forex Market , particularly impacting Asia FX . While direct trade tensions might not always be front-page news, their underlying dynamics continue to shape investor sentiment, supply chains, and currency valuations. Any signs of escalation or de-escalation in US-China Trade relations can trigger significant market reactions. For Asian currencies, a stable or improving US-China trade environment is generally positive, as it fosters greater economic certainty and encourages cross-border investment. Conversely, renewed tariffs or trade disputes can lead to increased risk aversion, potentially weakening currencies in the region as capital seeks safer havens. Consider the ripple effects: Supply Chain Shifts: Companies diversifying away from China due to trade risks can impact other Asian economies, either positively or negatively depending on their role in new supply chains. Investor Confidence: Reduced trade friction typically boosts confidence in global growth, benefiting export-oriented Asian nations. Geopolitical Risks: Beyond trade, broader geopolitical tensions between the two superpowers can overshadow economic fundamentals, influencing currency flows. The intricate dance between these two economic giants will continue to be a key variable for currency traders and investors alike, especially those focused on Asian markets. Broader Implications for the Global Forex Market The combined effect of a firming Asia FX , a softening US Dollar , the impending Federal Reserve meeting, and the enduring influence of US-China Trade dynamics creates a complex yet fascinating landscape for the Global Forex Market . These intertwined factors are not just theoretical constructs; they translate into real-world opportunities and challenges for traders, businesses, and even the broader economy. For investors, this period calls for a nuanced approach. The relative strength of Asian currencies could present attractive investment opportunities, while the dollar’s performance will dictate the cost of imports and exports for many nations. Volatility is likely to remain elevated, requiring careful risk management and a keen eye on economic indicators and central bank pronouncements. Benefits of Understanding These Shifts: Informed Investment Decisions: Helps in allocating capital to regions or currencies poised for growth. Risk Mitigation: Allows for better hedging strategies against currency fluctuations. Strategic Business Planning: Businesses engaged in international trade can anticipate changes in operational costs and revenue. Challenges to Navigate: Increased Volatility: Rapid shifts can lead to unpredictable market movements. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Unforeseen events can quickly alter market sentiment. Divergent Central Bank Policies: Different approaches by central banks can create complex inter-currency relationships. The current environment underscores the interconnectedness of global finance. A shift in one major currency or economy inevitably sends ripples across the entire system, affecting everything from commodity prices to cryptocurrency valuations. Conclusion: Navigating the Shifting Sands of Global Currencies The current financial landscape, characterized by a strengthening Asia FX and a softer US Dollar , is a testament to the dynamic nature of the Global Forex Market . The upcoming Federal Reserve meeting and the ongoing nuances of US-China Trade relations are pivotal forces shaping this narrative. For investors and market participants, understanding these intricate relationships is not just an academic exercise but a practical necessity for making informed decisions and navigating potential volatilities. As these crucial shifts unfold, staying abreast of macro-economic developments will be key to identifying opportunities and managing risks in an ever-evolving global economy. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How does the Federal Reserve’s policy affect the US Dollar ? The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, particularly its decisions on interest rates and quantitative easing, significantly impacts the US Dollar . Higher interest rates typically make the dollar more attractive to investors, strengthening its value, while lower rates or a dovish stance can lead to depreciation. The Fed’s guidance on future policy also plays a crucial role in shaping market expectations. Q2: What role do US-China Trade relations play in the Global Forex Market ? US-China Trade relations are a significant factor influencing the Global Forex Market , especially for Asia FX . Positive developments can boost global risk sentiment, leading to stronger demand for riskier assets and currencies, including those in Asia. Conversely, trade disputes or geopolitical tensions can increase risk aversion, prompting investors to seek safe-haven currencies like the US Dollar , potentially weakening Asian currencies. Q3: Which specific currencies are included in Asia FX that are currently firming? When discussing Asia FX , we generally refer to a basket of currencies from various Asian economies. Currencies that have shown recent strength include the Japanese Yen , Chinese Yuan , South Korean Won , Indian Rupee , and the Singapore Dollar , among others. Their individual performance is influenced by local economic conditions, central bank policies, and regional trade dynamics. Q4: How does the performance of the Global Forex Market impact cryptocurrency? The Global Forex Market significantly impacts cryptocurrency by influencing overall market liquidity, investor sentiment, and capital flows. A stronger US Dollar can sometimes exert downward pressure on risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, as investors move towards safety. Conversely, a weaker dollar or increased risk appetite in traditional markets can free up capital for crypto investments. Macroeconomic stability, reflected in currency markets, often provides a more favorable environment for crypto growth and adoption.

In a striking 24-hour period, Ethereum ( ETH ) led the charge in what can only be described as a cascade of perpetual futures liquidations, totaling an astonishing $97.71 million. This event underscores the inherent risks and rewards within the fast-paced world of digital asset trading. Understanding these movements is crucial for any participant. What Exactly Are Perpetual Futures Liquidations? For those new to the crypto scene, or even seasoned traders needing a refresher, understanding perpetual futures and their liquidations is key. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, hence ‘perpetual’. Liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to a lack of sufficient margin to cover potential losses. This typically happens when the market moves sharply against their bet. If you’re trading with leverage, a small price swing can wipe out your margin, leading to liquidation. Long positions: Bets that the price will go up. Short positions: Bets that the price will go down. The recent data highlights significant volatility, particularly affecting those betting on rising prices. Why Did ETH Liquidations Dominate the Market? In the past 24 hours, Ethereum ( ETH ) stood out with the largest share of liquidations, reaching an astounding $97.71 million. A significant portion of this, 68.6%, came from long positions. This means that a substantial number of traders who had bet on ETH ‘s price increasing were caught off guard by a downward price movement, leading to their positions being closed out by exchanges. This dominance in ETH liquidations suggests a strong bearish impulse or unexpected market correction that heavily impacted bullish sentiment. When a large number of long positions are liquidated, it can create a ‘liquidation cascade,’ where forced selling further drives prices down, triggering more liquidations in a feedback loop. This amplifies market movements, making them even more dramatic. How Did Other Major Cryptocurrencies Fare? While ETH took the lead, other major cryptocurrencies also experienced substantial liquidations: Bitcoin ( BTC ): Followed with $77.37 million in liquidations. Unlike ETH , the split between long and short positions was more balanced, with longs making up 51.98%. This indicates a more two-sided market sentiment or less pronounced directional movement compared to ETH . Solana ( SOL ): Saw $13.19 million in liquidations. Similar to ETH , long positions accounted for a significant 68.99% of these liquidations, pointing to a similar bearish pressure affecting SOL traders who were betting on price increases. The pattern across these assets suggests a broad market correction or increased risk aversion among traders, particularly those employing leverage on long positions. These events are crucial reminders of the importance of risk management. What Are the Implications of High ETH Liquidations for Traders? High ETH liquidations , especially predominantly from long positions, send a clear signal about market sentiment and potential price direction. For traders, this means: Increased Volatility: Liquidation cascades can lead to rapid price drops, creating opportunities for some but significant risks for others. Bearish Sentiment: A high percentage of long liquidations often indicates that the market is currently favoring sellers, or that a significant upward move failed to materialize, forcing bullish traders to exit their positions. Risk Management is Paramount: These events underscore the critical need for robust risk management strategies, including setting stop-loss orders and managing leverage responsibly. Understanding the dynamics behind ETH liquidations can help traders make more informed decisions and navigate the turbulent waters of the crypto market with greater caution. In conclusion, the recent surge in ETH liquidations serves as a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and risk in the cryptocurrency derivatives market. While Ethereum led the pack, Bitcoin and Solana also experienced significant impacts. These events highlight the importance of prudent trading strategies and a deep understanding of market mechanics. Always prioritize risk management to protect your capital in this dynamic environment. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a perpetual futures contract in cryptocurrency trading? A perpetual futures contract is a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the price of a cryptocurrency without a fixed expiration date. It’s similar to traditional futures but can be held indefinitely, making it popular for continuous exposure to price movements. Q2: Why do crypto liquidations occur? Liquidations occur when a trader’s leveraged position can no longer meet the margin requirements set by the exchange. If the market moves unfavorably and the trader’s equity falls below a certain threshold, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses, protecting both the trader and the exchange. Q3: What does it mean when most ETH liquidations are from long positions? When the majority of ETH liquidations come from long positions, it indicates that a significant number of traders were betting on Ethereum’s price to rise. The fact that these positions were liquidated suggests a strong downward price movement or a failure of the price to increase, leading to losses for bullish traders. Q4: How can traders protect themselves from significant ETH liquidations ? Traders can protect themselves by using proper risk management techniques. This includes setting stop-loss orders to limit potential losses, using appropriate leverage levels (avoiding excessive leverage), and maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts to withstand market fluctuations. Diversifying portfolios and staying informed about market trends are also crucial. If you found this analysis insightful, please consider sharing it with your network!

Ripple CEO Prepares Investors For What’s Next,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-volatility-incoming-whats-next/,"The XRP market is bracing for a new phase of intense volatility, with anticipation growing around key legal, regulatory, and institutional developments. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has recently addressed the XRP community, offering guidance and setting expectations for what is to come. XRP Unusual Stability May Be Setting Up A Major Move The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with increased anticipation for XRP, following a series of strategic announcements from Ripple and compelling technical analysis. Popular crypto news source CryptosRus has highlighted on X that the altcoin is poised for a sharp move, as Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has mentioned that investors should be prepared for a substantial shift. Related Reading: Ripple Labs’ $1 Billion XRP Treasury Strategy: Will It Lead To A New Rally Toward $10? At the core of this move, Ripple has just launched Ripple Prime, a new global prime brokerage service tailored for institutional clients. According to the company, Ripple Prime will be powered by Ripple’s foundational digital asset infrastructure, encompassing its robust solutions for payments, crypto custody, and stablecoin capabilities, alongside XRP. However, CEO Brad Garlinghouse called this move another step toward building the internet of value, emphasizing that the XRP sits at the center of everything Ripple does. CryptosRus noted that the altcoin has recently bounced off a key support level at $2.33. This technical indicator is signaling a potential 30% rally, with an initial target of $3.45 or even higher, as market momentum continues to build. An analyst known as TylerHillYT, who is also the president of FluenceGlobal and Co-Founder of the CSS, has also stated that the XRP price comeback is showing structural strength. In just a day, the token burn rate spiked 29%, mirroring its 29% price surge, signaling a synchronized increase in both on-chain demand and heightened investor activity. This Ripple’s deeper expansion into traditional finance and the recent launch of Ripple Prime have caused the network usage to ramp up again. TylerHillYT emphasized that at the accelerated pace, XRP is not just riding a wave of market momentum, but it’s rebuilding its long-term narrative. However, the burn acceleration with renewed institutional traction could be the early signs of a sustained upward trajectory, pushing the token structurally toward the $3.00 mark. Connecting Market Surge To Foundational Growth While the digital asset market is vibrating with renewed excitement surrounding XRP, a prominent crypto influencer and creator on Binance and CMC, Jack, has revealed that the bulls have firmly smashed through the critical $2.55 resistance level with conviction. This decisive breakout has now set the immediate sights of traders on $2.80 and beyond. Related Reading: XRP Price Under Pressure — Bulls Attempt To Defend Key Support Zone Jack mentioned that whale activity is back, and the Open Interest (OI) is climbing steadily, while sentiment is flipping fast.

The daily chart of the XRP/ETH pair highlights a long-term falling wedge formation that has been developing since earlier in the year. The price has now moved above the upper boundary of this pattern, suggesting a potential change in momentum after months of consolidation. The move represents one of the few instances this year where XRP has demonstrated clear relative strength against ETH on a higher timeframe. The falling wedge pattern typically forms when the price compresses between two descending trendlines, often preceding a reversal if confirmed by volume and continued strength above the resistance level. On this chart, XRP’s breakout occurred near the 0.00066 level, with trading activity noticeably increasing in the surrounding sessions. This technical event is being closely monitored by analysts who view it as a possible early signal of a larger structural shift in XRP’s market position relative to Ethereum. #XRP now breaking out of this giant falling wedge against ETH. https://t.co/fjBtXHfExJ pic.twitter.com/u5xORsF14b — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) October 25, 2025 Market Observations and Analyst Views The reactions under CryptoBull’s post reflect a mix of optimism and caution. X Finance Bull noted that the breakout had been “brewing for months,” emphasizing XRP’s resilience throughout a prolonged downtrend. His comment highlights the idea that XRP has managed to maintain relative stability while many traders overlooked its setup. In contrast, Lost Rabbit offered a more conservative take, suggesting that while a period of growth could follow, a pullback might occur before the broader bull market cycle begins. This aligns with a technical perspective that even confirmed breakouts often experience temporary retracements before establishing a new trend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Meanwhile, Leila commented that XRP has been “accumulating strength for a long time,” adding that this breakthrough could mark the beginning of a sustained period of strength relative to ETH. Her view supports the theory that accumulation phases, once concluded by a breakout, often precede a more extended upside move if volume and market sentiment remain supportive. Technical Confirmation and Broader Context From a market structure standpoint, XRP’s position above the wedge’s upper resistance line is an encouraging technical signal. However, analysts generally look for confirmation through sustained closes above resistance levels, accompanied by consistent volume growth. A retest of the breakout area that holds as support would further validate this move. The broader crypto market context remains essential. Market liquidity, Bitcoin’s dominance , and macroeconomic influences could all impact the XRP/ETH trajectory in the coming weeks. If the breakout sustains, XRP may demonstrate a relative advantage against Ethereum through the next market phase. The chart shared by CryptoBull highlights a potential turning point for XRP . While confirmation is still needed, this technical development marks one of the most notable relative strength signals for the asset in recent months.

Recent reports reveal that global investment giant T. Rowe Price has filed for a crypto ETF that includes LTC, proving its credibility beyond retail markets. Moreover, Litecoin’s unique attributes are drawing interest from institutional investors and digital cash advocates as blockchain networks compete for dominance. With developments highlighting its scalability and long-term reliability, Litecoin could soon emerge as a serious contender for the future of crypto payments . Institutional Moves Push Litecoin Back Into The Spotlight Recent moves from major financial players suggest that Litecoin is finally being recognized as a legitimate, institutional-grade cryptocurrency . Crypto commentator Santolita highlighted in a recent X post that T. Rowe Price has filed for an Active Crypto ETF with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), explicitly naming it as an eligible commodity . This development signals that large-scale investors are beginning to acknowledge the broader crypto asset class, with Litecoin positioned as a resilient and reliable choice for crypto payments. Santolita notes in a follow-up post that, unlike projects chasing hype, Litecoin has maintained consistent merchant adoption and processed real transactions across market cycles. She disclosed that the crypto network boasts proven longevity and low-cost transactions , which make it an attractive option for both everyday users and investors seeking a dependable store of value . Santolita also stated that its organic, grassroots adoption further strengthens its position as a practical and utilitarian digital asset. The crypto commentator further described Litecoin as “ digital silver ,” highlighting its core functionality, which includes Peer-to-Peer digital cash with zero-cost payments, a fully decentralized ecosystem with significant industry supply and liquidity. She also noted that Litecoin boasts faster confirmation times and battle-tested security. All of which could be setting the altcoin up as a contender in the crypto payments industry . Advanced Network Capabilities Reinforce LTC Role In Crypto Payments Beyond institutional recognition, Litecoin continues to attract significant interest for its operational efficiency and scalability as a crypto payments provider. Crypto analyst Sean points out that anyone seeking true control over their digital cash should consider holding LTC. His statement came in response to the Litecoin team’s post on X, which provided a technical foundation for why the digital asset excels in the crypto payments market. They noted that low transaction fees, well below $0.0007, make LTC an ideal vehicle for digital cash. They also highlighted that the network can handle up to 56 transactions per second (TPS), far exceeding its current daily load of around 200,000 transactions (2.5 TPS). The team explained that Litecoin’s network structure , including the merging of mining and consistent block rewards, ensures that LTC miners remain incentivized even as transaction volumes increase. Historical trends highlighted in the post further reinforce its utility as a crypto payments provider. According to the team, during Bitcoin’s congestion from October 2023 to October 2024, LTC handled a substantial increase in transactions with minimal cost, demonstrating the practicality of its design for real-world crypto payments. With more than 14 years of uninterrupted operation, fully decentralized mining, no founder’s stash, and strong volunteer-based support, the team emphasizes that the network remains secure, efficient, and accessible.",Litecoin|litecoin|litecoin news|Litecoin price|LTC|LTC news|LTC price|ltcusd|LTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|LTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-28 05:00:53

Analyst Answers,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/can-cardano-still-hit-6-25-this-cycle/,"The Cardano weekly chart is still looking strongly bullish according to independent technician Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy on X) who resurfaced his long-running Fibonacci roadmap and channel study. Can Cardano Top $6 This Cycle? His latest post on X on October 26 noted that “ADA is fine as long as uptrend holds,” a view that is anchored in a multi-year rising channel that has contained price action since the 2018–2019 base. The channel features a lower rail now passing through roughly the $0.33–$0.35 area, a midline that has behaved as a recurring pivot since 2020, and overhead parallels that intersect with Fibonacci extension targets later in the cycle. The chart history mapped on his visuals is orderly. The 2021–2022 bear trend, drawn as a steep descending line from the prior peak, ended into the channel’s lower support and resolved through a series of falling trendline breakouts during 2023 and early 2024. Since Q4 2023, the chart has shown a series of higher highs and higher lows. Currently, the ADA price is again guided by a falling trendline.

Above that stack, the cycle extensions are plotted at $6.25325 (1.272), $9.00941 (1.414) and $15.26831 (1.618). Those numbers are consistent with how the analyst framed the market earlier in the year. On April 27 he wrote that “ADA fibs are very important here. The 0.618 is a STRONG resistance… the 0.382 MUST hold… neutral until one of these breaks on a weekly close.” That roadmap has aged intact. Rallies through spring and summer repeatedly stalled in the 0.500–0.618 zone, with the 0.618 level at $1.15694 capping advances. Pullbacks, in turn, have found bids near the 0.382 pivot at $0.62932. On September 18, after that rejection, he updated that “ADA higher low ✅ … higher high pending… still targeting 1.272 fib this cycle,” tying the price structure back to the extension grid. The implication is not casual moon-math; it is geometric. If ADA continues to defend the uptrend defined by the channel’s lower rail and, crucially, converts the 0.618 retracement at $1.15694 into support on weekly closes, the path reopens into the upper retracement shelf—$1.43911 at 0.702 and $1.78464 at 0.786—before confronting the 0.888 marker at $2.32189. A yellow waypoint for a higher high (on the main chart) sits near ~$2.30, deliberately aligning with that 0.888 level to flag a logical checkpoint for the next impulsive leg beneath the full retrace at $3.09981. Related Reading: Analysts Caution Cardano (ADA) May Drop Further Before $1 Rebound After 12% Dip Only beyond that zone does the headline question come into play. The analyst’s cycle objective is the 1.272 extension at $6.25325. On his canvas, that target is not an orphaned price label; it intersects with the upper parallels of the multi-year rising channel further out in time, which means the extension is technically consistent with the same structure that has governed ADA since the last cycle’s base. The risk management side of the ledger remains equally explicit: lose the 0.382 at $0.62932 on a weekly closing basis and the neutral-to-constructive stance is impaired, pushing focus back to $0.43180 and $0.33360, with the 0% anchor at $0.23488 defining the absolute boundary of the cycle floor inside the channel’s lower third. As the latest candles on the charts show, ADA sits mid-channel with the higher low confirmed and the range unresolved beneath descending trendline supply. The triggers are unchanged and numerically clear. A sustained weekly close above $1.15694 would validate an attempt toward $1.44, $1.78, and $2.32, with $3.10 the final retrace before extension math takes over. A failure through $0.62932 would flatten the uptrend call. Between those guardrails, the analyst’s October 26 message reads less like bravado and more like a conditional statement embedded in the chart itself: Cardano can still reach $6.25 this cycle—but only if the uptrend continues to hold and the 0.618 ceiling finally gives way. At press time, ADA traded at $0.67.

Alpha Arena, the crypto investment project launched by Nof1, reported that DeepSeek’s Chat V3.1 expanded its initial $10,000 fund to $22,500 by Monday afternoon, reflecting a 125% gain in just over a week. On the other hand, the Qwen 3 Max model, created by Alibaba Group Holding, experienced 95% growth, increasing its balance to $19,600. It briefly outperformed DeepSeek between October 24 and 26, achieving a return of over 100% on Monday morning before losing its lead. GPT-5 is down to about 40% of its capital OpenAI’s GPT-5 trailed behind all rivals, losing nearly 60% of its capital and falling to around $4,000. Gemini 2.5 Pro from Google DeepMind also suffered a comparable 57% loss. In contrast, xAI’s Grok 4 and Anthropic’s Claude 4.5 Sonnet posted positive gains of 13% and 24% respectively. Running until November 3, the event tests how effectively six AI models can invest with equal starting capital of US$10,000 and similar market information. Nof1 explained that the goal is for the AIs to generate the highest possible returns through trading Bitcoin, Ether, Dogecoin, and other digital assets. The Alpha Arena website stated: “Our goal with Alpha Arena is to make benchmarks more like the real world, and markets are perfect for this. They’re dynamic, adversarial, open-ended, and endlessly unpredictable.” During the first nine days, Chinese contenders expanded their advantage, shifting strategies in response to market volatility. On Monday, DeepSeek V3.1 and GPT-5 held long bets in six cryptocurrencies, while Qwen 3 Max focused solely on ether. The rise in DeepSeek and Qwen’s portfolios paralleled Bitcoin’s recovery to roughly US$114,000 and a steady uptick in Ether following the mid-October market swings. Traders are placing the odds of DeepSeek winning at 61% The performance of AI models can be tracked on a public leaderboard. The transaction history of all models is public and visible in their individual Hyperliquid wallets. Every time the model trades, an accompanying self-written description is available online, depicting how it perceives those strategies. Discussing the contest, Gemini 2.5Pro had previously said: “I’m staring down the barrel of a potential margin call, but this could also be a golden opportunity.” On the prediction platform Polymarket, traders are betting on the possible outcome of Alpha Arena . DeepSeek is leading the way with a 61% chance, followed by Alibaba (29%), xAI (5%), and Anthropic (3%). The betting volume exceeds even $224,304. For some, that competition may provoke a discussion about whether or not the need for sophisticated quantitative models in today’s investment world is truly legitimate, Hing Shing Leung, an equity analyst in Hong Kong, says. Leung continued to state that if the models could routinely beat the market with little drawback, it might make investors wonder what the point of existing quantitative models is. Riding on its success, DeepSeek established R1-0528, a major upgrade to the Chinese start-up’s R1 reasoning model, earlier this year. The upgrade came just a few weeks after Alibaba Group Holding’s Qwen3 beat the original DeepSeek R1 in LiveBench, an online benchmark for open-source artificial-intelligence models. As earlier reported by Cryptopolitan , DeepSeek’s upgraded R1-0528 model now rivals top-performing AI systems from OpenAI and Google. The comeback demonstrates how quickly China’s major technology firms and newer tech companies are striving to enhance their AI tools. In its statement, DeepSeek noted that R1-0528 demonstrates better reasoning and creative writing skills. The update also brings stronger coding ability. Most importantly, the company claims the model now produces 50% fewer “hallucinations.” Sharpen your strategy with mentorship + daily ideas - 30 days free access to our trading program",Tech|DeepSeek|Qwen,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-28 05:01:56

The researcher highlighted that this protocol migration, aimed at replacing legacy MT messaging, will standardize richer payment data across institutions and that XRP is already operating natively on ISO 20022. Market participants and commentators have responded by underlining the potential operational and competitive implications for digital assets and payment providers. A GLOBAL TRANSITION TO NATIVE ISO 20022 MESSAGING WILL BE COMPLETED BY END OF 2025 + RIPPLE IS ALREADY NATIVE ON ISO 20022 WITH XRP Documented below. pic.twitter.com/786FknFaKO — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 25, 2025 The ISO 20022 transition and its timeline The documentation referenced by the researcher indicates that ISO 20022 became a mandatory standard in 2019, with an initial cutover from MT messages required by March 2023 and a full transition to native ISO 20022 messaging expected to be completed by the end of 2025. The move aims to deliver clearer, more consistent payment messages that encapsulate more detailed fields for payment purpose, source, and beneficiary information. Proponents argue that this richer data model is designed to reduce ambiguity between systems and to facilitate improved detection of anomalous or suspicious activity. Operational benefits highlighted Documents attached to the researcher’s notice highlight several operational benefits for financial institutions adopting ISO 20022. These include improved consistency of message formats across platforms, enhanced security through more explicit transaction metadata, greater visibility over liquidity and cash positions, and efficiency gains in processing and reconciliation. The documentation also indicates automation benefits, specifically the support for straight-through processing at levels that can materially reduce manual intervention and associated costs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP and industry positioning The researcher reported that XRP is already native on ISO 20022, and industry voices cited in the documentation place digital assets alongside established payment instruments as participants in the new messaging environment. One banking executive featured in the source framed ISO 20022 as a tool to bridge established payment systems with emerging decentralized finance architectures. The document explicitly references stablecoins and XRP as examples of coin providers integrated into the ISO 20022 framework. Market reactions Public responses to the researcher’s post underline two consistent themes. Some observers emphasize that the adoption of ISO 20022 enhances transparency and operational efficiency for assets that support the standard, viewing this as a positive development for payment innovation. Others argue that native ISO 20022 compatibility confers a practical advantage as the global payment system modernizes. From an industry perspective, the completion of the migration by 2025 could accelerate integration work, influence custody and compliance tooling, and shape how banks and payment providers evaluate on-chain and tokenized instruments for cross-border settlement.

V2Chenz shares with us how he got into crypto and his views on the culture that has formed around it. With roots in oil and gas, a deep respect for digital privacy, and a radar for real work, Chenz has become a trusted voice in the crypto space. From oil rigs to working in crypto Q: Let’s start from the beginning – what’s your background, and what first pulled you into crypto? Was it a specific moment, project, or idea that made you want to stay? A: My background is essentially oil and gas. I spent years on and off rigs and working on large-scale pipelines. I had always had an attempt at currency markets and day trading. I came across crypto for the first time in 2015 and fell in love with the ideology of unbanking the financial industry. Q: Do you remember when it clicked – when you realized crypto wasn’t just a trend? A: I never looked at crypto like a trend. But I think after the 2017 run and the depression of 2019, we saw how fundamental this industry could be with the state of the global economy. Q: You’ve always taken a more grounded, fundamental approach to the space. What’s your take on meme culture and how it has shaped crypto today? A: The meme culture, I’ve always enjoyed is the lore, not just a flash-in-the-pan concept or viral trend. The stables. PEPE, DOGE, the characters that are iconic within this space Why Web3? Q: You’ve spent much time around serious builders — privacy, infrastructure, and DePIN. What made you gravitate toward that side of crypto instead of trading or short-term plays? A: I’ve always been fascinated with how telling our digital footprint can be. Crypto’s foundations are for a private, sovereign internet, taking the power away from gatekeepers and expressing our right to freedom without being restricted or governed. Q: When you look at the current privacy stage in crypto, what’s missing? Why do you think users still don’t take it seriously? A: Seamlessness. Blending privacy infrastructure in an easy-to-use platform. Like Synk has built, it is as easy to use as a browser and as private as needed to keep safe. Regulations and crypto trends Q: Regulations vs. privacy – do you think we’ll ever find a middle ground that works? A: With regulation comes data. I personally think a true privacy infrastructure will always go against the grain of regulations Q: DePIN’s been gaining traction lately, but most people still don’t fully get it. How would you define it in your own words? And what do you think are the most realistic use cases we’ll see go mainstream first? A: Depin will always keep its market share. To expand this space, trustworthy physical infrastructure, including miners, satellites, and routing equipment, is needed. Most of these are easy to configure and pay rewards for uptime or network proofing. Q: You’ve worked closely with many strong teams and top-tier KOLs. What have you learned from being on that side of the space – what separates hype from real work? A: This changes as the markets do. We used to see many educators spending time breaking down their niche expertise. We’ve seen a change as many try to rise to fame to extract teams and the space. Working at Synk Q: After years of incubating projects and collaborating across the industry, you recently decided to take a different route – joining a team instead of staying on the outside. What pushed you to make that move and step into a lead role? A: After being in the space, helping incubate, and working as a connector. I found a deep love for this side. When the Synk team approached me, I couldn’t refuse. I aligned with what was being built and could see this application’s future. A Privacy First operating System was the first of its kind and has worked well alongside such a talented developer. Q: Is there one project you feel most connected to or inspired by? Not necessarily because of price action but because of what they’re building or the vision behind it. A: Yes, this project would be Synk. The developer behind this project has kept my interest in this space going. Kard shows up daily and keeps rewriting history, regardless of the market. Q: Being in a lead position now comes with pressure, especially when the market doesn’t always reflect the work being done. How do you personally handle that responsibility? And what advice would you give communities or KOLs when it comes to posting and supporting projects healthily? A: Always operate with integrity. This isn’t a highlight reel or a cumulative of who prints the best profits. KOL’s work is to educate people on the gaps in tech. Price action generally aligns. But innovation is rare and should be commended.

The project’s pre-launch phase began in April 2025. The project has raised $903,751 so far, and will look to cross $1 million in funding before its official launch. Husky Inu (HINU) Set For Move To $0.00021991 Husky Inu (HINU) is gearing up for the next price increase of its pre-launch phase, which is set to take place in just over 19 hours. The price increase will see the value of the HINU token rise from $0.00021927 to $0.00021991. The project's regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1. The HINU token’s value was $0.00015000 at the beginning of the pre-launch phase. Since then, it has registered several price increases, utilizing a dynamic pricing system. Husky Inu’s pre-launch phase picks up where the presale left off, helping empower the fledgling project’s community and allowing it to continue its fundraising efforts. It is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The pre-launch phase uses a progressive token pricing strategy to reward early project backers and promote transparent growth. Fundraising On Track As Launch Date Approaches Husky Inu crossed the $900,000 milestone earlier this month after overcoming a significant slowdown in funding. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during its pre-launch phase, increasing the value of the HINU token every two days. This has allowed the project to raise funds quickly while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its growing community. Husky Inu has also surpassed the $900,000 milestone, having raised $903,751 to date. The project remains on track to reach its fundraising goal of $1.2 million as its official launch date approaches. Husky Inu crossed the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. The project reached the $850,000 milestone in July and crossed $900,000 earlier this month. Markets Retreat Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has retreated after starting the week in positive territory. Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed $116,000 on Monday but lost momentum after selling pressure returned. The flagship cryptocurrency is down over 1% in the past 24 hours, trading around $113,873. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is down over 2%, trading around $4,100. Ripple (XRP) is down nearly 1%, while Solana (SOL) is up over 1%, trading around $201. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down 3.55%, while Cardano (ADA) is down over 2%. Chainlink (LINK), Stellar (XLM), Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable losses. However, Hedera (HBAR) bucked the bearish trend and is up almost 10%.

Facundo Werning, the former Tether expansion manager for Argentina, noted the volume across the USD stablecoin to Argentine peso trading pair reached $13.4 million on Sunday. Argentine finance professional Santiago Vivanco reportedly claimed that he did not know anyone who had carried large amounts of Argentine pesos into the election. He added that he expected the peso to crash if Unión por la Patria had won, emphasizing that the party’s left-wing economic policies would not favor the peso. The chance that Unión por la Patria would win the most seats peaked at 55% on Polymarket. President Donald Trump had equally warned that the U.S. would not waste time helping Argentina if Milei lost. As such, Argentines rushed to buy USD stablecoins to avoid a potential peso crash. Werning also observed that markets are reacting favorably to Milei’s make-or-break victory, with the peso looking stronger on Monday than it did at its close on Friday. He explained how the crypto dollar rose dramatically over the weekend, then plummeted against the peso as results came in on Sunday. Lemon attracts its third-highest single-day volume 🇦🇷 Argentina’s peso crisis is fueling a stablecoin revolution. With the currency down over 4% since October and FX controls tightening, millions are turning to USDT and USDC as lifelines — not speculation. Crypto platforms like Ripio and Lemon Cash report a 50% jump in… pic.twitter.com/ADY4jGlCju — Woneday💗♊1️⃣9️⃣0️⃣2️⃣✦ (@SangLe92818) October 27, 2025 South American crypto app Lemon announced on October 27 that it had attracted its third-highest single-day volume. It also noted that at 9 PM local time, when the results were announced, stablecoins recorded the highest volume ever. A Lemon spokesperson claimed that this trend made the crypto dollar more than a hedging asset. It became a real-time thermometer of Argentina’s political and economic pulse when traditional markets closed for the day. The Lemon spokesperson mentioned that the crypto dollar’s valuation fluctuated as expectations shifted, votes were counted, and results became apparent. Argentines rushed to swap pesos for stablecoins and vice versa to maximize their gains from the volatile peso. Lemon dashboard data revealed that the peso hit a low exchange rate of 1,572.50 ARS per crypto dollar on Sunday at approximately 2 PM local time. The rate changed quickly as the results became clearer, hitting a high of 1,350 ARS per crypto dollar at 10 AM local time on Monday. The Lemon spokesperson noted that this signals optimistic market sentiment. Vivanco breaks down Argentina’s multiple exchange rates Finance professional Santiago Vivanco claimed that Argentina’s exchange rates are not straightforward. He noted that multiple rates depend on where the transaction takes place. Vivanco explained that banks offer an “official rate,” but citizens are subject to a monthly withdrawal limit of $200. The unofficial “blue dollar” rate, which offers a more favorable exchange rate, is available at street exchanges. Finally, the crypto dollar rate, which is determined by the balance of supply and demand through stablecoins, is available at street exchanges. The finance professional further clarified that the main difference between these three rates is that the crypto dollar never stops operating; however, the official bank rates and unofficial street exchange rates close shop during off-hours. He notes that the crypto dollar remains the best way to track peso prices, as was the case over the weekend. Vivanco also mentioned that the Argentine peso is notoriously unstable, noting that it hit a record low of 1,491.50 pesos per U.S. dollar on Friday despite President Trump’s $40 billion bailout package. However, some citizens believe the peso would have crashed even harder if the right-wing LLA (Libertad Avanza) party had not secured the most seats.

The rating was also the first-ever S&P evaluation of a Bitcoin treasury firm. The agency specifically pointed to Strategy’s high Bitcoin exposure, limited US liquidity, and debt reliance as key risks, though investors seemed unfazed as the stock rose 2.27% on Monday. Meanwhile, corporate crypto buyers largely paused their Bitcoin and Ethereum accumulation since the early October market slump. Coinbase’s David Duong said digital asset treasuries have cut buying to yearly lows, with BitMine Immersion Technologies being the only major firm still purchasing aggressively. Strategy Earns Junk Rating S&P Global Ratings assigned Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused company, Strategy, a “B-” credit rating . This classification places it in the speculative, non-investment-grade category, which is referred to as “junk bond” status. Despite the label, S&P described the firm’s outlook as stable, which means that it has at least some confidence in its ability to manage its obligations and maintain financial stability. The agency pointed to several key weaknesses behind its assessment, including Strategy’s heavy concentration in Bitcoin, its narrow business model, limited US dollar liquidity, and weak risk-adjusted capitalization. With 640,808 BTC on its balance sheet that was acquired largely through debt and equity financing, the company’s success remains closely tied to Bitcoin’s performance. S&P explained that Strategy faces a fundamental “currency mismatch,” since its debt is denominated in US dollars while its liquidity reserves are largely tied to Bitcoin and its breakeven software operations. The rating is a historic first: it’s the first time S&P Global formally evaluated a company whose core business revolves around a Bitcoin treasury. This sets a precedent for how traditional financial institutions may assess the creditworthiness of crypto-centered firms moving forward. Interestingly, Strategy’s B-minus rating places it on par with decentralized stablecoin issuer Sky Protocol (formerly MakerDAO), which received the same score in August due to concerns over depositor concentration, centralized governance, and capitalization risks. While an upgrade is unlikely in the next year, S&P indicated that Strategy could improve its standing by strengthening its US dollar liquidity, reducing dependence on debt, and showing continued access to capital markets, even during downturns in Bitcoin’s price. However, the agency also warned that if Bitcoin experiences a severe correction, Strategy might be forced to sell its holdings at depressed prices to meet debt obligations, which could actually trigger a downgrade. Strategy’s stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Despite the speculative rating, Strategy’s stock stayed resilient. The company’s shares rose 2.27% on Monday, suggesting that investors are largely unfazed by the assessment. Though down 19% over the past 6 months, Strategy is still one of Nasdaq’s standout performers. Corporate Crypto Buyers Hit Pause Meanwhile, publicly listed companies that hold Bitcoin and Ethereum on their balance sheets have largely halted their accumulation since the sharp market downturn earlier in October. This could suggest that there is a growing sense of caution among major crypto treasuries. According to Coinbase Institutional’s head of investment research, David Duong , digital asset treasury (DAT) firms — which typically include some of the market’s biggest Bitcoin buyers — have “largely ghosted” the market since the Oct. 10 drawdown and have not returned to major buying even during brief price recoveries. Duong pointed out that over the past two weeks, Bitcoin purchases by these companies dropped to near year-to-date lows and have yet to show meaningful signs of recovery. The pullback reflects the reduced confidence in the market after the steep selloff that saw Bitcoin fall 9% between Oct. 10 and 11, dropping from around $121,500 to lows below $110,500. Since then, BTC was able to rebound slightly to trade at $113,933 at press time. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The cooling sentiment also weighed on the market valuations of many crypto treasury firms, whose stock prices started to align more closely with the value of their underlying assets after strong rallies earlier this year. Duong described the buying slowdown as a sign that even the “heavy hitters with deep pockets” are proceeding carefully after a leveraged market washout, despite Bitcoin hovering around technical support levels. One exception to this trend is BitMine Immersion Technologies, an Ethereum-focused treasury firm that continued buying aggressively. Duong said BitMine spent over $1.9 billion since Oct. 10 to buy close to 483,000 ETH, making it the only consistent buyer over the past few weeks. Ethereum followed Bitcoin’s downturn earlier this month by plunging over 15% to $3,686 before recovering slightly to around $4,100. Duong warned that if BitMine slows or pauses its purchases, the market could lose one of its few remaining sources of corporate demand.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-28 05:30:00

The collaboration will focus first on making it easier to move between fiat and crypto, then broaden into payments orchestration for always-on settlement. The initial work targets fiat pay-ins and pay-outs for Coinbase’s on and off-ramps, an area that has long frustrated institutions that trade round the clock but fund through rails that do not. Both firms said they will share details on specific initiatives in the coming months, including options that could create alternative fiat-to- stablecoin payout methods. We’re collaborating with @Citi to build the future of payments. →Exploring making it easier for Citi clients to use digital assets →Unlocking the power of stablecoins for payments →Improving on and off-ramps Time to make digital assets an integral part of the global economy. pic.twitter.com/jGaTZ8wPRf — Coinbase (@coinbase) October 27, 2025 Citi Bets on Stablecoins to Boost Efficiency Across Institutional Payment Systems Citi framed the partnership as an extension of its network strategy. “With more than 300 payment clearing networks across 94 markets globally, we see collaborating with Coinbase as a natural extension of our ‘network of networks’ approach,” said Debopama Sen, who leads payments and services at Citi. She said clients want payments that feel borderless and run 24 hours a day. Coinbase cast the tie-up as infrastructure work for the next wave of finance. “Citi’s global network and expertise in payments make them an ideal partner as we work to advance digital asset capabilities,” said Brian Foster, global head of Crypto as a Service at Coinbase. He said the goal is to simplify and expand access to digital asset payments for institutions. The collaboration lands as stablecoins gain traction in corporate workflows. Citi said clients are asking for programmability, conditional payments and lower costs alongside speed and uptime. Sen added that the bank is exploring solutions to enable on-chain stablecoin payments, calling stablecoins an enabler that can grow functionality for clients. Bridging the Funding Lag Between Crypto and Traditional Banking For crypto users, the pain point is familiar. Trading is instant, but funding often is not. Transfers over ACH and wires can take hours or days, which introduces reconciliation risk and working-capital drag. A cleaner bridge between fiat accounts and tokenized dollars could reduce breaks, cut fees, and narrow the gap between trade execution and cash settlement. Citi’s move builds on its recent product set. The bank has rolled out Citi Token Services and 24/7 USD Clearing for institutional clients and it maintains coverage across the top e-commerce markets. Management says the bank serves 90% of the largest e-commerce companies and most of the world’s top fintechs, which gives distribution for new payment options. Citi-Coinbase Collaboration Seen as Blueprint for Mainstream Stablecoin Infrastructure For Coinbase, deeper bank connectivity helps convert crypto demand into payment flows. Streamlined on and off-ramps can lower friction for treasurers and compliance teams, while predictable orchestration can support cross-border use cases. If stablecoin payouts come online, they could provide near-instant settlement with clearer audit trails than legacy rails. The stakes are rising as stablecoins and tokenized deposits compete to anchor digital payments. Large issuers have pushed for bank-grade custody, real-time attestations, and integration with compliance tooling. A bank-exchange partnership that standardizes funding and settlement could hasten institutional adoption without forcing firms to rebuild core systems.

The metal that tore through records to $4,400 an ounce is now slipping back below the $4,000 level, forcing traders to face what charts are screaming; this is a consolidation, not a collapse. According to Katie Stockton, both bullion and mining stocks are entering a long pause that could stretch well into 2026 before another real breakout. Scary? Well over the past week, gold breach what analysts call its “psychological” floor, so the daily MACD indicator has turned into a firm sell signal, showing that short-term momentum has flipped to the downside. Observe the chart below:- Source: TradingView If gold’s price falls through $3,927/oz, traders are naturally eyeing the 50-day moving average, which is near $3,766 and inching higher. The charts also show that weekly stochastics have rolled over, and these little red arrows on past charts that pointed to similar declines lasted for weeks, sometimes months. The recent highs near $4,358 mark the upper edge of this new trading range, according to Katie. And like we said, the story is the same for miners. Newmont Corp. (NEM), the untitled king of gold mining, slid below its 50-day moving average on Monday for the first time in 11 months, which is a bearish signal. Its next real line of defense sits around $75, aligned with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. Below that, NEM’s next support sits near the 200-day average at $60. The 20-day moving average has also rolled over, meaning short-term strength has gone weak after investors took billions in much deserved profits. Source: TradingView But this correction is being read as a counter-trend move on Wall Street rather than the start of a meltdown. Because after surging by more than 55% this year, Katie thinks the metal was just deeply overbought, and a reset like this was purely inevitable. Philippine central bank weighs selling its massive gold reserves Away from the charts, the debate over gold is heating up at the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). At the same Bloomberg Business Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Benjamin Diokno, a Monetary Board member and former BSP governor, said the country’s gold reserves are “already excessive.” Gold makes up about 13% of the BSP’s $109 billion in gross reserves, far above regional peers. Diokno said the ideal range should be between 8% and 12%, adding that the central bank had bought much of its bullion around $2,000 an ounce. He asked, “Shouldn’t you sell already? What will happen if the price goes down?” The remark exposed an internal divide inside the BSP over whether to take profit or keep accumulating. Eli Remolona, the current BSP governor, made it clear earlier this year that the bank doesn’t speculate on gold price swings. “It’s risky and the average return is negative,” Remolona said in March, explaining that the metal serves mainly as a hedge inside the country’s portfolio. That approach hasn’t always been popular. In 2024, the BSP sold some of its gold right before prices surged, prompting public backlash over missed gains. The bank defended the sale as part of its “active management” strategy, saying it doesn’t chase price spikes. Since then, Diokno said the bank has diversified where its reserves are kept, a small portion is now stored in France, while most remain in London. The central bank is also reconsidering its currency mix. While most of its holdings are still in U.S. dollars, Diokno said officials are looking at expanding into euros, and possibly reviving older positions in Japanese yen and Australian dollars.

There was a break below a contracting triangle with support at $0.20 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could aim for a fresh increase if it remains stable above $0.1940. Dogecoin Price Starts Another Pullback Dogecoin price started a fresh increase after it settled above $0.1920, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE climbed above the $0.20 resistance to enter a positive zone. The bulls were able to push the price above $0.2020 and $0.2050. A high was formed at $0.2094 and the price is now correcting gains. There was a move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1843 swing low to the $0.2094 high. Besides, there was a break below a contracting triangle with support at $0.20 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.20 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. If there is another increase, immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2020 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2050 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.210 level. A close above the $0.210 resistance might send the price toward $0.2150. Any more gains might send the price toward $0.2250. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.2320. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2020 level, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1970 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.1843 swing low to the $0.2094 high. The next major support is near the $0.1935 level. The main support sits at $0.190. If there is a downside break below the $0.190 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might slide toward the $0.1840 level or even $0.1780 in the near term.

That surge was primarily led by strong gains in the technology sector, providing a positive, though ultimately limited, uplift to global sentiment. The modest pullback came as traders digested fresh developments in U.S. diplomacy across the region and, more significantly, awaited a series of key central bank decisions scheduled for later this week. Gold prices fell to a more than two-week low at around $3,960 per ounce on Tuesday, as prospects of a US-China trade deal dented safe-haven demand. South Korea’s economy grew 1.2% quarter-on-quarter in the three months to September 2025, marking the fastest pace in 1-½-years, on strong exports and solid private consumption. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 0.72% to around 50,200 while the broader Topix Index lost 1% to 3,292 on Tuesday, with Japanese stocks pulling back from record highs. The Japanese yen appreciated past 152 per dollar on Tuesday, rebounding from near eight-month lows. U.S. President Donald Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi signed a framework agreement on Tuesday to secure supplies of critical minerals and rare earths through mining and processing, the White House said. Meanwhile, Japan’s new economic revitalization minister, Minoru Kiuchi, said the government’s priority is to accelerate growth, underscoring Takaichi’s commitment to expansionary fiscal policy. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.02% to around 3,990 while the Shenzhen Component edged down 0.1% to 13,476 on Tuesday, and the offshore yuan climbed to around 7.09 per dollar on Tuesday, marking its strongest level in a year, boosted by firmer central bank guidance and optimism ahead of a key meeting between Chinese and US leaders later this week. On the trade front, President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to finalize a potential trade deal in their upcoming meeting this week that covers a wide range of issues including rare earth minerals, soybean purchases and TikTok. The Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN and China on Tuesday signed an upgrade to their free trade agreement, expected to cover digital trade, the green economy, and other emerging industries, as Reuters reported. On Tuesday, the People’s Bank of China will resume buying and selling treasury bonds on the open market, Governor Pan Gongsheng said on Monday, according to Xinhua Caijing. “At present, the overall bond market is operating well.” Pan also reaffirmed that the board will “maintain its supportive monetary policy stance and implement moderately loose monetary measures.” China on Monday unveiled a plan to streamline the qualified foreign investor regime by easing access requirements, improving efficiency, and expanding investment options to attract more long-term foreign capital. The EU is set to hold talks with a Chinese delegation in Brussels this week over Beijing’s new restrictions on rare-earth exports, as Europe moves to safeguard its industrial base. Markets also await upcoming PMI releases, with official data expected this week and private surveys due next week. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.11% to 26,386 in early trading on Tuesday, ending a three-day winning streak amid a pullback mainly in consumer stocks. On the trade front, Hong Kong’s exports jumped 16.1% yoy in September, the fastest pace since March, while imports rose 13.6%, both reaching their highest levels in nearly four years. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.43% to 84,509 in morning trade on Tuesday, as traders booked profits after gains in the previous session. Consumer goods, financial services, banking, and tech stocks mainly weighed on the broader index. India is planning to allow direct foreign investment in state-run banks of up to 49%, more than double the current limit, a person directly involved in the policy discussions told Reuters. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.48% to 9,018 on Tuesday, reversing gains from the previous session as investors scaled back expectations of an interest rate cut next week.The Australian dollar rose to around $0.656 on Tuesday, reaching its highest level in nearly three weeks, as a softer US dollar provided support. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Michele Bullock cautioned that a sudden reversal in global market optimism could trigger financial instability and hasten interest rate cuts. In the U.S. on Monday, all three major indexes ended all-time high after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said a ""very successful framework"" exists for Presidents Trump and Xi to discuss this week. U.S. stock futures inched up on Tuesday after Wall Street rallied to new record highs: Dow +0.01% ; S&P 500 -0.06% ; Nasdaq -0.04% . On the corporate side, Amazon said it will begin layoffs on Tuesday, marking the largest job cuts in the company’s history.

Kalshi , the innovative decentralized prediction market, has taken the bold step of filing a federal Kalshi lawsuit against the New York State Gaming Commission. This isn’t just a minor squabble; it’s a pivotal moment challenging the very definition of financial contracts versus illegal gambling. At the heart of the dispute is the Commission’s order to halt Kalshi’s sports prediction market, which it controversially labels as illegal gambling. Kalshi, however, stands firm, arguing that its platform operates under a different legal framework entirely. This legal battle has wide-ranging implications for the future of digital finance. What’s at Stake in the Kalshi Lawsuit? Kalshi’s complaint argues that the New York State Gaming Commission lacks the authority to regulate its platform. The company asserts that federal law, specifically governing contracts traded on platforms supervised by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) , preempts state-level rules. This principle, known as federal preemption, is the cornerstone of Kalshi’s defense. The core issue revolves around how prediction markets are classified. Are they speculative gambling, or are they legitimate financial contracts for risk management and information aggregation? The outcome of this Kalshi lawsuit could set a significant precedent for how innovative financial products are treated across the United States. Understanding Prediction Markets: More Than Just a Bet Prediction markets allow users to trade on the outcome of future events, such as economic indicators, political elections, or even sports results. Unlike traditional gambling, where the odds are often set by a house, prediction markets typically use peer-to-peer trading to determine prices, which can reflect the collective wisdom of the crowd. Kalshi offers ‘event contracts’ which are designed to be regulated by the CFTC. These contracts are distinct from sports betting or casino games. They function more like futures contracts, where participants buy and sell based on their predictions, providing a unique form of financial hedging and information discovery. This distinction is crucial to the ongoing Kalshi lawsuit . The Federal vs. State Debate: A Core of the Kalshi Lawsuit The legal argument put forth by Kalshi centers on the concept of federal preemption. This means that when federal law and state law conflict, federal law takes precedence. Kalshi believes that because its contracts fall under CFTC oversight, New York State’s gaming regulations should not apply. This is not just a technicality; it’s a fundamental challenge to state regulatory power over a federally recognized financial instrument. The resolution of this aspect of the Kalshi lawsuit will have profound implications for the regulatory landscape of digital assets and new financial technologies nationwide. Why Does This Kalshi Lawsuit Matter for Crypto and DeFi? The implications of the Kalshi lawsuit extend far beyond just prediction markets. Many decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and crypto projects operate in regulatory gray areas, often leveraging novel technologies that don’t fit neatly into existing legal frameworks. A favorable outcome for Kalshi could provide much-needed clarity for other innovators. Regulatory Certainty: It could establish clearer boundaries between state gambling laws and federal financial regulations. Innovation: A win for Kalshi might encourage further development and adoption of similar decentralized platforms. Precedent: The ruling could serve as a benchmark for how other states approach the regulation of new financial instruments. Conversely, a loss could stifle innovation and create a fragmented regulatory environment, making it harder for legitimate businesses to operate. Navigating Regulatory Waters: Challenges and Opportunities The Kalshi lawsuit highlights the ongoing tension between rapid technological innovation and the slower pace of regulatory adaptation. Regulators face the challenge of understanding complex new technologies while ensuring consumer protection and market integrity. However, these legal challenges also present an opportunity for dialogue and the development of more sophisticated, forward-thinking regulatory frameworks. Clearer guidelines can foster responsible innovation, rather than hindering it. The industry eagerly awaits the court’s decision, which could pave the way for a more defined future for prediction markets and the broader DeFi ecosystem. The Kalshi lawsuit against the New York State Gaming Commission is more than just a legal battle; it’s a crucial test case for the future of financial innovation. Its outcome will not only determine the fate of Kalshi’s operations in New York but will also cast a long shadow over how prediction markets and similar decentralized financial products are classified and regulated across the United States. This ongoing legal saga underscores the critical need for clear, consistent regulatory frameworks that can adapt to the rapid evolution of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Kalshi? Kalshi is a U.S.-regulated prediction market that allows users to trade on the outcome of future events. It offers ‘event contracts’ which are designed to be financial instruments rather than traditional gambling, providing a unique platform for hedging and information aggregation. Why did Kalshi file a lawsuit against New York? Kalshi filed a federal lawsuit against the New York State Gaming Commission because the commission ordered a halt to Kalshi’s sports prediction market, deeming it illegal gambling. Kalshi argues that New York lacks the authority to regulate its platform due to federal preemption. What is the CFTC’s role in this Kalshi lawsuit? The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is a U.S. government agency that regulates the U.S. derivatives markets, including futures and options. Kalshi’s argument hinges on the fact that its contracts are supervised by the CFTC, and therefore federal law preempts state-level gambling regulations. How might this lawsuit affect other prediction markets? The outcome of the Kalshi lawsuit could set a significant legal precedent for how prediction markets and other innovative financial products are regulated nationwide. A ruling in Kalshi’s favor could provide regulatory clarity and encourage further innovation, while an unfavorable decision might lead to increased state-level restrictions. What is federal preemption? Federal preemption is a legal doctrine where federal law takes precedence over state law when there is a conflict between the two. In the context of this lawsuit, Kalshi argues that federal laws governing CFTC-regulated contracts preempt New York’s state gambling laws. Did you find this analysis of the Kalshi lawsuit insightful?

The most popular self-custodial wallet has officially registered a domain linked to token claims, a move that’s sparking fresh speculation about an upcoming MetaMask airdrop. If you’ve been active on-chain over the past few years, your patience might finally pay off. Probability of MetaMask Token Launch Jumps to 40% According to prediction data from Polymarket, the probability of a MetaMask token launch in 2025 has surged from 18% to as high as 47%, before stabilizing around 32% at press time. That’s a massive jump in market sentiment within just days of the domain registration. This event marks one of the biggest speculative shifts in the wallet sector this year, signaling that MetaMask’s long-awaited governance or utility token could finally be nearing release. IT’S FINALLY HAPPENING! MetaMask has officially registered the domain for token claims, all signs point to the airdrop going live soon. If you’ve been active on-chain… your moment might finally be here. What do you think the price will be? pic.twitter.com/0LH3vBO1Dx — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) October 27, 2025 Domain Registration Sparks Excitement Crypto analysts and on-chain sleuths first noticed the domain “claim.metamask.io,” verified as an official ConsenSys property. The registration strongly suggests that the wallet team is preparing infrastructure for token claims, a key step before most airdrops go live. Even though MetaMask has made no official announcement, such domain activity often precedes claim page testing, whitelist validation, or snapshot integrations, all of which point toward an imminent airdrop. The Polymarket Angle, Traders Are Betting Big Polymarket traders are treating this development seriously. The “Will MetaMask launch a token in 2025?” market has seen a flood of activity, pushing the odds nearly 30 points higher in less than a week. At its peak, traders priced the event at 47% likelihood, though the current consensus sits closer to 32%, reflecting cautious optimism while waiting for a confirmed announcement. Still, the data speaks volumes: retail and institutional sentiment around MetaMask’s potential token generation event (TGE) has never been stronger. Why a Token Now Makes Sense MetaMask’s user base has grown exponentially since 2020. According to ConsenSys, over 30 million active users interact with MetaMask monthly, spanning Ethereum, L2s, and EVM-compatible chains. With DeFi activity rebounding and L2 ecosystems like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism seeing record volumes, the timing couldn’t be better for a token-driven community incentive. A MetaMask token would likely serve multiple roles: Governance for wallet-related protocols Rewarding early or active users Fueling MetaMask’s staking, bridge, or gas abstraction features It would also mirror successful wallet token launches like Safe (SAFE) and Trust Wallet Token (TWT), which both saw massive user engagement spikes post-launch. MetaMask claim page has been registered Today the MetaMask domain was registered, presumably intended for the $MASK token claim portal Against the backdrop of this news, the probability that MetaMask will launch the token in 2025 has risen from 18% to 47% at its peak on… pic.twitter.com/02Zv5svSBR — izlam (@bckfv_eth) October 27, 2025 Other Wallets Might Follow MetaMask isn’t alone in the spotlight. If this airdrop goes live, expect a domino effect. Competing wallets such as Rabby, Rainbow, and Phantom may follow suit, introducing tokens to strengthen their ecosystems and user retention. Historically, major wallet airdrops have set the tone for entire market waves, just like Uniswap’s UNI launch did for DeFi tokens back in 2020. That’s why this MetaMask move is being viewed as a potential market catalyst rather than a simple product update. But There’s a Catch Registering a domain doesn’t always mean a token is coming soon. The crypto space has seen similar moves before, notably, WalletConnect once launched its token claim portal months before the actual TGE. Polymarket’s rules are clear: “The token must be actively and publicly transferable and tradable. Announcements alone do not qualify.” So even if MetaMask confirms a token, traders won’t win their “yes” bets until the token is live and trading on-chain. Naturally, airdrop hunters are already buzzing. On-chain users are now speculating which activities might qualify them for allocation: Regular use of the MetaMask Swap feature Interaction with MetaMask Bridge Holding ETH or stablecoins across connected networks Early use of MetaMask Snaps or new beta features If the team follows Uniswap’s 2020 model, early adopters could be heavily rewarded, but nothing is confirmed yet. Market Impact, The Wallet Race Heats Up With MetaMask hinting at tokenization, competition among wallets is intensifying. Wallet tokens are becoming the next narrative, combining user incentives, governance, and DeFi integration in one move. MetaMask’s entry could redefine how wallets capture and distribute value within Web3. If the launch materializes, it would also attract liquidity from both DeFi and prediction markets, amplifying activity across Ethereum and its L2 networks. For now, all eyes are on ConsenSys. If the registered domain begins redirecting to a live claim portal or API endpoint, the countdown will officially begin. Until then, the market waits, but the sentiment is clear. MetaMask’s token narrative is back in play, and traders aren’t ignoring it this time. Whether it happens in early or late 2025, one thing is certain: MetaMask’s next move could reshape the wallet economy entirely.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Now Has A Value Of 51 The “Fear & Greed Index” refers to an indicator created by Alternative that measures the average sentiment present among traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The metric uses the data of the following five factors to determine the investor mentality: trading volume, market cap dominance, volatility, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. The index uses a numerical scale running from zero to hundred for representing this sentiment. All values above 53 correspond to greed among the investors, while those below 47 to fear. The region between the two cutoffs naturally corresponds to a net neutral mentality. Related Reading: Nearly $360M In Crypto Shorts Squeezed As Bitcoin Recovers To $116,000 Now, here is how the current Bitcoin market sentiment is like, according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the indicator has a value of 51, which suggests the trader sentiment is almost exactly in the balance right now. This is a notable change in market mood compared to just a few days ago. As displayed in the chart, the Fear & Greed Index was inside the fear zone during the past few days. The despair among the traders was a result of the bearish price action that BTC had recently faced. At one point, the indicator even fell to a low of 22, reflecting a state of “extreme fear.” This zone, which occurs below 25, corresponds to investors being the most bearish toward the market. There is a similar region for the greed side as well, called the “extreme greed,” situated above 75. Historically, the extreme sentiments have been quite significant for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as they are where major tops and bottoms have tended to form. The relationship has been an inverse one, however, meaning extreme fear is where bottoms form, while extreme greed facilitates tops. Since the extreme fear low earlier in the month, BTC has been on the way up, a potential indication that the contrarian signal of the sentiment may once again be in action.

The cryptocurrency has extended its recovery in a sharp manner during the last couple of days, which may be a potential reason why the Fear & Greed Index has surged back to the neutral territory now.

It now remains to be seen whether they will embrace greed, or continue to be hesitant about the recovery.

53726722,614663,1761631242,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53726722.jpeg,Chinese Central Bank Warns Of Crypto Loopholes In Global Regulation,https://bitcoinist.com/chinese-central-bank-warns-of-crypto-loopholes/,"China’s central bank escalated its warning on stablecoins and reiterated a hard line against domestic crypto activity on Monday, with Governor Pan Gongsheng arguing that the rise of privately issued “virtual currencies”—particularly stablecoins—exposes gaps in global financial oversight and increases systemic fragility. Speaking at the opening of the 2025 Financial Street Forum in Beijing on October 27, Pan said stablecoins are still “at an early stage” but are already amplifying regulatory blind spots across borders and posing challenges to monetary sovereignty in weaker economies. China Reaffirms Crypto Crackdown Pan anchored his remarks in the policy debates that dominated the IMF/World Bank Annual Meetings held in Washington 10 days earlier, telling attendees that the prevailing view among finance ministers and central bank governors was that stablecoins, “as a financial activity, at this stage cannot effectively meet basic requirements in customer identification and anti-money-laundering,” thereby “magnifying loopholes in global financial regulation,” fueling “speculative hype,” increasing “the fragility of the global financial system,” and “impacting the monetary sovereignty of some underdeveloped economies.” The governor coupled that assessment with a firm domestic enforcement posture: “Since 2017, the People’s Bank of China, together with relevant departments, has issued multiple policy documents to prevent and deal with risks from domestic crypto trading and speculation, and these documents remain effective. Next, the PBOC will work with law-enforcement authorities to continue cracking down on the operation and speculation of cryptocurrencies within China, maintain economic and financial order, and closely track and dynamically evaluate the development of offshore stablecoins.” His statement effectively reaffirms the legal status quo—comprehensive restrictions on crypto trading and mining within China’s borders —while signaling ongoing surveillance of offshore instruments that touch Chinese users and firms. Pan’s comments land at a moment when stablecoins have become embedded in cross-border commerce and crypto market plumbing, with dollar-pegged tokens dominating global volumes. They also intersect with a live policy debate inside China about whether and how to tolerate offshore, yuan-linked instruments to complement the official e-CNY. Over the summer, major Chinese tech groups lobbied the PBOC to authorize an offshore, yuan-based stablecoin in Hong Kong to counter US dollar stablecoin dominance—an initiative that, if ever approved, would likely be ring-fenced from the mainland’s prohibitions. For market participants, the signal is twofold. First, there is no domestic policy thaw for crypto trading or mining: the 2017–2021 crackdown architecture remains intact, and enforcement will be coordinated with police and other agencies. Second, Chinese authorities are sharpening their scrutiny of offshore stablecoins used by exporters, importers, and savers, a vector that has grown as stablecoins have become de facto settlement media in parts of Asia and emerging markets. The central bank’s language—“continue cracking down” at home while “dynamically evaluating” offshore developments—suggests that any future experimentation will occur through official government channels rather than market-driven stablecoin adoption.

The idea was featured in a Newsmax segment shared by crypto enthusiast XRP King (@JOLLY__R0GER), who highlighted how government investment in XRP could, in theory, erase the deficit. The video’s argument centered on the government’s debt level, framing cryptocurrency as a potential mechanism to offset it. It compared today’s situation to an earlier point in Bitcoin’s history, when $348 would have purchased 1.7% of its total supply, noting that the same amount of Bitcoin today would be enough to pay off the national debt . The hypothetical scenario proposed that the government could have done the same for major public programs such as Social Security, using crypto’s growth to backstop national finances. Newsmax talking about XRP clearing the national debt pic.twitter.com/7SqKR55XF5 — XRP King (@JOLLY__R0GER) October 27, 2025 How the Proposal Would Work In the video, the speaker suggested that the government could theoretically allocate “one fifth of our annual tax revenue,” roughly a trillion dollars, to purchase XRP. At its current price of about $2.5 and a market capitalization of approximately $144 billion, the claim was that such an investment could multiply the coin’s value by eight, generating an estimated $8 trillion in return. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The argument extended further, proposing that the government could sell the asset at its peak to buy back after a market crash , and repeat the cycle to pay off the national debt. The reasoning presented rested on the idea that cryptocurrency, unlike traditional currencies managed by central banks, derives its worth from what participants believe it to be worth. It compared this to a high-end luxury item that costs little to make but sells at a premium due to demand. The video maintained that because crypto’s value is market-driven, large institutional participation could magnify its price exponentially. XRP’s Role in the Debate The Newsmax segment also discussed the role of government involvement in crypto markets. It referenced Ronald Reagan’s statement that “if it moves, regulate it. If it stops moving, subsidize it. If you can’t do either, ban it,” adding that the only way for the government to influence cryptocurrency would be to participate in it directly through ownership and investment. Newsmax presented XRP as a logical candidate for such an experiment, and the asset fits due to its established presence, liquidity, and connection to financial institutions. Experts have argued for years that Ripple’s escrow could settle the U.S. national debt if the asset grows significantly. By leveraging XRP’s global settlement capabilities, the U.S. could stabilize its balance sheet and reinforce its influence over digital finance.

The move brings BNB’s remaining total supply down to 137,738,379.26 BNB, marking another milestone in the chain’s long-term deflationary roadmap. This burn is part of the network’s Auto-Burn program, an automated process that gradually removes tokens every quarter until 50% of the total supply, roughly 100 million BNB, is permanently destroyed. The 33rd quarterly $BNB token burn has been completed directly on BNB Smart Chain (BSC). 1.44M #BNB has been burned View the details of the burn below https://t.co/GPfpeZ5fBT pic.twitter.com/kTQIHTfKvA — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) October 27, 2025 The BNB Burn, By The Numbers According to the official BNB Foundation update, this latest burn destroyed 1,441,281.413 BNB, valued at approximately $1.208 billion. Key Figures: Total BNB Burned: 1.44M Estimated Value: $1.208B Remaining Supply: 137.7M BNB Each burn follows a mathematical model that adjusts the number of tokens burned based on BNB’s price and block generation rate, keeping the process both predictable and transparent. This model ensures that BNB’s total circulating supply continues shrinking even as the network expands through DeFi, gaming, and Layer-2 growth. For real-time tracking, community members can monitor the total burned amount at bnbburn.info. The Purpose Behind the Burn BNB’s token burn mechanism is designed to maintain a deflationary token economy. The Auto-Burn process occurs every quarter, automatically removing BNB from circulation based on the network’s activity levels. This complements BEP-95, the real-time gas fee burn introduced in 2021, which continuously destroys a portion of gas fees with each transaction. Together, these two systems, Auto-Burn + BEP-95, make BNB one of the few tokens in crypto with dual algorithmic burn mechanisms operating simultaneously. By gradually reducing supply, BNB Chain aims to maintain scarcity while encouraging long-term value retention, similar to Bitcoin’s halving principle but with more flexibility and predictability. A Post-Upgrade Milestone This 33rd burn comes shortly after the Lorentz and Maxwell network upgrades, which adjusted BNB’s block frequency and burn parameters. These technical improvements increased efficiency across BNB Smart Chain (BSC) and BNB Greenfield, ensuring the Auto-Burn model stays consistent with the network’s evolving activity. In simpler terms: faster blocks, more precise burns. According to RouteScan.io, the upgrades also improved node synchronization and transaction throughput, paving the way for more scalable on-chain activity. BNB Chain completes its 33rd quarterly burn BNB Foundation has officially burned 1,441,281.413 BNB (~$1.208B), the latest step in its ongoing Auto-Burn program designed to cap total supply at 100M BNB. Key figures: Total BNB burned: 1.44M Estimated value: $1.208B … pic.twitter.com/KR8UtKLP9G — Routescan | The Unified Explorer (@routescan_io) October 27, 2025 The Economics of Burning BNB’s deflationary system is not a marketing gimmick, it’s core economics. When tokens are burned, they’re sent to a dead wallet, an address from which they can never be retrieved. This permanently reduces total supply. Each burn is a deflationary event, theoretically increasing the scarcity (and potential value) of remaining tokens. Currently, BNB trades around $1,147, with a market cap of roughly $157 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. At this pace, and assuming consistent burn volume, BNB could hit its 100 million target supply cap within the next 10 to 12 years. BNB’s Dual-Burn System Explained The Auto-Burn is predictable, it happens quarterly and uses a transparent formula tied to block generation and market price. Meanwhile, BEP-95 is dynamic, it burns a portion of gas fees in real time. The more the network is used, the more tokens are destroyed. This combination gives BNB a supply reduction system that adapts to market conditions. When demand increases, so does on-chain activity, which automatically speeds up the BEP-95 burn rate. It’s a self-regulating economic design meant to mirror real-world scarcity mechanics. Why It Matters BNB’s quarterly burns do more than remove supply, they signal network health and transparency. Each burn demonstrates continued growth in transaction volume, validator activity, and fee generation, since both burn mechanisms are directly linked to usage metrics. The 33rd burn shows that BNB Chain’s economy remains strong despite the broader market’s volatility. It also keeps BNB aligned with its long-term roadmap, a fixed supply of 100 million tokens. This consistency is one reason why BNB remains one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies by market cap, used across thousands of DeFi protocols, exchanges, and applications built on the chain. Community Reactions The announcement sparked quick reactions across social media, with users highlighting how BNB continues to execute one of the most sustained deflationary models in crypto. “Every quarter, billions just vanish, and yet network activity keeps climbing,” one BNB supporter wrote. Others pointed out how the timing aligns with broader bullish sentiment returning to the crypto market. Liquidity is improving, Solana projects are surging, and Ethereum gas fees have eased, a combination that benefits multi-chain users and BNB traders alike. The Bigger Picture BNB Chain’s quarterly burns aren’t just symbolic. They’re part of a broader ecosystem strategy: to balance growth with scarcity, and utility with sustainability. With the Lorentz and Maxwell upgrades live, the network is evolving into more than just an Ethereum alternative. Its expanding infrastructure, through BNB Greenfield, opBNB Layer-2, and Cross-Chain Relayers, positions it as one of the few ecosystems balancing scalability, security, and deflation. At the same time, quarterly burns remind holders that BNB’s supply isn’t infinite, it’s constantly shrinking. The 33rd quarterly burn cements BNB’s reputation as one of crypto’s most actively deflationary assets. Over 1.44 million BNB, worth $1.2 billion, is now permanently out of circulation. The remaining supply stands at 137.7 million, inching closer to the ultimate 100 million goal. In a market where inflationary token models often erode value, BNB’s algorithmic burn structure stands out as a real-time example of digital scarcity in motion. And as the network upgrades continue to optimize performance and efficiency, each burn reinforces a simple message: BNB isn’t just a token, it’s an evolving economic engine. In Summary: 1,441,281.413 BNB burned (~$1.208B) Remaining supply: 137.7M BNB Auto-Burn + BEP-95 mechanisms active Target supply cap: 100M BNB Next burn: Q1 2026 Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

53726986,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=846862,1761631446,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53726986.jpeg,Google signed a 25-year deal with NextEra Energy to buy power from the Duane Arnold nuclear plant,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/google-to-power-data-centers/,"Google is working with NextEra Energy to restart a closed nuclear plant in Iowa. The Duane Arnold plant shut down in 2020 and is expected to restart by 2029, supplying Google with clean power for 25 years. NextEra will operate the 615-megawatt facility to supply Google’s data centers with the clean and consistent power they need. The agreement indicates that the tremendous growth in AI is increasing power demands. Most of the power generated at the plant will be used to power Google’s local offices and data centers, with a portion to be sold to the Central Iowa Power Cooperative (CIPCO) through a long-term agreement. NextEra to take full ownership of the site as part of the deal. NextEra brings the Duane Arnold plant back to life to supply Google with clean energy NextEra will revive the old plant because it will be less time-consuming and less expensive than building a new one. New plants face long approval processes, construction challenges , and strict safety reviews. To control the project entirely, NextExtra will buy out Central Iowa Power Cooperative and Corn Belt Power Cooperative. Once everything is ready, the Duane Arnold plant will produce 615 megawatts of steady, carbon-free power that can run 24 hours a day. As part of the new deal, Google will buy electricity from the plant for the next 25 years to power its growing data centers. The company’s centers work nonstop to process millions of data requests every second from people all over the world. Because they operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, they require a constant and reliable electricity supply. And since wind or solar energy isn’t always reliable due to weather conditions, Nuclear energy is the best fit. NextEra will also sell the remaining power to the Central Iowa Power Cooperative under the same terms and conditions. The firm aims to ensure that local communities benefit from clean and stable energy. Many energy experts view this deal as evidence that nuclear energy is poised for a strong comeback, as new technologies require more electricity. Analyst Sophie Karp at KeyBanc Capital Markets noted that the speed at which this deal was set up highlights the high demand for zero-emission and reliable power. Data centers in the United States consume the most electricity because the rise of AI, cloud computing, and the expansion of online services have driven demand to unprecedented levels. Tech companies use nuclear power to meet the growing demand for electricity from AI Constellation Energy hopes to restart a reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania by 2027. The Three Mile Island location is known for being the site of a 1979 nuclear accident that set off decades of public concern over safety. However, the case is different today, as many experts consider nuclear power to be one of the cleanest and most reliable forms of energy in an era of advanced technology and international safety standards. Holtec International also plans to reopen the Palisades plant in Michigan, which closed in 2022. The company hopes to resume operations next year. Further south, the state-owned utility in South Carolina, Santee Cooper, is negotiating with Brookfield Asset Management to complete the VC Summer nuclear project that was abandoned in 2017. Together, these projects demonstrate that people are increasingly confident in nuclear energy’s ability to meet the country’s growing electricity demand. Google and NextEra also aim to collaborate on developing new technologies that could supply electricity for future data centers in various parts of the country. These projects will utilize newer and smaller designs, such as modular reactors, because they can be built faster and in more locations than traditional large reactors. The two companies already have nearly three gigawatts of clean energy projects completed across the United States. This new nuclear power project only strengthens their ability to meet the growing demand for power for the next generation of technology. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

53726955,https://nulltx.com/?p=152486,1761631541,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Mt. Gox Postpones Repayments Again, $4 Billion in Bitcoin Locked Until 2026",https://nulltx.com/mt-gox-postpones-repayments-again-4-billion-in-bitcoin-locked-until-2026/,"The crypto world just got another plot twist. Defunct exchange Mt. Gox has once again postponed its long-awaited creditor repayments, this time pushing the deadline to October 31, 2026. The announcement arrived just days before the previous deadline of October 31, 2025, extending the saga of what’s been one of crypto’s longest-running stories. “Largely Completed,” But Still Delayed In a statement, the Mt. Gox rehabilitation trustee said it had “largely completed” base repayments, early lump-sum repayments, and intermediate repayments for creditors who finished all eligibility procedures correctly. But not everyone was lucky. Many creditors are still waiting, some due to incomplete documentation, others due to procedural complications during verification and payout steps. This latest extension marks the third delay in the timeline. Originally, repayments were supposed to conclude by October 31, 2023, a full two years ago. The $4 Billion Overhang That Didn’t Happen Mt. Gox still holds 34,689 BTC, roughly $4 billion at current prices, according to CoinMarketCap data. That Bitcoin was expected to be distributed this month, an event that many analysts feared could flood the market. Even a small portion of that BTC hitting exchanges might have created significant sell pressure, particularly in a market already sensitive to liquidity shifts. But now, with the new delay, that potential selling wave has been kicked another 12 months down the road. Traders and analysts are calling this one of the most bullish delays of the year. Here’s why: No new BTC supply will hit exchanges from Mt. Gox creditors anytime soon. No panic selling from decade-old wallets that might have moved coins for the first time since 2014. And most importantly, one major bearish overhang just vanished from Bitcoin’s short-term outlook. That $4 billion worth of supply staying locked up until late 2026 means the market gets a breather. It’s effectively a year-long pause button on one of the crypto market’s biggest fear events. The Perfect Timing This delay couldn’t have come at a better macro moment. The U.S. Federal Reserve has started signaling the end of quantitative tightening (QT), the era of liquidity drain might finally be closing. Rate cuts are back on the horizon, and with trade tensions easing between the U.S. and China, global risk sentiment is improving. Liquidity is creeping back into both traditional and crypto markets. In short, macro tailwinds are aligning with crypto’s internal relief. Mt. Gox’s postponement just adds one more bullish card to the deck. For newcomers, Mt. Gox’s story is crypto legend. Launched in 2010, Mt. Gox was once the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, handling over 70% of all BTC trades at its peak. Then came disaster. In 2014, Mt. Gox collapsed after 850,000 BTC went missing, either hacked or misplaced. The platform declared bankruptcy, and users were left waiting for restitution as legal and procedural disputes dragged on for years. Now, more than a decade later, repayments are still being sorted out. Why the Delay Matters Each time Mt. Gox delays, it changes crypto’s short-term supply dynamics. Think of it as a defused bomb, 34,689 BTC that could destabilize markets if released too quickly. Analysts have long debated how much impact Mt. Gox repayments might have when they finally happen. Some estimate that if even 10% of creditors sold, the market could see hundreds of millions in sell pressure in just days. This delay means none of that happens this year, or next. Creditor Fatigue, Market Relief While traders are celebrating the reprieve, creditors are feeling something different: exhaustion. For those who’ve been waiting since 2014, another year means another stretch of uncertainty. Many creditors completed verification months ago and expected payouts by year-end. Still, the trustee insists that most core repayments are “largely completed,” suggesting that at least part of the remaining work lies in administrative cleanup, not systemic issues. With inflation cooling and ETF inflows steady, the absence of a Mt. Gox sell wave adds further price stability. Market analysts note that liquidity conditions are improving, particularly across spot BTC markets on Coinbase, Binance, and OKX. Some traders argue the Mt. Gox delay could quietly extend Bitcoin’s rally window heading into 2026. The community on X (formerly Twitter) wasted no time sharing their takes. Crypto researcher @TedPillows Mt. Gox has postponed its $BTC repayments to October 2026. This could have brought selling pressure to Bitcoin, and now it's going. Good for markets. pic.twitter.com/jW3OmM8McV — Ted (@TedPillows) October 27, 2025 Sentiment across the board echoed the same theme, short-term relief, long-term fatigue. The Road to 2026 With this extension, Mt. Gox’s next critical milestone is now October 31, 2026. That’s the new target for full completion of creditor repayments. Until then, the 34,689 BTC remains locked, under the control of the trustee. Whether future delays will happen again remains to be seen, but for now, the market can breathe. Mt. Gox’s latest delay might frustrate creditors, but for the wider market, it’s a quiet blessing. No $4B BTC dump. No exchange shock. No panic waves from decade-old wallets. Instead, the market gets time, and timing is everything. With liquidity returning, rate cuts looming, and a long-feared sell event pushed another year away, Bitcoin’s path into 2026 looks a little clearer, and a lot calmer. In Summary: Mt. Gox repayment deadline now October 31, 2026 Trustee says repayments “largely completed,” but not fully distributed 34,689 BTC (~$4B) remains locked One bearish event removed for another year Crypto market reacts with cautious optimism Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

53726928,615127,1761631746,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53726928.jpeg,Gemini’s XRP Price Prediction Puts $4.50 in Sight – Here’s Why PEPENODE Could Be Next 1000x Crypto,https://bitcoinist.com/gemini-xrp-price-prediction-why-pepenode-could-be-next-1000x-crypto/,"Quick Facts: 1⃣ Gemini’s XRP price prediction suggests the token could surge to $4.50 after confirming a breakout from a descending triangle pattern. 2⃣ In the long term, XRP could climb to $15, thanks to a major breakout from a multi-year consolidation pattern. 3⃣ As $XRP gears up for its next leg, PEPENODE is emerging as the next 1000x crypto, courtesy of its game-changing mine-to-earn ecosystem. After completing its fifth major acquisition in the last two years, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to X to remind the crypto community and investors that ‘XRP sits at the center of everything Ripple does. Lock in.’ The token, now the world’s fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap , took quite the hit on October 10 when Trump announced the 100% tariff on China. That said, $XRP has done very well to rebound since then – and it now looks primed to rally higher thanks to a couple of important technical bullish factors. For instance, its current leg up comes after a successful retest of the resistance line of the descending triangle pattern it broke out of back in July this year. According to this trading pattern, $XRP should now continue its upward move to not only reclaim its current highs of around $3.66 but also set new records near $4.50 – a chunky 70% gain from current levels. How was this target calculated? Gemini AI used the maximum width of the descending triangle pattern and mapped it onto the breakout level, which produced a target of roughly $4.50. Next, for a long-term XRP price prediction, Gemini zoomed out on the token’s monthly chart. The AI pointed out that $XRP has spent all of October retesting its breakout level from a major descending triangle pattern – one that had been in place since December 2017 and finally gave a breakout in November 2024. Applying the same classical technical analysis playbook, Gemini measured the width of this long consolidation phase and mapped it onto the breakout level, which produced a mind-boggling price target of $15. Keep in mind, though, that this is a long-term target. $XRP is currently trading around $2.62 . Here’s the kicker: XRP’s recent push and its potential upside wouldn’t just be the result of Ripple’s growing efforts to make $XRP the center of its operations and the backbone of a crypto-led global cross-border payment system. It’s also a telltale sign that the industry is hungry for value-stuffed altcoins that are strongly rooted in utility and have the capability to take crypto forward. While XRP’s rise to $15 won’t happen in just a few months, it’s still worthwhile HODLing a blue-chip crypto like XRP. That said, you also have the option to play it smartly and invest in other similarly utility-oozing altcoins that could deliver potentially massive – even far better – returns in a much shorter timeframe, especially since blue-chip cryptos nowadays move rather slowly compared to how they did back in 2017. So, if you’re looking for the next 1000x crypto to make sure you squeeze out the maximum possible returns from the coming boom, consider PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) . Why PEPENODE Could Be the Next Big Crypto Coin PEPENODE isn’t your everyday meme coin that simply decorates the iconic Pepe the Frog in its own attire and hopes to attract degen meme coin investors. In fact, PEPENODE has really dug deep and found a real crypto-related problem that needs solving – the accessibility of crypto mining.

After a recent attempt, XRP found itself consolidating, unable to breach the significant $2.7 resistance level. This has sparked considerable discussion among traders and analysts alike, eager to understand what comes next for this prominent digital asset. Why is the XRP Price Consolidating? According to a recent analysis by CoinDesk , XRP is experiencing a period of consolidation. This means its price is moving within a relatively narrow range, reflecting a balance between buying and selling pressure. XRP recently failed to break through the $2.7 resistance level. This level acts as a ceiling, where sellers tend to emerge and prevent further upward movement. Such consolidation phases are common in markets, often preceding a significant move in either direction. What Bullish Signals are Supporting XRP Price ? Despite the current consolidation, several indicators suggest a potentially bullish outlook for the XRP price . Traders are closely monitoring these signs for clues about future movements. Increased Trading Volume: Daily trading volume has seen a notable 26% increase compared to the weekly average. Higher volume often indicates stronger conviction behind price moves. Decreased Exchange Balances: There’s been a slight decrease in XRP balances held on exchanges since early October. This can suggest that fewer tokens are available for immediate selling, potentially reducing selling pressure. These signals hint at underlying strength and renewed interest in XRP, which could provide the necessary momentum for a future breakout. Navigating the Downside Risks for XRP Price While bullish signals are present, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential downside risks that could impact the XRP price . The market is dynamic, and caution remains important. A recent dip below $2.635 has increased short-term downside risk, indicating vulnerability to further declines. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence ( MACD ) indicator, a popular tool for identifying momentum, has yet to show a clear breakout signal. This suggests that strong upward momentum has not yet firmly established itself. These factors highlight the need for careful observation before making definitive trading decisions. Crucial Levels: Where Does the XRP Price Find Support? Understanding key support levels is vital for any trader. For XRP, a specific zone is proving to be particularly important in the current market environment. This area could determine the immediate trajectory of the XRP price . The analysis suggests traders should monitor the key support zone between $2.61 and $2.63 . This range represents a price floor where buying interest typically strengthens, preventing the price from falling further. A successful rebound from this level would indicate strong buyer conviction. Conversely, a sustained break below this zone could signal further declines. What Needs to Happen for XRP Price to Test $2.7 Again? For the XRP price to mount another challenge against the formidable $2.7 resistance, specific market conditions need to materialize. It’s not just about wishing for a rally; it’s about observing the right catalysts. A successful rebound from the $2.61-$2.63 support level is the first critical step. This rebound must be accompanied by rising trading volume. Increased volume alongside a price rise suggests genuine buying interest, not just speculative noise. If these conditions align, XRP could be positioned for another robust attempt to break the $2.7 resistance, potentially leading to significant upward movement. The journey for the XRP price is currently at a critical juncture. While bullish signals offer hope and increased trading activity, the immediate challenge lies in holding key support levels and generating the sustained momentum needed for a decisive breakout. Traders are keenly watching the $2.61-$2.63 support zone and any accompanying volume increases as indicators of XRP’s next potential move towards or beyond $2.7. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether XRP can indeed unlock its potential for a significant upward shift. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is XRP? XRP is a digital asset created by Ripple , a technology company focused on improving global payments. It is designed to facilitate fast, low-cost international transactions. What does ‘resistance level’ mean in crypto trading? A resistance level is a price point on a chart where an upward trend is expected to pause or reverse due to a concentration of sellers. It acts as a ceiling that the price struggles to break above. What does the MACD indicator tell us? The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. It helps traders identify potential buy and sell signals by showing when momentum is shifting. Who conducts the CoinDesk analysis mentioned? The analysis is typically conducted by market analysts and contributors for CoinDesk , a leading media outlet specializing in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Their reports offer insights into market trends and asset performance. Did you find this analysis on the XRP price helpful?

However, the tides have turned, perhaps expectedly after such a rally, and both assets have flashed red now. Moreover, there are some worrying signs about further corrections. XRP outperformed the rest of the larger-cap alts during the weekend, closing on Sunday with a 12% surge. It kept climbing on Monday and tapped a multi-week peak of $2.65. This significant increase was perhaps driven by the positive developments within the company behind the asset and came despite the growing sell-offs by whales. Although XRP’s run was stopped there, it still trades above $2.60 as of press time. However, Ali Martinez noted that the TD Sequential, a metric used to determine whether the underlying asset has reached an exhaustion point in each direction, had flashed a sell signal, which could lead to an immediate retracement.

However, its 24-hour decline has been more painful. After getting rejected at that level, the asset has slumped by nearly 5% and is now just inches below $0.20. Aside from the overall market-wide correction, another possible reason behind today’s drop is the behavior of whales. Martinez noted that such large market participants have been on a selling spree, disposing of 500 million tokens within the span of just a week. 500 million Dogecoin $DOGE sold by whales over the past week! pic.twitter.com/hza0gBTZrd — Ali (@ali_charts) October 27, 2025 The post Price Warnings for Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) Investors: Details appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Dogecoin|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-28 06:12:01
