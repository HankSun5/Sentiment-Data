Fed’s Second Consecutive Rate Cut On Thursday, the Federal Reserve announced its decision to cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 4.50%-4.75%, adding to the bullish sentiment surrounding crypto prices. This marks the second consecutive rate cut, following a half-percentage point reduction in September. The unanimous vote at this meeting, which included participation from Governor Michelle Bowman, reflects a shift in the Fed’s approach to balancing inflation control with labor market support. Related Reading: CNBC Projects Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 Before Presidential Inauguration – Details In its post-meeting statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) noted a revised assessment of economic risks, indicating that the outlook for achieving employment and inflation goals is now seen as balanced, a departure from the previous month’s more optimistic stance. Crypto analyst Doctor Profit commented on the recent surge in both stock and crypto markets, suggesting that the price increases were in anticipation of the Fed’s rate cut. He predicts that continued rate cuts in the coming quarters could further drive up prices for both stocks and cryptocurrencies. Positive Trends For Bitcoin And Ethereum Post-Election In an exclusive interview with NewsBTC, Nansen’s Principal Research Analyst, Aurelie Barthere, highlighted that Bitcoin rise above its previous all-time high, coupled with high trading volumes, signals a strong positive momentum in the market. The analyst noted a period of “de-risking” in the run-up to the election, likely influenced by unfavorable polls for Trump, but observed a subsequent rush to “re-risk” as confidence returned following the election result, further evidenced by the rise in prices. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance – Top Analyst Sets $300 Target Barthere also pointed out that the Republican victory in the House of Representatives could further amplify this rally. However, she cautioned that profit-taking may occur in the coming weeks as new policies are tested, particularly regarding the potential political pressure on the US SEC chair to step down. The analyst pointed out that Ethereum is also gaining traction as expectations rise for a resurgence in decentralized finance (DeFi). Barthere noted an interesting uptick in the ETH/BTC price ratio, accompanied by significant net inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), totaling $52 million on the day of the election results. The analyst suggests that these continued inflows into the recently approved ETF market are seen as indicative of broader retail interest in the second largest cryptocurrency, which she ultimately believes has yet to see significant adoption. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $76,629, up nearly 10% in the seven-day time frame. Similarly, ETH has also seen significant gains, rising 14% in the same period to reach a current price of $2,885.

After achieving a significant 30-day high, SHIB has embarked on an upward trajectory, leading many to speculate about its potential to attain new heights—perhaps even its all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Solana Rockets Past BNB To Claim Coveted 4th Spot In Crypto Ranks With increasing buying volume, confidence in SHIB’s future is growing. Some individuals are beginning to believe that this could signal the onset of something more substantial; however, there remains a crucial obstacle: a resistance level at $0.00001900, which must be overcome. Shiba Inu: Breaking Through Resistance SHIB needs to break out above this zone of resistance, thus keeping the upward momentum intact. It has acted as a barrier in the past and hence inaccessible for SHIB to record more. If successful at breaking through, there is high hope for higher levels-and that may just kindle the hopes among investors that anticipate SHIB to test its all-time high again. A significant volume break at this level would, however, bolster the bullish sentiment. Conversely, if it fails to overcome this obstacle, SHIB might encounter a pullback toward its support levels, which are around the 50-day moving average, where it could consolidate and gather strength for another attempt. A More Favorable Market Environment? The timing of this likely breakout also looks pretty good in the context of a much larger, more favorable market environment. With the US elections out of the way, political uncertainty has diminished significantly, and investors appear to be willing to take on risk once again. This has caused a “de-risking” environment, and the asset here is a beneficiary. The overall crypto market is slowly showing a recovery trend, and it will bode well for SHIB in the long term. This would be especially true if short-term runs continue to favor SHIB. The next week to 10 days will be pivotal as to whether SHIB can sustain this trend or not.

Recently, principal developer Kusama introduced an ambitious initiative designed to place the US as a global leader in blockchain technology through “Strategic Hub for Innovation in Blockchain” (S.H.I.B.). This project that has the potential to convert US into the “Silicon Valley of Crypto” will aim at attracting blockchain talent, stimulating innovation, and generating employment. However, despite these requiring hefty investments estimated between $1.3 billion and $2.35 billion for the next decade, it shows the growing ambition behind Shiba Inu and its much bigger role in the fast-changing blockchain landscape. At present, if it can break through the critical technical barriers and the market remains favorable, there is always the potential for significant growth down the line. Statistics from CoinCheckup indicate a six-month prediction increase of 107% for the meme coin, with a one year forecast of 77%.
