Fed’s Second Consecutive Rate Cut On Thursday, the Federal Reserve announced its decision to cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by 25 basis points to a target range of 4.50%-4.75%, adding to the bullish sentiment surrounding crypto prices. This marks the second consecutive rate cut, following a half-percentage point reduction in September. The unanimous vote at this meeting, which included participation from Governor Michelle Bowman, reflects a shift in the Fed’s approach to balancing inflation control with labor market support. Related Reading: CNBC Projects Bitcoin Could Hit $100,000 Before Presidential Inauguration – Details In its post-meeting statement, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) noted a revised assessment of economic risks, indicating that the outlook for achieving employment and inflation goals is now seen as balanced, a departure from the previous month’s more optimistic stance. Crypto analyst Doctor Profit commented on the recent surge in both stock and crypto markets, suggesting that the price increases were in anticipation of the Fed’s rate cut. He predicts that continued rate cuts in the coming quarters could further drive up prices for both stocks and cryptocurrencies. Positive Trends For Bitcoin And Ethereum Post-Election In an exclusive interview with NewsBTC, Nansen’s Principal Research Analyst, Aurelie Barthere, highlighted that Bitcoin rise above its previous all-time high, coupled with high trading volumes, signals a strong positive momentum in the market. The analyst noted a period of “de-risking” in the run-up to the election, likely influenced by unfavorable polls for Trump, but observed a subsequent rush to “re-risk” as confidence returned following the election result, further evidenced by the rise in prices. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance – Top Analyst Sets $300 Target Barthere also pointed out that the Republican victory in the House of Representatives could further amplify this rally. However, she cautioned that profit-taking may occur in the coming weeks as new policies are tested, particularly regarding the potential political pressure on the US SEC chair to step down. The analyst pointed out that Ethereum is also gaining traction as expectations rise for a resurgence in decentralized finance (DeFi). Barthere noted an interesting uptick in the ETH/BTC price ratio, accompanied by significant net inflows into Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), totaling $52 million on the day of the election results. The analyst suggests that these continued inflows into the recently approved ETF market are seen as indicative of broader retail interest in the second largest cryptocurrency, which she ultimately believes has yet to see significant adoption. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $76,629, up nearly 10% in the seven-day time frame. Similarly, ETH has also seen significant gains, rising 14% in the same period to reach a current price of $2,885.

After achieving a significant 30-day high, SHIB has embarked on an upward trajectory, leading many to speculate about its potential to attain new heights—perhaps even its all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Solana Rockets Past BNB To Claim Coveted 4th Spot In Crypto Ranks With increasing buying volume, confidence in SHIB’s future is growing. Some individuals are beginning to believe that this could signal the onset of something more substantial; however, there remains a crucial obstacle: a resistance level at $0.00001900, which must be overcome. Shiba Inu: Breaking Through Resistance SHIB needs to break out above this zone of resistance, thus keeping the upward momentum intact. It has acted as a barrier in the past and hence inaccessible for SHIB to record more. If successful at breaking through, there is high hope for higher levels-and that may just kindle the hopes among investors that anticipate SHIB to test its all-time high again. A significant volume break at this level would, however, bolster the bullish sentiment. Conversely, if it fails to overcome this obstacle, SHIB might encounter a pullback toward its support levels, which are around the 50-day moving average, where it could consolidate and gather strength for another attempt. A More Favorable Market Environment? The timing of this likely breakout also looks pretty good in the context of a much larger, more favorable market environment. With the US elections out of the way, political uncertainty has diminished significantly, and investors appear to be willing to take on risk once again. This has caused a “de-risking” environment, and the asset here is a beneficiary. The overall crypto market is slowly showing a recovery trend, and it will bode well for SHIB in the long term. This would be especially true if short-term runs continue to favor SHIB. The next week to 10 days will be pivotal as to whether SHIB can sustain this trend or not.

Recently, principal developer Kusama introduced an ambitious initiative designed to place the US as a global leader in blockchain technology through “Strategic Hub for Innovation in Blockchain” (S.H.I.B.). This project that has the potential to convert US into the “Silicon Valley of Crypto” will aim at attracting blockchain talent, stimulating innovation, and generating employment. However, despite these requiring hefty investments estimated between $1.3 billion and $2.35 billion for the next decade, it shows the growing ambition behind Shiba Inu and its much bigger role in the fast-changing blockchain landscape. At present, if it can break through the critical technical barriers and the market remains favorable, there is always the potential for significant growth down the line. Statistics from CoinCheckup indicate a six-month prediction increase of 107% for the meme coin, with a one year forecast of 77%.

This has raised questions about whether this is the highest point that the flagship crypto can reach in this market cycle, and the analyst also provided some answers. Bitcoin Price Ceiling Is At $137,000 Tony Severino mentioned in an X post that the current ceiling for the Bitcoin price is $137,000, while its floor is around $39,000. He noted that investors could double their investments from Bitcoin’s current price if the crypto reached this target. Meanwhile, a decline to the current floor represents a 50% drop. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Marks Local Bottom, Can Price Run 100% From Here Again? When asked if the $137,000 was the target for the bull top, the analyst responded that his target was between $160,000 and $180,000. He remarked that $137,000 is just the ceiling as of this month and rises as time goes by. As such, his $180,000 market top target could become more feasible in the next few months. While it remains to be seen whether the Bitcoin price could reach this $137,000 ceiling or even the $180,000 bull top target, it is almost certain that the flagship crypto might never drop to the $39,000 floor again. This is based on historical trends that show that Bitcoin never falls below its pre-election level after the US presidential elections have concluded. Therefore, the next leg of the bull run has likely begun, and the flagship crypto will likely continue to hit new highs in the coming months. In an X post, crypto analyst Jelle revealed that the Bitcoin price has resumed its uptrend after seven months of sideways action. He added that it shouldn’t be long before the falling wedge pattern on Bitcoin’s chart plays with a rise to $100,000, the potential target. The Most Bullish Background For Bitcoin At The Moment Crypto analyst CrediBULL, who had before now been bearish, said that this could arguably be the most bullish background for Bitcoin, with the elections over and Donald Trump’s victory. He added that if these are the fundamentals driving the market, then the Bitcoin price is unlikely to drop to $68,000 again. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Ignites 3,674% On Election Day, Will SHIB Move With Dogecoin Price To New ATH? He also suggested that this might be the perfect time to become bullish on the Bitcoin price as the run to $100,000 might have begun. However, he warned that any violations of the $68,700 level would “drastically” weaken the bullish argument and strengthen the bear case further. Analyst Justin Bennett also commented on the potential Bitcoin price rally to $100,000.

Launching on Fuel Network, the project aims to provide solutions for some of the limitations in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) landscape and offer traders fast, secure, and transparent trading with minimized state and reduced storage. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Looks ‘More Bullish Than Before’ After Flipping BNB As 4th Largest Crypto Spark Brings First On-Chain Oder Books To The Ethereum Ecosystem Decentralized trading protocol Spark is launching the Ethereum ecosystem’s first fully on-chain order book, seeking to offer traders a “secure, efficient, and decentralized” experience. Per the announcement, the state-minimized order book will move execution fully on-chain to enhance transparency. Moreover, it’s set to reduce data storage and processing needs to ensure faster transactions without compromising security. The Ethereum L2 project aims to address the limitations of Automated Market Makers (AMMS) and Centralized Exchanges (CEXs). Despite being instrumental in DeFi’s growth, AMMs struggle to meet the “advanced demands of institutional traders in high-frequency and algorithmic trading.” Meanwhile, CEXs have been criticized for the lack of transparency and control expected in decentralized systems. The project argues that DeFi needs to use traditional trading mechanisms to attract institutional traders. As a result, Spark will introduce Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs) to tackle these limitations. CLOBs are trading mechanisms used in traditional stock markets to match all bids and offers according to time priority and price. With this implementation, Spark is set to provide better price discovery, faster execution, and deeper liquidity while maintaining security and transparency. Additionally, it seeks to offer “the precision and capabilities necessary for professional and institutional traders.” Vitali Dervoed, Spark’s CEO and co-founder, highlighted the importance of order books for institutional and retail traders who seek accuracy and transparency while controlling their assets: Order books are the backbone of professional, institutional, and advanced retail traders who rely on precise execution and transparency. Spark’s shift to on-chain trading represents a significant leap in eliminating the trade-offs associated with off-chain systems. With full visibility into order depth and liquidity, users are protected from risks like front-running and manipulation while enjoying the security of self-custody. Unlike centralized exchanges, Spark ensures users have complete control over their assets, making it an ideal platform for traders prioritizing security, transparency, and efficiency. A ‘New Era’ For Decentralized Trading? Launched in October, Fuel is a modular rollup operating system designed for Ethereum. After three weeks, it achieved a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $33.5 million. According to data from DeFiLlama, Fuel saw a 700% TVL increase in one day, followed by a 1200% weekly increase. Spark is one of the first dApps in the Fuel Network. The Ethereum Layer 2 project is powered by Fuel’s modular architecture, aiming to “push DeFi closer to mainstream adoption” with speed, scalability, and interoperability. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Gearing Up For Massive Bullish Wave Following 8% Daily Surge, 110% Rally Ahead? The projects look to build a “new era for decentralized trading” that unlocks “new possibilities for institutional-grade DeFi” and evolves the Ethereum landscape. Ultimately, Fuel Network’s CEO, Nick Sway, noted Spark’s launch as a vehicle to “push” DeFi boundaries: Fuel’s mission is to foster an environment where builders can push the boundaries of DeFi, and Spark is a testament to this vision. By leveraging Fuel’s powerful high-performance design, Spark introduces a new level of transparency and efficiency to decentralized finance through on-chain order book trading, setting a new benchmark for scalability and precision.

This increase, representing a 10.24% growth over the past 24 hours, emphasizes Binance’s substantial share of global crypto futures positions. The surge in OI also highlights Binance’s influence on market trends, given that it now accounts for roughly 35% of all open futures positions across all exchanges globally. The total OI across exchanges, including Binance, reached $23.3 billion, setting a record in the sector, Kesmeci reveals. Implications Of Binance High Open Interest To understand what the increase in Binance open interest means for the crypto market, it is worth first looking into what the term ‘open interest’ means. Notably, open interest (OI) refers to the total number of outstanding contracts in the futures market, encompassing both long and short positions. A rise in this metric often suggests increased trading activity and interest, making it a crucial indicator for market participants. Binance OI Reaches New ATH of $8.3 Billion “Open Interest across all exchanges—including Binance—stands at $23.3 billion, marking a new ATH. This means Binance alone accounts for around 35% of all global futures positions.” – By @burak_kesmeci Link 👇https://t.co/zfnGiGUtKL pic.twitter.com/DfWbZH3tfN — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) November 6, 2024 Kesmeci explained that a significant jump in open interest such as that of Binance—particularly when it exceeds a 3% increase within a 24-hour period—frequently precedes heightened market volatility and potential liquidations. This means that both bullish and bearish positions could come under increased pressure as market dynamics shift, creating potential for major moves across the crypto landscape. The CryptoQuant analyst particularly wrote: Remember, the OI metric represents the total number of open long and short positions in the market. Sharp increases in OI suggest that, as volatility spikes, both long and short positions could face increased pressure, potentially leading to liquidations. BNB’s Price Movement Amid Broader Market Trends Binance’s native token BNB, has also experienced a notable price movement, mirroring the broader uptrend within the crypto market led by Bitcoin’s resurgence.

Earlier today, BNB breached the $600 mark, reaching a 24-hour high of $610 before experiencing a slight pullback to $595, at the time of writing. Despite this correction, the asset remains up 2% over the past 24 hours. This price action brings BNB closer to its previous ATH of $717, recorded on June 6 of this year, with the current price reflecting a 17.3% decrease from that peak.

The price rallied toward $0.5780 resistance and then quickly faded most gains. XRP price is losing pace above the $0.5500 zone. The price is now trading above $0.5320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5360 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $0.5250 support zone. XRP Price Eyes More Upsides XRP price remained supported above the $0.5150 level. It formed a base and started a fresh increase above $0.5250 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move above the $0.5350 and $0.5500 resistance levels. The bulls even pushed the price above the $0.5650 level before the bears appeared. A high is formed at $0.5758 and the price is correcting gains. There was a move below the $0.5650 support. It dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4948 swing low to the $0.5758 high. The price is now trading above $0.5320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5360 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4948 swing low to the $0.5758 high. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5600 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5650 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5780. A clear move above the $0.5780 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5880 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5920 resistance or even $0.6000 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.6200. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5650 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5450 level. The next major support is near the $0.5360 level and the trend line. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5360 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5250 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5120 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $0.5450 and $0.5360.
