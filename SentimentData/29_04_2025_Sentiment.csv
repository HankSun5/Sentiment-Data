One such exciting development is the integration of Bitcoin into the proof-of-stake ecosystem through networks like Babylon. While this opens up new opportunities for earning yield on your Bitcoin, it also introduces potential risks, most notably ‘slashing’. But what if you could stake your Bitcoin on Babylon with a crucial layer of safety? That’s where Nexus Mutual steps in, developing a specialized protection product designed specifically for Babylon staking . Understanding Babylon Staking and the Risk of Slashing Before diving into the protection, let’s clarify what we’re talking about. Babylon is a project focused on bringing Bitcoin’s robust security to proof-of-stake (PoS) chains. It allows Bitcoin holders to stake their BTC, contributing to the security of PoS networks and earning yield in return. This process, known as Bitcoin staking , is a significant step towards enhancing the utility of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. However, participating in proof-of-stake comes with a built-in mechanism to punish validators (and sometimes delegators) for misbehavior, such as going offline (downtime) or signing conflicting blocks (double-signing). This punishment is called ‘slashing’, where a portion of the staked assets is confiscated by the network. Slashing is a necessary evil in PoS design – it incentivizes good behavior and network integrity – but it represents a significant financial risk for anyone participating in staking, whether they are running a validator node or simply delegating their stake. For Babylon staking participants, this risk is particularly relevant. As Bitcoin is the asset being staked, a slashing event could lead to a direct loss of valuable BTC. This potential downside can be a major deterrent, especially for larger holders or institutions considering participating in the Babylon network. Enter Nexus Mutual: A Pioneer in Crypto Insurance This is where Nexus Mutual, a decentralized crypto insurance protocol, plays a vital role. Unlike traditional insurance companies, Nexus Mutual is a member-owned mutual where risks are shared among the community. Members buy cover to protect against specific smart contract risks, exchange hacks, or other defined events in the crypto space. The mutual is governed by its members, and claims are assessed by members, creating a transparent and community-driven risk-sharing pool. Nexus Mutual has been a leader in providing coverage for various risks within decentralized finance (DeFi) since its inception. Their expertise lies in understanding the unique technical and economic risks associated with blockchain protocols and creating products to mitigate them. Developing protection against slashing is a natural extension of their mission to provide essential safety nets for participants in the digital asset ecosystem. How Nexus Mutual’s Slashing Protection Works for Babylon Stakers According to reports, Nexus Mutual is actively developing a tailored slashing protection product specifically for Babylon’s proof-of-stake system. This product is being built with advisory support from Babylon Labs, the core team behind the Babylon network. This collaboration is crucial, as it ensures the protection product is designed with an in-depth understanding of Babylon’s specific slashing conditions and mechanisms. The core idea is straightforward: stakers on Babylon can purchase cover from Nexus Mutual. If a covered slashing event occurs – meaning the staker loses some of their staked Bitcoin due to a penalty defined in the cover policy – they can submit a claim to Nexus Mutual. If the claim is approved by the mutual’s members, the staker receives compensation in cryptocurrency, covering the loss incurred from the slashing penalty, up to the amount of cover purchased. The product aims to offer flexible and tailored coverage options. This is important because the needs of an individual delegating a small amount of Bitcoin differ significantly from those of a large institution running multiple validator nodes with substantial capital staked. Tailored options could include varying levels of coverage, different durations, and specific definitions of covered slashing events. What Specific Risks Does Slashing Protection Cover? While the exact details of Nexus Mutual’s Babylon product will be outlined in their policy wording, typical slashing protection covers events like: Double-Signing: When a validator node signs two different blocks at the same height, indicating malicious intent or a severe configuration error. Downtime/Inactivity: While often resulting in less severe penalties than double-signing, prolonged validator downtime can also lead to gradual slashing of staked funds. Other Protocol-Specific Penalties: Depending on Babylon’s specific rules, there might be other actions or inactions that trigger slashing, which the cover would aim to include. It’s crucial for stakers to read the specific policy details provided by Nexus Mutual to understand exactly which events are covered and any exclusions that may apply. Who Benefits? Individual vs. Institutional Stakers The development of this slashing protection product is a significant win for both types of participants in the Babylon ecosystem: Benefits for Individual Stakers: Reduced Anxiety: Staking can be nerve-wracking due to the risk of losing funds. Protection provides peace of mind. Encourages Participation: Lowering the risk barrier makes staking more accessible and appealing to a broader range of individual Bitcoin holders. Predictable Outcomes: While slashing is unpredictable, having insurance makes the financial outcome of such an event predictable – you’re covered. Benefits for Institutional Stakers: Risk Management: Institutions require robust risk management frameworks. Slashing protection is an essential tool for mitigating operational and protocol-level risks associated with staking. Capital Protection: Protecting large pools of staked capital from potentially significant slashing penalties is critical for preserving asset value. Compliance and Reporting: Having insurance can simplify compliance requirements and financial reporting by providing a clear strategy for addressing staking risks. Scalability: With protection in place, institutions can potentially scale their Babylon staking operations with greater confidence. The fact that Nexus Mutual is designing coverage specifically for both demographics highlights the anticipated broad appeal and importance of the Babylon network and the recognized need for robust crypto insurance solutions within it. Why Slashing Protection is Crucial for Bitcoin Staking Growth The ability to stake Bitcoin is a major step forward for the cryptocurrency space, unlocking new potential for yield and participation. However, integrating Bitcoin into PoS systems introduces new risks that aren’t present when simply holding BTC. Slashing is arguably the most significant of these risks from a financial perspective. For Bitcoin staking to achieve widespread adoption, especially among risk-averse individuals and institutions, mitigating this core risk is paramount. A reliable slashing protection product from a reputable provider like Nexus Mutual removes a major hurdle. It transforms staking from a potentially high-risk, high-reward activity into one where the downside risk is significantly limited, making the yield more attractive on a risk-adjusted basis. This development is not just important for Babylon, but it sets a precedent for other future projects that might seek to utilize Bitcoin’s security or allow BTC staking. It underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market, where infrastructure for risk management, like crypto insurance , is catching up with innovation in yield generation and cross-chain interoperability. Navigating the Nuances: Challenges and Considerations While highly beneficial, implementing and utilizing slashing protection isn’t without its nuances. Challenges and considerations include: Cost of Cover: Like any insurance, this protection will come at a cost (premiums), which needs to be weighed against the potential staking yield and the perceived risk of slashing. Policy Wording: Understanding the exact terms, conditions, and exclusions of the cover is vital. Not all slashing events might be covered under every policy. Claim Assessment Process: While Nexus Mutual has a proven claims process, it still requires member assessment, which takes time. Dynamic Risk: The risk profile of staking can change based on network conditions, validator performance, and protocol upgrades. Potential stakers should perform their own due diligence on both the Babylon network and the Nexus Mutual cover product before committing funds. Actionable Insights for Potential Babylon Stakers If you’re considering participating in Babylon staking , here are some actionable steps: Research Babylon: Understand how the network works, its consensus mechanism, and its specific slashing conditions. Evaluate the Risk: Assess your personal risk tolerance and the potential financial impact of a slashing event on your staked capital. Monitor Nexus Mutual’s Launch: Keep an eye on announcements from Nexus Mutual regarding the official launch and availability of the Babylon slashing protection product. Review Policy Details Carefully: Once available, read the cover policy wording thoroughly to understand what is covered, what isn’t, the cost, and the claims process. Compare Costs vs. Benefits: Determine if the cost of the cover is a worthwhile expense given the potential yield and the mitigation of slashing risk. Choose Your Validator Wisely (if delegating): While cover helps, delegating to a reputable and reliable validator significantly reduces the likelihood of slashing in the first place. Taking these steps will help you make an informed decision about participating in Bitcoin staking on Babylon with the added layer of slashing protection . Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin Staking Security The collaboration between Nexus Mutual and Babylon Labs to bring dedicated slashing protection to the Babylon network marks a significant milestone. It addresses one of the most prominent risks associated with proof-of-stake participation, particularly crucial for a network that allows staking of the most valuable digital asset, Bitcoin. By offering tailored crypto insurance options for both individuals and institutions, Nexus Mutual is not only providing a valuable service but also contributing to the overall maturity and de-risking of the crypto ecosystem. This development is poised to boost confidence and potentially drive greater participation in Babylon staking , unlocking new utility for Bitcoin holders and strengthening the security of integrated PoS chains. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the availability of robust risk management tools like specialized insurance will be key to fostering broader adoption and innovation.

SHIB battles resistance near $0.0000145 as bullish momentum faces critical test. Longer-term SHIB forecasts predict over 100% upside if market stability returns. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is facing fresh selling pressure after hackers offloaded an enormous amount of tokens. Blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the Bitrue Exploiters, linked to a 2023 breach, exchanged 150 billion SHIB and 756 million Holochain (HOT) tokens. In return, they acquired approximately 1,500 Ethereum (ETH). A major portion of these funds, particularly 1,050 ETH, has already been laundered through TornadoCash, significantly complicating the transaction trail. Consequently, fears are rising that SHIB’s market stability could suffer further as the hackers still hold around 5,111 ETH and 16 million DAI, with a combined value nearing $25.5 million. Given the vast number of SHIB tokens involved, investors are bracing for potential heavy selling pressure that could push SHIB into a more volatile and bearish territory. #PeckShieldAlert #Bitrue Exploiter-labeled addresses have swapped 150B $SHIB… The post SHIB’s Recovery Rally Now Faces Critical Test as Hackers Offload Millions in Tokens appeared first on Coin Edition .",Altcoin News|CoinMarketCap Feed|Market|Market News|News|Price Analysis|Top Crypto News|Shiba Inu (SHIB),EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-04-28 22:30:00

As the Heikin Ashi monthly candle flashes bearish signals, the analyst shares the ideal time to buy Bitcoin, warning investors of potential bear market traps. Upper Bollinger Band Reveal Time To Buy Bitcoin Severino has provided an in-depth examination of the Bitcoin market, identifying precise conditions under which investors and traders, including himself, might consider re-entering based on key market indicators and price action. The analyst broke down a Bitcoin price chart featuring monthly candlesticks, Bollinger Bands, and historical comparisons. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: The Last Leg-Up That Confirms A Resounding Rally To $150,000 The chart highlights that in late 2021, after hitting its previous ATH, Bitcoin touched the Upper Bollinger Band but failed to close above it. At the time, this move was perceived as a classic non-confirmation, which ultimately led to a sharp reversal and brutal bear market in 2022. Fast forward to today, Bitcoin is hovering above $94,000, with the Upper Bollinger Band positioned at $108,000. According to Severino, merely reaching this Upper Bollinger Band level, as it did in 2021, is not enough reason to buy Bitcoin in anticipation of a price increase. Instead, the analyst asserts that a full monthly close above $108,000 is needed to confirm a breakout and continuation of the bullish trend. The analyst also disclosed that he would consider buying Bitcoin once it closes sufficiently above this level. However, if the flagship cryptocurrency fails to close above the Upper Bollinger Band for a month, it could mirror the 2021 double top and fake breakout, potentially leading to another steep bear market this cycle. Overall, Severino advises investors to closely watch Bitcoin’s price action around this key Bollinger Band. He stresses that capital preservation far outweighs succumbing to the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). With elevated risks and rising volatility, the analyst believes that clear confirmation signals are the only way to engage with the market safely. BTC’s Heikin Ashi Candle Flips Bearish While Severino confirms the ideal time to buy BTC, the analyst also announced that the Bitcoin Heikin Ashi candles have turned bearish. The analyst shared a 12-week Heikin Ashi candlestick chart, which shows Bitcoin flashing early warning signs of a potential bear market. Related Reading: Analyst’s Bitcoin Price Prediction From March Plays Out, Here’s The Rest Of It The chart highlights a critical moment where Bitcoin’s Heikin Ashi candle turned red for the first time since its previous price peaks in 2014, 2018, and 2022. Historically, such a signal has marked the beginning of prolonged bear markets and deep price corrections. Further strengthening the bearish outlook, Severino pointed out that the Fisher Transform, a technical indicator used to detect trend reversals, is exhibiting a bearish crossover, with the green Fisher line dropping below the red Trigger line. In previous cycles, whenever these two signals — the Heikin Ashi and Fisher Transform — aligned, Bitcoin experienced substantial declines that lasted for months, if not years.

43919825,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153443,1745879439,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pakistan Crypto Council Strikes Revolutionary MOU with Trump-Linked WLFI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pakistan-crypto-council-mou/,"Big news recently surfaced from the intersection of decentralized finance and international crypto development. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi Project that has garnered attention due to its association with the Trump family, announced a significant step via their X account. They’ve signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Pakistan Crypto Council . This agreement is being framed as a major move aimed at accelerating Crypto Innovation through collaboration with key leaders in Pakistan’s burgeoning crypto space. What Exactly is This WLFI and Pakistan Crypto Council Agreement? Let’s break down the core announcement. At its heart, we have two entities coming together with a stated goal of fostering crypto growth. WLFI, positioned as a DeFi Project , operates within the decentralized finance ecosystem, typically involving blockchain-based financial applications without traditional intermediaries. The Pakistan Crypto Council , on the other hand, represents a collective effort within Pakistan to engage with, promote, and perhaps help shape the landscape for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the country. The signing of an MOU is essentially a declaration of mutual intent. It’s not a legally binding contract for specific actions or investments, but rather a formal expression of willingness to collaborate on certain objectives. In this case, the objective is clear: driving Crypto Innovation in Pakistan. This suggests potential future cooperation on initiatives like: Exploring the implementation of DeFi solutions in the Pakistani market. Sharing knowledge and expertise on blockchain technology. Potentially working towards creating a more favorable environment for crypto adoption. Identifying specific use cases for decentralized finance within Pakistan’s economy. For the Pakistan Crypto Council , partnering with an international project, especially one with some public profile, could be seen as a way to gain global exposure and potentially attract technology and investment. For WLFI, it represents an opportunity to explore expansion into an emerging market with significant potential for crypto adoption. Decoding the ‘Trump-Linked’ Aspect of the WLFI Project The mention of WLFI being ‘associated with the Trump family’ immediately adds a layer of complexity and intrigue to this development. While the exact nature of this association isn’t detailed in the announcement, such connections can significantly impact a project’s visibility and perception, both positively and negatively, depending on one’s political stance and view of Trump Crypto endeavors. Donald Trump’s relationship with the crypto space has evolved. Initially skeptical, he later launched successful NFT collections, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to leveraging digital assets for commercial purposes. Projects or ventures linked to prominent political figures often attract increased scrutiny, media attention, and can sometimes face unique challenges or opportunities related to regulatory environments and public opinion. For a DeFi Project like WLFI, having an association with a globally recognized name could theoretically provide a platform for broader reach. However, it also ties the project’s narrative, to some extent, to political dynamics, which are inherently unpredictable. When considering the Pakistan Crypto Council ‘s perspective, engaging with a project with such a link might be viewed through different lenses internally and externally, potentially influencing the partnership’s trajectory. Why is the Pakistan Crypto Council Focusing on DeFi Innovation? Pakistan represents a dynamic and rapidly evolving market for digital technologies. With a large, young population and increasing internet penetration, the potential for crypto adoption, particularly in areas like remittances and financial inclusion, is substantial. The Pakistan Crypto Council ‘s mandate likely includes exploring avenues to harness this potential while navigating the complex regulatory landscape. Focusing on Crypto Innovation , specifically within DeFi, makes strategic sense for several reasons: Financial Inclusion: DeFi can offer alternative financial services to underbanked populations. Remittances: Pakistan is a major recipient of remittances, and crypto/DeFi could offer faster, cheaper transfer methods. Technological Advancement: Embracing DeFi can position Pakistan as a forward-thinking nation in the digital economy. Attracting Talent & Investment: Demonstrating a commitment to innovation can draw in skilled professionals and foreign investment. Partnering with a DeFi Project like WLFI could provide the Council with direct insights into the latest decentralized technologies and use cases being developed globally. This knowledge exchange is crucial for building a robust local crypto ecosystem. Potential Benefits and Challenges of This Partnership Any cross-border partnership, especially in the fast-paced and often uncertain world of crypto, comes with its own set of potential upsides and hurdles. The agreement between WLFI and the Pakistan Crypto Council is no exception. Potential Benefits: Accelerated Learning: The Council gains access to WLFI’s technical expertise in DeFi, potentially accelerating their understanding and application of these technologies. Market Insights: WLFI gets valuable insights into the Pakistani market, its specific needs, and regulatory nuances from the Council. Pilot Programs: The MOU could pave the way for collaborative pilot projects demonstrating the practical application of DeFi in Pakistan. Increased Profile: Both entities could see their profiles raised within their respective spheres and internationally through this partnership. Driving Local Innovation: The collaboration could stimulate local development of crypto and blockchain solutions tailored to Pakistan’s needs. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for crypto in Pakistan is still evolving, which could pose significant challenges to implementing new DeFi solutions. MOU is Non-Binding: As an MOU, the agreement is a statement of intent, not a guarantee of specific outcomes or projects. Execution depends entirely on continued willingness and effort from both sides. Political Sensitivities: The ‘Trump-linked’ nature of WLFI could introduce political considerations or public perception issues that might complicate the partnership. Infrastructure Gaps: Implementing advanced DeFi solutions might face limitations depending on the digital infrastructure available in various parts of Pakistan. Market Volatility & Adoption Hurdles: The inherent volatility of the crypto market and potential user adoption challenges in a new market remain significant factors. Navigating these challenges will require careful planning, clear communication, and a deep understanding of both the technological possibilities and the local context. Keeping an Eye on WLFI and Pakistan Crypto Council Developments For anyone interested in the future of crypto in emerging markets, or the impact of high-profile associations on crypto projects, this partnership is one to watch. While the MOU is just the first step, it signals an intention to collaborate on fostering Crypto Innovation in a country with significant potential. What should we look out for next? Keep an eye on official announcements from both WLFI and the Pakistan Crypto Council . Will they announce specific joint initiatives or pilot projects? How will the regulatory landscape in Pakistan evolve, and how might that impact potential DeFi implementations? The success of this collaboration will ultimately depend on concrete actions taken following the MOU and their ability to navigate the inherent complexities of the crypto space and the local market. This development highlights the ongoing global effort to explore and implement blockchain and DeFi technologies, reaching into diverse markets and sometimes involving unexpected connections. Summary In summary, the DeFi Project WLFI, known for its association with the Trump family, has signed an MOU with the Pakistan Crypto Council . This agreement aims to drive Crypto Innovation in Pakistan through collaboration. While the ‘ Trump Crypto ‘ link adds a unique dimension, the core of the partnership lies in exploring how decentralized finance can contribute to Pakistan’s digital economy. The path forward involves potential benefits like knowledge sharing and pilot programs, but also challenges related to regulation, execution, and political sensitivities. As an initial step, this MOU sets the stage for potential future developments in Pakistan’s crypto landscape, which market observers will be watching closely.

43920106,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153450,1745880034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Android Updates Headline Dedicated Virtual Event Before Google I/O’s AI Focus,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/android-updates-virtual-event/,"The tech world is buzzing with news from Google, and while our focus is often on how these shifts impact the broader digital landscape, including cryptocurrencies and decentralized tech, understanding the moves of major players like Google is crucial. A recent announcement signals a notable change in how Google will present information about its mobile operating system. News specifically concerning Android updates will now take a different path ahead of the company’s major annual gathering. Android Updates Get a Dedicated Virtual Stage Google has decided to move a significant portion of its announcements regarding the latest developments in the Android ecosystem to a separate virtual event. This event, titled “The Android Show: I/O Edition,” is scheduled to air virtually on May 13. This means that enthusiasts and developers eager to hear about the newest features and changes coming to Android will tune into this online presentation before the main developer conference begins. While Android will still have a presence during the main event through keynotes and technical sessions aimed at developers, the bulk of the major announcements appears to be happening during this dedicated virtual show. This represents a shift from previous years where significant Android news was often a central part of the main Google I/O keynote. The Lead-Up to Google I/O : A Strategic Shift? The decision to pre-empt the main conference with a dedicated Android event has led to speculation about the focus of this year’s Google I/O . Historically, the Google I/O developer conference has been the primary venue for showcasing major updates across Google’s software, hardware, and platforms, with Android often taking a prominent role. Moving core Android news suggests that the main Google I/O keynote might be heavily weighted towards other areas. While Google states this is due to the sheer volume of new Android information, many observers believe it points to another dominant theme taking center stage at the main event. What to Expect for AI at Google I/O Given the industry-wide focus and Google’s significant investments in artificial intelligence, the prevailing expectation is that AI at Google I/O will command an even larger share of the spotlight this year. AI news and updates have been increasingly integrated into the Google I/O keynotes in recent years, reflecting the technology’s growing importance across all of Google’s products and services. With Android updates moved to a separate virtual event, it clears more time and space during the main conference for deep dives into Google’s latest AI advancements, models, applications, and developer tools. Attendees and viewers are likely to see a strong emphasis on how AI is being integrated into Google Search, Cloud, Workspace, and potentially new hardware or research initiatives. Navigating the Google Developer Conference Format Understanding the format of the Google Developer Conference this year requires noting the addition of this significant pre-conference virtual show. The main Google I/O event will still feature keynotes and technical sessions designed for developers across various Google platforms, including Android. However, the structure indicates a potential prioritization of topics during the main keynote. Developers interested specifically in the foundational ‘what’s new’ for Android should likely tune into the virtual event on May 13, while those interested in the broader Google ecosystem, particularly AI and cross-platform integrations, will focus on the main Google I/O dates. The Growing Trend of the Virtual Tech Event Google’s move also highlights the continued evolution of how major tech companies disseminate news and engage with their communities. The dedicated virtual event for Android updates is an example of the growing trend of the Virtual tech event . These online formats allow companies to reach a global audience more easily and can be tailored to specific topics or audiences. While the return to in-person elements for developer conferences is happening, companies are retaining virtual components to deliver targeted information. This split approach—a focused virtual show for a specific platform like Android, followed by a broader, potentially AI-centric main event—might become a more common model for large-scale tech announcements. Conclusion Google’s decision to host a dedicated virtual event for Android updates before the main Google I/O conference is a significant programming change. While framed by Google as a necessity due to the volume of Android news, it strongly suggests that artificial intelligence will be the dominant theme at this year’s main developer gathering.

This follows an announcement made on April 23, which detailed the plans for an exclusive dinner for the top 220 holders of the meme coin. Top 25 TRUMP holders promised more than just dinner According to the Kaiko report , part of the plans included a meet-and-greet session with the President for the top 25 holders. “On Wednesday, April 23, the team behind the official TRUMP meme coin announced plans for an exclusive dinner for the top 220 holders, with the top 25 receiving a meet-and-greet with the sitting president,” noted Kaiko. In their report, the research firm added that this announcement triggered a 200% surge in on-chain activity for TRUMP, amounting to $2.4 billion worth of on-chain transfers, as nearly 10,000 wallets transferred the token. According to Kaiko, TRUMP jumped 60% on the announcement day from $9 to $14.50, adding that it marked the busiest day of the month for the token as well as “its highest trading volume on centralized exchanges since mid-February.” Following the dinner announcement, TRUMP overshadowed all other meme coins, including DOGE, and accounted for almost 50% of all meme coin trading volume on centralized exchanges last Wednesday. Kaiko also noted that there was a spike in the share of smaller wallets that transferred smaller amounts of TRUMP tokens on the Solana blockchain. “Typically, around 46% of active wallets transfer less than $10k worth of TRUMP, but this jumped to 75% following the announcement. Most of this surge came from very small transfers (under $1k), which alone made up 47.2% of active wallets.” Kaiko. The research firm has also pointed out that while Trump is challenging the narrative that meme coins are not valuable, the initiative has not been without controversy. Critics see controversy with the initiative Critics, including Trump’s political rivals as well as ethics advocates, have closely examined the move by the President and expressed concerns that he is rewarding those who buy his meme coin. Senator Jon Ossoff has called for President Trump’s impeachment over the dinner event. Ossoff condemned the plan as unethical and dangerous, saying it blurs the line between politics, personal gain, and public trust. Adding another perspective to the story, some experts noted some suspicious on-chain movements. The next day, after the announcement, a user identified as “Sun” seemed to be registering for the upcoming event, according to Arkham Intelligence. The movements seemed to raise suspicion that the addresses could be directed to Justin Sun, who is the Tron founder and has been a strong supporter of Trump. In November, Sun announced that Tron had invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial, a Trump-linked DeFi project. Thereafter, World Liberty Financial named Sun as its advisor. Citing Chainalysis , The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the meme coin had “generated hundreds of millions worth of cryptocurrency profits for entities affiliated with Trump.” Although volumes have shrunk in the wake of the announcement, Kaiko is upbeat about another wave of intense market action around the corner. “Volumes have since tapered off as the euphoria waned, similar to onchain activity. However, based on the website’s rules for the competition, we can expect to see more activity in the coming weeks.” Kaiko. “The rules stipulate that the top 220 average TRUMP holders between April 23 and May 12 will be eligible for the dinner. Increased activity is likely as the deadline approaches and holders move funds back on-chain to qualify for the event,” added the research firm.

The new card is backed by Mastercard and is being developed in partnership with CompoSecure and Baanx, according to the company. The product uses smart contracts to execute the IRL (In Real Life) transactions, with a processing speed under five seconds. It operates on the Linea network, a layer-2 scaling solution on Ethereum. The companies marketed the self-custodied crypto card as an alternative to the potential risks associated with centralized exchanges. In February, the second-largest crypto exchange by volume, Bybit, was hacked for $1.4 billion , an event that sparked widespread consternation in the crypto space. With the launch of its card, MetaMask is entering a competitive segment of the cryptocurrency market. Major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, and Crypto.com already offer crypto debit cards, some of which feature ""crypto-back"" rewards that allow users to earn digital assets on their purchases. MetaMask has struggled lately as interest in and participation in the Ethereum ecosystem have dried up. According to Dune Analytics, the wallet collected just $289,312 in fees for the week of April 14, much less than the $1.3 million in fees collected for the same period a year ago.

43920392,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153451,1745880631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlock Dual Rewards: Lombard Integrates LBTC with EigenLayer,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lombard-eigenlayer-integration/,"The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with digital assets. A significant development recently emerged from the world of restaking, bridging the gap between the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Bitcoin restaking platform Lombard has announced a pivotal integration, bringing its wrapped Bitcoin asset, LBTC, into the burgeoning EigenLayer ecosystem. This move, undertaken in collaboration with the EigenLayer Foundation, is set to create exciting new opportunities for users. What Does the Lombard EigenLayer Integration Mean? At its core, the integration signifies a major step towards enhanced interoperability and capital efficiency within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. By integrating LBTC into EigenLayer, Lombard is essentially allowing Bitcoin holders, via their wrapped LBTC, to participate directly in the Ethereum restaking ecosystem facilitated by EigenLayer. This isn’t just a simple bridge; it’s about enabling a new layer of utility for Bitcoin capital. The key takeaway from this integration, as reported by The Block, is the potential for users to receive dual restaking rewards. Specifically, users holding LBTC and participating through this integration can earn rewards concurrently from both the Babylon protocol (a prominent player in Bitcoin restaking) and the EigenLayer ecosystem (a leading force in Ethereum restaking). Understanding Bitcoin Restaking with Babylon Before diving deeper into the dual rewards, it’s helpful to understand the components involved. Bitcoin restaking, as pioneered by protocols like Babylon, allows Bitcoin holders to repurpose their idle BTC capital to secure other decentralized networks or protocols. Traditionally, Bitcoin’s primary utility outside of being a store of value and medium of exchange has been limited to its own blockchain. Babylon’s approach enables Bitcoin holders to ‘stake’ their BTC in a way that provides security services to various proof-of-stake (PoS) systems. This mechanism leverages Bitcoin’s immense security and liquidity, extending it to other parts of the crypto ecosystem. Users who stake their Bitcoin through Babylon earn rewards for contributing to the security and consensus of these external networks. Exploring EigenLayer and Ethereum Restaking On the other side of this integration is EigenLayer, a protocol built on Ethereum that introduces the concept of ‘restaking’. Ethereum restaking allows users who have already staked their ETH (or Liquid Staking Tokens – LSTs) on the Ethereum Beacon Chain to restake that same capital to simultaneously secure other decentralized applications, services, or middleware, known as Actively Validated Services (AVSs). These AVSs might include decentralized oracles, bridges, data availability layers, or new virtual machines. EigenLayer provides a marketplace where AVSs can lease security from Ethereum stakers, and stakers can earn additional yield for providing this security. This significantly increases the capital efficiency for Ethereum stakers, allowing their staked ETH to work harder by securing multiple protocols simultaneously. How Does LBTC Bridge Bitcoin and EigenLayer Restaking? The integration of LBTC into EigenLayer creates a novel pathway. LBTC, being a wrapped representation of Bitcoin on a compatible network (often an Ethereum-compatible chain or a sidechain/layer-2 connected to Ethereum), can now interact with the EigenLayer smart contracts and infrastructure. This allows the value represented by LBTC to be ‘restaked’ within the EigenLayer ecosystem. Here’s a simplified breakdown: A user holds Bitcoin (BTC). The user wraps their BTC into LBTC using the Lombard platform. The user then utilizes the integration pathway to restake their LBTC through EigenLayer. Simultaneously, because Lombard’s platform facilitates interaction with protocols like Babylon, the underlying mechanism allows the user to also be eligible for rewards from Babylon’s Bitcoin restaking activities. This creates the unique scenario where the same underlying capital (originally Bitcoin, now represented as LBTC) is generating yield from two distinct restaking protocols operating on different blockchain paradigms (Babylon for Bitcoin restaking and EigenLayer for Ethereum-centric restaking). What are the Benefits for Users Participating in LBTC EigenLayer Restaking? The primary attraction of this integration is the potential for enhanced yield. By earning rewards from both Babylon and EigenLayer, users can potentially achieve a higher overall return on their Bitcoin capital compared to participating in only one form of restaking. Key benefits include: Dual Yield Generation: The ability to earn rewards from two separate, prominent restaking protocols simultaneously. Increased Capital Efficiency: Making idle Bitcoin capital work harder by securing multiple networks or services. Access to Ethereum Ecosystem Yields for Bitcoin Holders: Traditionally, earning yield within the Ethereum ecosystem required holding ETH or other Ethereum-based assets. This integration opens up new yield-earning avenues for Bitcoin holders using LBTC. Diversification of Restaking Exposure: Gaining exposure to both Bitcoin-native and Ethereum-centric restaking opportunities. Contribution to Ecosystem Security: Participating helps secure both the networks/protocols leveraging Babylon’s security and the AVSs building on EigenLayer. Are There Challenges or Considerations? While the potential rewards are appealing, it’s important to consider the complexities and risks inherent in such cross-chain and layered protocols: Protocol Risk: Both Lombard, Babylon, and EigenLayer are complex protocols. Smart contract bugs, design flaws, or exploits in any of these could lead to loss of funds. Slashing Risk: Restaking often involves slashing conditions, where staked or restaked assets can be partially or fully confiscated if the validator or participant acts maliciously or fails to perform their duties. Users must understand the specific slashing risks associated with both Babylon and EigenLayer. Wrapped Asset Risk: LBTC relies on the security and integrity of the wrapping mechanism provided by Lombard. Risks associated with the custody or pegging of the wrapped asset to the underlying Bitcoin exist. Yield Volatility: Restaking rewards can be variable and are subject to market conditions, the demand from AVSs on EigenLayer, and the protocols leveraging Babylon’s security. Complexity: Understanding the mechanics of wrapping, Bitcoin restaking, Ethereum restaking, and how they interact requires a certain level of technical understanding. Users should conduct thorough research and understand these risks before participating. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Ethereum Restaking? The Lombard and EigenLayer integration is a powerful example of the ongoing trend towards greater interoperability and capital efficiency in crypto. It demonstrates how the security and liquidity of Bitcoin can be leveraged to benefit ecosystems built on other chains, like Ethereum. This development could pave the way for more similar integrations, expanding the opportunities for Bitcoin holders to participate in various DeFi and restaking activities across different networks. It also highlights the growing maturity of the restaking landscape, with protocols finding innovative ways to stack utility and yield. Conclusion: Unlocking New Frontiers The integration of Lombard’s LBTC with EigenLayer marks a significant milestone, particularly for participants interested in Bitcoin restaking and Ethereum restaking. By enabling users to potentially earn dual rewards from both Babylon and EigenLayer, it unlocks new levels of capital efficiency and yield generation for Bitcoin holders. While the complexities and risks should not be overlooked, this development showcases the innovative potential at the intersection of Bitcoin and Ethereum, pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance and cross-chain collaboration.

43920735,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153452,1745881227,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Clarity on ProShares XRP ETF Launch Date,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/proshares-xrp-etf-launch-2/,"The world of cryptocurrency investing is constantly buzzing with anticipation, especially when it comes to the prospect of new investment vehicles like Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Recently, rumors circulated suggesting that ProShares, a major player in the ETF space, was set to launch a ProShares XRP ETF on April 30th. This specific date sparked considerable interest and speculation across the crypto community, eager for more regulated ways to gain exposure to XRP. Debunking the April 30th ProShares XRP ETF Launch Rumor Amidst the swirling rumors about a potential April 30th launch date for a ProShares XRP ETF, a key voice in the ETF analysis space stepped forward to provide clarity. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to address the speculation directly. His message was clear and concise: ProShares is not launching an XRP ETF on that specific date. This clarification served to temper expectations and correct misinformation that had begun to spread. Seyffart’s statement highlighted the fact that while there is indeed anticipation surrounding the potential launch of an XRP-focused ETF by issuers like ProShares, no official launch date has been confirmed by the company or regulatory bodies. The rumor likely stemmed from general excitement and perhaps misinterpretation of regulatory filings or market discussions. It’s a reminder that in the fast-paced crypto and ETF markets, relying on official announcements and reputable sources is paramount. Understanding the World of Cryptocurrency ETF Before diving deeper into the specifics of an XRP ETF, it’s helpful to understand what a Cryptocurrency ETF is and why it’s such a significant development for the market. An ETF is an investment fund that holds assets like stocks, commodities, or in this case, cryptocurrencies, and is traded on stock exchanges like regular stocks. For investors, Cryptocurrency ETFs offer several potential benefits: Accessibility: They allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies through traditional brokerage accounts, bypassing the need to set up separate crypto exchange accounts or manage private keys. Regulation: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of investor protection and oversight not always present with direct crypto ownership. Ease of Trading: They can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices, similar to stocks. Diversification (potentially): While an XRP ETF would focus on a single asset, broader crypto ETFs could offer exposure to a basket of digital currencies. The approval and launch of Cryptocurrency ETFs, particularly in the United States, are often seen as milestones for the industry, signaling increasing mainstream acceptance and institutional participation. The Path to a ProShares XRP ETF: More Complex Than Others? While the US has seen the launch of Bitcoin Futures ETFs (including one from ProShares) and, more recently, spot Bitcoin ETFs, the path for an XRP ETF is notably more complex. The primary hurdle is the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs, the company associated with XRP. The SEC alleges that XRP is an unregistered security, a classification that Ripple disputes. This legal uncertainty creates significant regulatory ambiguity around XRP. The SEC has been hesitant to approve investment products, like ETFs, for assets whose regulatory status is unclear or contested. Until there is definitive regulatory clarity on whether XRP is considered a security or a commodity (like Bitcoin and Ethereum), the prospect of a spot XRP ETF gaining SEC approval remains challenging. Compare this to Bitcoin and Ethereum: Cryptocurrency Regulatory Status (US Context) ETF Status (US) Bitcoin (BTC) Generally considered a commodity by the SEC. Spot and Futures ETFs approved and trading. Ethereum (ETH) SEC stance has evolved, leaning towards commodity, but not fully settled for spot ETFs yet. Futures ETFs approved and trading. Spot ETF applications pending, decision anticipated. XRP Regulatory status highly contested; SEC alleges it’s a security, Ripple disputes. No spot or futures ETFs approved or trading. Regulatory clarity is the major barrier. This table highlights why the regulatory environment is the critical factor influencing the timeline for a ProShares XRP ETF or any other XRP ETF. When Could We See an XRP ETF Launch? Despite the debunked April 30th rumor, the question remains: when could an XRP ETF launch potentially happen? James Seyffart’s clarification, while dismissing the specific date, did offer a general timeframe expectation: likely in the short to medium term. However, this timing is heavily contingent on external factors, primarily regulatory developments. Key factors influencing the timeline include: Resolution of the SEC vs. Ripple Case: A definitive ruling or settlement that clarifies XRP’s legal status in the U.S. is arguably the most significant catalyst needed for ETF approval. SEC Guidance: Even without a full case resolution, clearer guidance from the SEC regarding how it views and intends to regulate cryptocurrencies like XRP could pave the way. Market Demand and Issuer Interest: Strong market demand and continued interest from major issuers like ProShares are necessary drivers for filing and pursuing ETF applications. Political and Legislative Landscape: Potential legislation addressing crypto regulation could also impact the process. The “short to medium term” suggests that if regulatory clarity emerges relatively soon, the standard SEC review process for an ETF application could then begin. This process itself can take several months. Implications for XRP Investment The potential approval and launch of an XRP ETF launch is widely seen as a positive development for XRP investment. Such a product could: Increase Institutional Adoption: ETFs make it easier for large institutions (pension funds, asset managers) to gain exposure to XRP, potentially bringing significant capital into the market. Enhance Liquidity: Increased trading activity via an ETF could improve XRP’s market liquidity. Boost Mainstream Accessibility: Retail investors who are hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges might be more comfortable buying an ETF through their traditional brokerage. Improve Price Discovery: A regulated ETF could contribute to more efficient price discovery for XRP. However, it’s crucial for investors interested in XRP investment to remember that an ETF’s price would track XRP’s market price, meaning it would still be subject to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, ETF approval is not guaranteed, and the timeline remains uncertain. The Broader ETF Market Context The interest in an ProShares XRP ETF and other crypto-specific ETFs reflects the growing maturity and acceptance of the overall ETF market. ETFs have become incredibly popular investment vehicles due to their low costs, transparency, and ease of trading. The success of Bitcoin spot ETFs in attracting billions in assets under management since their launch in January 2024 has only amplified the anticipation for similar products tracking other major cryptocurrencies. The ETF market is constantly innovating, with issuers exploring various asset classes and strategies. While regulatory hurdles remain for many crypto assets, the trend towards offering regulated investment products for digital assets appears to be a long-term one. ProShares, being a significant player, is naturally expected to explore opportunities across different cryptocurrencies as the regulatory landscape evolves. Actionable Insights for Aspiring XRP ETF Investors Given the current situation – debunked rumors and uncertain timelines – what should investors interested in an XRP ETF do? Stay Informed, but Skeptical: Follow reputable news sources and analysts like James Seyffart. Be highly skeptical of specific launch dates announced via unofficial channels. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Pay close attention to news regarding the SEC vs. Ripple case and any broader statements or guidance from the SEC concerning crypto regulation. Regulatory clarity is the key. Understand XRP Itself: While an ETF offers indirect exposure, understand the underlying asset, its use cases, and the factors influencing its price. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. An ETF doesn’t eliminate this risk, though it may offer regulatory benefits. Ensure any investment aligns with your risk profile. Consider Alternatives (with Caution): If you seek XRP exposure now, research reputable cryptocurrency exchanges. Be aware of the differences in risk and custody compared to an ETF. Patience and due diligence are crucial in this evolving market. Conclusion: Anticipation Remains Despite Debunked Rumors In summary, the recent rumor about a ProShares XRP ETF launching on April 30th has been definitively debunked by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. While ProShares and other issuers are likely interested in launching an XRP ETF, and the market anticipates one in the short to medium term, the critical factor remains regulatory clarity surrounding XRP, primarily tied to the outcome of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit. Investors should rely on official announcements and regulatory progress rather than unconfirmed dates. The potential launch of an XRP ETF is a significant event to watch for, promising increased accessibility and potential institutional flow into XRP investment, but its timing is not yet set in stone.

MetaMask, one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallet service providers globally, is set to launch a groundbreaking MetaMask payment card . This isn’t just another crypto card; it promises real-time crypto payments directly from your wallet, bypassing traditional conversion hurdles. Slated for a Q2 release, this development could significantly bridge the gap between the crypto world and everyday transactions. What is the MetaMask Payment Card and Why Does it Matter? The upcoming MetaMask payment card is the result of a strategic collaboration between MetaMask, secure payment card technology provider CompoSecure, and leading Web3 financial services company Baanx. The core innovation here is its ability to facilitate transactions using the cryptocurrencies held within your MetaMask wallet in near real-time – specifically, within five seconds. Traditionally, spending crypto requires a multi-step process: selling your crypto on an exchange, withdrawing fiat currency, and then using that fiat. Even existing crypto cards often involve a pre-conversion step or a slight delay. The promise of the MetaMask card is to make this process seamless and instantaneous at the point of sale, whether online or in a physical store that accepts card payments. This capability is crucial because it removes friction. Imagine using your crypto to buy groceries, pay for coffee, or book a flight without waiting for conversions or worrying about fluctuating exchange rates during the transaction window. This move positions MetaMask to become a more central tool for users not just holding assets, but actively using them in the real world. How Will Real-Time Crypto Payments Work? The magic of real-time crypto payments lies in the technology integration between MetaMask’s wallet infrastructure and the payment network rails provided by CompoSecure and Baanx. While the exact technical details at the moment of transaction are complex, the user experience is designed to be simple: Initiate a payment with your MetaMask card at a merchant terminal or online checkout. The system quickly checks your MetaMask wallet balance. A near-instantaneous conversion of the required crypto amount to the local fiat currency occurs behind the scenes. The transaction is authorized and completed within approximately five seconds. This process eliminates the need for users to manually manage conversions beforehand, simplifying spending and making crypto feel more like traditional money for everyday purchases. It’s a significant step towards mainstream adoption and usability for digital currencies. The Power Behind the Card: CompoSecure and Baanx The partnership with CompoSecure and Baanx is key to enabling these real-time crypto payments . CompoSecure is known for its high-security, premium payment cards, often featuring metal construction and advanced technology. Their expertise in card manufacturing and security infrastructure provides the physical and digital backbone for the MetaMask card. Baanx specializes in providing crypto-friendly financial services, including card programs and payment solutions that bridge digital assets with traditional banking systems. Their technology likely facilitates the rapid conversion and settlement processes required for near-instantaneous crypto spending. This collaboration brings together the strengths of a leading crypto wallet, secure hardware, and sophisticated financial technology. Expanding Horizons: Bitcoin Solana Support and Wallet Evolution Beyond the immediate launch of the MetaMask payment card , MetaMask has signaled broader ambitions for 2024. A major announcement includes plans to support Bitcoin Solana support later this year. This is a significant move as MetaMask has historically been focused primarily on Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks. Adding native support for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and Solana, a high-throughput blockchain, will dramatically expand the range of assets users can hold and potentially spend directly from their MetaMask wallet using the new card. This diversification makes the wallet, and consequently the card, much more versatile and appealing to a wider audience of crypto holders. Furthermore, MetaMask plans a significant revamp of the wallet’s user interface (UI). While details are scarce, a UI refresh often aims to improve usability, streamline navigation, and potentially integrate new features like the payment card more seamlessly. A more intuitive interface can lower the barrier to entry for new users and enhance the experience for existing ones. What Does This Mean for Your MetaMask Wallet Experience? The introduction of the MetaMask payment card , coupled with planned Bitcoin Solana support and a UI revamp, points towards MetaMask evolving into a more comprehensive financial tool. For current users, this means: Increased Utility: Your crypto holdings become instantly spendable at millions of locations worldwide. Simplified Spending: No more complex manual conversions before making a purchase. Expanded Asset Support: Potentially spend not just ETH and ERC-20 tokens, but also BTC and SOL directly from the wallet. Improved User Experience: The planned UI revamp could make managing assets and using new features easier. This makes the MetaMask wallet less of just a place to store digital assets and more of an active account for managing and using your crypto in daily life. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of real-time crypto payments is exciting, it’s important to consider potential challenges: Fees: There will likely be fees associated with using the card, including conversion fees, transaction fees, or annual fees. The fee structure will be crucial for user adoption. Volatility: The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate significantly. While the real-time conversion minimizes risk during the transaction itself, the value of your holdings can change rapidly before you spend them. Regulation: The regulatory landscape for crypto and crypto-linked financial products is constantly evolving. Future regulations could impact the card’s availability or functionality in certain regions. Merchant Acceptance: While the card will likely operate on major payment networks, ensuring seamless acceptance at all merchant types will be key. Adoption Rate: The success of the card will depend on how quickly users adopt it and integrate it into their spending habits. Users should carefully review the terms and conditions, fee structure, and any regional restrictions once the card launches. Comparing the MetaMask Card to the Competition The crypto card market is becoming increasingly crowded. How does the proposed MetaMask payment card stack up? Its primary differentiator appears to be the focus on truly real-time crypto payments within the familiar MetaMask ecosystem. Many existing cards: Require users to pre-load fiat or stablecoins onto the card. Involve a conversion step that might not be truly instantaneous. Are tied to specific exchange platforms rather than a non-custodial wallet like MetaMask. By enabling spending directly from a non-custodial wallet with near-instant conversion, MetaMask is aiming for a higher level of convenience and control for the user compared to custodial card solutions. Actionable Insights: Getting Ready for Q2 If you’re a MetaMask user or interested in easier crypto spending, here’s what you can do: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from MetaMask regarding the Q2 launch date and application process for the MetaMask payment card . Understand the Details: Once launched, carefully read the terms, conditions, fee structure, and supported regions before applying or using the card. Prepare Your Wallet: Ensure your MetaMask wallet is updated and you understand how to manage your assets within it. Look for Bitcoin Solana Support: If you hold BTC or SOL, monitor for updates on when native support will be integrated into the wallet, potentially enabling spending of these assets via the card later. Conclusion: A Leap Forward for Crypto Utility The upcoming launch of the MetaMask payment card represents a significant leap forward in making cryptocurrencies more usable for everyday transactions. By enabling real-time crypto payments directly from the user’s MetaMask wallet , bypassing manual conversions, and planning to add crucial support like Bitcoin Solana support , MetaMask is positioning itself at the forefront of crypto-fiat integration. While challenges remain, the potential for increased adoption and utility is immense. Q2 is shaping up to be an exciting time for MetaMask users and the broader crypto ecosystem.

The use of crypto mixers by bad actors remains an existential threat to the wider crypto market. United States District Judge for the Western District of Texas, Robert Pitman, ruled in favor of Tornado Cash, a popular crypto mixer, against the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). According to court documents dated April 28, the OFAC is now legally prohibited from reinstating the original sanctions. In August 2022, OFAC added Tornado Cash to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list. According to OFAC, Tornado Cash enabled bad actors, led by North Korea-backed Lazarus, to launder more the. $7 billion in crypto assets. However, some Tornado Cash users, led by Joseph Van Loon, presented strong arguments that the Department of Treasury had overstepped its authority. On the top list, the Plaintiffs argued that Tornado Cash is not a person and immutable smart contracts are not property. In addition to citing constitutional violations of free speech and financial privacy, Tornado Cash can seamlessly exist in the United States. Bigger Picture of Tornado Cash Final Ruling The final blow to the Department of Treasury by the Tornado Cash is a huge victory for the web3 developers in the United States and globally. The ruling was hailed by web3 leaders led by Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, among others. Moreover, open source development of web3 protocols will take shape under the Donald Trump administration, especially amid the anticipated crypto legal clarity. Meanwhile, TORN price gained around 1 percent following the announcement to trade about $7.38 at the time of this writing.

Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy This Month Before History Repeats,https://timestabloid.com/back-when-monero-was-pennies-qubetics-is-the-best-crypto/,"Have you ever kicked yourself for not scooping up Monero when it was just pennies? Or for doubting it before it became one of the most trusted privacy coins out there? Yeah, most of us have that same regret stamped somewhere in our crypto journey. The worst part? It wasn’t about missing any project — it was about missing the right one at the right time. If you’ve ever felt that sting, this could be your clean break. There’s a fresh shot brewing, and it’s still under the radar for now. Enter Qubetics . This project isn’t about chasing hype — it’s about grabbing value before it explodes. Built with real-world utility at its core and backed by a game-changing product suite, Qubetics is shaping up as one of the best cryptos to buy this month. With the Qubetics presale heating up, community members still have a real window to tap into this opportunity before the mainnet officially launches in Q2 2025. Miss Monero? Fine. But missing Qubetics now, while it’s still wide open, would hurt even worse. Still Regretting Missing Early Qubetics? It’s Hands Down the Best Cryptos to Buy This Month If you’re still haunted by not locking in early-stage gems, you should know: Qubetics already had its “whitelist moment.” Early participants snagged $TICS at just $0.01 — and without even paying upfront. That was September 29, 2024. Since then, this best crypto presale has marched through multiple stages, raising the price at every checkpoint. And now? You’re standing right at Stage 32, where $TICS is priced at $0.2093. Over 510 million tokens are already gone, more than $16.5 million has been raised, and the Qubetics presale already boasts a loyal community of over 25,400 holders. With Qubetics quickly climbing the list of the best cryptos to buy this month, this isn’t the time to hesitate — it’s the time to lock your position before history repeats itself. Here’s the crazy part: even at this point, the numbers are still mind-bending. A $100 investment at today’s presale price could set you up for $7167 if $TICS hits $15 after launch. That’s a ridiculous 7,066.39% ROI potential. Even if $TICS just climbs to $5 post-launch, you’re looking at a 2,288.80% ROI. Not many projects offer a shot like this while still staying under everyone’s radar. And by the way — each presale stage only lasts 7 days with a 10% price hike, so time is seriously not your friend here. Now, let’s talk about what’s making Qubetics a standout among the best cryptos to buy this month . Its core product, QubeQode IDE, is a total game-changer for blockchain development. It hands real businesses — like freelance agencies needing tokenized payments or online retailers wanting blockchain-secured loyalty programs — the tools to build without writing heavy code. With drag-and-drop blockchain components, form-based configurations, and a massive library of pre-written code snippets, even non-tech founders can launch secure apps without paying five-figure dev costs. Qubetics isn’t just adding another buzzword to crypto — it’s actually solving real business needs in a way that’s fast, simple, and built for mass adoption. Monero’s Rise from the Shadows: A Lesson for Today’s Best Cryptos to Buy This Month Monero’s journey is a masterclass in missed opportunities. When it launched back in 2014, it was practically an unknown privacy token priced so low it barely showed up on charts. But early community members who believed in private, secure transactions knew they were onto something. Over the years, Monero went from dirt cheap to clocking jaw-dropping all-time highs, solidifying its name among serious crypto circles. Its growth wasn’t overnight — it was a steady climb fueled by real need, trust, and community dedication. Today, Monero holds a respected position in the digital asset space, having built its reputation without flashy gimmicks or viral hype. It quietly dominated as governments, institutions, and users alike sought stronger privacy protections. Missing its early ICO stages meant missing one of the purest use-case-driven success stories in crypto history. The lesson here? Sometimes the coins that don’t scream the loudest — but solve real problems — are the ones that define financial freedom for their early community members. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out Again on the Best Cryptos to Buy This Month If history taught anything with Monero, it’s this: value-driven projects don’t stay hidden forever. Right now, Qubetics is offering that same once-in-a-cycle entry point — through its current presale phase. Backed by real utility through QubeQode IDE and a fair launch model that benefits its early community members, Qubetics looks primed for a breakout once the mainnet hits later this year. For those who missed Monero or sat sidelines watching Solana, Avalanche, or Filecoin grow, there’s no excuse to sleep through this one. If you’re serious about finding the best cryptos to buy this month, don’t just watch from the sidelines — join this best crypto presale before Qubetics slips out of reach. History doesn’t just repeat itself; it rewards those who listen the second time around.

43921296,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153454,1745882422,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tether Gold: Verified 7.7 Tons of Gold Backing XAU₮ Confirmed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-gold-verified-reserve/,"Big news in the world of digital assets backed by real-world value! Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin by market cap, has just dropped a significant update regarding its Tether Gold (XAUτ) token. This isn’t just any update; it’s a formal attestation confirming the physical gold reserves that underpin the value of XAUτ. For anyone interested in the intersection of traditional finance and cryptocurrency, or simply looking for ways to diversify with digital gold , this is a key development. What Exactly Did the Tether Gold Attestation Confirm? Tether has officially released its first attestation specifically for Tether Gold (XAUτ). An attestation in this context is like an audit, but instead of a full financial statement, it verifies a specific claim – in this case, the physical gold reserves. The report confirms that 7.7 tons of physical gold are held in secure vaults located in Switzerland. This substantial amount of gold directly backs the current supply of the XAUτ token, which is valued at approximately $770 million. This verification is crucial because it provides transparency and trust regarding the backing of the token. Unlike simply claiming reserves, an attestation, particularly one conducted under a specific regulatory framework like El Salvador’s, adds a layer of formal validation to Tether’s assertions about XAUτ’s reserves. The news was initially reported by The Crypto Basic, highlighting its importance in the crypto space. Why is This Attestation Significant for XAUτ? The confirmation of 7.7 tons of gold reserves through this attestation significantly strengthens XAUτ’s position in the market. Here’s why it matters: Enhanced Trust and Transparency: For investors and users, knowing that the token is backed by a verified amount of physical gold held in reputable Swiss vaults provides a higher degree of confidence in the token’s stability and value. Regulatory Acknowledgment: The attestation being performed under El Salvador’s regulatory framework is notable. While the details of the framework’s specific requirements for this attestation are key, its involvement suggests a move towards greater formal recognition and oversight for tokenized assets. Solidifying Market Leadership: As the largest tokenized gold asset by market capitalization, XAUτ already holds a prominent position. This verified backing reinforces its status and differentiates it from potentially less transparent alternatives. Proof of Reserve: In the crypto world, proof of reserves is paramount, especially for assets claiming to be backed by real-world commodities. This attestation serves as a concrete proof point for the physical gold backing. Understanding Tokenized Gold: More Than Just Digital Pixels? So, what exactly is tokenized gold ? It’s a type of cryptocurrency or digital token where each token represents a specific amount of physical gold. In the case of XAUτ, one token represents one troy ounce of fine gold. The physical gold is held in secure vaults, and ownership of the token on the blockchain corresponds to ownership of that underlying physical asset. Think of it as having a digital certificate of ownership for a specific, allocated amount of gold, stored safely away. This differs from gold ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), where you own shares in a fund that owns gold, or owning physical gold yourself, which comes with storage and security challenges. What Are the Benefits of Holding Digital Gold Like XAUτ? Holding digital gold via a token like XAUτ offers several potential advantages compared to traditional methods of owning gold: Accessibility and Divisibility: You can buy and sell fractions of a troy ounce of gold, making it more accessible for smaller investors. Transactions can occur 24/7 on crypto exchanges, unlike traditional markets. Ease of Transfer: Sending XAUτ across the globe is as simple as sending a cryptocurrency transaction, bypassing the logistics and security risks of moving physical gold. Lower Costs: While fees exist, tokenized gold can potentially have lower storage, insurance, and transaction costs compared to buying, storing, and selling physical gold. Liquidity: Trading on cryptocurrency exchanges can offer higher liquidity than finding a buyer for physical gold bars or coins. Transparency: The token’s existence and transaction history are on the blockchain, offering a level of transparency regarding its movement. The attestation adds transparency regarding the backing reserves. How Does the XAUτ Gold Token Work? The mechanics behind the XAUτ gold token are designed to link the digital asset to its physical counterpart: Issuance: Tether issues XAUτ tokens on blockchain networks (currently Ethereum and TRON). Backing: For every XAUτ token issued, Tether acquires and stores one troy ounce of physical gold. Custody: The physical gold is held in secure, audited vaults, specifically in Switzerland, known for its robust financial infrastructure and storage facilities. Ownership: Holding the XAUτ token on the blockchain signifies beneficial ownership of the underlying gold. Redemption: Holders of XAUτ can, under specific conditions and potentially minimum thresholds, request redemption for the physical gold or the equivalent cash value. The recent attestation confirms that step 2 and 3 are being followed for the current supply, verifying the link between the digital token and the physical asset. Are There Challenges or Risks with Tokenized Gold? While tokenized gold offers benefits, it’s important to be aware of the potential challenges and risks: Custody Risk of Physical Gold: Although stored in secure vaults, there is always an inherent risk associated with the custodian (Tether and its partners) holding the physical asset. The attestation helps mitigate this by verifying existence, but it doesn’t eliminate counterparty risk entirely. Smart Contract Risk: The XAUτ token operates on blockchain smart contracts. While generally secure, any vulnerability in the contract code could pose a risk. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets is still evolving globally. While the El Salvador framework is a step, changes in regulations could impact the operation or accessibility of XAUτ. Tether Risk: XAUτ is issued by Tether. Risks associated with the parent company, whether operational, legal, or reputational, could potentially affect the token. Liquidity Risk: While potentially more liquid than physical gold, liquidity on exchanges can vary, especially during times of market stress. Understanding these risks is crucial before investing in any digital gold asset. What Does This Mean for the Future of Tokenized Assets? The successful attestation of Tether Gold ‘s reserves is a positive signal for the broader market of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). It demonstrates that it is possible to link physical commodities to digital tokens in a verifiable way. As the technology and regulatory clarity improve, we may see more assets, from real estate to art to commodities, being represented on the blockchain, potentially unlocking new levels of liquidity and accessibility. In Conclusion: A Golden Step Forward for XAUτ Tether’s first attestation for XAUτ, verifying 7.7 tons of physical gold in Swiss vaults backing its $770 million supply, is a significant milestone. It provides crucial transparency and reinforces XAUτ’s position as the leading tokenized gold asset. While challenges and risks inherent in any digital asset remain, this move towards verifiable reserves is a positive step for building trust in the growing market for digital gold and other tokenized real-world assets. It offers investors a potentially more accessible and liquid way to gain exposure to gold, backed by tangible reserves.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) displayed strength as the week opened on April 28, up 10% over the last seven days to trade at $95,500. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC price has been suppressed under $100,000 since early February, as shown in the chart below. BTC/USD weekly chart. Cointelegraph/ TradingView Bitcoin lacks a $100K catalyst The BTC/USD pair rallied 30% from its $74,400 low reached on April 7 to trade above $95,000, a recovery fueled largely by easing US-China tariff tensions. Although the rally has been accompanied by $3.06 billion in spot ETF inflows , there are doubts whether that is enough to break Bitcoin out of consolidation. In its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers, trading firm QCP Capital argued that Bitcoin’s decoupling from equities last week strengthened its narrative as a “hedge against political instability and uncertain monetary policy.” This helped BTC to comfortably breach the $90,000, QCP Capital explained, adding that it would have also helped propel it higher. However, BTC pivoted midweek, decoupling from gold and rallying alongside US equities , mainly responding to macroeconomic factors. “This flip-flopping between safe-haven and risk-asset behaviour suggests that traditional correlation frameworks are becoming less instructive. Instead, market participants are now focused on the durability of BTC’s “up only” trend.” On April 25, the trading firm said that BTC price could continue its choppy price for a few more days, arguing that it lacked a “catalyst” to propel it toward $100,000. The investment firm said: “With macro risks temporarily subdued and trade tensions cooling, BTC is likely to consolidate in a narrow $90K–$94.5K range while awaiting a catalyst for a decisive push toward the elusive $100K mark.” Meanwhile, crypto analyst Tazman noted that a lack of “sustained demand and fresh capital” stands in the way of Bitcoin’s path to $100,000.

The South Korean media outlet EDaily reported that the party has promised to do away with a law that requires domestic banks to form exclusive partnership deals with domestic exchanges, with the former absorbing the lion’s share of risk liability. Crypto Exchange Banking Rules: On the Way Out? Without such a partnership, exchanges cannot offer their clients crypto-fiat pairings. At present, only five domestic exchanges have managed to convince banks to enter such partnerships. The People Power Party Emergency Response Committee meeting at the National Assembly in Yeouido, Seoul, on April 28. (Source: JTBC/Screenshot) Shortly after the law was rolled out, scores of smaller exchanges were forced to close. Others have tried to get by, offering their clients crypto-to-crypto only trading. The PPP said the rule change would be one of seven “major tasks” that would help it “foster the cryptoasset ecosystem.” Speaking at a summit held at the National Assembly on April 28, PP lawmaker Park Soo-min said: “It is very restrictive for citizens if they cannot trade cryptossets through the bank of their choice. [The current rules] have solidified monopolies on the market. [Our approach] will also open the door to competition between exchanges.” The PPP also unveiled six other crypto-related policy manifesto pledges, namely: The launch of corporate crypto trading before the end of 2025 The creation of a Virtual Asset Special Committee that will report to the South Korean President Green-lighting the launch of crypto spot ETF trading “within 2025” Security token offering (STO) legislation “Global-standard” stablecoin regulation Crypto tax clarity The PPP said that its policies would help foster innovation in the industry and restore investors’ trust.

43921632,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153455,1745883018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BlackRock IBIT Defies Market Turmoil with Strong Inflows,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/blackrock-ibit-positive-flows/,"In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, investors are constantly seeking signs of stability and growth, especially within the realm of Crypto Investment . Amidst a turbulent global economic landscape, a significant update comes from one of the world’s largest asset managers. Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of ETF and index investments at BlackRock, recently shared insights on the performance of their spot Bitcoin ETF , known as IBIT. Her comments offer a compelling perspective on investor sentiment towards digital assets. Understanding the Resilience of BlackRock IBIT BlackRock’s entry into the spot Bitcoin ETF market was a landmark event, bringing a familiar investment vehicle to digital assets. The performance of IBIT has been closely watched by market participants, seen by many as a barometer for institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin. Samara Cohen’s recent statements provide a clear signal: despite prevailing macroeconomic headwinds, BlackRock IBIT has demonstrated remarkable resilience. Cohen highlighted that even with the current global environment marked by supply chain instability and international trade tensions – factors that typically induce caution in financial markets – IBIT has managed to maintain largely positive flows. This suggests a sustained demand for direct exposure to Bitcoin through this regulated product. What makes these positive IBIT flows particularly noteworthy? Consider the context: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Geopolitical events and economic shifts often lead investors to pull back from riskier assets. Market Volatility: The crypto market itself is known for its price swings, which can deter conservative investors. Competition: IBIT is one of several spot Bitcoin ETFs launched around the same time, competing for investor capital. Yet, Cohen asserts that IBIT has experienced fewer outflows than might have been anticipated under these conditions. This points to a strong underlying conviction among its holders. Who is Driving These Positive IBIT Flows? A key takeaway from Cohen’s discussion is the nature of the investors contributing to IBIT’s positive momentum. She specifically mentioned that both individual and institutional investors have continued to buy shares of the ETF. This is crucial for the long-term health and maturation of the Crypto Investment space. The participation of institutional players is often seen as a stamp of approval for an asset class. Large firms, endowments, and wealth managers conducting due diligence and allocating capital to a Bitcoin ETF like IBIT signifies growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional portfolios. Simultaneously, continued buying from individual investors indicates sustained retail interest and belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. This blend of investor types contributing to the positive IBIT flows paints a picture of broad-based adoption, moving beyond early crypto enthusiasts to include a wider spectrum of the investment community. Looking Ahead: BlackRock’s Bullish Stance on Tokenization Beyond the success of their Bitcoin ETF , Samara Cohen also touched upon BlackRock’s broader view on the future of digital assets, expressing a bullish outlook on Tokenization . Tokenization involves representing real-world assets, such as real estate, art, or even funds, as digital tokens on a blockchain. BlackRock’s interest in Tokenization is not new, but Cohen’s reaffirmation underscores its strategic importance for the firm. This technology has the potential to: Improve liquidity for illiquid assets. Increase transparency and efficiency in transactions. Enable fractional ownership of high-value assets. Potentially create new investment opportunities and markets. While IBIT focuses on providing exposure to Bitcoin, BlackRock’s exploration and positive view on Tokenization signal a deeper commitment to leveraging blockchain technology for various asset classes. This suggests that their engagement with the digital asset ecosystem extends far beyond just cryptocurrencies. Why Do IBIT Flows Matter for Crypto Investment? The sustained positive IBIT flows are more than just a statistic for one fund; they serve as an important indicator for the broader Crypto Investment landscape. They demonstrate that despite external pressures and market noise, a significant segment of investors remains committed to gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated channels. For those considering a Crypto Investment , the performance of major, institutionally-backed products like BlackRock IBIT provides valuable data points.

43921927,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153456,1745883616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Marinade Native Staking Gets Secure Boost with BitGo as First US Qualified Custodian,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/marinade-native-staking-bitgo/,"In a significant move for the institutional adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology, Marinade, a leading liquidity staking protocol on the Solana network, has announced a groundbreaking integration. According to a recent update shared on their official channels, BitGo, a prominent digital asset trust and security company, has become the first U.S.-qualified custodian to offer support for Marinade Native Staking . This development is poised to unlock new avenues for institutions looking to participate in the Solana ecosystem while adhering to stringent compliance and security requirements. For a long time, institutional investors have faced hurdles when seeking to engage directly with blockchain protocols, particularly in areas like staking. Concerns around custody, regulatory clarity, and operational security have often been significant barriers. The integration between Marinade and BitGo directly addresses these challenges, providing a compliant and secure pathway for institutions to earn Solana Staking Rewards . Understanding Marinade Native Staking Before diving into the implications of the BitGo integration, let’s clarify what Marinade Native Staking entails. Marinade offers two primary staking products for Solana (SOL): Liquid Staking (mSOL): Users stake SOL and receive mSOL, a liquid token representing their staked SOL plus accumulated rewards. mSOL can be used in various DeFi protocols, offering flexibility. Native Staking: This method allows users to stake their SOL directly with validators through Marinade’s automated strategy, but without receiving a liquid token like mSOL. The SOL remains in the user’s wallet (or, in this case, the custodian’s wallet), delegated to a set of validators chosen by Marinade’s algorithm to optimize for performance and decentralization. Rewards accrue directly to the staked SOL balance. The key advantage of Marinade Native Staking is its similarity to traditional native staking directly on the Solana network, but with the benefit of Marinade’s automated delegation strategy. This strategy diversifies staking across many validators, mitigating risk and aiming for optimal returns without requiring the user to manage individual validator choices. For institutions, the fact that the underlying SOL isn’t locked within the Marinade protocol itself (as it is with mSOL, which represents a claim on staked SOL) but rather delegated from a controlled address, aligns better with certain custodial and operational models. Why BitGo Crypto Custody is a Game Changer for Institutions BitGo’s role as a US Qualified Custodian is central to the significance of this announcement. But what exactly does being a ‘qualified custodian’ mean in the U.S. context, and why is it important for digital assets? A qualified custodian is typically a bank, a registered broker-dealer, or a trust company regulated by entities like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or state banking authorities. These institutions are subject to strict regulations regarding the safeguarding of client assets. For traditional finance, using a qualified custodian is standard practice and often a regulatory requirement for managing client funds, especially for registered investment advisors (RIAs). Extending this framework to digital assets like cryptocurrencies is crucial for attracting institutional capital. BitGo, through its regulated entities, provides the necessary infrastructure for institutions to hold digital assets securely and compliantly. Their services typically include: High-Level Security: Utilizing advanced multi-signature security protocols and cold storage solutions to protect assets from theft and loss. Regulatory Compliance: Operating under licenses and regulations that meet stringent governmental standards. Insurance: Often providing insurance coverage for digital assets held in custody. Operational Controls: Implementing robust internal controls, audit trails, and access policies. By integrating with Marinade Native Staking, BitGo now allows its institutional clients to move beyond simply holding SOL. They can now actively participate in securing the Solana network and earning rewards through staking, all within the familiar and regulated environment of their BitGo custody account. This eliminates the need for institutions to manage private keys themselves or interact directly with staking protocols in a non-custodial manner, which can be a compliance and security headache. The Impact: Unlocking Institutional Solana Staking This partnership marks a pivotal moment for Institutional Solana Staking . Here’s a breakdown of the key benefits and implications: Benefits for Institutions: Compliance: Stake SOL while meeting regulatory requirements for asset custody. Security: Leverage BitGo’s institutional-grade security infrastructure, reducing the risk of loss due to hacks or operational errors. Yield Generation: Access passive income opportunities through staking rewards on their SOL holdings. Simplicity: Integrate staking into existing custodial workflows, simplifying operations. Diversification: Add staked SOL to their portfolio within a regulated framework. Benefits for Marinade and Solana: Increased TVL: Attract significant institutional capital into Marinade’s Native Staking product. Enhanced Network Security: More staked SOL contributes to the security and decentralization of the Solana network. Validation: The integration with a major US Qualified Custodian like BitGo validates Marinade’s protocol and the robustness of Solana’s staking mechanism. Broader Adoption: Opens the door for a new class of investors to engage with the Solana ecosystem. Earning Solana Staking Rewards Through a Custodian: How Does it Work? For an institution using BitGo’s services, the process for engaging with Marinade Native Staking would typically involve: Depositing SOL into their BitGo custody account. Instructing BitGo (through their platform or account managers) to initiate Native Staking for a specified amount of SOL via the Marinade integration. BitGo, on behalf of the institution, delegates the specified SOL amount to validators selected by Marinade’s automated strategy. Solana Staking Rewards accrue directly to the staked balance within the BitGo custody account. The institution can view their staked balance and rewards through their BitGo interface. When the institution wishes to unstake, they would instruct BitGo, which would then manage the unstaking process according to Solana’s network rules (which involves a cooldown period). This abstracted process means institutions don’t need deep technical knowledge of Solana staking or direct interaction with blockchain wallets and protocols. BitGo handles the complexity, providing a familiar, enterprise-grade experience. Challenges and Considerations While this integration is overwhelmingly positive, institutions should still consider potential challenges: Slashing Risk: Although Marinade’s Native Staking strategy diversifies across many validators to minimize this, the risk of validators being slashed (penalized for misbehavior) and a small portion of staked SOL being lost still exists on the protocol level. Unstaking Period: Solana’s network requires an unstaking cooldown period (typically 2-3 days) before staked SOL becomes liquid again. Institutions need to factor this liquidity constraint into their strategies. Custodial Fees: Using a qualified custodian like BitGo involves fees for custody and potentially for staking services. These costs must be weighed against the staking rewards. Regulatory Evolution: While using a qualified custodian addresses current needs, the regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving, which could impact future operations. The Growing Trend of Institutional DeFi Access The BitGo and Marinade partnership is part of a larger trend: the increasing demand from institutions for compliant access to DeFi yield opportunities. As the digital asset space matures, traditional finance players are looking for ways to participate beyond simple spot trading. Staking, lending, and other DeFi strategies offer attractive potential returns, but require robust, regulated infrastructure. The availability of Marinade Native Staking through a trusted US Qualified Custodian like BitGo sets a precedent and lowers the barrier to entry for many risk-averse institutions who were previously on the sidelines. It signals that the necessary bridges between traditional finance and decentralized protocols are being built, piece by piece. Actionable Insights for Institutions and the Solana Ecosystem For Institutions: Evaluate your SOL holdings and consider the potential yield generation opportunities through compliant staking via BitGo. Assess the balance between potential rewards, custodial costs, and liquidity needs. For Marinade: Continue building integrations with other institutional service providers and enhancing the Native Staking product based on institutional feedback. For Solana: The increased institutional participation driven by such integrations strengthens the network’s security and credibility, potentially attracting more development and investment. Conclusion: A Secure Pathway to Solana Staking Rewards The integration of BitGo as the first US Qualified Custodian to support Marinade Native Staking is a landmark achievement. It provides institutions with a secure, compliant, and operationally efficient way to participate in the Solana ecosystem and earn Solana Staking Rewards . By bridging the gap between traditional finance’s need for trusted custody and the opportunities within decentralized protocols, this partnership paves the way for significant institutional capital to flow into Solana staking. This not only benefits institutions seeking yield but also strengthens the Solana network as a whole. It’s a clear signal that institutional DeFi is not just a concept, but a rapidly developing reality.

In a recent blog post, the EF laid out its strategic roadmap for the coming 12 months, highlighting key areas of focus designed to propel the Ethereum ecosystem forward. This vision isn’t just about technical upgrades; it’s a holistic approach aimed at strengthening the network’s core values while pursuing ambitious strategic goals for long-term success. What Drives the Ethereum Foundation’s Strategy? The EF’s plan is anchored by two main pillars: upholding core values and achieving strategic goals. Core values emphasize the decentralized, open-source nature of Ethereum, ensuring it remains a public good accessible to all. Strategic goals, on the other hand, are the concrete targets set to improve the network’s performance, usability, and reach. The next year will see concentrated efforts in several critical areas: Expanding the Ethereum mainnet and data handling capabilities (specifically focusing on Blobs): This is crucial for scalability and reducing transaction costs. Improving user experience (UX) and strengthening Layer-2 interoperability and application layer development: Making Ethereum easier to use and ensuring seamless interaction between scaling solutions and decentralized applications. Improving the developer experience (DevEx) and strengthening exposure and support for applications and Layer-2 projects within the platform, including Devcon 7: Empowering builders and showcasing the innovation happening on Ethereum. Let’s dive deeper into what these focus areas mean for the future of the Ethereum ecosystem . Scaling the Ethereum Ecosystem: The Role of Blobs and Layer 2 One of the most anticipated developments mentioned is the focus on expanding mainnet data through ‘Blobs’. This refers to the implementation of EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding, which was a major part of the recent Dencun upgrade. Blobs provide a new, cheaper way for Layer 2 rollups to post data back to the Ethereum mainnet. Why is this a big deal? Scaling remains a primary challenge for Ethereum. While the mainnet processes transactions securely, high demand can lead to congestion and high gas fees. Layer 2 Ethereum solutions like optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups bundle transactions off-chain and then post compressed data back to the mainnet. Historically, this data was posted as call data, which is expensive. Blobs offer a dedicated, cheaper space for this rollup data. This directly translates to significantly lower transaction costs for users on Layer 2 networks. By prioritizing this expansion, the Ethereum Foundation is directly addressing one of the biggest barriers to mass adoption – affordability. This focus lays the groundwork for future scaling advancements like full Danksharding. Benefits of Focusing on Blobs & Layer 2: Lower transaction fees for end-users. Increased transaction throughput across the ecosystem. Enables new types of applications that were previously too expensive. Strengthens the symbiotic relationship between the mainnet and Layer 2 solutions. Enhancing User & Developer Experience for Broader Adoption For the Ethereum ecosystem to truly flourish, it needs to be easy and intuitive for both users and developers. The EF’s commitment to improving User Experience (UX) and Developer Experience (DevEx) is paramount. Improving UX involves making wallets simpler, understanding gas fees easier, and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) more seamless. A significant part of this is strengthening interoperability between different Layer 2 Ethereum networks and the mainnet. Users shouldn’t have to navigate complex bridges or face compatibility issues when moving assets or interacting with applications across different layers or rollups. The EF aims to support initiatives that make this interaction smooth and secure. On the DevEx side, the goal is to make building on Ethereum as straightforward and supported as possible. This includes providing better tools, documentation, and resources for developers. The foundation plans to increase exposure and support for innovative applications and Layer 2 projects building on the platform. This support often comes in the form of grants, educational programs, and providing platforms for connection. Devcon 7: A Key Platform for Ethereum Development A major highlight in the EF’s plan is the emphasis on Devcon 7 . Devcon is the flagship conference for Ethereum developers, researchers, and enthusiasts. It’s a vital event for: Sharing knowledge about the latest technical advancements. Fostering collaboration among core developers and ecosystem participants. Showcasing groundbreaking projects and applications. Cultivating the global Ethereum community. By focusing on Devcon 7 , the EF underscores the importance of community and knowledge sharing in driving Ethereum Development . It provides a critical touchpoint for builders worldwide to connect, learn, and push the boundaries of what’s possible on Ethereum. Accelerating Deployment and Cultivating the Next Generation Beyond the specific technical and experiential goals, the Ethereum Foundation is focused on accelerating the deployment and adoption of Ethereum technology by a wider audience, including developers, entrepreneurs, and institutions. This involves educational outreach, simplifying onboarding processes, and demonstrating the real-world utility of decentralized applications. Crucially, the EF also aims to attract and cultivate a new generation of builders. Leveraging its knowledge base and leadership position, the foundation seeks to inspire and equip individuals with the skills and resources needed to contribute to the Ethereum Ecosystem . This long-term investment in human capital is essential for the network’s continued innovation and resilience. What Does This Mean for You? Whether you’re a user, developer, investor, or simply interested in the space, the EF’s roadmap signals a period of focused improvement and growth. Expect to see: Lower fees and faster transactions on your favorite Layer 2 Ethereum applications. More user-friendly interfaces and smoother interactions with dApps. New and innovative applications launching as DevEx improves. Increased institutional interest as the network matures and scales. Opportunities to engage with the community, perhaps even at Devcon 7 . While challenges remain, such as ongoing security considerations and the complexity of coordinating a global decentralized ecosystem, the clear focus areas outlined by the Ethereum Foundation provide a strong sense of direction and purpose for the next year of Ethereum Development . Conclusion: Building a Stronger, More Accessible Ethereum The Ethereum Foundation’s vision for the next 12 months is a clear commitment to strengthening the network’s core infrastructure, enhancing the experience for everyone who interacts with it, and fostering the community of builders driving innovation. By prioritizing scaling through Blobs and Layer 2s, improving UX and DevEx, and supporting key community events like Devcon 7, the EF is setting the stage for significant advancements. This focused approach aims to make the Ethereum Ecosystem more scalable, affordable, user-friendly, and vibrant, ultimately accelerating its journey towards becoming a truly global, decentralized computing platform.

The one-day chart sets out a textbook inverse-head-and-shoulders (iHS) basing pattern that has been forming since early March and is now approaching the neckline around 0.00162 BTC. At the time of the screenshot, SOL was quoted at 0.001588 BTC. With bitcoin changing hands near $94,765, that places Solana at roughly $150 per coin. The anatomy of the pattern is hard to miss: a March 19 low at 0.00127 BTC ($120) forms the head, flanked by higher swing lows on March 11 left shoulder). The left shoulders is currently in the process of forming. The horizontal neckline aligns with the late-December floor that broke down in February, converting sturdy support into equally sturdy resistance. Measured from the head to the neckline, the amplitude is roughly 0.00033 BTC; a clean breakout would imply a technical objective near 0.00195 BTC—conveniently the lower boundary of the Kumo cloud’s far edge. Solana Bulls Have A Target The chart is overlaid with a long-look Ichimoku configuration (20/60/120/30). At the latest close the Tenkan-sen sat at 0.00150 BTC, the Kijun-sen exactly on the neckline at 0.00162 BTC, and Senkou Span A printed 0.001742 BTC while Span B held higher at 0.002159 BTC. The cloud itself remains bearish—thick, red and overhead—yet the span differential is beginning to compress, signalling waning downward momentum. A decisive push into the Kumo would trigger the classic Ichimoku edge-to-edge trade, targeting Span B at roughly 0.00216 BTC (about $205).

The bullish setup is occurring only two months after the market completed the mirror image of the same pattern. From mid-December to early-February, SOL/BTC carved out a prominent head-and-shoulders, lost the neckline in early February and cascaded directly to March’s iHs. That down-and-up symmetry gives extra weight to the current formation by demonstrating how faithfully the pair has respected classical geometry during the past half-year. “1D SOL/BTC – iHS + E2E at some point but not soon, probably late May,” Olszewicz wrote on X. The analyst’s caution reflects the fact that price is still beneath both the neckline and the Kijun-sen, and the Kumo does not thin materially until the final week of May. A premature break attempt risks rejection into a final right-shoulder retest near 0.00151 BTC ($143), which is also where the Tenkan-sen currently resides. Notably, the Chikou Span (lagging line) remains below price and cloud, emphasising that trend confirmation is pending; both Ichimoku purists and pattern traders could therefore agree that 0.00162 BTC is the line Solana bulls must flip decisively. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holding Strong Above $150 — Breakout Zone In Play If the edge-to-edge objective is achieved, SOL would add roughly 26 % against Bitcoin from present levels and reclaim ground last seen in early February. Should the neckline reject yet again, downside protection is thin until the twin shoulders at 0.00145–0.00148 BTC; a break of that shelf would invalidate the bullish thesis and reopen the March trough. For now, the market is content to coil beneath resistance while the clock ticks toward the cloud’s inflection. Whether Olszewicz’s late-May timetable proves prescient will depend on Bitcoin’s own trajectory and the broader risk environment, but the price structure on the Solana/Bitcoin chart is clear: after a bruising winter, the bulls finally have a pattern worth defending. At press time, SOL traded at $149.

BONK’s open interest surged 290% to $43.2 million. Bonk ( BONK ), the second-largest Solana-based memecoin by market capitalization, is on track to continue the recovery it began on April 22. BONK has climbed approximately 73% from its April 22 low of around $0.00001247, bringing its price up to an intraday high of $0.00002167 on April 28. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BONK trading at $0.00001923, up 3% over the 24 hours and 60% over the last seven days. BONK/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView BONK’s trading volume has jumped 98% over the last 24 hours to $478 million, and its market capitalization also jumped, briefly touching $1.7 billion on April 28, before retracing to the current level of $1.5 billion. Let’s examine the factors that have fueled BONK's price momentum over the last week. Memecoins recover across the board BONK’s rally over the last seven days mirrors the bullish price movements across the broader crypto market, including the memecoin sector. Most memecoins have posted double-digit gains over the last week. DOGE and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the leading memecoins , have jumped 3% and 5% over the last seven days. Official Trump (TRUMP), the memecoin associated with US President Donald Trump, has recorded 73% weekly gains, while Base’s Brett ( BRETT ) has rallied 83% over the same period.

Memecoin market cap and volume. Source: CoinMarketCap Over $7.96 billion in memecoin trading volume was recorded in the past seven days alone, representing an 85% weekly change. The resurgence is driven by investors once again embracing risk-on assets like memecoins. Increasing open interest backs BONK’s rally The surge in the price of Bonk over the last seven days comes after a significant jump in its open interest (OI). BONK’s total OI on all exchanges rose 290% from $11 million on April 22 to $43.2 million on April 26. Although this metric has since dropped to $28 million at the time of writing, it remains significantly higher than the OI seen since December 2024. Rising open interest reflects growing trader participation in BONK futures, indicating heightened speculative activity. BONK open interest across all exchanges.

BONK average perpetual contracts 8-hour funding rate. Source: CoinGlass Increasing funding rates usually suggest that futures traders are bullish, expecting future price increases, which may indicate a continuation of the uptrend. BONK's social dominance remains high, suggesting high social activity. Santiment data shows BONK’s social dominance spiking from 0.091% to 0.572% between April 20 and April 26, driven by BONK’s ecosystem buzz. BONK social dominance and volume. Source: Santiment This surge in chatter on social media platforms reflects rising retail and institutional interest, amplifying FOMO and driving demand. BONK breaks out of a multimonth downtrend On April 13, BONK price broke out of a descending parallel channel, igniting strength that saw it flip the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) to support. The bulls will likely continue the rebound toward the significant resistance level at $0.00002410 (200-day SMA) in the short term. A daily candlestick close above this level, accompanied by high volume, could see BONK rise toward the Jan. 19 range high near $0.000040. This would represent a 104% increase from the current price. BONK/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The sharp rise in the relative strength index and its position at 71 in the overbought region reinforces the buyers’ dominance in the market. However, the overbought conditions could facilitate profit-taking, occasioning a slight correction before BONK continues its uptrend. “$BONK’s descending trendline got cleared,” declared popular analyst World of Charts in an April 28 post on X, “expecting 2x in the coming days.” Meanwhile, Crypto Joe spotted BONK breaking out of a bullish pennant in the 30-minute timeframe targeting $0.00002690.

Bitcoin (BTC) reinforces its global dominance, Ethereum (ETH) scales its network upgrades, Ripple (XRP) advances its payment corridors, and Solana (SOL) continues to power blockchain speed innovation.Yet alongside these major players, a new opportunity is drawing increasing attention from serious investors— MAGACOINFINANCE . Those positioned early into expanding ecosystems often find themselves benefiting the most when broader adoption hits. MAGACOINFINANCE Continues Its Strategic Rise The early success of MAGACOINFINANCE has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike. MAGACOINFINANCE saw immediate demand after launch, positioning it as one of the fastest-growing altcoin entries of the year.Investor interest continues climbing as wallets expand and strategic positioning unfolds ahead of larger listings. To strengthen this momentum, MAGACOINFINANCE is still offering a 50% bonus using MAGA50X for early buyers—providing a rare advantage for those entering before full exposure drives valuations higher. Other Key Movers in the Market: LINK, DOT, MATIC, and ADA Chainlink (LINK) maintains leadership in decentralized oracle solutions. Polkadot (DOT) continues advancing blockchain interoperability with its innovative network. Polygon (MATIC) delivers critical scalability enhancements to Ethereum ecosystems. Cardano (ADA) builds on sustainability and peer-reviewed blockchain advancements. While these names remain critical infrastructure pieces, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the kind of early entry window that only comes around once in a cycle. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Standing Out From Other Tokens Investor behavior highlights that MAGACOINFINANCE is attracting a level of organic early-stage traction rarely seen today.Built on strong fundamentals, growing community activity, and analyst interest, MAGACOINFINANCE is earning strategic positioning long before broader market discovery. Early-stage momentum often sets the tone for outsized future returns—and MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining ground rapidly. Final Word While Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple (XRP) , and Solana (SOL) continue to drive market excitement, MAGACOINFINANCE is positioning as the top early-stage opportunity for forward-looking investors. Those who move before wider exposure almost always stand to benefit the most.

Alan Williams, 79, appeared before U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan. Williams, who once ran trading at Sutro & Co. in San Francisco, admitted last year that he used insider tips from Lawrence Billimek, a former trader at Nuveen, to place thousands of timely stock bets. Gardephe noted that Williams helped prosecutors build their case against Billimek, but said the sheer scope of illegal trades made a sentence without jail time impossible. Billimek, 54, pleaded guilty in 2023 and received a sentence of five years and 10 months in May. From 2018 through 2023, he shared details of Nuveen’s planned buys and sells with Williams, allowing the retiree to mirror positions before the firm’s own trades moved prices. Investigators said Williams executed 1,697 intraday stock trades flagged by the Consolidated Audit Trail, or CAT, a database that can log as many as 500 billion trade events each day. The SEC found that Williams enjoyed a 97 percent “win rate” during the five-year stretch—odds of less than one in a trillion if achieved by chance, the agency said. Legal scholars have argued that such a pattern could not have been spotted without CAT’s sweeping records. SEC’s trade tracking tool faces resistance Citadel Securities LLC and the American Securities Association sued the SEC in 2023, contending the regulator lacked congressional approval to run the database. Republican lawmakers echoed those concerns, warning that CAT might expose investors’ personal or political information. Donald Trump’s return to the White House and the publication of the conservative “Project 2025” policy blueprint have pushed the debate inside the commission. Paul Atkins , sworn in as SEC chair last week, told senators during his confirmation hearing that CAT’s costs had “ballooned” and that its scope “has kind of veered off.” He has ordered a review of the project. Financial-industry lobbying began even before Atkins took office. The SEC has already removed direct personal identifiers such as names and birth years from CAT data. In February, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association urged the commission to halt fee collections tied to the system while its future is decided. CAT has recently triggered two more enforcement actions Alongside the Nuveen matter, the SEC credits CAT with triggering two other recent enforcement actions. In November, a Federal Reserve Bank examiner pleaded guilty to trading on secrets about firms he supervised. The following month, a Florida day trader settled claims that he used thousands of fake “spoof” orders to nudge thinly traded stocks. Standing before Judge Gardephe on Monday, Williams, who has advanced Parkinson’s disease, apologized “to the court, my family, and Nuveen’s employees and clients,” adding, “I’m embarrassed and ashamed.” Federal guidelines called for 57 to 71 months. The maximum possible term was 75 years, though such penalties are rare in white-collar cases. Prosecutors said the pair used prepaid “burner” phones to avoid detection. On one August 2022 morning, they made more than $55,000 by shorting Match Group Inc. shares just before Nuveen unloaded a large block. Williams had asked the judge to spare him prison, calling himself “an uncommonly decent and giving man.” Gardephe rejected that plea, citing the “blatant nature” of the wrongdoing and the sheer volume of illegal trades. Under a forfeiture order filed later Monday, Williams agreed to give up more than $35 million held in Charles Schwab Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. accounts, along with a six-bedroom, six-bathroom home in West Linn, Oregon.

This New Crypto Might Be the Best ROI Play Before Exchange Listings Begin,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/120x-in-sight-this-new-crypto-might-be-the-best-roi-play-before-exchange-listings-begin/,"When searching for the best crypto to buy now, it pays to look at projects with real mechanics behind them. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently trades at just $0.025 in its presale, yet its setup points to dramatic upside. With exchange listings still ahead, early participants enjoy a rare window to secure tokens at a low entry price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum combines two lending options—peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P)—to cover a wide range of user needs. In P2C, you deposit familiar assets like ETH, USDC, or USDT into shared liquidity pools. Borrowers then draw from these pools by locking collateral, while lenders earn a dynamic APY that adjusts with usage: single digits when demand is light and mid-teens during busy periods. Loan-to-value (LTV) thresholds keep the system stable. For example, someone locking $1,000 worth of USDC might be allowed to borrow up to $900 in mixed assets at a 90% LTV. That ensures lenders remain overcollateralized and borrowers retain upside potential on their original holdings. This balance gives conservative users confidence and keeps risk aligned with activity. On the P2P side, two users negotiate terms directly, opening the door for more specialized tokens. Imagine lending LINK at a 12% rate with a 75% LTV—you lock in returns on an otherwise idle position without needing centralized approval. This flexibility attracts experienced DeFi participants who want bespoke deals on assets not usually supported in pooled contracts. What really fuels MUTM’s growth, however, is its revenue-driven tokenomics. Mutuum channels a portion of its protocol fees into buying MUTM on the open market. Those tokens are then awarded to users holding mtTokens, the interest-accruing receipts you receive when you deposit. This creates a steady buying pressure that naturally raises demand. The presale itself highlights the project’s momentum. Half of the current phase is already sold, and there are eleven phases in total. Each upcoming round increases the price, so delaying your purchase means losing ground on guaranteed upside. That ticking clock adds a real sense of urgency for anyone weighing what cryptocurrency to invest in before prices climb. Analysts are eyeing MUTM for a potential 120x return once it lists on major exchanges. To illustrate, a $1,400 investment at today’s presale price could theoretically grow to around $168,000 When MUTM reaches $3. These projections stem from concrete protocol mechanics—growing lending volume, expanding peer markets, and ongoing buybacks. Beyond lending and borrowing, Mutuum is rolling out an overcollateralized stablecoin that adds another layer of utility. Users will mint a USD-pegged token by locking excess collateral above the required ratio. When these stablecoins are repaid or liquidated, they’re burned, keeping supply balanced. Interest from stablecoin loans flows directly into the protocol’s treasury, creating yet another revenue stream for token buybacks. This layered ecosystem—dynamic pools, custom peer contracts, a stablecoin, and revenue-tied tokenomics—positions Mutuum as a standout in the DeFi space. It isn’t about chasing the next meme coin pump. Instead, it’s about building an engine for sustainable growth and real yield. For those plotting their portfolios ahead of the next altcoin rally, securing MUTM at $0.025 represents one of the most strategic moves available today. With exchange listings still on the horizon, the presale offers a low-cost entry into a protocol engineered for compounding value. As the market shifts toward projects with genuine utility, Mutuum Finance stands ready to reward early believers. In a world where many ask which crypto to buy today for long-term, Mutuum’s blend of concrete mechanics and limited presale pricing makes it a compelling choice. Don’t let the low ticket price fool you—this is a DeFi project built for outsized returns.

The board will act as the “security council to protect the heart and soul” of the foundation and set visions for Ethereum, while the new management will be focused on the strategic and operational execution of those visions, the Foundation said in an April 28 blog post . It added in an April 28 X post that Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak were appointed as co-executive directors on March 2 to deliver on those visions — which are centered around championing censorship resistance, open-source innovation, privacy and security Wang and Stańczak’s roles took effect on April 28 with the foundation setting a two-year term for Stańczak to address some of Ethereum’s biggest challenges. Stańczak’s new role will be balanced with his work as founder of Ethereum infrastructure firm Nethermind and a soon-to-be-announced Ethereum-focused venture capital firm. Source: Ethereum Foundation Bastian Aue and Josh Stark are also a part of the management team, with Aue to focus on organizational strategy, hiring and training, and Stark to primarily be tasked with project execution, communications and marketing. The board consists of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin , the Ethereum Foundation’s President Aya Miyaguchi, Swiss counsel Patrick Storchenegger, and Wang, who will bridge between the board and management team. Related: ‘Vitalik: An Ethereum Story’ is less about crypto and more about being human Buterin will continue providing technical and intellectual guidance on the Ethereum ecosystem, Miyaguchi will oversee the foundation’s vision while managing external relationships, and Storchenegger will keep handling legal and compliance matters. The board was responsible for selecting Wang and Stańczak as executive directors — a decision they acknowledged was unconventional — and they also have the power to terminate those positions. The Ethereum Foundation has adopted a more active role in the Ethereum ecosystem in recent months, following criticism from Synthetix founder Kain Warwick that the foundation “doesn’t care” about decentralized finance innovation. Others in the Ethereum community previously attributed the foundation’s lack of engagement and leadership to Ether’s ( ETH ) poor price performance relative to Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Solana ( SOL ). Ethereum Foundation’s main focus is scaling The Foundation said its three main focus areas over the next 12 months would be to scale the Ethereum layer 1, scale blobs at the layer 2 level, and improve user experience. Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist and protocol support Sophia Gold have already pitched proposals to to address Ethereum’s scaling woes at the base layer under Ethereum Improvement Proposals-9678 and 9698. Both EIPs look to raise the gas limit, which should theoretically raise Ethereum’s transaction throughput by the same magnitude.

On-Chain Data Provides Hints,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-rally-stalled-on-chain-data-provides-hints/,"On-chain data shows a few Bitcoin indicators are following a trajectory that could potentially explain the reason why the latest rally has taken a pause. Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics Have Seen Bearish Developments Recently In a new post on X, an analyst has talked about how a few on-chain indicators related to Bitcoin have changed recently. The first metric of relevance is the “Exchange Reserve,” which measures the total amount of BTC that’s sitting in the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Sell, But Bitcoin’s Key Investors Are Buying Below is the chart shared by the quant showing the trend in this indicator: As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve plunged alongside the recent price rally, suggesting the investors withdrew a large number of tokens from exchanges. Generally, large withdrawals can be a sign that the holders are accumulating, so it could have been this buying activity that helped provide the fuel for the price rally. From the chart, it’s apparent that in the last few days, the decline has ended and the indicator has taken to sideways movement. It may be no coincidence that the asset’s surge, too, has taken a pause alongside this trend. For now, outflows are still balancing out inflows, but the indicator can be kept an eye on, as a reversal to net deposits could prove to be bearish for the cryptocurrency. Another obstacle to the rally could be the fact that the investors have been participating in profit-taking recently. The metric that shows this trend is the Net Realized Profit and Loss (NRPL), which keeps track of the net amount of profit or loss that Bitcoin investors as a whole are realizing through their transactions. Just earlier, the NRPL observed a large negative spike corresponding to a realized loss of $2 billion, but with the rally, its value has seen a sharp reversal into the positive territory. At the peak of this profit-taking spree, the metric managed to achieve a value of around $3 billion. Another metric, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), also confirms the dominance of profit-taking. The SOPR, much like NRPL, deals with profit/loss realization. The difference lies in that the NRPL shows the net situation, while the SOPR calculates the ratio between profit and loss. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Realizing $139 Million In Profit Per Hour This Rally, Report Says As for which investors have been participating in the profit-taking, it would appear whale-sized entities (investors with more than 1,000 BTC) have been making some large moves. These humongous investors tend to carry some influence in the market, so their transfers are generally to look out for. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $95,000, up around 10% in the last week.

PI was last changing hands around $0.61, having slipped back below its 21DMA amid a bearish breakout from a short-term pennant pattern. That suggests, in the short-term, price risks are titled towards the downside. The near-term bearish technical outlook syncs with bearish token fundamentals. Since the launch of the Open Network in February and an initial hype-fueled price spike up to $3.0 per token, the Pi Network price has slumped over 80% amid major token unlocks, that could continue to weigh on the price in the near-future.

And one analyst thinks the catalyst could be coming up in just over two weeks. This Key Catalyst Could Spark Breakout “I am fairly confident that the price pumping of Pi might start during the Consensus Summit (May 14–16, 2025)” widely followed analyst Dr Altcoin said in a recent X post. Pi is doing well! I am fairly confident that the price pumping of Pi might start during the Consensus Summit (May 14–16, 2025) rather than at the end of August when Pi unlocking significantly reduces. pic.twitter.com/iaSDGzqwYa — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) April 27, 2025 That’s instead of the pump coming at “the end of August when Pi unlocking significantly reduces”, he added. Pi Network is a sponsor of the event, one of the biggest summits in crypto, and its founder Nicholas Kalallis is one of the speakers. A major Pi Network price recovery would likely see PI reach all the way back to its 50% Fibonnaci retracement from the April lows under $0.40 to the record highs near $3.0, which is around $1.70. That could mean a rally of nearly 3x from current levels. So now might be a good time for investors with a high risk tolerance to consider getting into the market. The Pi Network’s price is likely to perform well in the long run due to its growing user base and innovative mobile mining model, which fosters widespread adoption and sustained demand. A potential surge to new record highs next year could be driven by the project’s mainnet launch and increasing merchant acceptance, significantly boosting its utility and market confidence.

TRUMP is up 2.3% today and 83% over the past week , now trading at $15.13 . Despite the impressive rally, the coin remains about 79.4% below its all-time high of $73.43 , set just days after Trump’s inauguration. Even so, TRUMP is currently the best-performing meme coin among the top five by market cap — outpacing the likes of Dogecoin ($DOGE), which, despite backing from Tesla/SpaceX/X CEO Elon Musk, has stayed flat over the past day and gained just 12% over the past week. Trump’s VIP dinner for the 220 top TRUMP donors attracted a lot of criticism, with Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff calling for Trump’s impeachment . TRUMP Price Prediction: Where Will TRUMP go Next? TRUMP’s rally still looks strong, and the momentum could easily extend if the team continues to capitalize on the current excitement. As shown in the chart, TRUMP had been grinding lower for months — until a major breakout triggered a sharp move higher, reversing the downtrend with powerful buying pressure. While some short-term profit-taking is visible — with the RSI cooling to 70.99 — the token has successfully consolidated above key levels, suggesting it’s building a base for another potential leg up. The broader meme coin market is slightly down 0.3% over the past 24 hours, but TRUMP’s $1.7 billion 24-hour trading volume signals that serious attention remains on the project. If bullish momentum returns to the sector, traders will be eyeing a move toward the $20 mark as the next big target.

The report claims Elon used his heavy influence to kill investigations, dodge enforcement, and wipe away lawsuits tied to his businesses. It says Elon’s so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” helped shred Washington’s agencies while President Donald Trump openly backed the aggressive cuts. Democrats now say Elon’s upcoming exit from DOGE operations could be more about escaping scrutiny than anything else. They accuse Elon, the world’s richest man, of turning the government into a personal tool to “evade oversight, derail investigations, and make litigation disappear whenever he so chooses—on his terms and at his command,” the report said. The Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations put together the 44-page memo outlining how deep Elon’s mess ran. Summary of Elon Musk’s exposure by investigations and litigation. Source: Senate Democrats On Trump’s inauguration day, Elon’s companies – including SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and xAI – were already facing at least 65 active or possible regulatory or enforcement actions from 11 different federal agencies, that much we’re all certain of. These open cases stacked up to $2.37 billion in potential financial risk. At Tesla, investigators flagged $1.19 billion in possible liability for allegedly lying about the capabilities of its autopilot and self-driving features. Neuralink, Elon’s brain chip venture, faced $281 million in potential penalties for allegedly making false claims about risks tied to its products. Neuralink also risked another $1.59 million in civil and criminal fines tied to alleged violations of the Animal Welfare Act. The report says Elon wasn’t just trying to protect one company — he had a full empire to shield. Senate pushes Elon for answers before May deadline Democrats said Elon’s behavior has one clear goal: boost his own wealth by crushing any roadblocks. “The through line connecting many of Mr. Elon’s decisions appears to be self-enrichment and avoiding what he perceives as obstacles to advancing his interests,” the memo said. Senate staffers also warned that the true benefits Elon has pocketed through these tactics “may never be known, and that is by design. The silence is strategic, and it is dangerous.” Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who is the ranking member of the committee, sent out formal letters demanding answers from all five Elon-run companies. Blumenthal wants each business to spill the details about the investigations it faced before Trump took office, and explain how they made sure Elon’s DOGE government work wasn’t used to interfere with those probes. Blumenthal told them to respond by May 11, leaving Elon and his companies little time to come up with the paperwork. The White House, as per usual, blasted the Democrats’ claims. The Trump administration denied that Elon’s government role was ever used for personal or financial gain. “Any assertion otherwise is completely false and defamatory,” the White House said in a statement. In an emailed response, Steven Cheung, Trump’s communications director, said Blumenthal “is clearly suffering from a debilitating and uncurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has wilted his brain.” Elon’s DOGE involvement and his company problems are now tangled deeper than ever. Senate Democrats aren’t just asking questions; they’re digging into years of investigations, fines, and allegations Elon tried to erase while riding the government machine. Every case connected to Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and xAI carries a dollar amount and a paper trail, and the memo hints there might be even more hidden under the surface. Democrats said Elon’s control wasn’t random or messy – it was sharp, calculated, and designed to crush anything standing in his way. They pointed to the government cuts, the regulatory silencing, and the dismantled agencies as part of Elon’s game plan. The White House may laugh it off, but Senate Democrats want answers in black and white. With a hard May 11 deadline looming, Elon’s companies can either open the books, or deal with a full-blown Senate fight.

Through the venture, 150 million merchants across the Mastercard network will now have the option to receive payments in stablecoins , regardless of how a customer pays, Mastercard said on April 28. The payments giant also partnered with crypto exchange OKX for a crypto-enabled bank card, which Mastercard product chief Jorn Lambert said creates a “360-degree approach” where consumers can spend stablecoins and merchants can receive them. He added that the “mainstream use cases are clear” for blockchain tech, and the company wanted “to make it as easy for merchants to receive stablecoin payments and for consumers to use them.” Source: Mastercard News The stablecoin market has continued to make gains, crossing a market value of $230 billion, an increase of 54% since last year , with Tether ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) dominating 90% of the market. Active stablecoin wallets have also increased over 50% in one year, according to a report last month from onchain analysis platforms Artemis and Dune. Investment banking giant Citigroup predicted in an April 23 report that a combination of growing regulatory support and adoption by financial institutions has set the stage for the stablecoin market to reach as high as $3.7 trillion by 2030. Mastercard launches another crypto card Mastercard said its partnership with OKX for the so-called OKX Card aims to give crypto users “easy access to their funds” and integrate stablecoins into daily transactions. OKX marketing chief Haider Rafique said the exchange’s venture with Mastercard is “a significant step toward integrating stablecoins into daily transactions and creating richer experiences.” Related: Mastercard tokenized 30% of its transactions in 2024 Crypto wallet maker MetaMask also partnered with Mastercard on April 28 to launch a crypto payments card allowing users to spend self-custodied funds, using smart contracts to execute the IRL (In Real Life) transactions, with a processing speed under five seconds.

Financial giant Mastercard has just made a major move into the world of stablecoin payments, announcing new capabilities designed to integrate these digital assets more deeply into everyday transactions. This isn’t just a minor update; it signals a growing acceptance and strategic push by traditional payment networks to embrace the potential of cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins. Mastercard’s Ambitious Stablecoin Capabilities Mastercard is rolling out a suite of new capabilities aimed at making stablecoins more functional within its vast network. These initiatives focus on several key areas: Wallet Integration: Making it easier for digital wallets to connect and interact with Mastercard’s network, potentially allowing users to spend stablecoins directly from their wallets. Merchant Settlement: Exploring ways for merchants to accept stablecoin payments and potentially settle transactions in stablecoins or easily convert them to fiat. On-Chain Remittances: Streamlining cross-border payments using stablecoins, leveraging the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology for remittances. This move by Mastercard indicates a clear recognition of stablecoins’ potential as a more efficient and cost-effective method for certain types of transactions compared to traditional systems. By building infrastructure for Mastercard stablecoin use, they are laying the groundwork for wider adoption. Introducing the OKX Card: Bridging Crypto Trading and Global Payments Adding to the excitement, Mastercard is partnering with leading crypto exchange OKX to launch the “OKX Card.” This collaboration is a direct link between the crypto trading world and Mastercard’s extensive global payment network. CoinDesk reported on this significant development, highlighting how the OKX Card aims to make spending crypto as simple as using a regular debit or credit card. How does the OKX Card potentially work? While specific details are still emerging, the general idea behind such crypto-linked cards is straightforward: Users hold cryptocurrency (including stablecoins) in their linked OKX account. When a purchase is made using the OKX Card at a Mastercard-accepting merchant, the necessary amount of crypto is converted to the local fiat currency at the point of sale. Mastercard processes the transaction through its traditional network. This mechanism allows users to leverage their crypto holdings for everyday purchases without needing to manually convert funds beforehand, offering unprecedented convenience and liquidity for crypto assets. Why are Mastercard’s Crypto Payment Moves So Significant? Mastercard’s foray into stablecoins and its partnership with OKX for the OKX Card represent more than just new product launches. They signify a major validation of cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins, by a global financial powerhouse. Here’s why this is a big deal: Mainstream Adoption: Mastercard’s network reaches millions of merchants and billions of consumers worldwide. Integrating stablecoins into this network could dramatically accelerate mainstream crypto payments adoption. Bridging TradFi and Crypto: This move further blurs the lines between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), creating pathways for easier interaction and utilization of digital assets within the existing financial infrastructure. Increased Utility for Stablecoins: By enabling stablecoins for payments and remittances, Mastercard is enhancing their real-world utility beyond just trading or holding. Competition and Innovation: This could spur other traditional payment networks and financial institutions to accelerate their own crypto and stablecoin initiatives, driving innovation in the space. This isn’t just about enabling spending; it’s about integrating the underlying technology and assets into the core financial plumbing. The Power of Stablecoin Payments: Benefits for Users and Businesses The focus on stablecoin payments by Mastercard highlights the unique advantages these digital assets offer: For Users: Stability: Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This makes them suitable for transactions and payments without the risk of price swings. Speed: Transactions on blockchain networks can often be faster than traditional banking transfers, especially for cross-border payments. Lower Costs: Depending on the network and transaction type, stablecoin transactions can potentially involve lower fees compared to traditional methods, particularly for international remittances. Accessibility: Stablecoins can be accessed and used by anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet, potentially banking the unbanked or underbanked populations globally. For Businesses/Merchants: Reduced Fees: Accepting stablecoin payments might offer lower transaction fees compared to traditional card processing fees. Faster Settlement: Settlement times can potentially be reduced, improving cash flow. Global Reach: Stablecoins facilitate easier transactions with international customers without dealing with complex currency conversions or high fees. Innovation: Offering stablecoin payment options can attract tech-savvy customers and position businesses at the forefront of payment innovation. By integrating stablecoins into their network, Mastercard is unlocking these benefits for a much wider audience. Mastercard Crypto Initiatives: Paving the Way for Mainstream Adoption? Mastercard’s recent announcements are part of a broader strategy to engage with the digital asset space. The company has been exploring various aspects of Mastercard crypto integration for some time, including NFTs, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and now stablecoins and crypto-linked cards. Their approach seems to be one of cautious yet determined exploration and integration. Instead of building a separate crypto network from scratch, Mastercard is leveraging its existing infrastructure and relationships to bridge the gap between the traditional financial world and the burgeoning crypto economy. This strategic positioning allows them to tap into the innovation of crypto while providing the familiarity, security, and regulatory compliance expected by consumers and businesses using their network. What Challenges Lie Ahead? While the potential is immense, integrating stablecoins and crypto payments into a global network like Mastercard’s isn’t without challenges: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins and cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Navigating different rules in different jurisdictions is complex. Consumer Education: Educating the general public about stablecoins and how to use crypto-linked cards safely and effectively is crucial for adoption. Technical Integration: Ensuring seamless and secure integration of blockchain technology with existing legacy systems requires significant technical effort. Security: Protecting users from fraud, hacks, and scams in the crypto space is paramount. Volatility (for non-stablecoin crypto): While the focus here is on stablecoins, cards like the OKX Card might allow spending of other cryptocurrencies. Managing the volatility of these assets at the point of sale requires robust systems. Mastercard and its partners like OKX will need to address these challenges effectively to build trust and ensure widespread adoption. Looking Ahead: The Future of Payments Mastercard’s move is a strong indicator that digital assets, particularly stablecoins, are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative investments but as tools for actual commerce and payments. The partnership with OKX for the OKX Card is a concrete step towards making crypto holdings spendable in the real world. As infrastructure improves, regulatory frameworks mature, and user understanding grows, we can expect to see more integrations like this, potentially reshaping the future of global payments. The collaboration between traditional finance giants and crypto native companies is likely to be a key theme in this evolution. In Summary Mastercard’s launch of new stablecoin capabilities for wallet integration, merchant settlement, and on-chain remittances, coupled with its partnership with OKX for the OKX Card, marks a significant milestone. This initiative aims to bridge the gap between the traditional Mastercard network and the growing world of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. By enhancing the utility of stablecoins for everyday transactions and providing a convenient way to spend crypto via the OKX Card, Mastercard is taking a bold step towards enabling mainstream crypto payments. While challenges remain, particularly regarding regulation and education, these developments highlight the increasing relevance of stablecoin payments and Mastercard’s commitment to exploring the potential of Mastercard crypto initiatives. This is a powerful move that could accelerate the integration of digital assets into the global economy.

ADA has been finding support as of late as it falls back towards its 50DMA around $0.6750, which it broke through during last week’s broad crypto market rally. Per CoinMarketCap , Cardano’s market cap was last around $24.7 billion. This sends an important signal about the market’s near-term outlook – the break back above the 50DMA suggests that the bearish trend of late March/April has been snapped. Risks are thus now tilted towards a continued Cardano price recovery. A return to recent highs in the $1.20-30 area are even possible. That said, its very unlikely that a new altcoin season is about to arrive and send ADA back to its 2021 record highs above $3.0. That’s because macro uncertainties remain elevated. Yes, US President Trump has seemingly turned down the heat slightly in his trade wars. But uncertainty about trade policy remains elevated. And cracks are already appearing in the US economy, as survey data released on Monday illustrated. Ouch: April ⁦ @DallasFed ⁩ Manufacturing Index down to -35.8 vs. -14.2 est. & -16.3 prior … new orders down to -20 (-0.1 prior), shipments down to -5.5 (+6.1 prior), prices paid up to +48.4 (+37.7 prior), and employment up to -3.9 (-4.6 prior) pic.twitter.com/AXdv26GZ5h — Liz Ann Sonders (@LizAnnSonders) April 28, 2025 With risks rising that the US economy tilts into recession rising, and global economic uncertainty high amid the trade war, and the world’s most important central bank the Fed worried about “sticky inflation” (and thus r eluctant to save the day via monetary policy easing ), this isn’t exactly the environment for altcoin season to launch the Cardano price moonwards. That means that, while ADA could see further upside in the coming weeks, a breakout of recent multi-month ranges isn’t likely. Cardano’s Long-Term Bull Case: A Strategic Accumulation Opportunity Despite a neutral medium-term outlook, Cardano presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity. While trailing rivals such as Ethereum and Solana in terms of adoption, Cardano’s robust fundamentals and strategic roadmap position it for significant growth, potentially reaching $10 by the end of Trump’s term in 2029. Investors should thus view the current range-bound price action as a chance to accumulate. Cardano’s blockchain excels in scalability, sustainability, and security, leveraging its Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol. Its focus on rigorous academic research ensures a resilient foundation, distinguishing it from competitors. A key bullish narrative is Cardano’s ambition to become the premier Bitcoin DeFi chain, enabling seamless integration of Bitcoin’s liquidity into decentralized finance applications.

That’s especially the case against the backdrop of a historically favorable global regulatory backdrop for the crypto industry, spearheaded by the ardently pro-crypto Trump administration’s efforts to bolster the industry. However, with a market cap still modest compared to rivals, Cardano offers asymmetric return potential. Strategic investors can capitalize on current consolidation to build positions in a blockchain poised for exponential growth over the next four years.

In an April 28 letter to White House crypto czar David Sacks , the group urged President Donald Trump “to take immediate action to discontinue the Biden-era Department of Justice's lawless campaign to criminalize open-source software development.” The letter specifically mentioned the prosecution of Storm, who was charged in August 2023 with helping launder over $1 billion in crypto through Tornado Cash. His trial is still set for July , and his fellow charged co-founder, Roman Semenov, is at large and believed to be in Russia. The DeFi Education Fund said that in Storm’s case, the Department of Justice is attempting to hold software developers criminally liable for how others use their code, which is “not only absurd in principle, but it sets a precedent that potentially chills all crypto development in the United States.” The group also called for the recognition that the prosecution contradicts the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidance from Trump’s first term, which established that developers of self-custodial, peer-to-peer protocols are not money transmitters. Source: DeFi Education Fund “This kind of legal environment does not just chill innovation — it freezes it,” they argued. The letter added that it also “empowers politically-motivated enforcement and puts every open-source developer at risk, regardless of industry.” In January, a federal court in Texas ruled that the Treasury overstepped its authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash. Stakes could not be higher The group thanked Trump for his support of the industry and his stated goal to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” They added, however, that his goal can’t be realized if developers are prosecuted for building tools that enable the technology. “We ask President Trump to protect American software developers, restore legal clarity, and end this unlawful DOJ overreach. The job’s not finished, and the stakes could not be higher.” Related: Tornado Cash dev wants charges dropped after court said OFAC ‘overstepped’ Variant Fund chief legal officer Jake Chervinsky said the Justice Department’s case against Storm is “an outdated remnant of the Biden administration's war on crypto.” “There is no justification in law or policy for prosecuting software developers for launching non-custodial smart contract protocols,” he added. At the time of writing, the petition had attracted 232 signatures from industry executives and developers, including Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang, and Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko, among others.

This kind of engagement from a figure with CZ’s track record is invaluable for early-stage ventures navigating the complex landscape of decentralized technology. Understanding YZiLabs and the Role of Crypto Venture Capital While not as widely publicized as some major venture funds, YZiLabs appears to be playing a role in identifying and nurturing promising Crypto Projects . The specific nature of YZiLabs (whether it’s an incubator, accelerator, or pure venture fund) isn’t detailed in CZ’s post, but its function is clear: providing support to new ventures in the space. This highlights the crucial role of Crypto Venture Capital in driving innovation. Early funding and strategic guidance are essential for turning ambitious ideas into functional, impactful decentralized applications and platforms. Investors and labs like YZiLabs act as catalysts, providing the resources and network that Web3 Startups desperately need to get off the ground and scale.

43927168,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=717288,1745893873,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43927168.jpeg,What Wall Street expects from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway earnings,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-wall-street-expects-berkshire-earnings/,"Wall Street is already laying its bets on Berkshire Hathaway before the company releases its first-quarter earnings on May 2. According to a CNBC report on Monday, UBS analyst Brian Meredith is pushing even harder on the company’s Class B stock, calling the so-called “Baby Berkshire” a “safe haven in a turbulent environment.” Meredith stuck to his previous buy rating but pushed the 12-month price target higher to $606 per share from $557. That is about a 14% rise from yesterday’s $530.96 closing price. Meredith also moved up his first-quarter earnings estimate to $4.89 per share from $4.81, driven by improved loss ratios at Geico, which sits as one of Warren Buffett’s major holdings. Shares of Berkshire’s Class B stock have already climbed nearly 18% in 2025. Even with Donald Trump back in the White House and tariffs rolling out, Meredith said Geico could handle the impact. “We expect tariffs to potentially increase claims costs by 3% – 4% at Geico, however, given current profitability, Geico may be able to absorb the additional costs without raising prices and stay within target margins,” Meredith said. Meredith is also keeping his eyes open for any hints about how Berkshire plans to use its massive $334 billion cash pile, an amount that has reached record levels for the company. On top of all that, analysts polled by FactSet are forecasting first-quarter earnings per share of $4.72 on revenue of $90.8 billion. Buffett’s wealth balloons as Berkshire stock powers higher At 94 years old, Warren’s fortune is swelling alongside Berkshire Hathaway’s stock price. His net worth jumped by $23.7 billion so far in 2025, hitting $166 billion, Bloomberg Billionaire Index reported. The surge amounts to a 16.7% gain year-to-date, largely powered by the strong run of Berkshire’s Class B shares. As of the latest figures, the stock closed at $534.29, up 19% this year. Warren’s financial empire is basically tied to Berkshire, accounting for around 99.5% of his net worth, as he has repeatedly pointed out in public statements. Even after a minor dip of $260 million—or 0.2%—on the most recent trading day, Warren’s financial standing is still firmly locked in. Berkshire’s November 2024 filings show that the Oracle of Omaha owns about 37.4% of the company’s Class A shares, while his Class B holdings are almost too small to matter. Warren’s limited non-Berkshire assets haven’t changed much in over a decade. In that infamous letter he wrote to Congressman Tim Huelskamp back in 2011, and through disclosures since 2010, Warren said that any non-Berkshire investments he holds are basically pocket change compared to his main holdings. He once had stakes in Wells Fargo and US Bancorp, but those added up to less than 1% of his total fortune and still do today. Time hasn’t really helped those outside investments either. Market changes, dividend reinvestments, and asset sales have changed their values around, but they remain tiny compared to his Berkshire mountain. The bigger picture here is that his playbook hasn’t needed adjusting even through the roughest economic seasons. His no-drama approach has carried him through inflation, market collapses, and economic slowdowns. All in all, Warren’s steady hands have turned his Berkshire holdings into the ultimate fortress against market chaos for Wall Street, proving once again that he might be the greatest investor history has ever recorded.

Recent comments from a high-ranking US official have sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, particularly concerning the US Government Bitcoin Stance . According to a report by Bitcoin Magazine on X, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that America is embracing Bitcoin and that the government will continue to support its growth. This isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a statement from a key figure in the US administration, potentially signaling a significant shift or clarification in how the nation views the leading cryptocurrency. Understanding the Significance of Commerce Secretary Bitcoin Comments When the Commerce Secretary Bitcoin Comments surface, they carry weight. Howard Lutnick is a prominent figure, leading the department responsible for promoting economic growth and technological advancement in the United States. His statement that the US is “embracing” Bitcoin and will “support its growth” is a powerful indicator. It suggests a recognition of Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but potentially as a technology or financial instrument that the US government sees value in fostering within its borders. Why is this particular comment noteworthy? Source Authority: The Commerce Department plays a role in areas like technology policy, international trade, and economic development, all of which intersect with the world of digital assets. Positive Framing: Using words like “embracing” and “support its growth” presents a distinctly positive outlook compared to previous government discussions that often focused heavily on risks and regulation. Potential Signal: Such a statement could signal to businesses, investors, and international partners that the US is looking favorably upon the development and integration of Bitcoin and potentially other digital assets into the economy. While not a legislative announcement, it contributes to the overall narrative and sentiment surrounding the US Government Bitcoin Stance . It contrasts with more cautious or critical perspectives sometimes voiced by other regulatory bodies. How Might Bitcoin Regulation in the US Evolve? The path for Bitcoin Regulation US has been complex and often fragmented. Various agencies like the SEC, CFTC, Treasury, and the Federal Reserve have overlapping jurisdictions and differing views. A statement like Lutnick’s, however, might hint at a potential push towards more coordinated or even favorable regulatory frameworks in the future. Supporting growth often requires providing clarity and reducing uncertainty. Potential directions for Bitcoin Regulation US could include: Clearer Tax Guidance: Simplifying how Bitcoin transactions and holdings are taxed. Framework for Digital Assets: Developing a cohesive regulatory framework that defines different types of digital assets and how they are treated. Innovation-Friendly Policies: Creating sandboxes or guidelines that encourage technological development in the blockchain space without stifling it. Consumer Protection: Implementing rules focused on protecting investors and users without imposing overly burdensome requirements that hinder adoption. This potential evolution in Bitcoin Regulation US is crucial for mainstream adoption and institutional participation. Clarity can unlock significant capital and drive innovation within the country. Analyzing US Crypto Policy: Is a Bullish Future Ahead? The broader US Crypto Policy landscape is a mosaic of different agency actions and congressional discussions. Lutnick’s comments add a potentially bullish piece to this mosaic. A government that actively supports the growth of Bitcoin might be more inclined to adopt policies that foster innovation, attract crypto businesses, and integrate digital assets into the financial system. Historically, the US Crypto Policy has sometimes been perceived as lagging behind other nations in providing regulatory certainty, leading some companies to explore domiciling elsewhere. A supportive stance from the Commerce Department could indicate a desire to change this narrative and position the US as a leader in the digital asset space. Considering the potential implications for US Crypto Policy : Economic Competitiveness: Supporting Bitcoin and blockchain technology can enhance the US’s position in the global digital economy. Job Creation: Growth in the sector leads to new jobs in technology, finance, and related fields. Innovation Hub: Favorable policies can solidify the US as a hub for blockchain development and research. While challenges remain, including concerns around illicit finance, energy consumption, and financial stability, a supportive voice from the Commerce Department is a positive signal for the direction of US Crypto Policy . What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin in US? The potential Future of Bitcoin in US appears brighter if this supportive sentiment translates into concrete policies. Increased government backing, even if primarily rhetorical at this stage, can boost confidence among both retail and institutional investors. The Future of Bitcoin in US could see: Potential Opportunity Possible Impact Increased Institutional Adoption More investment from large funds, corporations, and traditional financial institutions. Broader Retail Access Easier and safer ways for everyday Americans to buy, hold, and use Bitcoin. Technological Integration Bitcoin and blockchain technology used in more sectors beyond finance, such as supply chain or digital identity. Regulatory Clarity Reduced uncertainty for businesses building on Bitcoin and blockchain. However, it’s important to temper expectations. A single statement, while significant, doesn’t instantly solve all the challenges or align all government agencies. The path to a fully integrated Future of Bitcoin in US will likely involve continued debate and policy development. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Enthusiast What should you take away from the Commerce Secretary’s comments and the evolving US Government Bitcoin Stance ? Stay Informed: Keep track of official statements and policy developments from various US government bodies. The landscape is dynamic. Assess Risk: While sentiment might be improving, regulatory uncertainty hasn’t vanished entirely. Understand the risks associated with investing in or building with Bitcoin. Look for Policy Details: Watch for specific legislative proposals or regulatory guidance that follow such high-level statements. That’s where the real impact lies. Understand the Nuances: Remember that different government agencies have different perspectives and mandates regarding digital assets. Lutnick’s comments are a positive data point, suggesting a potential shift towards greater acceptance and support for Bitcoin’s role in the US economy. It’s a signal that proponents of digital assets have been hoping for. Conclusion: A Glimpse of a Supportive Future? The statement from U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that the US is embracing Bitcoin and will support its growth is a notable development. It provides a glimpse into a potentially more supportive US Government Bitcoin Stance , influencing the discussion around Bitcoin Regulation US and the broader US Crypto Policy . While challenges and regulatory hurdles remain, these Commerce Secretary Bitcoin Comments contribute to a narrative that could shape the promising Future of Bitcoin in US . It’s a powerful signal for innovation and economic growth in the digital asset space, suggesting that key figures in the US administration recognize the potential of Bitcoin and are looking to foster its development domestically.

In the latest FTX News update, the bankrupt crypto exchange has launched a legal offensive to recover assets in a fresh effort to speed up FTX repayments. According to a new press release on PR Newswire , FTX has filed lawsuits against NFT Stars Limited and KUROSEMI INC., the company behind Delysium. FTX claims these firms failed to deliver specific tokens that rightfully belong to its estate, even after multiple reminders and negotiation attempts. With out-of-court talks failing, FTX is now seeking court orders to force the return of the disputed assets. More Lawsuits on the Horizon The legal push may just be getting started. FTX has warned that more lawsuits are coming, targeting other token and coin issuers who are allegedly holding onto assets. The exchange is actively reaching out, but if companies fail to cooperate, they can expect swift legal action. The message is loud and clear: hand over the assets or prepare for a courtroom battle. On the other side, Crypto analyst Eva Lenoir throws shade at FTX’s legal move, sarcastically calling it a “sheriff” act. She questions where this energy was when Sam Bankman-Fried was mishandling users’ funds, suggesting the lawsuits against NFT Stars and Delysium come far too late to matter. Moreover, she also believes that the real losers are small investors who’ll bear the cost. She contrasts the chaos with Bitcoin, calling it strong, unshaken, and still shining. Why FTX Is Ramping Up the Pressure The FTX legal team emphasized that every asset recovery counts. Returning these tokens could significantly boost the funds available for FTX repayments to creditors who are still awaiting compensation after the exchange’s catastrophic collapse. While FTX says it prefers to resolve matters amicably, it has made it clear it will not hesitate to pursue aggressive legal remedies if needed. In its mission to maximize FTX repayments, the collapsed exchange is taking no prisoners. Lawsuits are now firmly on the table, and more companies could soon find themselves in FTX’s crosshairs. FAQ What happened to FTX? FTX collapsed in November 2022 after it was revealed that the company misused customer funds and faced a massive liquidity crisis. This led to bankruptcy, legal investigations, and major losses for users and investors. How are FTX lawsuits connected to FTX repayment efforts? FTX lawsuits aim to recover missing crypto assets from companies and individuals. These recovered assets will directly contribute to increasing the FTX repayment pool for creditors. What caused the FTX collapse? The FTX collapse was caused by alleged fraudulent practices, poor financial management, and misuse of customer deposits. When these issues came to light, users rushed to withdraw funds, exposing the company’s insolvency. Why is FTX suing companies like NFT Stars and Delysium? FTX claims that these companies failed to deliver tokens that were supposed to be transferred to its estate. After unsuccessful attempts to settle the matter outside of court, FTX is now pursuing legal action to recover these assets.",News|Crypto Regulations|Hack,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-29 02:44:17

43927782,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153478,1745895041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tornado Cash: Crucial Legal Battle as Crypto Firms Defend Roman Storm,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tornado-cash-roman-storm/,"A significant development is unfolding in the complex world of cryptocurrency regulation and privacy tools, specifically concerning the Tornado Cash case. A coalition of prominent crypto firms has taken a direct step, appealing to the White House to intervene in the criminal proceedings against Roman Storm, a co-founder of the controversial crypto mixer, Tornado Cash. Why Are Crypto Firms Defending Roman Storm Trial? The core of this unprecedented move lies in a letter sent by several leading crypto industry participants to David Sacks, who has been identified as a key figure advising the Trump administration on cryptocurrency matters. The letter, reportedly led by the DeFi Education Fund and signed by major venture capital firms like Paradigm, Multicoin Capital, and 6th Man Ventures, makes a clear plea: drop the criminal case against Roman Storm. Their argument hinges on a recent statement from the Department of Justice (DOJ) that seemingly differentiates between developers of tools and users of those tools for illicit purposes. The DOJ indicated it would not pursue legal action against developers of cryptocurrency mixers and wallets simply because those tools were used in criminal activities by others. The crypto firms argue that prosecuting Roman Storm, a developer of Tornado Cash, directly contradicts this stated policy. The firms believe that holding developers liable for how third parties use open-source software sets a dangerous precedent that could stifle innovation and the development of essential privacy-preserving technologies within the crypto space. They view the case against Storm not just as an attack on one individual, but as a potential threat to the entire ecosystem of decentralized development and financial privacy. Understanding Crypto Mixers Legality and Tornado Cash To fully grasp the stakes involved in the Crypto mixers legality debate and the Tornado Cash situation, it’s important to understand what crypto mixers are and why they are so contentious. What are Crypto Mixers? Crypto mixers, also known as tumbling services, are tools designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin. They work by pooling together cryptocurrency from many users and then sending it out to their respective destinations in a scrambled manner. This process makes it difficult to trace the origin and destination of specific funds, effectively breaking the link between a user’s wallet address and their transaction history. Why are they Controversial? While mixers offer legitimate privacy benefits for users who don’t want their entire financial history public, they have also been exploited by criminals to launder illicit funds. Bad actors, including ransomware gangs and state-sponsored hacking groups, have used services like Tornado Cash to obscure the movement of stolen or illegally obtained cryptocurrency. Tornado Cash, in particular, gained notoriety after the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned it in August 2022, adding specific Tornado Cash addresses to its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. OFAC alleged that the mixer had been used to launder billions of dollars, including funds stolen by North Korean hackers. The legal challenge arises because Tornado Cash is not a traditional company with employees and a central server. It’s largely a decentralized protocol, governed by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Roman Storm and other co-founders were involved in its initial development and continued maintenance, but they argue they do not control the protocol or the funds that pass through it in the way a traditional financial institution would. Crypto Developer Legal Challenges: A Growing Concern The case against Roman Storm is part of a broader trend of Crypto developer legl challenges being brought by regulators and law enforcement globally. As cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) grow, authorities are grappling with how to apply existing laws, designed for traditional financial systems, to novel, permissionless technologies. Developers of decentralized protocols often argue that they are simply writing and deploying code, akin to creating software. They contend that they should not be held responsible for how individuals choose to use that software, just as the creator of an email protocol isn’t responsible for spam or phishing. Authorities, however, sometimes view developers or key contributors to a protocol as operators of an unlicensed money transmission service or as facilitators of illicit activity, especially if they believe the protocol was designed specifically to evade detection or if the developers profited from its use. The charges against Storm, including conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, reflect this latter perspective. This legal grey area creates significant uncertainty for developers working on decentralized technologies. Will building a privacy feature make them legally liable? Does contributing to an open-source project expose them to criminal charges if someone misuses the code? The crypto firms’ letter to David Sacks underscores this anxiety. They see the prosecution of Roman Storm as a direct threat to the principle of open-source development and the ability to build privacy-preserving tools, which they argue are essential for the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. DOJ Crypto Policy: A Point of Contention The firms’ reference to the recent DOJ crypto policy is particularly insightful. While the specific DOJ announcement they cite might require further clarification, the general sentiment expressed by some U.S. officials has been that enforcement efforts should focus on the *users* of crypto for illicit purposes and the centralized *service providers* who facilitate such activities, rather than solely targeting the developers of the underlying technology. For example, recent actions against centralized exchanges or mixers that operate as businesses (like the charges against the founders of Samourai Wallet) might be seen as more aligned with a focus on service providers. The case against Storm, however, targets a developer of a largely decentralized protocol, which the firms argue falls outside the spirit, if not the letter, of the DOJ’s purported stance on developers. The firms are essentially asking the White House, through David Sacks, to ensure that the actions of the DOJ align with a policy that protects software developers. They argue that prosecuting developers for writing code, even code that can be misused, is fundamentally different from prosecuting individuals or entities who operate services that actively facilitate or engage in illegal financial activities. Key Arguments from the Crypto Firms’ Letter (Based on Reporting): Prosecuting Roman Storm contradicts the DOJ’s recent indication that it won’t target developers simply for creating tools used in crime. Tornado Cash is open-source software; developers should not be liable for the actions of third-party users. The case sets a dangerous precedent for decentralized and privacy-focused development. Privacy tools are necessary for legitimate reasons in the digital age. Efforts to imprison Roman Storm should be dropped to protect innovation. What Happens Next? The Roman Storm Trial Approaches Despite the industry’s plea, the legal wheels continue to turn. Roman Storm’s trial is currently scheduled to begin in New York in July. This trial is poised to be a landmark case, potentially setting significant legal precedents regarding developer liability, the nature of decentralized protocols, and the application of anti-money laundering and sanctions laws to code. The defense is expected to argue that Storm merely contributed to open-source code and did not operate an unlicensed money transmitting business or conspire to violate sanctions. They will likely emphasize the decentralized nature of Tornado Cash and the lack of control developers had over its operation once deployed. The prosecution will likely focus on the design of Tornado Cash, its alleged use by sanctioned entities and criminals, and potentially any actions taken by the developers that could be construed as facilitating or profiting from its illicit use. The outcome of this trial will be closely watched by developers, investors, and regulators worldwide. Implications for the Future of Crypto and Privacy The outcome of the Roman Storm trial and the response (or lack thereof) to the crypto firms’ letter could have profound implications: Developer Chilling Effect: A conviction could deter developers from working on any open-source projects that could potentially be misused, even if they have legitimate purposes. Future of Privacy Tools: Increased legal risk could make it harder to develop and use tools designed to enhance financial privacy on blockchains. Regulatory Clarity (or lack thereof): The trial’s verdict and subsequent appeals will help shape the legal interpretation of decentralized protocols and developer responsibility. Industry Advocacy: The letter highlights the growing willingness of crypto firms to engage directly with policymakers and defend individuals facing legal challenges they deem unjust or harmful to the industry’s principles. This situation encapsulates the ongoing tension between the decentralized, permissionless nature of crypto technology and the desire of nation-states to maintain control over financial flows and prevent illicit activity. The crypto firms are advocating for a framework where tools can be built freely, while the responsibility for misuse falls squarely on the user, not the creator of the code. A Crucial Juncture for Decentralized Development The letter from leading crypto firms to the White House regarding the Roman Storm case is more than just a plea for one individual; it’s a forceful statement about the future direction of the industry. They are highlighting the perceived contradiction in government policy and arguing that prosecuting developers for creating open-source software poses an existential threat to the principles of decentralization and privacy that underpin much of the crypto ecosystem. As the Roman Storm trial approaches, the outcome remains uncertain. However, the industry’s unified voice in defending a developer against criminal charges signals a growing determination to push back against what they see as overreach that could stifle innovation and criminalize code. The world is watching to see how the U.S. legal system will grapple with these complex issues at the intersection of technology, finance, and individual liberty.

For those following the cryptocurrency space, understanding these shifts in core internet services like search is crucial, as they often pave the way for new digital commerce paradigms. OpenAI has announced a major ChatGPT update , enhancing its search capabilities with dedicated features for ChatGPT shopping . What’s New with OpenAI Search and Shopping? OpenAI is rolling out improvements to its web search tool within ChatGPT, specifically designed to create a better online shopping experience. When users search for products, the chatbot will now provide a more integrated and helpful response. Here’s what you can expect: Product Recommendations: ChatGPT will suggest relevant products based on your queries. Visuals and Reviews: Get images and see user reviews directly within the search results. Direct Purchase Links: Easy access to webpages where you can buy the items. This move is a direct challenge to traditional search engines, particularly Google, which heavily relies on its shopping features and advertising revenue. OpenAI aims to offer a more personalized and less cluttered way to discover products. How AI Shopping Works in ChatGPT The core idea behind this AI shopping enhancement is to allow users to use natural language to ask very specific questions about products. Instead of just providing a list of links, ChatGPT will synthesize information to offer customized results. Initially, OpenAI is experimenting with popular categories like fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics. The company states that the shopping results are determined independently, based on structured metadata from third parties, including pricing, product descriptions, and reviews. Crucially, OpenAI notes that advertising is not part of this current upgrade, and they will not receive a kickback from purchases made through OpenAI search . This positions their offering as a potentially unbiased alternative to search results influenced by ad spend, although future models might include affiliate fees. Who Gets the ChatGPT Update and When? This significant ChatGPT update is being rolled out globally today. It’s available in the default AI model, GPT-4o, for a wide range of users: ChatGPT Pro, Plus, Free, and even logged-out users. This broad accessibility underscores OpenAI’s ambition to make this feature widely adopted. Looking ahead, OpenAI plans to integrate its memory feature for Pro and Plus users. This means ChatGPT could reference your past conversations to provide highly personalized product recommendations, learning your preferences over time. However, due to regulatory considerations, these memory features will not be available to users in the EU, the U.K., Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein for shopping. Competing in the Online Shopping Arena OpenAI’s foray into ChatGPT shopping is a clear strategic move to compete with established players in the lucrative online shopping and search markets. While Google’s search product has faced criticism regarding the quality of results due to heavy advertising, OpenAI is positioning its search as a rapidly growing alternative, citing over a billion web searches made in ChatGPT in a single week recently. Beyond shopping, the update also brings other search improvements, such as displaying trending searches as users type, similar to autocomplete features found in other search engines. Furthermore, OpenAI search capabilities are now accessible via WhatsApp, allowing users to interact with the chatbot for up-to-date information on the go. Comparing ChatGPT Shopping to Previous Efforts OpenAI has explored shopping features before, notably through its AI agent platform, Operator. Operator could browse multiple webpages to find relevant products, but it was often a slower process, taking several minutes. The new ChatGPT shopping feature integrated into search offers a much faster, more direct, and hands-on experience, while still leveraging the power of natural language queries that users are accustomed to in ChatGPT. Conclusion: A New Era for Online Shopping Search? The integration of dedicated shopping features into OpenAI search marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI assistants and their role in digital commerce. By offering personalized recommendations, visual information, and direct purchase links without initial advertising influence, OpenAI is attempting to carve out a unique space in the competitive online shopping landscape. This ChatGPT update promises a more intuitive and efficient way for users to find and buy products, potentially setting a new standard for AI-powered search experiences.

33767162,[object Object],1745895641,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Trader Supply Shoots Up—Sign Of Fresh Demand?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-trader-supply-shoots-up-sign-fresh-demand/,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin balance held by the short-term holders has jumped recently. Here’s what this could mean for BTC’s price. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Supply Has Registered An Uptick In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has talked about how the different Bitcoin cohorts have seen their supply change recently. The groups in question have been divided on the basis of holding time . The analytics firm classifies the investors into these groups: ‘traders’ who purchased their coins within the past month, ‘cruisers’ who did so between one and twelve months ago, and ‘ HODLers ‘ who have been holding for more than a year. Generally, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they are to sell them in the future. Thus, the holder resolve gets stronger as one goes from the traders to the HODLers. Now, here is the chart shared by IntoTheBlock that shows the trend in the net change of the balance held by each of these groups during the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin traders have registered a positive value on this metric recently, suggesting the balance held by the group has gone up. This increase for this cohort has come as BTC has been witnessing a price rally. Whenever the supply of the traders observes a rise, it means members of one or both of the older cohorts are breaking their dormancy. Given that the latest surge has coincided with an uplift in the asset’s price, it’s possible that it’s an indication of profit-taking in the market. From the chart, it’s visible that the HODLers have also seen a positive change recently, implying these diamond hands are continuing to hold tight. This leaves the cruisers as the only group that can be responsible for the selling, and indeed, the negative balance change would confirm so. The cruisers are more resolute than the traders, but even they can be prone to panic selling as they haven’t quite achieved the same stalwartness as the HODLers, so the latest distribution from them may not be too surprising. While the profit-taking may not be a positive sign for Bitcoin, the increase in the trader supply could be looked at from a more bullish perspective: it could imply there is fresh demand flowing into the sector. This was seemingly the case back during the rally that occurred in the last couple of months of 2024, where the trader supply change spiked high into the positive territory. “If this influx persists, it supports the view that the current move is more than a relief rally and could be the opening leg of a broader uptrend,” notes the analytics firm. BTC Price Bitcoin saw a pullback below $93,000 yesterday, but it appears the coin has regained bullish momentum as its price has now surged to $95,200.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin demand|Bitcoin Short-Term Holder|bitcoin traders|btc|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-04-29 03:00:41

However, the leading cryptocurrency now faces a critical resistance level that could determine its near-term price trajectory. What Do On-Chain Metrics Indicate? In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, on-chain analyst BorisVest noted that BTC has entered a stagnation phase as short-term holders have begun realizing profits. The contributor warned that if this ongoing profit-taking is not fully absorbed, it could trigger a fresh wave of selling. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Clear This Critical Cost Basis Level For Continued Upside, Analyst Says BorisVest also highlighted that BTC exchange reserves – which had been depleting at a significant rate until last week – are now starting to stabilize. As a result, enhanced selling pressure could emerge for the apex cryptocurrency. The analyst added that both BTC inflows and outflows on crypto exchanges are currently balanced, suggesting a neutral market state. Moreover, while short-term holders were previously selling at a loss, they have now entered profitable territory. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has risen to 1.04, indicating that investors who bought BTC at recent lows – possibly around $76,000 earlier this month – are now cashing out. For those unfamiliar, SOPR measures the profit or loss of Bitcoin transactions by comparing the price at which coins were originally acquired to the price at which they are now spent. A SOPR value above 1 signals that holders are selling at a profit, while a value below 1 indicates they are selling at a loss. Additionally, the current SOPR metric reveals increased selling activity with rising prices, suggesting that BTC whales and institutional investors are likely taking profits. The Net Realized Profit and Loss (NRPL) metric supports this view, having sharply rebounded from about $2 billion in realized losses to $3 billion in realized gains. Bitcoin Faces Critical Resistance – Can BTC Continue Its Rally? According to the post, Bitcoin now faces significant resistance at $96,000. If BTC manages to break through this level with strong volume and momentum, it could turn this resistance into a new support base and continue its rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following Gold’s Footsteps? Analyst Sets Mid-Term Target At $155,000 Conversely, a failure to decisively break through $96,000 could stall Bitcoin’s rally and potentially trigger a price pullback toward the $80,000 range. Therefore, monitoring BTC’s price behavior around this critical resistance level will be crucial. That said, Bitcoin’s apparent demand has recently shown a sharp momentum shift, reigniting hopes for a sustained rally that could lead to a new all-time high. At press time, BTC is trading at $93,972, up 0.3% over the past 24 hours.
