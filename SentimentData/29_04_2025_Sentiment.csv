One such exciting development is the integration of Bitcoin into the proof-of-stake ecosystem through networks like Babylon. While this opens up new opportunities for earning yield on your Bitcoin, it also introduces potential risks, most notably ‘slashing’. But what if you could stake your Bitcoin on Babylon with a crucial layer of safety? That’s where Nexus Mutual steps in, developing a specialized protection product designed specifically for Babylon staking . Understanding Babylon Staking and the Risk of Slashing Before diving into the protection, let’s clarify what we’re talking about. Babylon is a project focused on bringing Bitcoin’s robust security to proof-of-stake (PoS) chains. It allows Bitcoin holders to stake their BTC, contributing to the security of PoS networks and earning yield in return. This process, known as Bitcoin staking , is a significant step towards enhancing the utility of the world’s largest cryptocurrency. However, participating in proof-of-stake comes with a built-in mechanism to punish validators (and sometimes delegators) for misbehavior, such as going offline (downtime) or signing conflicting blocks (double-signing). This punishment is called ‘slashing’, where a portion of the staked assets is confiscated by the network. Slashing is a necessary evil in PoS design – it incentivizes good behavior and network integrity – but it represents a significant financial risk for anyone participating in staking, whether they are running a validator node or simply delegating their stake. For Babylon staking participants, this risk is particularly relevant. As Bitcoin is the asset being staked, a slashing event could lead to a direct loss of valuable BTC. This potential downside can be a major deterrent, especially for larger holders or institutions considering participating in the Babylon network. Enter Nexus Mutual: A Pioneer in Crypto Insurance This is where Nexus Mutual, a decentralized crypto insurance protocol, plays a vital role. Unlike traditional insurance companies, Nexus Mutual is a member-owned mutual where risks are shared among the community. Members buy cover to protect against specific smart contract risks, exchange hacks, or other defined events in the crypto space. The mutual is governed by its members, and claims are assessed by members, creating a transparent and community-driven risk-sharing pool. Nexus Mutual has been a leader in providing coverage for various risks within decentralized finance (DeFi) since its inception. Their expertise lies in understanding the unique technical and economic risks associated with blockchain protocols and creating products to mitigate them. Developing protection against slashing is a natural extension of their mission to provide essential safety nets for participants in the digital asset ecosystem. How Nexus Mutual’s Slashing Protection Works for Babylon Stakers According to reports, Nexus Mutual is actively developing a tailored slashing protection product specifically for Babylon’s proof-of-stake system. This product is being built with advisory support from Babylon Labs, the core team behind the Babylon network. This collaboration is crucial, as it ensures the protection product is designed with an in-depth understanding of Babylon’s specific slashing conditions and mechanisms. The core idea is straightforward: stakers on Babylon can purchase cover from Nexus Mutual. If a covered slashing event occurs – meaning the staker loses some of their staked Bitcoin due to a penalty defined in the cover policy – they can submit a claim to Nexus Mutual. If the claim is approved by the mutual’s members, the staker receives compensation in cryptocurrency, covering the loss incurred from the slashing penalty, up to the amount of cover purchased. The product aims to offer flexible and tailored coverage options. This is important because the needs of an individual delegating a small amount of Bitcoin differ significantly from those of a large institution running multiple validator nodes with substantial capital staked. Tailored options could include varying levels of coverage, different durations, and specific definitions of covered slashing events. What Specific Risks Does Slashing Protection Cover? While the exact details of Nexus Mutual’s Babylon product will be outlined in their policy wording, typical slashing protection covers events like: Double-Signing: When a validator node signs two different blocks at the same height, indicating malicious intent or a severe configuration error. Downtime/Inactivity: While often resulting in less severe penalties than double-signing, prolonged validator downtime can also lead to gradual slashing of staked funds. Other Protocol-Specific Penalties: Depending on Babylon’s specific rules, there might be other actions or inactions that trigger slashing, which the cover would aim to include. It’s crucial for stakers to read the specific policy details provided by Nexus Mutual to understand exactly which events are covered and any exclusions that may apply. Who Benefits? Individual vs. Institutional Stakers The development of this slashing protection product is a significant win for both types of participants in the Babylon ecosystem: Benefits for Individual Stakers: Reduced Anxiety: Staking can be nerve-wracking due to the risk of losing funds. Protection provides peace of mind. Encourages Participation: Lowering the risk barrier makes staking more accessible and appealing to a broader range of individual Bitcoin holders. Predictable Outcomes: While slashing is unpredictable, having insurance makes the financial outcome of such an event predictable – you’re covered. Benefits for Institutional Stakers: Risk Management: Institutions require robust risk management frameworks. Slashing protection is an essential tool for mitigating operational and protocol-level risks associated with staking. Capital Protection: Protecting large pools of staked capital from potentially significant slashing penalties is critical for preserving asset value. Compliance and Reporting: Having insurance can simplify compliance requirements and financial reporting by providing a clear strategy for addressing staking risks. Scalability: With protection in place, institutions can potentially scale their Babylon staking operations with greater confidence. The fact that Nexus Mutual is designing coverage specifically for both demographics highlights the anticipated broad appeal and importance of the Babylon network and the recognized need for robust crypto insurance solutions within it. Why Slashing Protection is Crucial for Bitcoin Staking Growth The ability to stake Bitcoin is a major step forward for the cryptocurrency space, unlocking new potential for yield and participation. However, integrating Bitcoin into PoS systems introduces new risks that aren’t present when simply holding BTC. Slashing is arguably the most significant of these risks from a financial perspective. For Bitcoin staking to achieve widespread adoption, especially among risk-averse individuals and institutions, mitigating this core risk is paramount. A reliable slashing protection product from a reputable provider like Nexus Mutual removes a major hurdle. It transforms staking from a potentially high-risk, high-reward activity into one where the downside risk is significantly limited, making the yield more attractive on a risk-adjusted basis. This development is not just important for Babylon, but it sets a precedent for other future projects that might seek to utilize Bitcoin’s security or allow BTC staking. It underscores the growing maturity of the crypto market, where infrastructure for risk management, like crypto insurance , is catching up with innovation in yield generation and cross-chain interoperability. Navigating the Nuances: Challenges and Considerations While highly beneficial, implementing and utilizing slashing protection isn’t without its nuances. Challenges and considerations include: Cost of Cover: Like any insurance, this protection will come at a cost (premiums), which needs to be weighed against the potential staking yield and the perceived risk of slashing. Policy Wording: Understanding the exact terms, conditions, and exclusions of the cover is vital. Not all slashing events might be covered under every policy. Claim Assessment Process: While Nexus Mutual has a proven claims process, it still requires member assessment, which takes time. Dynamic Risk: The risk profile of staking can change based on network conditions, validator performance, and protocol upgrades. Potential stakers should perform their own due diligence on both the Babylon network and the Nexus Mutual cover product before committing funds. Actionable Insights for Potential Babylon Stakers If you’re considering participating in Babylon staking , here are some actionable steps: Research Babylon: Understand how the network works, its consensus mechanism, and its specific slashing conditions. Evaluate the Risk: Assess your personal risk tolerance and the potential financial impact of a slashing event on your staked capital. Monitor Nexus Mutual’s Launch: Keep an eye on announcements from Nexus Mutual regarding the official launch and availability of the Babylon slashing protection product. Review Policy Details Carefully: Once available, read the cover policy wording thoroughly to understand what is covered, what isn’t, the cost, and the claims process. Compare Costs vs. Benefits: Determine if the cost of the cover is a worthwhile expense given the potential yield and the mitigation of slashing risk. Choose Your Validator Wisely (if delegating): While cover helps, delegating to a reputable and reliable validator significantly reduces the likelihood of slashing in the first place. Taking these steps will help you make an informed decision about participating in Bitcoin staking on Babylon with the added layer of slashing protection . Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin Staking Security The collaboration between Nexus Mutual and Babylon Labs to bring dedicated slashing protection to the Babylon network marks a significant milestone. It addresses one of the most prominent risks associated with proof-of-stake participation, particularly crucial for a network that allows staking of the most valuable digital asset, Bitcoin. By offering tailored crypto insurance options for both individuals and institutions, Nexus Mutual is not only providing a valuable service but also contributing to the overall maturity and de-risking of the crypto ecosystem. This development is poised to boost confidence and potentially drive greater participation in Babylon staking , unlocking new utility for Bitcoin holders and strengthening the security of integrated PoS chains. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the availability of robust risk management tools like specialized insurance will be key to fostering broader adoption and innovation.

SHIB battles resistance near $0.0000145 as bullish momentum faces critical test. Longer-term SHIB forecasts predict over 100% upside if market stability returns. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is facing fresh selling pressure after hackers offloaded an enormous amount of tokens. Blockchain security firm PeckShield reported that the Bitrue Exploiters, linked to a 2023 breach, exchanged 150 billion SHIB and 756 million Holochain (HOT) tokens. In return, they acquired approximately 1,500 Ethereum (ETH). A major portion of these funds, particularly 1,050 ETH, has already been laundered through TornadoCash, significantly complicating the transaction trail. Consequently, fears are rising that SHIB’s market stability could suffer further as the hackers still hold around 5,111 ETH and 16 million DAI, with a combined value nearing $25.5 million. Given the vast number of SHIB tokens involved, investors are bracing for potential heavy selling pressure that could push SHIB into a more volatile and bearish territory. #PeckShieldAlert #Bitrue Exploiter-labeled addresses have swapped 150B $SHIB… The post SHIB’s Recovery Rally Now Faces Critical Test as Hackers Offload Millions in Tokens appeared first on Coin Edition .",Altcoin News|CoinMarketCap Feed|Market|Market News|News|Price Analysis|Top Crypto News|Shiba Inu (SHIB),EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-04-28 22:30:00

As the Heikin Ashi monthly candle flashes bearish signals, the analyst shares the ideal time to buy Bitcoin, warning investors of potential bear market traps. Upper Bollinger Band Reveal Time To Buy Bitcoin Severino has provided an in-depth examination of the Bitcoin market, identifying precise conditions under which investors and traders, including himself, might consider re-entering based on key market indicators and price action. The analyst broke down a Bitcoin price chart featuring monthly candlesticks, Bollinger Bands, and historical comparisons. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: The Last Leg-Up That Confirms A Resounding Rally To $150,000 The chart highlights that in late 2021, after hitting its previous ATH, Bitcoin touched the Upper Bollinger Band but failed to close above it. At the time, this move was perceived as a classic non-confirmation, which ultimately led to a sharp reversal and brutal bear market in 2022. Fast forward to today, Bitcoin is hovering above $94,000, with the Upper Bollinger Band positioned at $108,000. According to Severino, merely reaching this Upper Bollinger Band level, as it did in 2021, is not enough reason to buy Bitcoin in anticipation of a price increase. Instead, the analyst asserts that a full monthly close above $108,000 is needed to confirm a breakout and continuation of the bullish trend. The analyst also disclosed that he would consider buying Bitcoin once it closes sufficiently above this level. However, if the flagship cryptocurrency fails to close above the Upper Bollinger Band for a month, it could mirror the 2021 double top and fake breakout, potentially leading to another steep bear market this cycle. Overall, Severino advises investors to closely watch Bitcoin’s price action around this key Bollinger Band. He stresses that capital preservation far outweighs succumbing to the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO). With elevated risks and rising volatility, the analyst believes that clear confirmation signals are the only way to engage with the market safely. BTC’s Heikin Ashi Candle Flips Bearish While Severino confirms the ideal time to buy BTC, the analyst also announced that the Bitcoin Heikin Ashi candles have turned bearish. The analyst shared a 12-week Heikin Ashi candlestick chart, which shows Bitcoin flashing early warning signs of a potential bear market. Related Reading: Analyst’s Bitcoin Price Prediction From March Plays Out, Here’s The Rest Of It The chart highlights a critical moment where Bitcoin’s Heikin Ashi candle turned red for the first time since its previous price peaks in 2014, 2018, and 2022. Historically, such a signal has marked the beginning of prolonged bear markets and deep price corrections. Further strengthening the bearish outlook, Severino pointed out that the Fisher Transform, a technical indicator used to detect trend reversals, is exhibiting a bearish crossover, with the green Fisher line dropping below the red Trigger line. In previous cycles, whenever these two signals — the Heikin Ashi and Fisher Transform — aligned, Bitcoin experienced substantial declines that lasted for months, if not years.

43919825,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153443,1745879439,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Pakistan Crypto Council Strikes Revolutionary MOU with Trump-Linked WLFI,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pakistan-crypto-council-mou/,"Big news recently surfaced from the intersection of decentralized finance and international crypto development. World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi Project that has garnered attention due to its association with the Trump family, announced a significant step via their X account. They’ve signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Pakistan Crypto Council . This agreement is being framed as a major move aimed at accelerating Crypto Innovation through collaboration with key leaders in Pakistan’s burgeoning crypto space. What Exactly is This WLFI and Pakistan Crypto Council Agreement? Let’s break down the core announcement. At its heart, we have two entities coming together with a stated goal of fostering crypto growth. WLFI, positioned as a DeFi Project , operates within the decentralized finance ecosystem, typically involving blockchain-based financial applications without traditional intermediaries. The Pakistan Crypto Council , on the other hand, represents a collective effort within Pakistan to engage with, promote, and perhaps help shape the landscape for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology in the country. The signing of an MOU is essentially a declaration of mutual intent. It’s not a legally binding contract for specific actions or investments, but rather a formal expression of willingness to collaborate on certain objectives. In this case, the objective is clear: driving Crypto Innovation in Pakistan. This suggests potential future cooperation on initiatives like: Exploring the implementation of DeFi solutions in the Pakistani market. Sharing knowledge and expertise on blockchain technology. Potentially working towards creating a more favorable environment for crypto adoption. Identifying specific use cases for decentralized finance within Pakistan’s economy. For the Pakistan Crypto Council , partnering with an international project, especially one with some public profile, could be seen as a way to gain global exposure and potentially attract technology and investment. For WLFI, it represents an opportunity to explore expansion into an emerging market with significant potential for crypto adoption. Decoding the ‘Trump-Linked’ Aspect of the WLFI Project The mention of WLFI being ‘associated with the Trump family’ immediately adds a layer of complexity and intrigue to this development. While the exact nature of this association isn’t detailed in the announcement, such connections can significantly impact a project’s visibility and perception, both positively and negatively, depending on one’s political stance and view of Trump Crypto endeavors. Donald Trump’s relationship with the crypto space has evolved. Initially skeptical, he later launched successful NFT collections, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to leveraging digital assets for commercial purposes. Projects or ventures linked to prominent political figures often attract increased scrutiny, media attention, and can sometimes face unique challenges or opportunities related to regulatory environments and public opinion. For a DeFi Project like WLFI, having an association with a globally recognized name could theoretically provide a platform for broader reach. However, it also ties the project’s narrative, to some extent, to political dynamics, which are inherently unpredictable. When considering the Pakistan Crypto Council ‘s perspective, engaging with a project with such a link might be viewed through different lenses internally and externally, potentially influencing the partnership’s trajectory. Why is the Pakistan Crypto Council Focusing on DeFi Innovation? Pakistan represents a dynamic and rapidly evolving market for digital technologies. With a large, young population and increasing internet penetration, the potential for crypto adoption, particularly in areas like remittances and financial inclusion, is substantial. The Pakistan Crypto Council ‘s mandate likely includes exploring avenues to harness this potential while navigating the complex regulatory landscape. Focusing on Crypto Innovation , specifically within DeFi, makes strategic sense for several reasons: Financial Inclusion: DeFi can offer alternative financial services to underbanked populations. Remittances: Pakistan is a major recipient of remittances, and crypto/DeFi could offer faster, cheaper transfer methods. Technological Advancement: Embracing DeFi can position Pakistan as a forward-thinking nation in the digital economy. Attracting Talent & Investment: Demonstrating a commitment to innovation can draw in skilled professionals and foreign investment. Partnering with a DeFi Project like WLFI could provide the Council with direct insights into the latest decentralized technologies and use cases being developed globally. This knowledge exchange is crucial for building a robust local crypto ecosystem. Potential Benefits and Challenges of This Partnership Any cross-border partnership, especially in the fast-paced and often uncertain world of crypto, comes with its own set of potential upsides and hurdles. The agreement between WLFI and the Pakistan Crypto Council is no exception. Potential Benefits: Accelerated Learning: The Council gains access to WLFI’s technical expertise in DeFi, potentially accelerating their understanding and application of these technologies. Market Insights: WLFI gets valuable insights into the Pakistani market, its specific needs, and regulatory nuances from the Council. Pilot Programs: The MOU could pave the way for collaborative pilot projects demonstrating the practical application of DeFi in Pakistan. Increased Profile: Both entities could see their profiles raised within their respective spheres and internationally through this partnership. Driving Local Innovation: The collaboration could stimulate local development of crypto and blockchain solutions tailored to Pakistan’s needs. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory environment for crypto in Pakistan is still evolving, which could pose significant challenges to implementing new DeFi solutions. MOU is Non-Binding: As an MOU, the agreement is a statement of intent, not a guarantee of specific outcomes or projects. Execution depends entirely on continued willingness and effort from both sides. Political Sensitivities: The ‘Trump-linked’ nature of WLFI could introduce political considerations or public perception issues that might complicate the partnership. Infrastructure Gaps: Implementing advanced DeFi solutions might face limitations depending on the digital infrastructure available in various parts of Pakistan. Market Volatility & Adoption Hurdles: The inherent volatility of the crypto market and potential user adoption challenges in a new market remain significant factors. Navigating these challenges will require careful planning, clear communication, and a deep understanding of both the technological possibilities and the local context. Keeping an Eye on WLFI and Pakistan Crypto Council Developments For anyone interested in the future of crypto in emerging markets, or the impact of high-profile associations on crypto projects, this partnership is one to watch. While the MOU is just the first step, it signals an intention to collaborate on fostering Crypto Innovation in a country with significant potential. What should we look out for next? Keep an eye on official announcements from both WLFI and the Pakistan Crypto Council . Will they announce specific joint initiatives or pilot projects? How will the regulatory landscape in Pakistan evolve, and how might that impact potential DeFi implementations? The success of this collaboration will ultimately depend on concrete actions taken following the MOU and their ability to navigate the inherent complexities of the crypto space and the local market. This development highlights the ongoing global effort to explore and implement blockchain and DeFi technologies, reaching into diverse markets and sometimes involving unexpected connections. Summary In summary, the DeFi Project WLFI, known for its association with the Trump family, has signed an MOU with the Pakistan Crypto Council . This agreement aims to drive Crypto Innovation in Pakistan through collaboration. While the ‘ Trump Crypto ‘ link adds a unique dimension, the core of the partnership lies in exploring how decentralized finance can contribute to Pakistan’s digital economy. The path forward involves potential benefits like knowledge sharing and pilot programs, but also challenges related to regulation, execution, and political sensitivities. As an initial step, this MOU sets the stage for potential future developments in Pakistan’s crypto landscape, which market observers will be watching closely.

43920106,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153450,1745880034,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Android Updates Headline Dedicated Virtual Event Before Google I/O’s AI Focus,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/android-updates-virtual-event/,"The tech world is buzzing with news from Google, and while our focus is often on how these shifts impact the broader digital landscape, including cryptocurrencies and decentralized tech, understanding the moves of major players like Google is crucial. A recent announcement signals a notable change in how Google will present information about its mobile operating system. News specifically concerning Android updates will now take a different path ahead of the company’s major annual gathering. Android Updates Get a Dedicated Virtual Stage Google has decided to move a significant portion of its announcements regarding the latest developments in the Android ecosystem to a separate virtual event. This event, titled “The Android Show: I/O Edition,” is scheduled to air virtually on May 13. This means that enthusiasts and developers eager to hear about the newest features and changes coming to Android will tune into this online presentation before the main developer conference begins. While Android will still have a presence during the main event through keynotes and technical sessions aimed at developers, the bulk of the major announcements appears to be happening during this dedicated virtual show. This represents a shift from previous years where significant Android news was often a central part of the main Google I/O keynote. The Lead-Up to Google I/O : A Strategic Shift? The decision to pre-empt the main conference with a dedicated Android event has led to speculation about the focus of this year’s Google I/O . Historically, the Google I/O developer conference has been the primary venue for showcasing major updates across Google’s software, hardware, and platforms, with Android often taking a prominent role. Moving core Android news suggests that the main Google I/O keynote might be heavily weighted towards other areas. While Google states this is due to the sheer volume of new Android information, many observers believe it points to another dominant theme taking center stage at the main event. What to Expect for AI at Google I/O Given the industry-wide focus and Google’s significant investments in artificial intelligence, the prevailing expectation is that AI at Google I/O will command an even larger share of the spotlight this year. AI news and updates have been increasingly integrated into the Google I/O keynotes in recent years, reflecting the technology’s growing importance across all of Google’s products and services. With Android updates moved to a separate virtual event, it clears more time and space during the main conference for deep dives into Google’s latest AI advancements, models, applications, and developer tools. Attendees and viewers are likely to see a strong emphasis on how AI is being integrated into Google Search, Cloud, Workspace, and potentially new hardware or research initiatives. Navigating the Google Developer Conference Format Understanding the format of the Google Developer Conference this year requires noting the addition of this significant pre-conference virtual show. The main Google I/O event will still feature keynotes and technical sessions designed for developers across various Google platforms, including Android. However, the structure indicates a potential prioritization of topics during the main keynote. Developers interested specifically in the foundational ‘what’s new’ for Android should likely tune into the virtual event on May 13, while those interested in the broader Google ecosystem, particularly AI and cross-platform integrations, will focus on the main Google I/O dates. The Growing Trend of the Virtual Tech Event Google’s move also highlights the continued evolution of how major tech companies disseminate news and engage with their communities. The dedicated virtual event for Android updates is an example of the growing trend of the Virtual tech event . These online formats allow companies to reach a global audience more easily and can be tailored to specific topics or audiences. While the return to in-person elements for developer conferences is happening, companies are retaining virtual components to deliver targeted information. This split approach—a focused virtual show for a specific platform like Android, followed by a broader, potentially AI-centric main event—might become a more common model for large-scale tech announcements. Conclusion Google’s decision to host a dedicated virtual event for Android updates before the main Google I/O conference is a significant programming change. While framed by Google as a necessity due to the volume of Android news, it strongly suggests that artificial intelligence will be the dominant theme at this year’s main developer gathering.

This follows an announcement made on April 23, which detailed the plans for an exclusive dinner for the top 220 holders of the meme coin. Top 25 TRUMP holders promised more than just dinner According to the Kaiko report , part of the plans included a meet-and-greet session with the President for the top 25 holders. “On Wednesday, April 23, the team behind the official TRUMP meme coin announced plans for an exclusive dinner for the top 220 holders, with the top 25 receiving a meet-and-greet with the sitting president,” noted Kaiko. In their report, the research firm added that this announcement triggered a 200% surge in on-chain activity for TRUMP, amounting to $2.4 billion worth of on-chain transfers, as nearly 10,000 wallets transferred the token. According to Kaiko, TRUMP jumped 60% on the announcement day from $9 to $14.50, adding that it marked the busiest day of the month for the token as well as “its highest trading volume on centralized exchanges since mid-February.” Following the dinner announcement, TRUMP overshadowed all other meme coins, including DOGE, and accounted for almost 50% of all meme coin trading volume on centralized exchanges last Wednesday. Kaiko also noted that there was a spike in the share of smaller wallets that transferred smaller amounts of TRUMP tokens on the Solana blockchain. “Typically, around 46% of active wallets transfer less than $10k worth of TRUMP, but this jumped to 75% following the announcement. Most of this surge came from very small transfers (under $1k), which alone made up 47.2% of active wallets.” Kaiko. The research firm has also pointed out that while Trump is challenging the narrative that meme coins are not valuable, the initiative has not been without controversy. Critics see controversy with the initiative Critics, including Trump’s political rivals as well as ethics advocates, have closely examined the move by the President and expressed concerns that he is rewarding those who buy his meme coin. Senator Jon Ossoff has called for President Trump’s impeachment over the dinner event. Ossoff condemned the plan as unethical and dangerous, saying it blurs the line between politics, personal gain, and public trust. Adding another perspective to the story, some experts noted some suspicious on-chain movements. The next day, after the announcement, a user identified as “Sun” seemed to be registering for the upcoming event, according to Arkham Intelligence. The movements seemed to raise suspicion that the addresses could be directed to Justin Sun, who is the Tron founder and has been a strong supporter of Trump. In November, Sun announced that Tron had invested $30 million in World Liberty Financial, a Trump-linked DeFi project. Thereafter, World Liberty Financial named Sun as its advisor. Citing Chainalysis , The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the meme coin had “generated hundreds of millions worth of cryptocurrency profits for entities affiliated with Trump.” Although volumes have shrunk in the wake of the announcement, Kaiko is upbeat about another wave of intense market action around the corner. “Volumes have since tapered off as the euphoria waned, similar to onchain activity. However, based on the website’s rules for the competition, we can expect to see more activity in the coming weeks.” Kaiko. “The rules stipulate that the top 220 average TRUMP holders between April 23 and May 12 will be eligible for the dinner. Increased activity is likely as the deadline approaches and holders move funds back on-chain to qualify for the event,” added the research firm.

The new card is backed by Mastercard and is being developed in partnership with CompoSecure and Baanx, according to the company. The product uses smart contracts to execute the IRL (In Real Life) transactions, with a processing speed under five seconds. It operates on the Linea network, a layer-2 scaling solution on Ethereum. The companies marketed the self-custodied crypto card as an alternative to the potential risks associated with centralized exchanges. In February, the second-largest crypto exchange by volume, Bybit, was hacked for $1.4 billion , an event that sparked widespread consternation in the crypto space. With the launch of its card, MetaMask is entering a competitive segment of the cryptocurrency market. Major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, Coinbase, and Crypto.com already offer crypto debit cards, some of which feature ""crypto-back"" rewards that allow users to earn digital assets on their purchases. MetaMask has struggled lately as interest in and participation in the Ethereum ecosystem have dried up. According to Dune Analytics, the wallet collected just $289,312 in fees for the week of April 14, much less than the $1.3 million in fees collected for the same period a year ago.

43920392,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153451,1745880631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unlock Dual Rewards: Lombard Integrates LBTC with EigenLayer,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lombard-eigenlayer-integration/,"The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with digital assets. A significant development recently emerged from the world of restaking, bridging the gap between the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. Bitcoin restaking platform Lombard has announced a pivotal integration, bringing its wrapped Bitcoin asset, LBTC, into the burgeoning EigenLayer ecosystem. This move, undertaken in collaboration with the EigenLayer Foundation, is set to create exciting new opportunities for users. What Does the Lombard EigenLayer Integration Mean? At its core, the integration signifies a major step towards enhanced interoperability and capital efficiency within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. By integrating LBTC into EigenLayer, Lombard is essentially allowing Bitcoin holders, via their wrapped LBTC, to participate directly in the Ethereum restaking ecosystem facilitated by EigenLayer. This isn’t just a simple bridge; it’s about enabling a new layer of utility for Bitcoin capital. The key takeaway from this integration, as reported by The Block, is the potential for users to receive dual restaking rewards. Specifically, users holding LBTC and participating through this integration can earn rewards concurrently from both the Babylon protocol (a prominent player in Bitcoin restaking) and the EigenLayer ecosystem (a leading force in Ethereum restaking). Understanding Bitcoin Restaking with Babylon Before diving deeper into the dual rewards, it’s helpful to understand the components involved. Bitcoin restaking, as pioneered by protocols like Babylon, allows Bitcoin holders to repurpose their idle BTC capital to secure other decentralized networks or protocols. Traditionally, Bitcoin’s primary utility outside of being a store of value and medium of exchange has been limited to its own blockchain. Babylon’s approach enables Bitcoin holders to ‘stake’ their BTC in a way that provides security services to various proof-of-stake (PoS) systems. This mechanism leverages Bitcoin’s immense security and liquidity, extending it to other parts of the crypto ecosystem. Users who stake their Bitcoin through Babylon earn rewards for contributing to the security and consensus of these external networks. Exploring EigenLayer and Ethereum Restaking On the other side of this integration is EigenLayer, a protocol built on Ethereum that introduces the concept of ‘restaking’. Ethereum restaking allows users who have already staked their ETH (or Liquid Staking Tokens – LSTs) on the Ethereum Beacon Chain to restake that same capital to simultaneously secure other decentralized applications, services, or middleware, known as Actively Validated Services (AVSs). These AVSs might include decentralized oracles, bridges, data availability layers, or new virtual machines. EigenLayer provides a marketplace where AVSs can lease security from Ethereum stakers, and stakers can earn additional yield for providing this security. This significantly increases the capital efficiency for Ethereum stakers, allowing their staked ETH to work harder by securing multiple protocols simultaneously. How Does LBTC Bridge Bitcoin and EigenLayer Restaking? The integration of LBTC into EigenLayer creates a novel pathway. LBTC, being a wrapped representation of Bitcoin on a compatible network (often an Ethereum-compatible chain or a sidechain/layer-2 connected to Ethereum), can now interact with the EigenLayer smart contracts and infrastructure. This allows the value represented by LBTC to be ‘restaked’ within the EigenLayer ecosystem. Here’s a simplified breakdown: A user holds Bitcoin (BTC). The user wraps their BTC into LBTC using the Lombard platform. The user then utilizes the integration pathway to restake their LBTC through EigenLayer. Simultaneously, because Lombard’s platform facilitates interaction with protocols like Babylon, the underlying mechanism allows the user to also be eligible for rewards from Babylon’s Bitcoin restaking activities. This creates the unique scenario where the same underlying capital (originally Bitcoin, now represented as LBTC) is generating yield from two distinct restaking protocols operating on different blockchain paradigms (Babylon for Bitcoin restaking and EigenLayer for Ethereum-centric restaking). What are the Benefits for Users Participating in LBTC EigenLayer Restaking? The primary attraction of this integration is the potential for enhanced yield. By earning rewards from both Babylon and EigenLayer, users can potentially achieve a higher overall return on their Bitcoin capital compared to participating in only one form of restaking. Key benefits include: Dual Yield Generation: The ability to earn rewards from two separate, prominent restaking protocols simultaneously. Increased Capital Efficiency: Making idle Bitcoin capital work harder by securing multiple networks or services. Access to Ethereum Ecosystem Yields for Bitcoin Holders: Traditionally, earning yield within the Ethereum ecosystem required holding ETH or other Ethereum-based assets. This integration opens up new yield-earning avenues for Bitcoin holders using LBTC. Diversification of Restaking Exposure: Gaining exposure to both Bitcoin-native and Ethereum-centric restaking opportunities. Contribution to Ecosystem Security: Participating helps secure both the networks/protocols leveraging Babylon’s security and the AVSs building on EigenLayer. Are There Challenges or Considerations? While the potential rewards are appealing, it’s important to consider the complexities and risks inherent in such cross-chain and layered protocols: Protocol Risk: Both Lombard, Babylon, and EigenLayer are complex protocols. Smart contract bugs, design flaws, or exploits in any of these could lead to loss of funds. Slashing Risk: Restaking often involves slashing conditions, where staked or restaked assets can be partially or fully confiscated if the validator or participant acts maliciously or fails to perform their duties. Users must understand the specific slashing risks associated with both Babylon and EigenLayer. Wrapped Asset Risk: LBTC relies on the security and integrity of the wrapping mechanism provided by Lombard. Risks associated with the custody or pegging of the wrapped asset to the underlying Bitcoin exist. Yield Volatility: Restaking rewards can be variable and are subject to market conditions, the demand from AVSs on EigenLayer, and the protocols leveraging Babylon’s security. Complexity: Understanding the mechanics of wrapping, Bitcoin restaking, Ethereum restaking, and how they interact requires a certain level of technical understanding. Users should conduct thorough research and understand these risks before participating. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Ethereum Restaking? The Lombard and EigenLayer integration is a powerful example of the ongoing trend towards greater interoperability and capital efficiency in crypto. It demonstrates how the security and liquidity of Bitcoin can be leveraged to benefit ecosystems built on other chains, like Ethereum. This development could pave the way for more similar integrations, expanding the opportunities for Bitcoin holders to participate in various DeFi and restaking activities across different networks. It also highlights the growing maturity of the restaking landscape, with protocols finding innovative ways to stack utility and yield. Conclusion: Unlocking New Frontiers The integration of Lombard’s LBTC with EigenLayer marks a significant milestone, particularly for participants interested in Bitcoin restaking and Ethereum restaking. By enabling users to potentially earn dual rewards from both Babylon and EigenLayer, it unlocks new levels of capital efficiency and yield generation for Bitcoin holders. While the complexities and risks should not be overlooked, this development showcases the innovative potential at the intersection of Bitcoin and Ethereum, pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance and cross-chain collaboration.

43920735,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153452,1745881227,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Clarity on ProShares XRP ETF Launch Date,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/proshares-xrp-etf-launch-2/,"The world of cryptocurrency investing is constantly buzzing with anticipation, especially when it comes to the prospect of new investment vehicles like Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Recently, rumors circulated suggesting that ProShares, a major player in the ETF space, was set to launch a ProShares XRP ETF on April 30th. This specific date sparked considerable interest and speculation across the crypto community, eager for more regulated ways to gain exposure to XRP. Debunking the April 30th ProShares XRP ETF Launch Rumor Amidst the swirling rumors about a potential April 30th launch date for a ProShares XRP ETF, a key voice in the ETF analysis space stepped forward to provide clarity. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to address the speculation directly. His message was clear and concise: ProShares is not launching an XRP ETF on that specific date. This clarification served to temper expectations and correct misinformation that had begun to spread. Seyffart’s statement highlighted the fact that while there is indeed anticipation surrounding the potential launch of an XRP-focused ETF by issuers like ProShares, no official launch date has been confirmed by the company or regulatory bodies. The rumor likely stemmed from general excitement and perhaps misinterpretation of regulatory filings or market discussions. It’s a reminder that in the fast-paced crypto and ETF markets, relying on official announcements and reputable sources is paramount. Understanding the World of Cryptocurrency ETF Before diving deeper into the specifics of an XRP ETF, it’s helpful to understand what a Cryptocurrency ETF is and why it’s such a significant development for the market. An ETF is an investment fund that holds assets like stocks, commodities, or in this case, cryptocurrencies, and is traded on stock exchanges like regular stocks. For investors, Cryptocurrency ETFs offer several potential benefits: Accessibility: They allow investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies through traditional brokerage accounts, bypassing the need to set up separate crypto exchange accounts or manage private keys. Regulation: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of investor protection and oversight not always present with direct crypto ownership. Ease of Trading: They can be bought and sold throughout the trading day at market prices, similar to stocks. Diversification (potentially): While an XRP ETF would focus on a single asset, broader crypto ETFs could offer exposure to a basket of digital currencies. The approval and launch of Cryptocurrency ETFs, particularly in the United States, are often seen as milestones for the industry, signaling increasing mainstream acceptance and institutional participation. The Path to a ProShares XRP ETF: More Complex Than Others? While the US has seen the launch of Bitcoin Futures ETFs (including one from ProShares) and, more recently, spot Bitcoin ETFs, the path for an XRP ETF is notably more complex. The primary hurdle is the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs, the company associated with XRP. The SEC alleges that XRP is an unregistered security, a classification that Ripple disputes. This legal uncertainty creates significant regulatory ambiguity around XRP. The SEC has been hesitant to approve investment products, like ETFs, for assets whose regulatory status is unclear or contested. Until there is definitive regulatory clarity on whether XRP is considered a security or a commodity (like Bitcoin and Ethereum), the prospect of a spot XRP ETF gaining SEC approval remains challenging. Compare this to Bitcoin and Ethereum: Cryptocurrency Regulatory Status (US Context) ETF Status (US) Bitcoin (BTC) Generally considered a commodity by the SEC. Spot and Futures ETFs approved and trading. Ethereum (ETH) SEC stance has evolved, leaning towards commodity, but not fully settled for spot ETFs yet. Futures ETFs approved and trading. Spot ETF applications pending, decision anticipated. XRP Regulatory status highly contested; SEC alleges it’s a security, Ripple disputes. No spot or futures ETFs approved or trading. Regulatory clarity is the major barrier. This table highlights why the regulatory environment is the critical factor influencing the timeline for a ProShares XRP ETF or any other XRP ETF. When Could We See an XRP ETF Launch? Despite the debunked April 30th rumor, the question remains: when could an XRP ETF launch potentially happen? James Seyffart’s clarification, while dismissing the specific date, did offer a general timeframe expectation: likely in the short to medium term. However, this timing is heavily contingent on external factors, primarily regulatory developments. Key factors influencing the timeline include: Resolution of the SEC vs. Ripple Case: A definitive ruling or settlement that clarifies XRP’s legal status in the U.S. is arguably the most significant catalyst needed for ETF approval. SEC Guidance: Even without a full case resolution, clearer guidance from the SEC regarding how it views and intends to regulate cryptocurrencies like XRP could pave the way. Market Demand and Issuer Interest: Strong market demand and continued interest from major issuers like ProShares are necessary drivers for filing and pursuing ETF applications. Political and Legislative Landscape: Potential legislation addressing crypto regulation could also impact the process. The “short to medium term” suggests that if regulatory clarity emerges relatively soon, the standard SEC review process for an ETF application could then begin. This process itself can take several months. Implications for XRP Investment The potential approval and launch of an XRP ETF launch is widely seen as a positive development for XRP investment. Such a product could: Increase Institutional Adoption: ETFs make it easier for large institutions (pension funds, asset managers) to gain exposure to XRP, potentially bringing significant capital into the market. Enhance Liquidity: Increased trading activity via an ETF could improve XRP’s market liquidity. Boost Mainstream Accessibility: Retail investors who are hesitant to navigate crypto exchanges might be more comfortable buying an ETF through their traditional brokerage. Improve Price Discovery: A regulated ETF could contribute to more efficient price discovery for XRP. However, it’s crucial for investors interested in XRP investment to remember that an ETF’s price would track XRP’s market price, meaning it would still be subject to the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, ETF approval is not guaranteed, and the timeline remains uncertain. The Broader ETF Market Context The interest in an ProShares XRP ETF and other crypto-specific ETFs reflects the growing maturity and acceptance of the overall ETF market. ETFs have become incredibly popular investment vehicles due to their low costs, transparency, and ease of trading. The success of Bitcoin spot ETFs in attracting billions in assets under management since their launch in January 2024 has only amplified the anticipation for similar products tracking other major cryptocurrencies. The ETF market is constantly innovating, with issuers exploring various asset classes and strategies. While regulatory hurdles remain for many crypto assets, the trend towards offering regulated investment products for digital assets appears to be a long-term one. ProShares, being a significant player, is naturally expected to explore opportunities across different cryptocurrencies as the regulatory landscape evolves. Actionable Insights for Aspiring XRP ETF Investors Given the current situation – debunked rumors and uncertain timelines – what should investors interested in an XRP ETF do? Stay Informed, but Skeptical: Follow reputable news sources and analysts like James Seyffart. Be highly skeptical of specific launch dates announced via unofficial channels. Monitor Regulatory Developments: Pay close attention to news regarding the SEC vs. Ripple case and any broader statements or guidance from the SEC concerning crypto regulation. Regulatory clarity is the key. Understand XRP Itself: While an ETF offers indirect exposure, understand the underlying asset, its use cases, and the factors influencing its price. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency markets are volatile. An ETF doesn’t eliminate this risk, though it may offer regulatory benefits. Ensure any investment aligns with your risk profile. Consider Alternatives (with Caution): If you seek XRP exposure now, research reputable cryptocurrency exchanges. Be aware of the differences in risk and custody compared to an ETF. Patience and due diligence are crucial in this evolving market. Conclusion: Anticipation Remains Despite Debunked Rumors In summary, the recent rumor about a ProShares XRP ETF launching on April 30th has been definitively debunked by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart. While ProShares and other issuers are likely interested in launching an XRP ETF, and the market anticipates one in the short to medium term, the critical factor remains regulatory clarity surrounding XRP, primarily tied to the outcome of the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit. Investors should rely on official announcements and regulatory progress rather than unconfirmed dates. The potential launch of an XRP ETF is a significant event to watch for, promising increased accessibility and potential institutional flow into XRP investment, but its timing is not yet set in stone.

MetaMask, one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallet service providers globally, is set to launch a groundbreaking MetaMask payment card . This isn’t just another crypto card; it promises real-time crypto payments directly from your wallet, bypassing traditional conversion hurdles. Slated for a Q2 release, this development could significantly bridge the gap between the crypto world and everyday transactions. What is the MetaMask Payment Card and Why Does it Matter? The upcoming MetaMask payment card is the result of a strategic collaboration between MetaMask, secure payment card technology provider CompoSecure, and leading Web3 financial services company Baanx. The core innovation here is its ability to facilitate transactions using the cryptocurrencies held within your MetaMask wallet in near real-time – specifically, within five seconds. Traditionally, spending crypto requires a multi-step process: selling your crypto on an exchange, withdrawing fiat currency, and then using that fiat. Even existing crypto cards often involve a pre-conversion step or a slight delay. The promise of the MetaMask card is to make this process seamless and instantaneous at the point of sale, whether online or in a physical store that accepts card payments. This capability is crucial because it removes friction. Imagine using your crypto to buy groceries, pay for coffee, or book a flight without waiting for conversions or worrying about fluctuating exchange rates during the transaction window. This move positions MetaMask to become a more central tool for users not just holding assets, but actively using them in the real world. How Will Real-Time Crypto Payments Work? The magic of real-time crypto payments lies in the technology integration between MetaMask’s wallet infrastructure and the payment network rails provided by CompoSecure and Baanx. While the exact technical details at the moment of transaction are complex, the user experience is designed to be simple: Initiate a payment with your MetaMask card at a merchant terminal or online checkout. The system quickly checks your MetaMask wallet balance. A near-instantaneous conversion of the required crypto amount to the local fiat currency occurs behind the scenes. The transaction is authorized and completed within approximately five seconds. This process eliminates the need for users to manually manage conversions beforehand, simplifying spending and making crypto feel more like traditional money for everyday purchases. It’s a significant step towards mainstream adoption and usability for digital currencies. The Power Behind the Card: CompoSecure and Baanx The partnership with CompoSecure and Baanx is key to enabling these real-time crypto payments . CompoSecure is known for its high-security, premium payment cards, often featuring metal construction and advanced technology. Their expertise in card manufacturing and security infrastructure provides the physical and digital backbone for the MetaMask card. Baanx specializes in providing crypto-friendly financial services, including card programs and payment solutions that bridge digital assets with traditional banking systems. Their technology likely facilitates the rapid conversion and settlement processes required for near-instantaneous crypto spending. This collaboration brings together the strengths of a leading crypto wallet, secure hardware, and sophisticated financial technology. Expanding Horizons: Bitcoin Solana Support and Wallet Evolution Beyond the immediate launch of the MetaMask payment card , MetaMask has signaled broader ambitions for 2024. A major announcement includes plans to support Bitcoin Solana support later this year. This is a significant move as MetaMask has historically been focused primarily on Ethereum and EVM-compatible networks. Adding native support for Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and Solana, a high-throughput blockchain, will dramatically expand the range of assets users can hold and potentially spend directly from their MetaMask wallet using the new card. This diversification makes the wallet, and consequently the card, much more versatile and appealing to a wider audience of crypto holders. Furthermore, MetaMask plans a significant revamp of the wallet’s user interface (UI). While details are scarce, a UI refresh often aims to improve usability, streamline navigation, and potentially integrate new features like the payment card more seamlessly. A more intuitive interface can lower the barrier to entry for new users and enhance the experience for existing ones. What Does This Mean for Your MetaMask Wallet Experience? The introduction of the MetaMask payment card , coupled with planned Bitcoin Solana support and a UI revamp, points towards MetaMask evolving into a more comprehensive financial tool. For current users, this means: Increased Utility: Your crypto holdings become instantly spendable at millions of locations worldwide. Simplified Spending: No more complex manual conversions before making a purchase. Expanded Asset Support: Potentially spend not just ETH and ERC-20 tokens, but also BTC and SOL directly from the wallet. Improved User Experience: The planned UI revamp could make managing assets and using new features easier. This makes the MetaMask wallet less of just a place to store digital assets and more of an active account for managing and using your crypto in daily life. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the prospect of real-time crypto payments is exciting, it’s important to consider potential challenges: Fees: There will likely be fees associated with using the card, including conversion fees, transaction fees, or annual fees. The fee structure will be crucial for user adoption. Volatility: The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate significantly. While the real-time conversion minimizes risk during the transaction itself, the value of your holdings can change rapidly before you spend them. Regulation: The regulatory landscape for crypto and crypto-linked financial products is constantly evolving. Future regulations could impact the card’s availability or functionality in certain regions. Merchant Acceptance: While the card will likely operate on major payment networks, ensuring seamless acceptance at all merchant types will be key. Adoption Rate: The success of the card will depend on how quickly users adopt it and integrate it into their spending habits. Users should carefully review the terms and conditions, fee structure, and any regional restrictions once the card launches. Comparing the MetaMask Card to the Competition The crypto card market is becoming increasingly crowded. How does the proposed MetaMask payment card stack up? Its primary differentiator appears to be the focus on truly real-time crypto payments within the familiar MetaMask ecosystem. Many existing cards: Require users to pre-load fiat or stablecoins onto the card. Involve a conversion step that might not be truly instantaneous. Are tied to specific exchange platforms rather than a non-custodial wallet like MetaMask. By enabling spending directly from a non-custodial wallet with near-instant conversion, MetaMask is aiming for a higher level of convenience and control for the user compared to custodial card solutions. Actionable Insights: Getting Ready for Q2 If you’re a MetaMask user or interested in easier crypto spending, here’s what you can do: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from MetaMask regarding the Q2 launch date and application process for the MetaMask payment card . Understand the Details: Once launched, carefully read the terms, conditions, fee structure, and supported regions before applying or using the card. Prepare Your Wallet: Ensure your MetaMask wallet is updated and you understand how to manage your assets within it. Look for Bitcoin Solana Support: If you hold BTC or SOL, monitor for updates on when native support will be integrated into the wallet, potentially enabling spending of these assets via the card later. Conclusion: A Leap Forward for Crypto Utility The upcoming launch of the MetaMask payment card represents a significant leap forward in making cryptocurrencies more usable for everyday transactions. By enabling real-time crypto payments directly from the user’s MetaMask wallet , bypassing manual conversions, and planning to add crucial support like Bitcoin Solana support , MetaMask is positioning itself at the forefront of crypto-fiat integration. While challenges remain, the potential for increased adoption and utility is immense. Q2 is shaping up to be an exciting time for MetaMask users and the broader crypto ecosystem.

The use of crypto mixers by bad actors remains an existential threat to the wider crypto market. United States District Judge for the Western District of Texas, Robert Pitman, ruled in favor of Tornado Cash, a popular crypto mixer, against the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). According to court documents dated April 28, the OFAC is now legally prohibited from reinstating the original sanctions. In August 2022, OFAC added Tornado Cash to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list. According to OFAC, Tornado Cash enabled bad actors, led by North Korea-backed Lazarus, to launder more the. $7 billion in crypto assets. However, some Tornado Cash users, led by Joseph Van Loon, presented strong arguments that the Department of Treasury had overstepped its authority. On the top list, the Plaintiffs argued that Tornado Cash is not a person and immutable smart contracts are not property. In addition to citing constitutional violations of free speech and financial privacy, Tornado Cash can seamlessly exist in the United States. Bigger Picture of Tornado Cash Final Ruling The final blow to the Department of Treasury by the Tornado Cash is a huge victory for the web3 developers in the United States and globally. The ruling was hailed by web3 leaders led by Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, among others. Moreover, open source development of web3 protocols will take shape under the Donald Trump administration, especially amid the anticipated crypto legal clarity. Meanwhile, TORN price gained around 1 percent following the announcement to trade about $7.38 at the time of this writing.

Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Buy This Month Before History Repeats,https://timestabloid.com/back-when-monero-was-pennies-qubetics-is-the-best-crypto/,"Have you ever kicked yourself for not scooping up Monero when it was just pennies? Or for doubting it before it became one of the most trusted privacy coins out there? Yeah, most of us have that same regret stamped somewhere in our crypto journey. The worst part? It wasn’t about missing any project — it was about missing the right one at the right time. If you’ve ever felt that sting, this could be your clean break. There’s a fresh shot brewing, and it’s still under the radar for now. Enter Qubetics . This project isn’t about chasing hype — it’s about grabbing value before it explodes. Built with real-world utility at its core and backed by a game-changing product suite, Qubetics is shaping up as one of the best cryptos to buy this month. With the Qubetics presale heating up, community members still have a real window to tap into this opportunity before the mainnet officially launches in Q2 2025. Miss Monero? Fine. But missing Qubetics now, while it’s still wide open, would hurt even worse. Still Regretting Missing Early Qubetics? It’s Hands Down the Best Cryptos to Buy This Month If you’re still haunted by not locking in early-stage gems, you should know: Qubetics already had its “whitelist moment.” Early participants snagged $TICS at just $0.01 — and without even paying upfront. That was September 29, 2024. Since then, this best crypto presale has marched through multiple stages, raising the price at every checkpoint. And now? You’re standing right at Stage 32, where $TICS is priced at $0.2093. Over 510 million tokens are already gone, more than $16.5 million has been raised, and the Qubetics presale already boasts a loyal community of over 25,400 holders. With Qubetics quickly climbing the list of the best cryptos to buy this month, this isn’t the time to hesitate — it’s the time to lock your position before history repeats itself. Here’s the crazy part: even at this point, the numbers are still mind-bending. A $100 investment at today’s presale price could set you up for $7167 if $TICS hits $15 after launch. That’s a ridiculous 7,066.39% ROI potential. Even if $TICS just climbs to $5 post-launch, you’re looking at a 2,288.80% ROI. Not many projects offer a shot like this while still staying under everyone’s radar. And by the way — each presale stage only lasts 7 days with a 10% price hike, so time is seriously not your friend here. Now, let’s talk about what’s making Qubetics a standout among the best cryptos to buy this month . Its core product, QubeQode IDE, is a total game-changer for blockchain development. It hands real businesses — like freelance agencies needing tokenized payments or online retailers wanting blockchain-secured loyalty programs — the tools to build without writing heavy code. With drag-and-drop blockchain components, form-based configurations, and a massive library of pre-written code snippets, even non-tech founders can launch secure apps without paying five-figure dev costs. Qubetics isn’t just adding another buzzword to crypto — it’s actually solving real business needs in a way that’s fast, simple, and built for mass adoption. Monero’s Rise from the Shadows: A Lesson for Today’s Best Cryptos to Buy This Month Monero’s journey is a masterclass in missed opportunities. When it launched back in 2014, it was practically an unknown privacy token priced so low it barely showed up on charts. But early community members who believed in private, secure transactions knew they were onto something. Over the years, Monero went from dirt cheap to clocking jaw-dropping all-time highs, solidifying its name among serious crypto circles. Its growth wasn’t overnight — it was a steady climb fueled by real need, trust, and community dedication. Today, Monero holds a respected position in the digital asset space, having built its reputation without flashy gimmicks or viral hype. It quietly dominated as governments, institutions, and users alike sought stronger privacy protections. Missing its early ICO stages meant missing one of the purest use-case-driven success stories in crypto history. The lesson here? Sometimes the coins that don’t scream the loudest — but solve real problems — are the ones that define financial freedom for their early community members. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss Out Again on the Best Cryptos to Buy This Month If history taught anything with Monero, it’s this: value-driven projects don’t stay hidden forever. Right now, Qubetics is offering that same once-in-a-cycle entry point — through its current presale phase. Backed by real utility through QubeQode IDE and a fair launch model that benefits its early community members, Qubetics looks primed for a breakout once the mainnet hits later this year. For those who missed Monero or sat sidelines watching Solana, Avalanche, or Filecoin grow, there’s no excuse to sleep through this one. If you’re serious about finding the best cryptos to buy this month, don’t just watch from the sidelines — join this best crypto presale before Qubetics slips out of reach. History doesn’t just repeat itself; it rewards those who listen the second time around.

43921296,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153454,1745882422,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tether Gold: Verified 7.7 Tons of Gold Backing XAU₮ Confirmed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tether-gold-verified-reserve/,"Big news in the world of digital assets backed by real-world value! Tether, the company behind the largest stablecoin by market cap, has just dropped a significant update regarding its Tether Gold (XAUτ) token. This isn’t just any update; it’s a formal attestation confirming the physical gold reserves that underpin the value of XAUτ. For anyone interested in the intersection of traditional finance and cryptocurrency, or simply looking for ways to diversify with digital gold , this is a key development. What Exactly Did the Tether Gold Attestation Confirm? Tether has officially released its first attestation specifically for Tether Gold (XAUτ). An attestation in this context is like an audit, but instead of a full financial statement, it verifies a specific claim – in this case, the physical gold reserves. The report confirms that 7.7 tons of physical gold are held in secure vaults located in Switzerland. This substantial amount of gold directly backs the current supply of the XAUτ token, which is valued at approximately $770 million. This verification is crucial because it provides transparency and trust regarding the backing of the token. Unlike simply claiming reserves, an attestation, particularly one conducted under a specific regulatory framework like El Salvador’s, adds a layer of formal validation to Tether’s assertions about XAUτ’s reserves. The news was initially reported by The Crypto Basic, highlighting its importance in the crypto space. Why is This Attestation Significant for XAUτ? The confirmation of 7.7 tons of gold reserves through this attestation significantly strengthens XAUτ’s position in the market. Here’s why it matters: Enhanced Trust and Transparency: For investors and users, knowing that the token is backed by a verified amount of physical gold held in reputable Swiss vaults provides a higher degree of confidence in the token’s stability and value. Regulatory Acknowledgment: The attestation being performed under El Salvador’s regulatory framework is notable. While the details of the framework’s specific requirements for this attestation are key, its involvement suggests a move towards greater formal recognition and oversight for tokenized assets. Solidifying Market Leadership: As the largest tokenized gold asset by market capitalization, XAUτ already holds a prominent position. This verified backing reinforces its status and differentiates it from potentially less transparent alternatives. Proof of Reserve: In the crypto world, proof of reserves is paramount, especially for assets claiming to be backed by real-world commodities. This attestation serves as a concrete proof point for the physical gold backing. Understanding Tokenized Gold: More Than Just Digital Pixels? So, what exactly is tokenized gold ? It’s a type of cryptocurrency or digital token where each token represents a specific amount of physical gold. In the case of XAUτ, one token represents one troy ounce of fine gold. The physical gold is held in secure vaults, and ownership of the token on the blockchain corresponds to ownership of that underlying physical asset. Think of it as having a digital certificate of ownership for a specific, allocated amount of gold, stored safely away. This differs from gold ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), where you own shares in a fund that owns gold, or owning physical gold yourself, which comes with storage and security challenges. What Are the Benefits of Holding Digital Gold Like XAUτ? Holding digital gold via a token like XAUτ offers several potential advantages compared to traditional methods of owning gold: Accessibility and Divisibility: You can buy and sell fractions of a troy ounce of gold, making it more accessible for smaller investors. Transactions can occur 24/7 on crypto exchanges, unlike traditional markets. Ease of Transfer: Sending XAUτ across the globe is as simple as sending a cryptocurrency transaction, bypassing the logistics and security risks of moving physical gold. Lower Costs: While fees exist, tokenized gold can potentially have lower storage, insurance, and transaction costs compared to buying, storing, and selling physical gold. Liquidity: Trading on cryptocurrency exchanges can offer higher liquidity than finding a buyer for physical gold bars or coins. Transparency: The token’s existence and transaction history are on the blockchain, offering a level of transparency regarding its movement. The attestation adds transparency regarding the backing reserves. How Does the XAUτ Gold Token Work? The mechanics behind the XAUτ gold token are designed to link the digital asset to its physical counterpart: Issuance: Tether issues XAUτ tokens on blockchain networks (currently Ethereum and TRON). Backing: For every XAUτ token issued, Tether acquires and stores one troy ounce of physical gold. Custody: The physical gold is held in secure, audited vaults, specifically in Switzerland, known for its robust financial infrastructure and storage facilities. Ownership: Holding the XAUτ token on the blockchain signifies beneficial ownership of the underlying gold. Redemption: Holders of XAUτ can, under specific conditions and potentially minimum thresholds, request redemption for the physical gold or the equivalent cash value. The recent attestation confirms that step 2 and 3 are being followed for the current supply, verifying the link between the digital token and the physical asset. Are There Challenges or Risks with Tokenized Gold? While tokenized gold offers benefits, it’s important to be aware of the potential challenges and risks: Custody Risk of Physical Gold: Although stored in secure vaults, there is always an inherent risk associated with the custodian (Tether and its partners) holding the physical asset. The attestation helps mitigate this by verifying existence, but it doesn’t eliminate counterparty risk entirely. Smart Contract Risk: The XAUτ token operates on blockchain smart contracts. While generally secure, any vulnerability in the contract code could pose a risk. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for tokenized assets is still evolving globally. While the El Salvador framework is a step, changes in regulations could impact the operation or accessibility of XAUτ. Tether Risk: XAUτ is issued by Tether. Risks associated with the parent company, whether operational, legal, or reputational, could potentially affect the token. Liquidity Risk: While potentially more liquid than physical gold, liquidity on exchanges can vary, especially during times of market stress. Understanding these risks is crucial before investing in any digital gold asset. What Does This Mean for the Future of Tokenized Assets? The successful attestation of Tether Gold ‘s reserves is a positive signal for the broader market of tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs). It demonstrates that it is possible to link physical commodities to digital tokens in a verifiable way. As the technology and regulatory clarity improve, we may see more assets, from real estate to art to commodities, being represented on the blockchain, potentially unlocking new levels of liquidity and accessibility. In Conclusion: A Golden Step Forward for XAUτ Tether’s first attestation for XAUτ, verifying 7.7 tons of physical gold in Swiss vaults backing its $770 million supply, is a significant milestone. It provides crucial transparency and reinforces XAUτ’s position as the leading tokenized gold asset. While challenges and risks inherent in any digital asset remain, this move towards verifiable reserves is a positive step for building trust in the growing market for digital gold and other tokenized real-world assets. It offers investors a potentially more accessible and liquid way to gain exposure to gold, backed by tangible reserves.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) displayed strength as the week opened on April 28, up 10% over the last seven days to trade at $95,500. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and Bitstamp shows that BTC price has been suppressed under $100,000 since early February, as shown in the chart below. BTC/USD weekly chart. Cointelegraph/ TradingView Bitcoin lacks a $100K catalyst The BTC/USD pair rallied 30% from its $74,400 low reached on April 7 to trade above $95,000, a recovery fueled largely by easing US-China tariff tensions. Although the rally has been accompanied by $3.06 billion in spot ETF inflows , there are doubts whether that is enough to break Bitcoin out of consolidation. In its latest bulletin to Telegram channel subscribers, trading firm QCP Capital argued that Bitcoin’s decoupling from equities last week strengthened its narrative as a “hedge against political instability and uncertain monetary policy.” This helped BTC to comfortably breach the $90,000, QCP Capital explained, adding that it would have also helped propel it higher. However, BTC pivoted midweek, decoupling from gold and rallying alongside US equities , mainly responding to macroeconomic factors. “This flip-flopping between safe-haven and risk-asset behaviour suggests that traditional correlation frameworks are becoming less instructive. Instead, market participants are now focused on the durability of BTC’s “up only” trend.” On April 25, the trading firm said that BTC price could continue its choppy price for a few more days, arguing that it lacked a “catalyst” to propel it toward $100,000. The investment firm said: “With macro risks temporarily subdued and trade tensions cooling, BTC is likely to consolidate in a narrow $90K–$94.5K range while awaiting a catalyst for a decisive push toward the elusive $100K mark.” Meanwhile, crypto analyst Tazman noted that a lack of “sustained demand and fresh capital” stands in the way of Bitcoin’s path to $100,000.

The South Korean media outlet EDaily reported that the party has promised to do away with a law that requires domestic banks to form exclusive partnership deals with domestic exchanges, with the former absorbing the lion’s share of risk liability. Crypto Exchange Banking Rules: On the Way Out? Without such a partnership, exchanges cannot offer their clients crypto-fiat pairings. At present, only five domestic exchanges have managed to convince banks to enter such partnerships. The People Power Party Emergency Response Committee meeting at the National Assembly in Yeouido, Seoul, on April 28. (Source: JTBC/Screenshot) Shortly after the law was rolled out, scores of smaller exchanges were forced to close. Others have tried to get by, offering their clients crypto-to-crypto only trading. The PPP said the rule change would be one of seven “major tasks” that would help it “foster the cryptoasset ecosystem.” Speaking at a summit held at the National Assembly on April 28, PP lawmaker Park Soo-min said: “It is very restrictive for citizens if they cannot trade cryptossets through the bank of their choice. [The current rules] have solidified monopolies on the market. [Our approach] will also open the door to competition between exchanges.” The PPP also unveiled six other crypto-related policy manifesto pledges, namely: The launch of corporate crypto trading before the end of 2025 The creation of a Virtual Asset Special Committee that will report to the South Korean President Green-lighting the launch of crypto spot ETF trading “within 2025” Security token offering (STO) legislation “Global-standard” stablecoin regulation Crypto tax clarity The PPP said that its policies would help foster innovation in the industry and restore investors’ trust.

43921632,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153455,1745883018,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,BlackRock IBIT Defies Market Turmoil with Strong Inflows,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/blackrock-ibit-positive-flows/,"In the ever-evolving world of digital assets, investors are constantly seeking signs of stability and growth, especially within the realm of Crypto Investment . Amidst a turbulent global economic landscape, a significant update comes from one of the world’s largest asset managers. Samara Cohen, Chief Investment Officer (CIO) of ETF and index investments at BlackRock, recently shared insights on the performance of their spot Bitcoin ETF , known as IBIT. Her comments offer a compelling perspective on investor sentiment towards digital assets. Understanding the Resilience of BlackRock IBIT BlackRock’s entry into the spot Bitcoin ETF market was a landmark event, bringing a familiar investment vehicle to digital assets. The performance of IBIT has been closely watched by market participants, seen by many as a barometer for institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin. Samara Cohen’s recent statements provide a clear signal: despite prevailing macroeconomic headwinds, BlackRock IBIT has demonstrated remarkable resilience. Cohen highlighted that even with the current global environment marked by supply chain instability and international trade tensions – factors that typically induce caution in financial markets – IBIT has managed to maintain largely positive flows. This suggests a sustained demand for direct exposure to Bitcoin through this regulated product. What makes these positive IBIT flows particularly noteworthy? Consider the context: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Geopolitical events and economic shifts often lead investors to pull back from riskier assets. Market Volatility: The crypto market itself is known for its price swings, which can deter conservative investors. Competition: IBIT is one of several spot Bitcoin ETFs launched around the same time, competing for investor capital. Yet, Cohen asserts that IBIT has experienced fewer outflows than might have been anticipated under these conditions. This points to a strong underlying conviction among its holders. Who is Driving These Positive IBIT Flows? A key takeaway from Cohen’s discussion is the nature of the investors contributing to IBIT’s positive momentum. She specifically mentioned that both individual and institutional investors have continued to buy shares of the ETF. This is crucial for the long-term health and maturation of the Crypto Investment space. The participation of institutional players is often seen as a stamp of approval for an asset class. Large firms, endowments, and wealth managers conducting due diligence and allocating capital to a Bitcoin ETF like IBIT signifies growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional portfolios. Simultaneously, continued buying from individual investors indicates sustained retail interest and belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. This blend of investor types contributing to the positive IBIT flows paints a picture of broad-based adoption, moving beyond early crypto enthusiasts to include a wider spectrum of the investment community. Looking Ahead: BlackRock’s Bullish Stance on Tokenization Beyond the success of their Bitcoin ETF , Samara Cohen also touched upon BlackRock’s broader view on the future of digital assets, expressing a bullish outlook on Tokenization . Tokenization involves representing real-world assets, such as real estate, art, or even funds, as digital tokens on a blockchain. BlackRock’s interest in Tokenization is not new, but Cohen’s reaffirmation underscores its strategic importance for the firm. This technology has the potential to: Improve liquidity for illiquid assets. Increase transparency and efficiency in transactions. Enable fractional ownership of high-value assets. Potentially create new investment opportunities and markets. While IBIT focuses on providing exposure to Bitcoin, BlackRock’s exploration and positive view on Tokenization signal a deeper commitment to leveraging blockchain technology for various asset classes. This suggests that their engagement with the digital asset ecosystem extends far beyond just cryptocurrencies. Why Do IBIT Flows Matter for Crypto Investment? The sustained positive IBIT flows are more than just a statistic for one fund; they serve as an important indicator for the broader Crypto Investment landscape. They demonstrate that despite external pressures and market noise, a significant segment of investors remains committed to gaining exposure to Bitcoin through regulated channels. For those considering a Crypto Investment , the performance of major, institutionally-backed products like BlackRock IBIT provides valuable data points.

43921927,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153456,1745883616,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Marinade Native Staking Gets Secure Boost with BitGo as First US Qualified Custodian,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/marinade-native-staking-bitgo/,"In a significant move for the institutional adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology, Marinade, a leading liquidity staking protocol on the Solana network, has announced a groundbreaking integration. According to a recent update shared on their official channels, BitGo, a prominent digital asset trust and security company, has become the first U.S.-qualified custodian to offer support for Marinade Native Staking . This development is poised to unlock new avenues for institutions looking to participate in the Solana ecosystem while adhering to stringent compliance and security requirements. For a long time, institutional investors have faced hurdles when seeking to engage directly with blockchain protocols, particularly in areas like staking. Concerns around custody, regulatory clarity, and operational security have often been significant barriers. The integration between Marinade and BitGo directly addresses these challenges, providing a compliant and secure pathway for institutions to earn Solana Staking Rewards . Understanding Marinade Native Staking Before diving into the implications of the BitGo integration, let’s clarify what Marinade Native Staking entails. Marinade offers two primary staking products for Solana (SOL): Liquid Staking (mSOL): Users stake SOL and receive mSOL, a liquid token representing their staked SOL plus accumulated rewards. mSOL can be used in various DeFi protocols, offering flexibility. Native Staking: This method allows users to stake their SOL directly with validators through Marinade’s automated strategy, but without receiving a liquid token like mSOL. The SOL remains in the user’s wallet (or, in this case, the custodian’s wallet), delegated to a set of validators chosen by Marinade’s algorithm to optimize for performance and decentralization. Rewards accrue directly to the staked SOL balance. The key advantage of Marinade Native Staking is its similarity to traditional native staking directly on the Solana network, but with the benefit of Marinade’s automated delegation strategy. This strategy diversifies staking across many validators, mitigating risk and aiming for optimal returns without requiring the user to manage individual validator choices. For institutions, the fact that the underlying SOL isn’t locked within the Marinade protocol itself (as it is with mSOL, which represents a claim on staked SOL) but rather delegated from a controlled address, aligns better with certain custodial and operational models. Why BitGo Crypto Custody is a Game Changer for Institutions BitGo’s role as a US Qualified Custodian is central to the significance of this announcement. But what exactly does being a ‘qualified custodian’ mean in the U.S. context, and why is it important for digital assets? A qualified custodian is typically a bank, a registered broker-dealer, or a trust company regulated by entities like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or state banking authorities. These institutions are subject to strict regulations regarding the safeguarding of client assets. For traditional finance, using a qualified custodian is standard practice and often a regulatory requirement for managing client funds, especially for registered investment advisors (RIAs). Extending this framework to digital assets like cryptocurrencies is crucial for attracting institutional capital. BitGo, through its regulated entities, provides the necessary infrastructure for institutions to hold digital assets securely and compliantly. Their services typically include: High-Level Security: Utilizing advanced multi-signature security protocols and cold storage solutions to protect assets from theft and loss. Regulatory Compliance: Operating under licenses and regulations that meet stringent governmental standards. Insurance: Often providing insurance coverage for digital assets held in custody. Operational Controls: Implementing robust internal controls, audit trails, and access policies. By integrating with Marinade Native Staking, BitGo now allows its institutional clients to move beyond simply holding SOL. They can now actively participate in securing the Solana network and earning rewards through staking, all within the familiar and regulated environment of their BitGo custody account. This eliminates the need for institutions to manage private keys themselves or interact directly with staking protocols in a non-custodial manner, which can be a compliance and security headache. The Impact: Unlocking Institutional Solana Staking This partnership marks a pivotal moment for Institutional Solana Staking . Here’s a breakdown of the key benefits and implications: Benefits for Institutions: Compliance: Stake SOL while meeting regulatory requirements for asset custody. Security: Leverage BitGo’s institutional-grade security infrastructure, reducing the risk of loss due to hacks or operational errors. Yield Generation: Access passive income opportunities through staking rewards on their SOL holdings. Simplicity: Integrate staking into existing custodial workflows, simplifying operations. Diversification: Add staked SOL to their portfolio within a regulated framework. Benefits for Marinade and Solana: Increased TVL: Attract significant institutional capital into Marinade’s Native Staking product. Enhanced Network Security: More staked SOL contributes to the security and decentralization of the Solana network. Validation: The integration with a major US Qualified Custodian like BitGo validates Marinade’s protocol and the robustness of Solana’s staking mechanism. Broader Adoption: Opens the door for a new class of investors to engage with the Solana ecosystem. Earning Solana Staking Rewards Through a Custodian: How Does it Work? For an institution using BitGo’s services, the process for engaging with Marinade Native Staking would typically involve: Depositing SOL into their BitGo custody account. Instructing BitGo (through their platform or account managers) to initiate Native Staking for a specified amount of SOL via the Marinade integration. BitGo, on behalf of the institution, delegates the specified SOL amount to validators selected by Marinade’s automated strategy. Solana Staking Rewards accrue directly to the staked balance within the BitGo custody account. The institution can view their staked balance and rewards through their BitGo interface. When the institution wishes to unstake, they would instruct BitGo, which would then manage the unstaking process according to Solana’s network rules (which involves a cooldown period). This abstracted process means institutions don’t need deep technical knowledge of Solana staking or direct interaction with blockchain wallets and protocols. BitGo handles the complexity, providing a familiar, enterprise-grade experience. Challenges and Considerations While this integration is overwhelmingly positive, institutions should still consider potential challenges: Slashing Risk: Although Marinade’s Native Staking strategy diversifies across many validators to minimize this, the risk of validators being slashed (penalized for misbehavior) and a small portion of staked SOL being lost still exists on the protocol level. Unstaking Period: Solana’s network requires an unstaking cooldown period (typically 2-3 days) before staked SOL becomes liquid again. Institutions need to factor this liquidity constraint into their strategies. Custodial Fees: Using a qualified custodian like BitGo involves fees for custody and potentially for staking services. These costs must be weighed against the staking rewards. Regulatory Evolution: While using a qualified custodian addresses current needs, the regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving, which could impact future operations. The Growing Trend of Institutional DeFi Access The BitGo and Marinade partnership is part of a larger trend: the increasing demand from institutions for compliant access to DeFi yield opportunities. As the digital asset space matures, traditional finance players are looking for ways to participate beyond simple spot trading. Staking, lending, and other DeFi strategies offer attractive potential returns, but require robust, regulated infrastructure. The availability of Marinade Native Staking through a trusted US Qualified Custodian like BitGo sets a precedent and lowers the barrier to entry for many risk-averse institutions who were previously on the sidelines. It signals that the necessary bridges between traditional finance and decentralized protocols are being built, piece by piece. Actionable Insights for Institutions and the Solana Ecosystem For Institutions: Evaluate your SOL holdings and consider the potential yield generation opportunities through compliant staking via BitGo. Assess the balance between potential rewards, custodial costs, and liquidity needs. For Marinade: Continue building integrations with other institutional service providers and enhancing the Native Staking product based on institutional feedback. For Solana: The increased institutional participation driven by such integrations strengthens the network’s security and credibility, potentially attracting more development and investment. Conclusion: A Secure Pathway to Solana Staking Rewards The integration of BitGo as the first US Qualified Custodian to support Marinade Native Staking is a landmark achievement. It provides institutions with a secure, compliant, and operationally efficient way to participate in the Solana ecosystem and earn Solana Staking Rewards . By bridging the gap between traditional finance’s need for trusted custody and the opportunities within decentralized protocols, this partnership paves the way for significant institutional capital to flow into Solana staking. This not only benefits institutions seeking yield but also strengthens the Solana network as a whole. It’s a clear signal that institutional DeFi is not just a concept, but a rapidly developing reality.

In a recent blog post, the EF laid out its strategic roadmap for the coming 12 months, highlighting key areas of focus designed to propel the Ethereum ecosystem forward. This vision isn’t just about technical upgrades; it’s a holistic approach aimed at strengthening the network’s core values while pursuing ambitious strategic goals for long-term success. What Drives the Ethereum Foundation’s Strategy? The EF’s plan is anchored by two main pillars: upholding core values and achieving strategic goals. Core values emphasize the decentralized, open-source nature of Ethereum, ensuring it remains a public good accessible to all. Strategic goals, on the other hand, are the concrete targets set to improve the network’s performance, usability, and reach. The next year will see concentrated efforts in several critical areas: Expanding the Ethereum mainnet and data handling capabilities (specifically focusing on Blobs): This is crucial for scalability and reducing transaction costs. Improving user experience (UX) and strengthening Layer-2 interoperability and application layer development: Making Ethereum easier to use and ensuring seamless interaction between scaling solutions and decentralized applications. Improving the developer experience (DevEx) and strengthening exposure and support for applications and Layer-2 projects within the platform, including Devcon 7: Empowering builders and showcasing the innovation happening on Ethereum. Let’s dive deeper into what these focus areas mean for the future of the Ethereum ecosystem . Scaling the Ethereum Ecosystem: The Role of Blobs and Layer 2 One of the most anticipated developments mentioned is the focus on expanding mainnet data through ‘Blobs’. This refers to the implementation of EIP-4844, also known as Proto-Danksharding, which was a major part of the recent Dencun upgrade. Blobs provide a new, cheaper way for Layer 2 rollups to post data back to the Ethereum mainnet. Why is this a big deal? Scaling remains a primary challenge for Ethereum. While the mainnet processes transactions securely, high demand can lead to congestion and high gas fees. Layer 2 Ethereum solutions like optimistic and zero-knowledge rollups bundle transactions off-chain and then post compressed data back to the mainnet. Historically, this data was posted as call data, which is expensive. Blobs offer a dedicated, cheaper space for this rollup data. This directly translates to significantly lower transaction costs for users on Layer 2 networks. By prioritizing this expansion, the Ethereum Foundation is directly addressing one of the biggest barriers to mass adoption – affordability. This focus lays the groundwork for future scaling advancements like full Danksharding. Benefits of Focusing on Blobs & Layer 2: Lower transaction fees for end-users. Increased transaction throughput across the ecosystem. Enables new types of applications that were previously too expensive. Strengthens the symbiotic relationship between the mainnet and Layer 2 solutions. Enhancing User & Developer Experience for Broader Adoption For the Ethereum ecosystem to truly flourish, it needs to be easy and intuitive for both users and developers. The EF’s commitment to improving User Experience (UX) and Developer Experience (DevEx) is paramount. Improving UX involves making wallets simpler, understanding gas fees easier, and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps) more seamless. A significant part of this is strengthening interoperability between different Layer 2 Ethereum networks and the mainnet. Users shouldn’t have to navigate complex bridges or face compatibility issues when moving assets or interacting with applications across different layers or rollups. The EF aims to support initiatives that make this interaction smooth and secure. On the DevEx side, the goal is to make building on Ethereum as straightforward and supported as possible. This includes providing better tools, documentation, and resources for developers. The foundation plans to increase exposure and support for innovative applications and Layer 2 projects building on the platform. This support often comes in the form of grants, educational programs, and providing platforms for connection. Devcon 7: A Key Platform for Ethereum Development A major highlight in the EF’s plan is the emphasis on Devcon 7 . Devcon is the flagship conference for Ethereum developers, researchers, and enthusiasts. It’s a vital event for: Sharing knowledge about the latest technical advancements. Fostering collaboration among core developers and ecosystem participants. Showcasing groundbreaking projects and applications. Cultivating the global Ethereum community. By focusing on Devcon 7 , the EF underscores the importance of community and knowledge sharing in driving Ethereum Development . It provides a critical touchpoint for builders worldwide to connect, learn, and push the boundaries of what’s possible on Ethereum. Accelerating Deployment and Cultivating the Next Generation Beyond the specific technical and experiential goals, the Ethereum Foundation is focused on accelerating the deployment and adoption of Ethereum technology by a wider audience, including developers, entrepreneurs, and institutions. This involves educational outreach, simplifying onboarding processes, and demonstrating the real-world utility of decentralized applications. Crucially, the EF also aims to attract and cultivate a new generation of builders. Leveraging its knowledge base and leadership position, the foundation seeks to inspire and equip individuals with the skills and resources needed to contribute to the Ethereum Ecosystem . This long-term investment in human capital is essential for the network’s continued innovation and resilience. What Does This Mean for You? Whether you’re a user, developer, investor, or simply interested in the space, the EF’s roadmap signals a period of focused improvement and growth. Expect to see: Lower fees and faster transactions on your favorite Layer 2 Ethereum applications. More user-friendly interfaces and smoother interactions with dApps. New and innovative applications launching as DevEx improves. Increased institutional interest as the network matures and scales. Opportunities to engage with the community, perhaps even at Devcon 7 . While challenges remain, such as ongoing security considerations and the complexity of coordinating a global decentralized ecosystem, the clear focus areas outlined by the Ethereum Foundation provide a strong sense of direction and purpose for the next year of Ethereum Development . Conclusion: Building a Stronger, More Accessible Ethereum The Ethereum Foundation’s vision for the next 12 months is a clear commitment to strengthening the network’s core infrastructure, enhancing the experience for everyone who interacts with it, and fostering the community of builders driving innovation. By prioritizing scaling through Blobs and Layer 2s, improving UX and DevEx, and supporting key community events like Devcon 7, the EF is setting the stage for significant advancements. This focused approach aims to make the Ethereum Ecosystem more scalable, affordable, user-friendly, and vibrant, ultimately accelerating its journey towards becoming a truly global, decentralized computing platform.

The one-day chart sets out a textbook inverse-head-and-shoulders (iHS) basing pattern that has been forming since early March and is now approaching the neckline around 0.00162 BTC. At the time of the screenshot, SOL was quoted at 0.001588 BTC. With bitcoin changing hands near $94,765, that places Solana at roughly $150 per coin. The anatomy of the pattern is hard to miss: a March 19 low at 0.00127 BTC ($120) forms the head, flanked by higher swing lows on March 11 left shoulder). The left shoulders is currently in the process of forming. The horizontal neckline aligns with the late-December floor that broke down in February, converting sturdy support into equally sturdy resistance. Measured from the head to the neckline, the amplitude is roughly 0.00033 BTC; a clean breakout would imply a technical objective near 0.00195 BTC—conveniently the lower boundary of the Kumo cloud’s far edge. Solana Bulls Have A Target The chart is overlaid with a long-look Ichimoku configuration (20/60/120/30). At the latest close the Tenkan-sen sat at 0.00150 BTC, the Kijun-sen exactly on the neckline at 0.00162 BTC, and Senkou Span A printed 0.001742 BTC while Span B held higher at 0.002159 BTC. The cloud itself remains bearish—thick, red and overhead—yet the span differential is beginning to compress, signalling waning downward momentum. A decisive push into the Kumo would trigger the classic Ichimoku edge-to-edge trade, targeting Span B at roughly 0.00216 BTC (about $205).

The bullish setup is occurring only two months after the market completed the mirror image of the same pattern. From mid-December to early-February, SOL/BTC carved out a prominent head-and-shoulders, lost the neckline in early February and cascaded directly to March’s iHs. That down-and-up symmetry gives extra weight to the current formation by demonstrating how faithfully the pair has respected classical geometry during the past half-year. “1D SOL/BTC – iHS + E2E at some point but not soon, probably late May,” Olszewicz wrote on X. The analyst’s caution reflects the fact that price is still beneath both the neckline and the Kijun-sen, and the Kumo does not thin materially until the final week of May. A premature break attempt risks rejection into a final right-shoulder retest near 0.00151 BTC ($143), which is also where the Tenkan-sen currently resides. Notably, the Chikou Span (lagging line) remains below price and cloud, emphasising that trend confirmation is pending; both Ichimoku purists and pattern traders could therefore agree that 0.00162 BTC is the line Solana bulls must flip decisively. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Holding Strong Above $150 — Breakout Zone In Play If the edge-to-edge objective is achieved, SOL would add roughly 26 % against Bitcoin from present levels and reclaim ground last seen in early February. Should the neckline reject yet again, downside protection is thin until the twin shoulders at 0.00145–0.00148 BTC; a break of that shelf would invalidate the bullish thesis and reopen the March trough. For now, the market is content to coil beneath resistance while the clock ticks toward the cloud’s inflection. Whether Olszewicz’s late-May timetable proves prescient will depend on Bitcoin’s own trajectory and the broader risk environment, but the price structure on the Solana/Bitcoin chart is clear: after a bruising winter, the bulls finally have a pattern worth defending. At press time, SOL traded at $149.

BONK’s open interest surged 290% to $43.2 million. Bonk ( BONK ), the second-largest Solana-based memecoin by market capitalization, is on track to continue the recovery it began on April 22. BONK has climbed approximately 73% from its April 22 low of around $0.00001247, bringing its price up to an intraday high of $0.00002167 on April 28. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BONK trading at $0.00001923, up 3% over the 24 hours and 60% over the last seven days. BONK/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView BONK’s trading volume has jumped 98% over the last 24 hours to $478 million, and its market capitalization also jumped, briefly touching $1.7 billion on April 28, before retracing to the current level of $1.5 billion. Let’s examine the factors that have fueled BONK's price momentum over the last week. Memecoins recover across the board BONK’s rally over the last seven days mirrors the bullish price movements across the broader crypto market, including the memecoin sector. Most memecoins have posted double-digit gains over the last week. DOGE and Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the leading memecoins , have jumped 3% and 5% over the last seven days. Official Trump (TRUMP), the memecoin associated with US President Donald Trump, has recorded 73% weekly gains, while Base’s Brett ( BRETT ) has rallied 83% over the same period.

Memecoin market cap and volume. Source: CoinMarketCap Over $7.96 billion in memecoin trading volume was recorded in the past seven days alone, representing an 85% weekly change. The resurgence is driven by investors once again embracing risk-on assets like memecoins. Increasing open interest backs BONK’s rally The surge in the price of Bonk over the last seven days comes after a significant jump in its open interest (OI). BONK’s total OI on all exchanges rose 290% from $11 million on April 22 to $43.2 million on April 26. Although this metric has since dropped to $28 million at the time of writing, it remains significantly higher than the OI seen since December 2024. Rising open interest reflects growing trader participation in BONK futures, indicating heightened speculative activity. BONK open interest across all exchanges.

BONK average perpetual contracts 8-hour funding rate. Source: CoinGlass Increasing funding rates usually suggest that futures traders are bullish, expecting future price increases, which may indicate a continuation of the uptrend. BONK's social dominance remains high, suggesting high social activity. Santiment data shows BONK’s social dominance spiking from 0.091% to 0.572% between April 20 and April 26, driven by BONK’s ecosystem buzz. BONK social dominance and volume. Source: Santiment This surge in chatter on social media platforms reflects rising retail and institutional interest, amplifying FOMO and driving demand. BONK breaks out of a multimonth downtrend On April 13, BONK price broke out of a descending parallel channel, igniting strength that saw it flip the 50-day and 100-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) to support. The bulls will likely continue the rebound toward the significant resistance level at $0.00002410 (200-day SMA) in the short term. A daily candlestick close above this level, accompanied by high volume, could see BONK rise toward the Jan. 19 range high near $0.000040. This would represent a 104% increase from the current price. BONK/USD daily chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView The sharp rise in the relative strength index and its position at 71 in the overbought region reinforces the buyers’ dominance in the market. However, the overbought conditions could facilitate profit-taking, occasioning a slight correction before BONK continues its uptrend. “$BONK’s descending trendline got cleared,” declared popular analyst World of Charts in an April 28 post on X, “expecting 2x in the coming days.” Meanwhile, Crypto Joe spotted BONK breaking out of a bullish pennant in the 30-minute timeframe targeting $0.00002690.

Bitcoin (BTC) reinforces its global dominance, Ethereum (ETH) scales its network upgrades, Ripple (XRP) advances its payment corridors, and Solana (SOL) continues to power blockchain speed innovation.Yet alongside these major players, a new opportunity is drawing increasing attention from serious investors— MAGACOINFINANCE . Those positioned early into expanding ecosystems often find themselves benefiting the most when broader adoption hits. MAGACOINFINANCE Continues Its Strategic Rise The early success of MAGACOINFINANCE has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike. MAGACOINFINANCE saw immediate demand after launch, positioning it as one of the fastest-growing altcoin entries of the year.Investor interest continues climbing as wallets expand and strategic positioning unfolds ahead of larger listings. To strengthen this momentum, MAGACOINFINANCE is still offering a 50% bonus using MAGA50X for early buyers—providing a rare advantage for those entering before full exposure drives valuations higher. Other Key Movers in the Market: LINK, DOT, MATIC, and ADA Chainlink (LINK) maintains leadership in decentralized oracle solutions. Polkadot (DOT) continues advancing blockchain interoperability with its innovative network. Polygon (MATIC) delivers critical scalability enhancements to Ethereum ecosystems. Cardano (ADA) builds on sustainability and peer-reviewed blockchain advancements. While these names remain critical infrastructure pieces, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the kind of early entry window that only comes around once in a cycle. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Standing Out From Other Tokens Investor behavior highlights that MAGACOINFINANCE is attracting a level of organic early-stage traction rarely seen today.Built on strong fundamentals, growing community activity, and analyst interest, MAGACOINFINANCE is earning strategic positioning long before broader market discovery. Early-stage momentum often sets the tone for outsized future returns—and MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining ground rapidly. Final Word While Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple (XRP) , and Solana (SOL) continue to drive market excitement, MAGACOINFINANCE is positioning as the top early-stage opportunity for forward-looking investors. Those who move before wider exposure almost always stand to benefit the most.

Alan Williams, 79, appeared before U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan. Williams, who once ran trading at Sutro & Co. in San Francisco, admitted last year that he used insider tips from Lawrence Billimek, a former trader at Nuveen, to place thousands of timely stock bets. Gardephe noted that Williams helped prosecutors build their case against Billimek, but said the sheer scope of illegal trades made a sentence without jail time impossible. Billimek, 54, pleaded guilty in 2023 and received a sentence of five years and 10 months in May. From 2018 through 2023, he shared details of Nuveen’s planned buys and sells with Williams, allowing the retiree to mirror positions before the firm’s own trades moved prices. Investigators said Williams executed 1,697 intraday stock trades flagged by the Consolidated Audit Trail, or CAT, a database that can log as many as 500 billion trade events each day. The SEC found that Williams enjoyed a 97 percent “win rate” during the five-year stretch—odds of less than one in a trillion if achieved by chance, the agency said. Legal scholars have argued that such a pattern could not have been spotted without CAT’s sweeping records. SEC’s trade tracking tool faces resistance Citadel Securities LLC and the American Securities Association sued the SEC in 2023, contending the regulator lacked congressional approval to run the database. Republican lawmakers echoed those concerns, warning that CAT might expose investors’ personal or political information. Donald Trump’s return to the White House and the publication of the conservative “Project 2025” policy blueprint have pushed the debate inside the commission. Paul Atkins , sworn in as SEC chair last week, told senators during his confirmation hearing that CAT’s costs had “ballooned” and that its scope “has kind of veered off.” He has ordered a review of the project. Financial-industry lobbying began even before Atkins took office. The SEC has already removed direct personal identifiers such as names and birth years from CAT data. In February, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association urged the commission to halt fee collections tied to the system while its future is decided. CAT has recently triggered two more enforcement actions Alongside the Nuveen matter, the SEC credits CAT with triggering two other recent enforcement actions. In November, a Federal Reserve Bank examiner pleaded guilty to trading on secrets about firms he supervised. The following month, a Florida day trader settled claims that he used thousands of fake “spoof” orders to nudge thinly traded stocks. Standing before Judge Gardephe on Monday, Williams, who has advanced Parkinson’s disease, apologized “to the court, my family, and Nuveen’s employees and clients,” adding, “I’m embarrassed and ashamed.” Federal guidelines called for 57 to 71 months. The maximum possible term was 75 years, though such penalties are rare in white-collar cases. Prosecutors said the pair used prepaid “burner” phones to avoid detection. On one August 2022 morning, they made more than $55,000 by shorting Match Group Inc. shares just before Nuveen unloaded a large block. Williams had asked the judge to spare him prison, calling himself “an uncommonly decent and giving man.” Gardephe rejected that plea, citing the “blatant nature” of the wrongdoing and the sheer volume of illegal trades. Under a forfeiture order filed later Monday, Williams agreed to give up more than $35 million held in Charles Schwab Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. accounts, along with a six-bedroom, six-bathroom home in West Linn, Oregon.

This New Crypto Might Be the Best ROI Play Before Exchange Listings Begin,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/120x-in-sight-this-new-crypto-might-be-the-best-roi-play-before-exchange-listings-begin/,"When searching for the best crypto to buy now, it pays to look at projects with real mechanics behind them. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently trades at just $0.025 in its presale, yet its setup points to dramatic upside. With exchange listings still ahead, early participants enjoy a rare window to secure tokens at a low entry price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum combines two lending options—peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P)—to cover a wide range of user needs. In P2C, you deposit familiar assets like ETH, USDC, or USDT into shared liquidity pools. Borrowers then draw from these pools by locking collateral, while lenders earn a dynamic APY that adjusts with usage: single digits when demand is light and mid-teens during busy periods. Loan-to-value (LTV) thresholds keep the system stable. For example, someone locking $1,000 worth of USDC might be allowed to borrow up to $900 in mixed assets at a 90% LTV. That ensures lenders remain overcollateralized and borrowers retain upside potential on their original holdings. This balance gives conservative users confidence and keeps risk aligned with activity. On the P2P side, two users negotiate terms directly, opening the door for more specialized tokens. Imagine lending LINK at a 12% rate with a 75% LTV—you lock in returns on an otherwise idle position without needing centralized approval. This flexibility attracts experienced DeFi participants who want bespoke deals on assets not usually supported in pooled contracts. What really fuels MUTM’s growth, however, is its revenue-driven tokenomics. Mutuum channels a portion of its protocol fees into buying MUTM on the open market. Those tokens are then awarded to users holding mtTokens, the interest-accruing receipts you receive when you deposit. This creates a steady buying pressure that naturally raises demand. The presale itself highlights the project’s momentum. Half of the current phase is already sold, and there are eleven phases in total. Each upcoming round increases the price, so delaying your purchase means losing ground on guaranteed upside. That ticking clock adds a real sense of urgency for anyone weighing what cryptocurrency to invest in before prices climb. Analysts are eyeing MUTM for a potential 120x return once it lists on major exchanges. To illustrate, a $1,400 investment at today’s presale price could theoretically grow to around $168,000 When MUTM reaches $3. These projections stem from concrete protocol mechanics—growing lending volume, expanding peer markets, and ongoing buybacks. Beyond lending and borrowing, Mutuum is rolling out an overcollateralized stablecoin that adds another layer of utility. Users will mint a USD-pegged token by locking excess collateral above the required ratio. When these stablecoins are repaid or liquidated, they’re burned, keeping supply balanced. Interest from stablecoin loans flows directly into the protocol’s treasury, creating yet another revenue stream for token buybacks. This layered ecosystem—dynamic pools, custom peer contracts, a stablecoin, and revenue-tied tokenomics—positions Mutuum as a standout in the DeFi space. It isn’t about chasing the next meme coin pump. Instead, it’s about building an engine for sustainable growth and real yield. For those plotting their portfolios ahead of the next altcoin rally, securing MUTM at $0.025 represents one of the most strategic moves available today. With exchange listings still on the horizon, the presale offers a low-cost entry into a protocol engineered for compounding value. As the market shifts toward projects with genuine utility, Mutuum Finance stands ready to reward early believers. In a world where many ask which crypto to buy today for long-term, Mutuum’s blend of concrete mechanics and limited presale pricing makes it a compelling choice. Don’t let the low ticket price fool you—this is a DeFi project built for outsized returns.

The board will act as the “security council to protect the heart and soul” of the foundation and set visions for Ethereum, while the new management will be focused on the strategic and operational execution of those visions, the Foundation said in an April 28 blog post . It added in an April 28 X post that Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak were appointed as co-executive directors on March 2 to deliver on those visions — which are centered around championing censorship resistance, open-source innovation, privacy and security Wang and Stańczak’s roles took effect on April 28 with the foundation setting a two-year term for Stańczak to address some of Ethereum’s biggest challenges. Stańczak’s new role will be balanced with his work as founder of Ethereum infrastructure firm Nethermind and a soon-to-be-announced Ethereum-focused venture capital firm. Source: Ethereum Foundation Bastian Aue and Josh Stark are also a part of the management team, with Aue to focus on organizational strategy, hiring and training, and Stark to primarily be tasked with project execution, communications and marketing. The board consists of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin , the Ethereum Foundation’s President Aya Miyaguchi, Swiss counsel Patrick Storchenegger, and Wang, who will bridge between the board and management team. Related: ‘Vitalik: An Ethereum Story’ is less about crypto and more about being human Buterin will continue providing technical and intellectual guidance on the Ethereum ecosystem, Miyaguchi will oversee the foundation’s vision while managing external relationships, and Storchenegger will keep handling legal and compliance matters. The board was responsible for selecting Wang and Stańczak as executive directors — a decision they acknowledged was unconventional — and they also have the power to terminate those positions. The Ethereum Foundation has adopted a more active role in the Ethereum ecosystem in recent months, following criticism from Synthetix founder Kain Warwick that the foundation “doesn’t care” about decentralized finance innovation. Others in the Ethereum community previously attributed the foundation’s lack of engagement and leadership to Ether’s ( ETH ) poor price performance relative to Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Solana ( SOL ). Ethereum Foundation’s main focus is scaling The Foundation said its three main focus areas over the next 12 months would be to scale the Ethereum layer 1, scale blobs at the layer 2 level, and improve user experience. Ethereum Foundation researcher Dankrad Feist and protocol support Sophia Gold have already pitched proposals to to address Ethereum’s scaling woes at the base layer under Ethereum Improvement Proposals-9678 and 9698. Both EIPs look to raise the gas limit, which should theoretically raise Ethereum’s transaction throughput by the same magnitude.

On-Chain Data Provides Hints,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-rally-stalled-on-chain-data-provides-hints/,"On-chain data shows a few Bitcoin indicators are following a trajectory that could potentially explain the reason why the latest rally has taken a pause. Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics Have Seen Bearish Developments Recently In a new post on X, an analyst has talked about how a few on-chain indicators related to Bitcoin have changed recently. The first metric of relevance is the “Exchange Reserve,” which measures the total amount of BTC that’s sitting in the wallets associated with centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Sell, But Bitcoin’s Key Investors Are Buying Below is the chart shared by the quant showing the trend in this indicator: As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Reserve plunged alongside the recent price rally, suggesting the investors withdrew a large number of tokens from exchanges. Generally, large withdrawals can be a sign that the holders are accumulating, so it could have been this buying activity that helped provide the fuel for the price rally. From the chart, it’s apparent that in the last few days, the decline has ended and the indicator has taken to sideways movement. It may be no coincidence that the asset’s surge, too, has taken a pause alongside this trend. For now, outflows are still balancing out inflows, but the indicator can be kept an eye on, as a reversal to net deposits could prove to be bearish for the cryptocurrency. Another obstacle to the rally could be the fact that the investors have been participating in profit-taking recently. The metric that shows this trend is the Net Realized Profit and Loss (NRPL), which keeps track of the net amount of profit or loss that Bitcoin investors as a whole are realizing through their transactions. Just earlier, the NRPL observed a large negative spike corresponding to a realized loss of $2 billion, but with the rally, its value has seen a sharp reversal into the positive territory. At the peak of this profit-taking spree, the metric managed to achieve a value of around $3 billion. Another metric, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), also confirms the dominance of profit-taking. The SOPR, much like NRPL, deals with profit/loss realization. The difference lies in that the NRPL shows the net situation, while the SOPR calculates the ratio between profit and loss. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Realizing $139 Million In Profit Per Hour This Rally, Report Says As for which investors have been participating in the profit-taking, it would appear whale-sized entities (investors with more than 1,000 BTC) have been making some large moves. These humongous investors tend to carry some influence in the market, so their transfers are generally to look out for. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $95,000, up around 10% in the last week.

PI was last changing hands around $0.61, having slipped back below its 21DMA amid a bearish breakout from a short-term pennant pattern. That suggests, in the short-term, price risks are titled towards the downside. The near-term bearish technical outlook syncs with bearish token fundamentals. Since the launch of the Open Network in February and an initial hype-fueled price spike up to $3.0 per token, the Pi Network price has slumped over 80% amid major token unlocks, that could continue to weigh on the price in the near-future.

And one analyst thinks the catalyst could be coming up in just over two weeks. This Key Catalyst Could Spark Breakout “I am fairly confident that the price pumping of Pi might start during the Consensus Summit (May 14–16, 2025)” widely followed analyst Dr Altcoin said in a recent X post. Pi is doing well! I am fairly confident that the price pumping of Pi might start during the Consensus Summit (May 14–16, 2025) rather than at the end of August when Pi unlocking significantly reduces. pic.twitter.com/iaSDGzqwYa — Dr Altcoin (@Dr_Picoin) April 27, 2025 That’s instead of the pump coming at “the end of August when Pi unlocking significantly reduces”, he added. Pi Network is a sponsor of the event, one of the biggest summits in crypto, and its founder Nicholas Kalallis is one of the speakers. A major Pi Network price recovery would likely see PI reach all the way back to its 50% Fibonnaci retracement from the April lows under $0.40 to the record highs near $3.0, which is around $1.70. That could mean a rally of nearly 3x from current levels. So now might be a good time for investors with a high risk tolerance to consider getting into the market. The Pi Network’s price is likely to perform well in the long run due to its growing user base and innovative mobile mining model, which fosters widespread adoption and sustained demand. A potential surge to new record highs next year could be driven by the project’s mainnet launch and increasing merchant acceptance, significantly boosting its utility and market confidence.

TRUMP is up 2.3% today and 83% over the past week , now trading at $15.13 . Despite the impressive rally, the coin remains about 79.4% below its all-time high of $73.43 , set just days after Trump’s inauguration. Even so, TRUMP is currently the best-performing meme coin among the top five by market cap — outpacing the likes of Dogecoin ($DOGE), which, despite backing from Tesla/SpaceX/X CEO Elon Musk, has stayed flat over the past day and gained just 12% over the past week. Trump’s VIP dinner for the 220 top TRUMP donors attracted a lot of criticism, with Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff calling for Trump’s impeachment . TRUMP Price Prediction: Where Will TRUMP go Next? TRUMP’s rally still looks strong, and the momentum could easily extend if the team continues to capitalize on the current excitement. As shown in the chart, TRUMP had been grinding lower for months — until a major breakout triggered a sharp move higher, reversing the downtrend with powerful buying pressure. While some short-term profit-taking is visible — with the RSI cooling to 70.99 — the token has successfully consolidated above key levels, suggesting it’s building a base for another potential leg up. The broader meme coin market is slightly down 0.3% over the past 24 hours, but TRUMP’s $1.7 billion 24-hour trading volume signals that serious attention remains on the project. If bullish momentum returns to the sector, traders will be eyeing a move toward the $20 mark as the next big target.

The report claims Elon used his heavy influence to kill investigations, dodge enforcement, and wipe away lawsuits tied to his businesses. It says Elon’s so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” helped shred Washington’s agencies while President Donald Trump openly backed the aggressive cuts. Democrats now say Elon’s upcoming exit from DOGE operations could be more about escaping scrutiny than anything else. They accuse Elon, the world’s richest man, of turning the government into a personal tool to “evade oversight, derail investigations, and make litigation disappear whenever he so chooses—on his terms and at his command,” the report said. The Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations put together the 44-page memo outlining how deep Elon’s mess ran. Summary of Elon Musk’s exposure by investigations and litigation. Source: Senate Democrats On Trump’s inauguration day, Elon’s companies – including SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and xAI – were already facing at least 65 active or possible regulatory or enforcement actions from 11 different federal agencies, that much we’re all certain of. These open cases stacked up to $2.37 billion in potential financial risk. At Tesla, investigators flagged $1.19 billion in possible liability for allegedly lying about the capabilities of its autopilot and self-driving features. Neuralink, Elon’s brain chip venture, faced $281 million in potential penalties for allegedly making false claims about risks tied to its products. Neuralink also risked another $1.59 million in civil and criminal fines tied to alleged violations of the Animal Welfare Act. The report says Elon wasn’t just trying to protect one company — he had a full empire to shield. Senate pushes Elon for answers before May deadline Democrats said Elon’s behavior has one clear goal: boost his own wealth by crushing any roadblocks. “The through line connecting many of Mr. Elon’s decisions appears to be self-enrichment and avoiding what he perceives as obstacles to advancing his interests,” the memo said. Senate staffers also warned that the true benefits Elon has pocketed through these tactics “may never be known, and that is by design. The silence is strategic, and it is dangerous.” Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who is the ranking member of the committee, sent out formal letters demanding answers from all five Elon-run companies. Blumenthal wants each business to spill the details about the investigations it faced before Trump took office, and explain how they made sure Elon’s DOGE government work wasn’t used to interfere with those probes. Blumenthal told them to respond by May 11, leaving Elon and his companies little time to come up with the paperwork. The White House, as per usual, blasted the Democrats’ claims. The Trump administration denied that Elon’s government role was ever used for personal or financial gain. “Any assertion otherwise is completely false and defamatory,” the White House said in a statement. In an emailed response, Steven Cheung, Trump’s communications director, said Blumenthal “is clearly suffering from a debilitating and uncurable case of Trump Derangement Syndrome that has wilted his brain.” Elon’s DOGE involvement and his company problems are now tangled deeper than ever. Senate Democrats aren’t just asking questions; they’re digging into years of investigations, fines, and allegations Elon tried to erase while riding the government machine. Every case connected to Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and xAI carries a dollar amount and a paper trail, and the memo hints there might be even more hidden under the surface. Democrats said Elon’s control wasn’t random or messy – it was sharp, calculated, and designed to crush anything standing in his way. They pointed to the government cuts, the regulatory silencing, and the dismantled agencies as part of Elon’s game plan. The White House may laugh it off, but Senate Democrats want answers in black and white. With a hard May 11 deadline looming, Elon’s companies can either open the books, or deal with a full-blown Senate fight.

Through the venture, 150 million merchants across the Mastercard network will now have the option to receive payments in stablecoins , regardless of how a customer pays, Mastercard said on April 28. The payments giant also partnered with crypto exchange OKX for a crypto-enabled bank card, which Mastercard product chief Jorn Lambert said creates a “360-degree approach” where consumers can spend stablecoins and merchants can receive them. He added that the “mainstream use cases are clear” for blockchain tech, and the company wanted “to make it as easy for merchants to receive stablecoin payments and for consumers to use them.” Source: Mastercard News The stablecoin market has continued to make gains, crossing a market value of $230 billion, an increase of 54% since last year , with Tether ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) dominating 90% of the market. Active stablecoin wallets have also increased over 50% in one year, according to a report last month from onchain analysis platforms Artemis and Dune. Investment banking giant Citigroup predicted in an April 23 report that a combination of growing regulatory support and adoption by financial institutions has set the stage for the stablecoin market to reach as high as $3.7 trillion by 2030. Mastercard launches another crypto card Mastercard said its partnership with OKX for the so-called OKX Card aims to give crypto users “easy access to their funds” and integrate stablecoins into daily transactions. OKX marketing chief Haider Rafique said the exchange’s venture with Mastercard is “a significant step toward integrating stablecoins into daily transactions and creating richer experiences.” Related: Mastercard tokenized 30% of its transactions in 2024 Crypto wallet maker MetaMask also partnered with Mastercard on April 28 to launch a crypto payments card allowing users to spend self-custodied funds, using smart contracts to execute the IRL (In Real Life) transactions, with a processing speed under five seconds.

Financial giant Mastercard has just made a major move into the world of stablecoin payments, announcing new capabilities designed to integrate these digital assets more deeply into everyday transactions. This isn’t just a minor update; it signals a growing acceptance and strategic push by traditional payment networks to embrace the potential of cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins. Mastercard’s Ambitious Stablecoin Capabilities Mastercard is rolling out a suite of new capabilities aimed at making stablecoins more functional within its vast network. These initiatives focus on several key areas: Wallet Integration: Making it easier for digital wallets to connect and interact with Mastercard’s network, potentially allowing users to spend stablecoins directly from their wallets. Merchant Settlement: Exploring ways for merchants to accept stablecoin payments and potentially settle transactions in stablecoins or easily convert them to fiat. On-Chain Remittances: Streamlining cross-border payments using stablecoins, leveraging the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology for remittances. This move by Mastercard indicates a clear recognition of stablecoins’ potential as a more efficient and cost-effective method for certain types of transactions compared to traditional systems. By building infrastructure for Mastercard stablecoin use, they are laying the groundwork for wider adoption. Introducing the OKX Card: Bridging Crypto Trading and Global Payments Adding to the excitement, Mastercard is partnering with leading crypto exchange OKX to launch the “OKX Card.” This collaboration is a direct link between the crypto trading world and Mastercard’s extensive global payment network. CoinDesk reported on this significant development, highlighting how the OKX Card aims to make spending crypto as simple as using a regular debit or credit card. How does the OKX Card potentially work? While specific details are still emerging, the general idea behind such crypto-linked cards is straightforward: Users hold cryptocurrency (including stablecoins) in their linked OKX account. When a purchase is made using the OKX Card at a Mastercard-accepting merchant, the necessary amount of crypto is converted to the local fiat currency at the point of sale. Mastercard processes the transaction through its traditional network. This mechanism allows users to leverage their crypto holdings for everyday purchases without needing to manually convert funds beforehand, offering unprecedented convenience and liquidity for crypto assets. Why are Mastercard’s Crypto Payment Moves So Significant? Mastercard’s foray into stablecoins and its partnership with OKX for the OKX Card represent more than just new product launches. They signify a major validation of cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins, by a global financial powerhouse. Here’s why this is a big deal: Mainstream Adoption: Mastercard’s network reaches millions of merchants and billions of consumers worldwide. Integrating stablecoins into this network could dramatically accelerate mainstream crypto payments adoption. Bridging TradFi and Crypto: This move further blurs the lines between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi), creating pathways for easier interaction and utilization of digital assets within the existing financial infrastructure. Increased Utility for Stablecoins: By enabling stablecoins for payments and remittances, Mastercard is enhancing their real-world utility beyond just trading or holding. Competition and Innovation: This could spur other traditional payment networks and financial institutions to accelerate their own crypto and stablecoin initiatives, driving innovation in the space. This isn’t just about enabling spending; it’s about integrating the underlying technology and assets into the core financial plumbing. The Power of Stablecoin Payments: Benefits for Users and Businesses The focus on stablecoin payments by Mastercard highlights the unique advantages these digital assets offer: For Users: Stability: Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This makes them suitable for transactions and payments without the risk of price swings. Speed: Transactions on blockchain networks can often be faster than traditional banking transfers, especially for cross-border payments. Lower Costs: Depending on the network and transaction type, stablecoin transactions can potentially involve lower fees compared to traditional methods, particularly for international remittances. Accessibility: Stablecoins can be accessed and used by anyone with an internet connection and a crypto wallet, potentially banking the unbanked or underbanked populations globally. For Businesses/Merchants: Reduced Fees: Accepting stablecoin payments might offer lower transaction fees compared to traditional card processing fees. Faster Settlement: Settlement times can potentially be reduced, improving cash flow. Global Reach: Stablecoins facilitate easier transactions with international customers without dealing with complex currency conversions or high fees. Innovation: Offering stablecoin payment options can attract tech-savvy customers and position businesses at the forefront of payment innovation. By integrating stablecoins into their network, Mastercard is unlocking these benefits for a much wider audience. Mastercard Crypto Initiatives: Paving the Way for Mainstream Adoption? Mastercard’s recent announcements are part of a broader strategy to engage with the digital asset space. The company has been exploring various aspects of Mastercard crypto integration for some time, including NFTs, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and now stablecoins and crypto-linked cards. Their approach seems to be one of cautious yet determined exploration and integration. Instead of building a separate crypto network from scratch, Mastercard is leveraging its existing infrastructure and relationships to bridge the gap between the traditional financial world and the burgeoning crypto economy. This strategic positioning allows them to tap into the innovation of crypto while providing the familiarity, security, and regulatory compliance expected by consumers and businesses using their network. What Challenges Lie Ahead? While the potential is immense, integrating stablecoins and crypto payments into a global network like Mastercard’s isn’t without challenges: Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins and cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Navigating different rules in different jurisdictions is complex. Consumer Education: Educating the general public about stablecoins and how to use crypto-linked cards safely and effectively is crucial for adoption. Technical Integration: Ensuring seamless and secure integration of blockchain technology with existing legacy systems requires significant technical effort. Security: Protecting users from fraud, hacks, and scams in the crypto space is paramount. Volatility (for non-stablecoin crypto): While the focus here is on stablecoins, cards like the OKX Card might allow spending of other cryptocurrencies. Managing the volatility of these assets at the point of sale requires robust systems. Mastercard and its partners like OKX will need to address these challenges effectively to build trust and ensure widespread adoption. Looking Ahead: The Future of Payments Mastercard’s move is a strong indicator that digital assets, particularly stablecoins, are increasingly being viewed not just as speculative investments but as tools for actual commerce and payments. The partnership with OKX for the OKX Card is a concrete step towards making crypto holdings spendable in the real world. As infrastructure improves, regulatory frameworks mature, and user understanding grows, we can expect to see more integrations like this, potentially reshaping the future of global payments. The collaboration between traditional finance giants and crypto native companies is likely to be a key theme in this evolution. In Summary Mastercard’s launch of new stablecoin capabilities for wallet integration, merchant settlement, and on-chain remittances, coupled with its partnership with OKX for the OKX Card, marks a significant milestone. This initiative aims to bridge the gap between the traditional Mastercard network and the growing world of stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. By enhancing the utility of stablecoins for everyday transactions and providing a convenient way to spend crypto via the OKX Card, Mastercard is taking a bold step towards enabling mainstream crypto payments. While challenges remain, particularly regarding regulation and education, these developments highlight the increasing relevance of stablecoin payments and Mastercard’s commitment to exploring the potential of Mastercard crypto initiatives. This is a powerful move that could accelerate the integration of digital assets into the global economy.

ADA has been finding support as of late as it falls back towards its 50DMA around $0.6750, which it broke through during last week’s broad crypto market rally. Per CoinMarketCap , Cardano’s market cap was last around $24.7 billion. This sends an important signal about the market’s near-term outlook – the break back above the 50DMA suggests that the bearish trend of late March/April has been snapped. Risks are thus now tilted towards a continued Cardano price recovery. A return to recent highs in the $1.20-30 area are even possible. That said, its very unlikely that a new altcoin season is about to arrive and send ADA back to its 2021 record highs above $3.0. That’s because macro uncertainties remain elevated. Yes, US President Trump has seemingly turned down the heat slightly in his trade wars. But uncertainty about trade policy remains elevated. And cracks are already appearing in the US economy, as survey data released on Monday illustrated. Ouch: April ⁦ @DallasFed ⁩ Manufacturing Index down to -35.8 vs. -14.2 est. & -16.3 prior … new orders down to -20 (-0.1 prior), shipments down to -5.5 (+6.1 prior), prices paid up to +48.4 (+37.7 prior), and employment up to -3.9 (-4.6 prior) pic.twitter.com/AXdv26GZ5h — Liz Ann Sonders (@LizAnnSonders) April 28, 2025 With risks rising that the US economy tilts into recession rising, and global economic uncertainty high amid the trade war, and the world’s most important central bank the Fed worried about “sticky inflation” (and thus r eluctant to save the day via monetary policy easing ), this isn’t exactly the environment for altcoin season to launch the Cardano price moonwards. That means that, while ADA could see further upside in the coming weeks, a breakout of recent multi-month ranges isn’t likely. Cardano’s Long-Term Bull Case: A Strategic Accumulation Opportunity Despite a neutral medium-term outlook, Cardano presents a compelling long-term investment opportunity. While trailing rivals such as Ethereum and Solana in terms of adoption, Cardano’s robust fundamentals and strategic roadmap position it for significant growth, potentially reaching $10 by the end of Trump’s term in 2029. Investors should thus view the current range-bound price action as a chance to accumulate. Cardano’s blockchain excels in scalability, sustainability, and security, leveraging its Ouroboros proof-of-stake protocol. Its focus on rigorous academic research ensures a resilient foundation, distinguishing it from competitors. A key bullish narrative is Cardano’s ambition to become the premier Bitcoin DeFi chain, enabling seamless integration of Bitcoin’s liquidity into decentralized finance applications.

That’s especially the case against the backdrop of a historically favorable global regulatory backdrop for the crypto industry, spearheaded by the ardently pro-crypto Trump administration’s efforts to bolster the industry. However, with a market cap still modest compared to rivals, Cardano offers asymmetric return potential. Strategic investors can capitalize on current consolidation to build positions in a blockchain poised for exponential growth over the next four years.

In an April 28 letter to White House crypto czar David Sacks , the group urged President Donald Trump “to take immediate action to discontinue the Biden-era Department of Justice's lawless campaign to criminalize open-source software development.” The letter specifically mentioned the prosecution of Storm, who was charged in August 2023 with helping launder over $1 billion in crypto through Tornado Cash. His trial is still set for July , and his fellow charged co-founder, Roman Semenov, is at large and believed to be in Russia. The DeFi Education Fund said that in Storm’s case, the Department of Justice is attempting to hold software developers criminally liable for how others use their code, which is “not only absurd in principle, but it sets a precedent that potentially chills all crypto development in the United States.” The group also called for the recognition that the prosecution contradicts the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) guidance from Trump’s first term, which established that developers of self-custodial, peer-to-peer protocols are not money transmitters. Source: DeFi Education Fund “This kind of legal environment does not just chill innovation — it freezes it,” they argued. The letter added that it also “empowers politically-motivated enforcement and puts every open-source developer at risk, regardless of industry.” In January, a federal court in Texas ruled that the Treasury overstepped its authority by sanctioning Tornado Cash. Stakes could not be higher The group thanked Trump for his support of the industry and his stated goal to make America the “crypto capital of the planet.” They added, however, that his goal can’t be realized if developers are prosecuted for building tools that enable the technology. “We ask President Trump to protect American software developers, restore legal clarity, and end this unlawful DOJ overreach. The job’s not finished, and the stakes could not be higher.” Related: Tornado Cash dev wants charges dropped after court said OFAC ‘overstepped’ Variant Fund chief legal officer Jake Chervinsky said the Justice Department’s case against Storm is “an outdated remnant of the Biden administration's war on crypto.” “There is no justification in law or policy for prosecuting software developers for launching non-custodial smart contract protocols,” he added. At the time of writing, the petition had attracted 232 signatures from industry executives and developers, including Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang, and Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko, among others.

This kind of engagement from a figure with CZ’s track record is invaluable for early-stage ventures navigating the complex landscape of decentralized technology. Understanding YZiLabs and the Role of Crypto Venture Capital While not as widely publicized as some major venture funds, YZiLabs appears to be playing a role in identifying and nurturing promising Crypto Projects . The specific nature of YZiLabs (whether it’s an incubator, accelerator, or pure venture fund) isn’t detailed in CZ’s post, but its function is clear: providing support to new ventures in the space. This highlights the crucial role of Crypto Venture Capital in driving innovation. Early funding and strategic guidance are essential for turning ambitious ideas into functional, impactful decentralized applications and platforms. Investors and labs like YZiLabs act as catalysts, providing the resources and network that Web3 Startups desperately need to get off the ground and scale.

43927168,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=717288,1745893873,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/43927168.jpeg,What Wall Street expects from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway earnings,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/what-wall-street-expects-berkshire-earnings/,"Wall Street is already laying its bets on Berkshire Hathaway before the company releases its first-quarter earnings on May 2. According to a CNBC report on Monday, UBS analyst Brian Meredith is pushing even harder on the company’s Class B stock, calling the so-called “Baby Berkshire” a “safe haven in a turbulent environment.” Meredith stuck to his previous buy rating but pushed the 12-month price target higher to $606 per share from $557. That is about a 14% rise from yesterday’s $530.96 closing price. Meredith also moved up his first-quarter earnings estimate to $4.89 per share from $4.81, driven by improved loss ratios at Geico, which sits as one of Warren Buffett’s major holdings. Shares of Berkshire’s Class B stock have already climbed nearly 18% in 2025. Even with Donald Trump back in the White House and tariffs rolling out, Meredith said Geico could handle the impact. “We expect tariffs to potentially increase claims costs by 3% – 4% at Geico, however, given current profitability, Geico may be able to absorb the additional costs without raising prices and stay within target margins,” Meredith said. Meredith is also keeping his eyes open for any hints about how Berkshire plans to use its massive $334 billion cash pile, an amount that has reached record levels for the company. On top of all that, analysts polled by FactSet are forecasting first-quarter earnings per share of $4.72 on revenue of $90.8 billion. Buffett’s wealth balloons as Berkshire stock powers higher At 94 years old, Warren’s fortune is swelling alongside Berkshire Hathaway’s stock price. His net worth jumped by $23.7 billion so far in 2025, hitting $166 billion, Bloomberg Billionaire Index reported. The surge amounts to a 16.7% gain year-to-date, largely powered by the strong run of Berkshire’s Class B shares. As of the latest figures, the stock closed at $534.29, up 19% this year. Warren’s financial empire is basically tied to Berkshire, accounting for around 99.5% of his net worth, as he has repeatedly pointed out in public statements. Even after a minor dip of $260 million—or 0.2%—on the most recent trading day, Warren’s financial standing is still firmly locked in. Berkshire’s November 2024 filings show that the Oracle of Omaha owns about 37.4% of the company’s Class A shares, while his Class B holdings are almost too small to matter. Warren’s limited non-Berkshire assets haven’t changed much in over a decade. In that infamous letter he wrote to Congressman Tim Huelskamp back in 2011, and through disclosures since 2010, Warren said that any non-Berkshire investments he holds are basically pocket change compared to his main holdings. He once had stakes in Wells Fargo and US Bancorp, but those added up to less than 1% of his total fortune and still do today. Time hasn’t really helped those outside investments either. Market changes, dividend reinvestments, and asset sales have changed their values around, but they remain tiny compared to his Berkshire mountain. The bigger picture here is that his playbook hasn’t needed adjusting even through the roughest economic seasons. His no-drama approach has carried him through inflation, market collapses, and economic slowdowns. All in all, Warren’s steady hands have turned his Berkshire holdings into the ultimate fortress against market chaos for Wall Street, proving once again that he might be the greatest investor history has ever recorded.

Recent comments from a high-ranking US official have sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, particularly concerning the US Government Bitcoin Stance . According to a report by Bitcoin Magazine on X, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that America is embracing Bitcoin and that the government will continue to support its growth. This isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a statement from a key figure in the US administration, potentially signaling a significant shift or clarification in how the nation views the leading cryptocurrency. Understanding the Significance of Commerce Secretary Bitcoin Comments When the Commerce Secretary Bitcoin Comments surface, they carry weight. Howard Lutnick is a prominent figure, leading the department responsible for promoting economic growth and technological advancement in the United States. His statement that the US is “embracing” Bitcoin and will “support its growth” is a powerful indicator. It suggests a recognition of Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but potentially as a technology or financial instrument that the US government sees value in fostering within its borders. Why is this particular comment noteworthy? Source Authority: The Commerce Department plays a role in areas like technology policy, international trade, and economic development, all of which intersect with the world of digital assets. Positive Framing: Using words like “embracing” and “support its growth” presents a distinctly positive outlook compared to previous government discussions that often focused heavily on risks and regulation. Potential Signal: Such a statement could signal to businesses, investors, and international partners that the US is looking favorably upon the development and integration of Bitcoin and potentially other digital assets into the economy. While not a legislative announcement, it contributes to the overall narrative and sentiment surrounding the US Government Bitcoin Stance . It contrasts with more cautious or critical perspectives sometimes voiced by other regulatory bodies. How Might Bitcoin Regulation in the US Evolve? The path for Bitcoin Regulation US has been complex and often fragmented. Various agencies like the SEC, CFTC, Treasury, and the Federal Reserve have overlapping jurisdictions and differing views. A statement like Lutnick’s, however, might hint at a potential push towards more coordinated or even favorable regulatory frameworks in the future. Supporting growth often requires providing clarity and reducing uncertainty. Potential directions for Bitcoin Regulation US could include: Clearer Tax Guidance: Simplifying how Bitcoin transactions and holdings are taxed. Framework for Digital Assets: Developing a cohesive regulatory framework that defines different types of digital assets and how they are treated. Innovation-Friendly Policies: Creating sandboxes or guidelines that encourage technological development in the blockchain space without stifling it. Consumer Protection: Implementing rules focused on protecting investors and users without imposing overly burdensome requirements that hinder adoption. This potential evolution in Bitcoin Regulation US is crucial for mainstream adoption and institutional participation. Clarity can unlock significant capital and drive innovation within the country. Analyzing US Crypto Policy: Is a Bullish Future Ahead? The broader US Crypto Policy landscape is a mosaic of different agency actions and congressional discussions. Lutnick’s comments add a potentially bullish piece to this mosaic. A government that actively supports the growth of Bitcoin might be more inclined to adopt policies that foster innovation, attract crypto businesses, and integrate digital assets into the financial system. Historically, the US Crypto Policy has sometimes been perceived as lagging behind other nations in providing regulatory certainty, leading some companies to explore domiciling elsewhere. A supportive stance from the Commerce Department could indicate a desire to change this narrative and position the US as a leader in the digital asset space. Considering the potential implications for US Crypto Policy : Economic Competitiveness: Supporting Bitcoin and blockchain technology can enhance the US’s position in the global digital economy. Job Creation: Growth in the sector leads to new jobs in technology, finance, and related fields. Innovation Hub: Favorable policies can solidify the US as a hub for blockchain development and research. While challenges remain, including concerns around illicit finance, energy consumption, and financial stability, a supportive voice from the Commerce Department is a positive signal for the direction of US Crypto Policy . What Does This Mean for the Future of Bitcoin in US? The potential Future of Bitcoin in US appears brighter if this supportive sentiment translates into concrete policies. Increased government backing, even if primarily rhetorical at this stage, can boost confidence among both retail and institutional investors. The Future of Bitcoin in US could see: Potential Opportunity Possible Impact Increased Institutional Adoption More investment from large funds, corporations, and traditional financial institutions. Broader Retail Access Easier and safer ways for everyday Americans to buy, hold, and use Bitcoin. Technological Integration Bitcoin and blockchain technology used in more sectors beyond finance, such as supply chain or digital identity. Regulatory Clarity Reduced uncertainty for businesses building on Bitcoin and blockchain. However, it’s important to temper expectations. A single statement, while significant, doesn’t instantly solve all the challenges or align all government agencies. The path to a fully integrated Future of Bitcoin in US will likely involve continued debate and policy development. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Enthusiast What should you take away from the Commerce Secretary’s comments and the evolving US Government Bitcoin Stance ? Stay Informed: Keep track of official statements and policy developments from various US government bodies. The landscape is dynamic. Assess Risk: While sentiment might be improving, regulatory uncertainty hasn’t vanished entirely. Understand the risks associated with investing in or building with Bitcoin. Look for Policy Details: Watch for specific legislative proposals or regulatory guidance that follow such high-level statements. That’s where the real impact lies. Understand the Nuances: Remember that different government agencies have different perspectives and mandates regarding digital assets. Lutnick’s comments are a positive data point, suggesting a potential shift towards greater acceptance and support for Bitcoin’s role in the US economy. It’s a signal that proponents of digital assets have been hoping for. Conclusion: A Glimpse of a Supportive Future? The statement from U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick that the US is embracing Bitcoin and will support its growth is a notable development. It provides a glimpse into a potentially more supportive US Government Bitcoin Stance , influencing the discussion around Bitcoin Regulation US and the broader US Crypto Policy . While challenges and regulatory hurdles remain, these Commerce Secretary Bitcoin Comments contribute to a narrative that could shape the promising Future of Bitcoin in US . It’s a powerful signal for innovation and economic growth in the digital asset space, suggesting that key figures in the US administration recognize the potential of Bitcoin and are looking to foster its development domestically.

In the latest FTX News update, the bankrupt crypto exchange has launched a legal offensive to recover assets in a fresh effort to speed up FTX repayments. According to a new press release on PR Newswire , FTX has filed lawsuits against NFT Stars Limited and KUROSEMI INC., the company behind Delysium. FTX claims these firms failed to deliver specific tokens that rightfully belong to its estate, even after multiple reminders and negotiation attempts. With out-of-court talks failing, FTX is now seeking court orders to force the return of the disputed assets. More Lawsuits on the Horizon The legal push may just be getting started. FTX has warned that more lawsuits are coming, targeting other token and coin issuers who are allegedly holding onto assets. The exchange is actively reaching out, but if companies fail to cooperate, they can expect swift legal action. The message is loud and clear: hand over the assets or prepare for a courtroom battle. On the other side, Crypto analyst Eva Lenoir throws shade at FTX’s legal move, sarcastically calling it a “sheriff” act. She questions where this energy was when Sam Bankman-Fried was mishandling users’ funds, suggesting the lawsuits against NFT Stars and Delysium come far too late to matter. Moreover, she also believes that the real losers are small investors who’ll bear the cost. She contrasts the chaos with Bitcoin, calling it strong, unshaken, and still shining. Why FTX Is Ramping Up the Pressure The FTX legal team emphasized that every asset recovery counts. Returning these tokens could significantly boost the funds available for FTX repayments to creditors who are still awaiting compensation after the exchange’s catastrophic collapse. While FTX says it prefers to resolve matters amicably, it has made it clear it will not hesitate to pursue aggressive legal remedies if needed. In its mission to maximize FTX repayments, the collapsed exchange is taking no prisoners. Lawsuits are now firmly on the table, and more companies could soon find themselves in FTX’s crosshairs. FAQ What happened to FTX? FTX collapsed in November 2022 after it was revealed that the company misused customer funds and faced a massive liquidity crisis. This led to bankruptcy, legal investigations, and major losses for users and investors. How are FTX lawsuits connected to FTX repayment efforts? FTX lawsuits aim to recover missing crypto assets from companies and individuals. These recovered assets will directly contribute to increasing the FTX repayment pool for creditors. What caused the FTX collapse? The FTX collapse was caused by alleged fraudulent practices, poor financial management, and misuse of customer deposits. When these issues came to light, users rushed to withdraw funds, exposing the company’s insolvency. Why is FTX suing companies like NFT Stars and Delysium? FTX claims that these companies failed to deliver tokens that were supposed to be transferred to its estate. After unsuccessful attempts to settle the matter outside of court, FTX is now pursuing legal action to recover these assets.",News|Crypto Regulations|Hack,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-29 02:44:17

43927782,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153478,1745895041,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Tornado Cash: Crucial Legal Battle as Crypto Firms Defend Roman Storm,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tornado-cash-roman-storm/,"A significant development is unfolding in the complex world of cryptocurrency regulation and privacy tools, specifically concerning the Tornado Cash case. A coalition of prominent crypto firms has taken a direct step, appealing to the White House to intervene in the criminal proceedings against Roman Storm, a co-founder of the controversial crypto mixer, Tornado Cash. Why Are Crypto Firms Defending Roman Storm Trial? The core of this unprecedented move lies in a letter sent by several leading crypto industry participants to David Sacks, who has been identified as a key figure advising the Trump administration on cryptocurrency matters. The letter, reportedly led by the DeFi Education Fund and signed by major venture capital firms like Paradigm, Multicoin Capital, and 6th Man Ventures, makes a clear plea: drop the criminal case against Roman Storm. Their argument hinges on a recent statement from the Department of Justice (DOJ) that seemingly differentiates between developers of tools and users of those tools for illicit purposes. The DOJ indicated it would not pursue legal action against developers of cryptocurrency mixers and wallets simply because those tools were used in criminal activities by others. The crypto firms argue that prosecuting Roman Storm, a developer of Tornado Cash, directly contradicts this stated policy. The firms believe that holding developers liable for how third parties use open-source software sets a dangerous precedent that could stifle innovation and the development of essential privacy-preserving technologies within the crypto space. They view the case against Storm not just as an attack on one individual, but as a potential threat to the entire ecosystem of decentralized development and financial privacy. Understanding Crypto Mixers Legality and Tornado Cash To fully grasp the stakes involved in the Crypto mixers legality debate and the Tornado Cash situation, it’s important to understand what crypto mixers are and why they are so contentious. What are Crypto Mixers? Crypto mixers, also known as tumbling services, are tools designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin. They work by pooling together cryptocurrency from many users and then sending it out to their respective destinations in a scrambled manner. This process makes it difficult to trace the origin and destination of specific funds, effectively breaking the link between a user’s wallet address and their transaction history. Why are they Controversial? While mixers offer legitimate privacy benefits for users who don’t want their entire financial history public, they have also been exploited by criminals to launder illicit funds. Bad actors, including ransomware gangs and state-sponsored hacking groups, have used services like Tornado Cash to obscure the movement of stolen or illegally obtained cryptocurrency. Tornado Cash, in particular, gained notoriety after the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned it in August 2022, adding specific Tornado Cash addresses to its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list. OFAC alleged that the mixer had been used to launder billions of dollars, including funds stolen by North Korean hackers. The legal challenge arises because Tornado Cash is not a traditional company with employees and a central server. It’s largely a decentralized protocol, governed by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Roman Storm and other co-founders were involved in its initial development and continued maintenance, but they argue they do not control the protocol or the funds that pass through it in the way a traditional financial institution would. Crypto Developer Legal Challenges: A Growing Concern The case against Roman Storm is part of a broader trend of Crypto developer legl challenges being brought by regulators and law enforcement globally. As cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) grow, authorities are grappling with how to apply existing laws, designed for traditional financial systems, to novel, permissionless technologies. Developers of decentralized protocols often argue that they are simply writing and deploying code, akin to creating software. They contend that they should not be held responsible for how individuals choose to use that software, just as the creator of an email protocol isn’t responsible for spam or phishing. Authorities, however, sometimes view developers or key contributors to a protocol as operators of an unlicensed money transmission service or as facilitators of illicit activity, especially if they believe the protocol was designed specifically to evade detection or if the developers profited from its use. The charges against Storm, including conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to commit sanctions violations, reflect this latter perspective. This legal grey area creates significant uncertainty for developers working on decentralized technologies. Will building a privacy feature make them legally liable? Does contributing to an open-source project expose them to criminal charges if someone misuses the code? The crypto firms’ letter to David Sacks underscores this anxiety. They see the prosecution of Roman Storm as a direct threat to the principle of open-source development and the ability to build privacy-preserving tools, which they argue are essential for the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. DOJ Crypto Policy: A Point of Contention The firms’ reference to the recent DOJ crypto policy is particularly insightful. While the specific DOJ announcement they cite might require further clarification, the general sentiment expressed by some U.S. officials has been that enforcement efforts should focus on the *users* of crypto for illicit purposes and the centralized *service providers* who facilitate such activities, rather than solely targeting the developers of the underlying technology. For example, recent actions against centralized exchanges or mixers that operate as businesses (like the charges against the founders of Samourai Wallet) might be seen as more aligned with a focus on service providers. The case against Storm, however, targets a developer of a largely decentralized protocol, which the firms argue falls outside the spirit, if not the letter, of the DOJ’s purported stance on developers. The firms are essentially asking the White House, through David Sacks, to ensure that the actions of the DOJ align with a policy that protects software developers. They argue that prosecuting developers for writing code, even code that can be misused, is fundamentally different from prosecuting individuals or entities who operate services that actively facilitate or engage in illegal financial activities. Key Arguments from the Crypto Firms’ Letter (Based on Reporting): Prosecuting Roman Storm contradicts the DOJ’s recent indication that it won’t target developers simply for creating tools used in crime. Tornado Cash is open-source software; developers should not be liable for the actions of third-party users. The case sets a dangerous precedent for decentralized and privacy-focused development. Privacy tools are necessary for legitimate reasons in the digital age. Efforts to imprison Roman Storm should be dropped to protect innovation. What Happens Next? The Roman Storm Trial Approaches Despite the industry’s plea, the legal wheels continue to turn. Roman Storm’s trial is currently scheduled to begin in New York in July. This trial is poised to be a landmark case, potentially setting significant legal precedents regarding developer liability, the nature of decentralized protocols, and the application of anti-money laundering and sanctions laws to code. The defense is expected to argue that Storm merely contributed to open-source code and did not operate an unlicensed money transmitting business or conspire to violate sanctions. They will likely emphasize the decentralized nature of Tornado Cash and the lack of control developers had over its operation once deployed. The prosecution will likely focus on the design of Tornado Cash, its alleged use by sanctioned entities and criminals, and potentially any actions taken by the developers that could be construed as facilitating or profiting from its illicit use. The outcome of this trial will be closely watched by developers, investors, and regulators worldwide. Implications for the Future of Crypto and Privacy The outcome of the Roman Storm trial and the response (or lack thereof) to the crypto firms’ letter could have profound implications: Developer Chilling Effect: A conviction could deter developers from working on any open-source projects that could potentially be misused, even if they have legitimate purposes. Future of Privacy Tools: Increased legal risk could make it harder to develop and use tools designed to enhance financial privacy on blockchains. Regulatory Clarity (or lack thereof): The trial’s verdict and subsequent appeals will help shape the legal interpretation of decentralized protocols and developer responsibility. Industry Advocacy: The letter highlights the growing willingness of crypto firms to engage directly with policymakers and defend individuals facing legal challenges they deem unjust or harmful to the industry’s principles. This situation encapsulates the ongoing tension between the decentralized, permissionless nature of crypto technology and the desire of nation-states to maintain control over financial flows and prevent illicit activity. The crypto firms are advocating for a framework where tools can be built freely, while the responsibility for misuse falls squarely on the user, not the creator of the code. A Crucial Juncture for Decentralized Development The letter from leading crypto firms to the White House regarding the Roman Storm case is more than just a plea for one individual; it’s a forceful statement about the future direction of the industry. They are highlighting the perceived contradiction in government policy and arguing that prosecuting developers for creating open-source software poses an existential threat to the principles of decentralization and privacy that underpin much of the crypto ecosystem. As the Roman Storm trial approaches, the outcome remains uncertain. However, the industry’s unified voice in defending a developer against criminal charges signals a growing determination to push back against what they see as overreach that could stifle innovation and criminalize code. The world is watching to see how the U.S. legal system will grapple with these complex issues at the intersection of technology, finance, and individual liberty.

This AI-powered DeFi juggernaut is not just catching up. It’s blazing past the meme coins with real-world utility, cutting-edge tech, and a staggering user base of over 285,000 beta participants. Combine that with a jaw-dropping $17.38 million already secured in presale, and it’s easy to see why investors are shifting their gaze and funds toward RCOF. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu’s Market Struggles As the broader market fluctuates, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu face turbulent waters. As of now, Dogecoin (DOGE) is priced at $0.1852 after a 3.1% decline in the past day, whereas Shiba Inu (SHIB) has risen by 6.47% to $0.000014 , fueled partly by momentum from its bold ShibTorch campaign. But the numbers tell a deeper story. Dogecoin’s trading volume has dropped by 8.78% , suggesting that trader interest is starting to cool off. Shiba Inu, often seen as Dogecoin’s closest rival, is similarly hindered by massive whale concentrations, with large holders triggering flash sell-offs that rattle market confidence. Dogecoin has built a strong community and brand through its unique cultural appeal, and investors continue to support its presence in the market. At the same time, RCO Finance is gaining attention for its real-world applications and business-grade innovation, attracting those seeking broader utility and long-term growth potential. Investors are growing weary of hype-driven assets and turning instead to platforms offering real value, and RCO Finance is answering that call. $7.5M VC Surge Fuels RCOF’s Meteoric Rise What sets RCO Finance (RCOF) apart is not just tech or timing. It’s trust. A staggering $7.5 million secured from a top-tier venture capital firm underscores the faith institutional investors are placing in RCOF’s vision. That injection of capital adds credibility and momentum to an already successful presale campaign, which has so far raised $17 million across six stages. With more institutional players expected to enter the fray, the window for retail investors to get in early is rapidly closing. Experts project RCOF’s value could skyrocket over the next year. Predictions estimate that a modest $600 investment could balloon to over $300,000 by Q3 2025. The return on investment has exceeded forecasts and outperformed the gains made by early supporters of Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. The platform’s ability to fuse institutional-grade security with retail accessibility makes it a powerhouse in the making. RCO Finance’s DeFi Revolution Redefined Where Dogecoin and Shiba Inu offer limited scope beyond trading and staking, RCOF unleashes a complete financial ecosystem. Its no-KYC DeFi platform boasts access to over 120,000 assets, including cryptocurrencies, tokenized stocks, ETFs, bonds, and real estate. This wide asset range is paired with user-centric features such as Smart Portfolio Management, which provides dynamic analytics and investment strategies powered by artificial intelligence. The platform also supports Custom Watchlists for real-time tracking, intuitive Wallet Management for crypto and NFT holdings, and Automated Savings tools that rival the features of traditional finance apps, all without compromising on decentralization. Its Beta platform that gathered 10,000 users within a short period of time has drawn in 285,000 users now, with a target of surpassing 500,000 by mid-2025. Every layer of RCOF’s ecosystem has been fortified by a SolidProof audit, offering the kind of security and transparency most meme coins can only dream of. Perhaps RCOF’s most impressive innovation is its AI Robo Advisor, which enables even crypto novices to build portfolios like seasoned pros. By crunching market data and historical trends, the AI recommends bespoke strategies to maximize returns, effectively removing the need for financial middlemen. Upcoming tools like AI-Powered Simulated Trading and Demo Environments will allow users to test their strategies against high-frequency trading algorithms before risking real capital, equipping them with an unprecedented edge. Innovations like these are exactly why RCO Finance secured a $7.5 million injection from a leading venture capital firm. RCOF’s Presale Positioned for Explosive Growth Dogecoin may boast a market cap of $22 billion and Shiba Inu $7 billion, but their massive token supplies and meme roots limit their potential for substantial growth. In contrast, RCO Finance’s controlled supply of 800 million tokens sets the stage for meteoric value appreciation. Now in presale Stage 6 at just $0.13 per token and set to increase to $0.15 at the next stage, the project is fast approaching its listing on Uniswap, expected to land at $0.6 per token. That translates to a 3,000% ROI or more, turning $2,000 into $60,000. Up to 1,580% profits have already been realized by early funders who joined at Stage 1. Some analysts are even forecasting a breakout to $5 per token by Q2 2025. A staggering 50,000% increase that makes Dogecoin’s $1 target and Shiba Inu’s $0.0001 goal look modest in comparison. Don’t Let RCOF’s Rocket Pass You By Seize your RCOF tokens while presale prices hold firm. With institutional giants pouring in and momentum surging, today’s investment could headline tomorrow’s crypto boom. Act now. Position yourself. Unleash your wealth.

43928108,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153521,1745895635,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,OpenAI Search Unleashes Powerful ChatGPT Shopping Features,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-search-shopping/,"In the fast-evolving world of technology, where AI continues to reshape how we interact with information, a significant development is set to impact how we find and purchase products online. For those following the cryptocurrency space, understanding these shifts in core internet services like search is crucial, as they often pave the way for new digital commerce paradigms. OpenAI has announced a major ChatGPT update , enhancing its search capabilities with dedicated features for ChatGPT shopping . What’s New with OpenAI Search and Shopping? OpenAI is rolling out improvements to its web search tool within ChatGPT, specifically designed to create a better online shopping experience. When users search for products, the chatbot will now provide a more integrated and helpful response. Here’s what you can expect: Product Recommendations: ChatGPT will suggest relevant products based on your queries. Visuals and Reviews: Get images and see user reviews directly within the search results. Direct Purchase Links: Easy access to webpages where you can buy the items. This move is a direct challenge to traditional search engines, particularly Google, which heavily relies on its shopping features and advertising revenue. OpenAI aims to offer a more personalized and less cluttered way to discover products. How AI Shopping Works in ChatGPT The core idea behind this AI shopping enhancement is to allow users to use natural language to ask very specific questions about products. Instead of just providing a list of links, ChatGPT will synthesize information to offer customized results. Initially, OpenAI is experimenting with popular categories like fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics. The company states that the shopping results are determined independently, based on structured metadata from third parties, including pricing, product descriptions, and reviews. Crucially, OpenAI notes that advertising is not part of this current upgrade, and they will not receive a kickback from purchases made through OpenAI search . This positions their offering as a potentially unbiased alternative to search results influenced by ad spend, although future models might include affiliate fees. Who Gets the ChatGPT Update and When? This significant ChatGPT update is being rolled out globally today. It’s available in the default AI model, GPT-4o, for a wide range of users: ChatGPT Pro, Plus, Free, and even logged-out users. This broad accessibility underscores OpenAI’s ambition to make this feature widely adopted. Looking ahead, OpenAI plans to integrate its memory feature for Pro and Plus users. This means ChatGPT could reference your past conversations to provide highly personalized product recommendations, learning your preferences over time. However, due to regulatory considerations, these memory features will not be available to users in the EU, the U.K., Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein for shopping. Competing in the Online Shopping Arena OpenAI’s foray into ChatGPT shopping is a clear strategic move to compete with established players in the lucrative online shopping and search markets. While Google’s search product has faced criticism regarding the quality of results due to heavy advertising, OpenAI is positioning its search as a rapidly growing alternative, citing over a billion web searches made in ChatGPT in a single week recently. Beyond shopping, the update also brings other search improvements, such as displaying trending searches as users type, similar to autocomplete features found in other search engines. Furthermore, OpenAI search capabilities are now accessible via WhatsApp, allowing users to interact with the chatbot for up-to-date information on the go. Comparing ChatGPT Shopping to Previous Efforts OpenAI has explored shopping features before, notably through its AI agent platform, Operator. Operator could browse multiple webpages to find relevant products, but it was often a slower process, taking several minutes. The new ChatGPT shopping feature integrated into search offers a much faster, more direct, and hands-on experience, while still leveraging the power of natural language queries that users are accustomed to in ChatGPT. Conclusion: A New Era for Online Shopping Search? The integration of dedicated shopping features into OpenAI search marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI assistants and their role in digital commerce. By offering personalized recommendations, visual information, and direct purchase links without initial advertising influence, OpenAI is attempting to carve out a unique space in the competitive online shopping landscape. This ChatGPT update promises a more intuitive and efficient way for users to find and buy products, potentially setting a new standard for AI-powered search experiences.

However, the leading cryptocurrency now faces a critical resistance level that could determine its near-term price trajectory. What Do On-Chain Metrics Indicate? In a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post, on-chain analyst BorisVest noted that BTC has entered a stagnation phase as short-term holders have begun realizing profits. The contributor warned that if this ongoing profit-taking is not fully absorbed, it could trigger a fresh wave of selling. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Clear This Critical Cost Basis Level For Continued Upside, Analyst Says BorisVest also highlighted that BTC exchange reserves – which had been depleting at a significant rate until last week – are now starting to stabilize. As a result, enhanced selling pressure could emerge for the apex cryptocurrency. The analyst added that both BTC inflows and outflows on crypto exchanges are currently balanced, suggesting a neutral market state. Moreover, while short-term holders were previously selling at a loss, they have now entered profitable territory. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has risen to 1.04, indicating that investors who bought BTC at recent lows – possibly around $76,000 earlier this month – are now cashing out. For those unfamiliar, SOPR measures the profit or loss of Bitcoin transactions by comparing the price at which coins were originally acquired to the price at which they are now spent. A SOPR value above 1 signals that holders are selling at a profit, while a value below 1 indicates they are selling at a loss. Additionally, the current SOPR metric reveals increased selling activity with rising prices, suggesting that BTC whales and institutional investors are likely taking profits. The Net Realized Profit and Loss (NRPL) metric supports this view, having sharply rebounded from about $2 billion in realized losses to $3 billion in realized gains. Bitcoin Faces Critical Resistance – Can BTC Continue Its Rally? According to the post, Bitcoin now faces significant resistance at $96,000. If BTC manages to break through this level with strong volume and momentum, it could turn this resistance into a new support base and continue its rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Following Gold’s Footsteps? Analyst Sets Mid-Term Target At $155,000 Conversely, a failure to decisively break through $96,000 could stall Bitcoin’s rally and potentially trigger a price pullback toward the $80,000 range. Therefore, monitoring BTC’s price behavior around this critical resistance level will be crucial. That said, Bitcoin’s apparent demand has recently shown a sharp momentum shift, reigniting hopes for a sustained rally that could lead to a new all-time high. At press time, BTC is trading at $93,972, up 0.3% over the past 24 hours.

The trade tensions are fracturing the monetary, political and international world orders by fueling deglobalization and unsustainable trade imbalances, Dalio, the former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said in an April 28 X post. Dalio added that this is leading to irreversible damage, and an increasing number of importers and exporters, particularly between the US and China, are drastically reducing interdependencies and “making alternative plans.” “[They’re] recognizing that whatever happens with tariffs, these problems won't go away, and that radically reduced interdependencies with the US is a reality that has to be planned for.” Source: Ray Dalio Dalio said America’s role as the world’s largest consumer of manufactured goods and the largest debt issuer is looking increasingly unsustainable, and the idea that trade partners would continue selling to the US and receive dollars was “naive thinking.” As a result, more countries may increasingly bypass the US by forming new trade networks that rely on alternative currencies. While Dalio didn’t suggest which monetary alternative would eat into the dollar’s dominance, he has championed “hard money” assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold during times of global uncertainty. Less fighting, more coordination The billionaire called for more calm and coordinated action from the US to address the trade imbalances and become more self-sufficient. Dealing with the US government debt problem head-on would lead to much better results than the “path that we appear to be on,” Dalio said. “Unfortunately, thus far we haven’t seen the better ways and have instead seen disturbing fighting and volatility that are teaching lessons that are leading to irreversible bad consequences.” Dalio advised investors and policymakers to redirect their attention away from day-to-day market moves and policy announcements to deal with these “big fundamental changes” in world order.

Several key Bitcoin mining manufacturing countries, such as Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, have also been hit with respective rates of 36%, 32% and 24%, which has already impacted machine imports into the US.

43928657,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153523,1745896830,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Supply on Exchanges Hits Astonishing 7-Year Low,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-supply-7-year-low/,"Crypto market watchers are buzzing about a significant on-chain metric: the Bitcoin supply on exchanges has plunged to levels not seen in seven years. This development, highlighted by data from analytics firm CryptoQuant, suggests a major shift in investor behavior and could have profound implications for the future price trajectory of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What Does a 7-Year Low in Bitcoin Supply on Exchanges Mean? According to CryptoQuant data, the total amount of Bitcoin held on major centralized crypto exchanges dropped to a remarkable 7-year low of 2.488 million BTC on April 25th. While the figure has slightly rebounded to 2.492 million BTC since then, it remains near this historic trough. But why is this specific number causing such a stir? Think of centralized exchanges like temporary holding bays or trading floors for cryptocurrencies. When a large amount of Bitcoin sits on these platforms, it’s often seen as readily available supply for selling. Conversely, when the supply decreases significantly, it implies that holders are moving their BTC off exchanges. This action is typically interpreted in a few key ways: Long-Term Holding (HODLing): Investors are moving their Bitcoin to personal wallets (cold storage or hardware wallets) with the intention of holding it for the long term, rather than keeping it on an exchange for immediate trading or selling. Increased Self-Custody: Growing awareness of the risks associated with keeping funds on exchanges (like hacks, platform insolvency, or regulatory actions) encourages users to take control of their private keys. Reduced Selling Pressure: Less Bitcoin available on exchanges generally means less supply readily available to meet selling orders, which can reduce downward price pressure. Anticipation of Price Rise: The act of moving BTC off exchanges is often a vote of confidence, suggesting holders expect the price to increase in the future and want to secure their assets away from trading platforms. Is This a Sign of an Impending Supply Shock? The concept of a supply shock is frequently discussed in relation to Bitcoin , especially following halving events that reduce the rate of new BTC creation. A supply shock occurs when demand significantly outstrips the available supply, potentially leading to rapid price appreciation. The shrinking amount of Bitcoin supply on exchanges is a crucial component of this narrative. Here’s how the low exchange supply contributes to the supply shock potential: Fixed Total Supply: Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins. This inherent scarcity is its foundational economic principle. Reduced New Supply: Halving events cut the block reward for miners, slowing down the rate at which new BTC enters circulation. Increasing Illiquid Supply: A growing amount of Bitcoin is held in wallets that show little to no history of spending or moving coins, indicating long-term holding. The movement off crypto exchanges adds to this illiquid supply. Potential for Rising Demand: Factors like institutional adoption (e.g., Bitcoin ETFs), increasing global uncertainty, or growing retail interest can drive up demand for Bitcoin . When you combine fixed supply, reduced new supply, increasing illiquid supply (driven by movements off crypto exchanges ), and potentially rising demand, you create the conditions ripe for a supply shock . The current low level of Bitcoin supply on exchanges is a strong indicator that a significant portion of the existing circulating supply is being locked away by long-term holders, making it less accessible for immediate purchase on open markets. Historical Context: What Happened Last Time Bitcoin Supply on Exchanges Was This Low? Looking back at the last time the Bitcoin supply on exchanges was this low – around seven years ago – provides interesting context, though it’s crucial to remember that past performance is not indicative of future results. Seven years ago places us roughly in 2017, a period that saw a significant bull run culminating in Bitcoin reaching what was then an all-time high near $20,000 by the end of the year. While correlation doesn’t equal causation, the decrease in exchange supply during that period coincided with strong upward price momentum. This historical parallel reinforces the market’s tendency to view reduced exchange balances as a bullish signal, suggesting accumulation rather than distribution by holders. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights and Considerations While the 7-year low in Bitcoin supply on exchanges is a compelling data point, it’s essential to integrate it into a broader understanding of the market. Here are some takeaways: It’s a Bullish Signal, But Not a Guarantee: This metric strongly suggests that a large number of BTC holders are in accumulation mode and are preparing for potential future price increases. However, market prices are influenced by many factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, and overall market sentiment. On-Chain Data is Powerful: Metrics like exchange balances, transaction volumes, and miner behavior provide valuable insights into the underlying health and sentiment of the Bitcoin network, offering a different perspective than just looking at price charts. Consider Self-Custody: The trend of moving BTC off exchanges highlights the importance many investors place on self-custody. If you plan to hold Bitcoin long-term, research and understand how to securely store your private keys off-exchange. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Don’t base investment decisions solely on one metric. Combine on-chain analysis with technical analysis, fundamental analysis, and an understanding of the broader market environment. The continued decline in Bitcoin supply on exchanges is a powerful testament to the conviction of its holders. It paints a picture of a market where participants are increasingly opting to secure their assets for the long haul, potentially setting the stage for interesting dynamics should demand continue to grow. The fact that the Bitcoin supply on exchanges has hit a 7-year low is more than just an interesting statistic; it’s a reflection of evolving investor psychology and market structure. As fewer BTC sit readily available on trading platforms, the potential for supply-side constraints in the face of rising demand becomes more pronounced. While the path of Bitcoin’s price is never certain, this significant on-chain development provides compelling evidence of strong underlying holder confidence and reinforces the long-term bullish case for the digital asset.

The price is trading above $1,770 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,815 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,820 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Eyes Fresh Gains Ethereum price remained stable above the $1,725 level and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin . ETH traded as low as $1,746 and climbed back above the $1,770 resistance level. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,857 swing high to the $1,746 low. The bulls even pushed the price toward the $1,800 resistance . However, there was no close above the $1,800 resistance. The price was rejected near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,857 swing high to the $1,746 low. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,815 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $1,770 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,800 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,820 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,850 level. A clear move above the $1,850 resistance might send the price toward the $1,920 resistance. An upside break above the $1,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,950 resistance zone or even $2,000 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH?

Let’s figure out how memecoins have transformed from an ironic speculative asset to politics, presidents and billion-dollar scams. A joke that went too far The first is considered to be DOGE . It was created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer in 2013 . At that time, the topic of crypto was too serious, so they decided to create a humorous response to Bitcoin and the arrogant market – a coin with a funny dog. Who knew that it would instantly start gaining popularity? It was first used as a tipping currency on Reddit, and in just two weeks, it had more daily transactions than Bitcoin. The success of DOGE was inspiring, and within a month, this trend was picked up by YeCoin, a reference to Kanye West, MaxCoin , a reference to Max Kaiser and more. This entire category of coins began to form based on references to someone or something famous. Ethereum and the ICO boom revitalized the market, but memecoins remained in the shadow of more serious projects. UnderDOGE – The original memecoin branch Currently, DOGE is considered a hype coin, but it has a responsive community at heart. The coin was positioned as a challenge, a contrast, an underdog or perhaps ‘underDOGE.’ And this community often supported charitable initiatives and other underdogs. You may not have heard about it, but they raised money to send a team from Jamaica to the Olympics , to train dogs for children with disabilities, to build wells in Kenya and to finance the participation of an outsider driver , Josh Wise, in Nascar. It created a feeling of kindness and unity and allowed even outsiders to stand a chance. This is also a part of the project’s manifesto – to do good every day, to put benefit above technical perfection and people above competition and profits. In 2021, DOGE became mainstream. Thanks to Musk’s activity , the token was picked up by the masses. For example, Mark Cuban – owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks – integrated Dogecoin into his business – he allowed fans to pay for tickets and merchandise with DOGE. Source: CoinGecko At its peak in 2021, DOGE’s market cap was over $80 billion, which is more than some US banks. Of course, the combined market cap of all memecoins is now much smaller than $80 billion, but this example shows how one celebrity can instantly turn an underdog into a star. DOGE is a joke that didn’t go as planned – but it’s still a joke. But when the community wants more, projects have to grow and develop. Shiba is another underdog – or better yet, a response to one. It’s an already scaled project that has integrated the ShibaOS blockchain solution into the UAE Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure. It was created as an Ethereum-based competitor to DOGE. This is an example of how an entire ecosystem can be created from a meme – the project became a platform with its own blockchain, decentralized exchange (DEX), token system, non-fungible token (NFT), decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), metaverse and burn mechanism. It could certainly be a technical knockout for DOGE. However, even though Elon pumped up SHIBA , DOGE still remains higher in the ratings and hearts. Or let’s take a look at Floki Inu, a memecoin named after Elon’s Shiba Inu. It has also become an example of scaling into an ecosystem with a game, NFT, metaverse and more. By the way, this is not the first time that Musk’s tweets not only pump cryptocurrencies but also give rise to new memecoins. Memecoins got a chance to become technically advanced projects. But did all coins want to grow up? Trash coins We believe that the popularity of NFTs has pushed memecoins into a different branch of development. They have opened up that side of Web 3.0 where the technical component is not important, but storytelling, irony, virality and community are. Memes and post-irony evolved into NFTs and carved out their place in the crypto world – and with that, a swarm of digital hooligans kicked down the door to Web 3.0. Solana made the launch fast and easy. Now you can do anything with tokens – even turn a photo of a manhole into an NFT. It’s that simple. Could you imagine in 2018 that a beer token would be created one day? Not for a specific brand but for beer in general. That it would instantly trend on social media, raising millions in pre-sales and listing on top exchanges in record time? Web 3.0 projects are increasingly turning to quests as a way to improve user engagement, and the numbers speak for themselves. As Zealy shared on their blog, two of their partners gained over 10,000 new members in just one week through a single partnership quest, proving how collaborative campaigns can fuel rapid community growth. This aligns with Claimr’s recent analyses, which show that quests boost audience retention by an average of 43% and increase user activity by over 63%. These mechanics are especially effective in meme and gaming communities. Projects like BEER or ecosystems such as Kyoto Blockchain and Qorpo World have leveraged platforms to attract tens of thousands of new users within days, showing how gamified interactions can drive real traction, even without deep utility. A bit later, the BEER authors decided to replicate their success by launching the WATER token. Although users were already burned by the pump-and-dump experience they had with BEER, it still worked. Messi, Ronaldinho and Suarez’s participation in the advertising campaign played a certain role, but they were more of a supporting factor. Rather, it was a matter of FOMO – people wanted to get in at the start and quickly get out on high. But the project wasn’t completely useless – t he authors invested in creating several water collection facilities in Africa. As you can see, trash coins have become a separate branch. Around the same time, CZ spoke out about the unhealthy development of memecoins on X – he was worried that they were becoming weird and said that it would be better to concentrate on more useful projects. PolitiFi Memecoins work because of humor, unexpectedness, emotions and a rebellious spirit. Humor perfectly conveys messages and is easy to remember because when a person laughs, they unconsciously remember the message of the joke. Note that instructions and wisdom are often presented in ironic form as are political or discriminatory messages and conspiracy theories. Humor and memes have already influenced politics . Remember Brexit, or even better, the Cambridge Analytica scandal? Social networks are filled with targeted messages and memes, very well tailored to each group of users. Memecoins allow you to turn every joke about an opponent into a coin and not worry about censorship. Undoubtedly, propagandists would not miss the chance to take advantage of this because it is the perfect camouflage. In addition, with the help of memecoins, you can financially stimulate voters – link the success of a politician or movement with the financial success of the holder. They win, you earn. Elon was able to give away millions for votes, and this was not recognized as bribery – so why not? Perhaps this is what QAnon – a conspiracy movement whose ideas are related to Trump – decided. Because such a token actually exists. Interestingly, in 2022, journalists exposed a scheme where QAnon leaders were selling a number of coins to supporters, promising mega-profits. The coins were allegedly backed by either an American bank or a Kazakh gold mine, but in reality, it was a simple ‘rug pull.’ Let’s Go Brandon is a euphemism that means ‘F*** Joe Biden.’ It went from being a protest slogan to the LGB coin and its obscene version FJB. It was publicly picked up by the young Republican congressman Madison Cotton, and then the token became a partner of one of the NASCAR teams. But as soon as the team refused the partnership, the token collapsed sharply and the congressman was accused of fraud. He had to donate his profits to charity to clear his reputation. But this case did not scare away politicians – on the contrary, it attracted them. They understood that if you can create a hate coin, then you can also create a praise coin. And again, it was the Republicans who did it. The crypto community was a very important audience for Donald Trump’s campaign during the elections, so his personal token TRUMP ( MAGA ) has existed since 2023 and helped the candidate promote narratives. He must have been used to taking more from life and decided to double his success, so after the victory, the official Trump Token ( TRUMP ) on Solana was released. This is the first time that the US president has personally supported a memecoin. What could have gone wrong? The failure of his and Melania’s tokens did not stop Donald, so he tried to promote the coin again. One big trader believed in Donny and lost $207,000 as soon as the price collapsed again. Javier Milley, on the other hand, wasn’t prepared for his reputational losses. When his alternative cryptocurrency for Argentina, Libra , suddenly lost liquidity, Milley’s posts about its support evaporated. But the Internet remembers everything. Hate coins The Let’s Go Brandon hate token was very niche and died as a scam. But what if a really big celebrity creates it? In February 2025, Ye (formerly known as Kanye) blew up the X social network with the news of a memecoin launch. He didn’t stop with anti-Semitic posts and swastika merchandise , so he called the new coin Swasticoin , and on March 15 , he reposted the YZY contract address. The community was torn. Some people expressed support for the Nazi setting. And finally, some users spoke out against it. Representatives of the human rights group Campaign Against Antisemitism and the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism expressed criticism , noting that Ye is promoting the symbol and not destigmatizing it, and it is strange that traders don’t approve, yet still invest in it. Indeed, such a position seems hypocritical, to say the least. Neither Swasticoin nor LGB are the first hate coins. As we already noted, you can find anything on Solana. Solana simplified the launch so much that a person with basic knowledge of crypto can deploy a token using instructions from YouTube. This is how hate tokens appeared. We found more than 30 questionable tokens on DEX Screener and GeckoTerminal. Luckily, screeners began to censor the issuance , and a representative of the Solana Foundation stated that he was looking for ways to filter or ‘sanction’ hate tokens. What does the future hold for memecoins As you can see, almost anything can be tokenized – emotions, beliefs, prejudices and even hate. What began with innocent memes spiraled into symbols of extremism. It’s no longer a joke – it’s a tool that shapes politics, culture, public perception and ideals. When the boundaries of what is permissible are expanding, who knows what will happen to memecoins? Perhaps there will be more sarcastic memecoins about Trump’s tariffs – TarrifAgeddon , CTO (Chief Tariff Officer), PT (Penguin Tariff), GOT (Game of Tariffs) and more. Or maybe one day marketers will start using them as a situational marketing tool.

As such, Investors appear to be turning to digital assets, viewing them as a potential safe-haven option amid growing economic instability. Bitcoin Leads Weekly Inflows; Ethereum Makes a Comeback According to the latest edition of ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report ,’ Bitcoin investment funds dominated last week’s activity as they attracted $3.18 billion in inflows and boosted total digital asset assets under management to $132 billion. Interestingly, this figure is the highest since late February. Short-Bitcoin products also registered $1.6 million in inflows, indicating some investors had positioned for a potential drawdown in Bitcoin as its price climbed above $90,000. Ethereum reversed its downtrend with $183 million in inflows after eight consecutive weeks of outflows. Solana, on the other hand, was the only altcoin to see investor pullback, with $5.7 million in outflows. This has pushed its monthly total into negative territory at $13.9 million. Other altcoins saw minimal action, with Sui and XRP standing out, drawing $20.7 million and $31.6 million, respectively, during the same period. Multi-asset investment products also gained traction with $2.4 million in inflows. A similar sentiment was seen across Blockchain equities as investors also poured $17.4 million, with notable interest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tied to Bitcoin mining operations. Global Sentiment Remains Positive In terms of region, US investors led the charge in digital asset investments last week and contributed $3.3 billion in inflows. Positive sentiment extended globally, with Germany and Switzerland seeing notable inflows of $51.5 million and $41.4 million, respectively. Australia followed suit with $4.9 million, while Sweden attracted $4.2 million. Hong Kong recorded modest gains of $0.3 million. However, not all regions saw growth – Canada and Brazil recorded a minor investor pullback, with outflows of $1.6 million and $0.6 million.

Sovereign wealth fund ADQ, conglomerate International Holding Company (IHC) and First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) announced on Monday that they are developing a digital token that will be subject to oversight by the UAE’s central bank . The new stablecoin will operate on the ADI blockchain, a technology developed domestically by the ADI Foundation. In particular, it aims to offer citizens, businesses and institutions a trusted means of payment. Moreover, it will support transactions across a range of everyday and emerging digital scenarios. “This stablecoin will be used as a reliable digital currency across a wide range of everyday scenarios – by citizens and consumers, businesses and institutions,” the companies said in a joint statement.

The new #stablecoin will transform payments and business… pic.twitter.com/gWnVjX0LoC — IHC (@ihc__official) April 28, 2025 Stablecoin Project Adds to UAE’s Growing Crypto Credentials Abu Dhabi’s latest move reflects the UAE’s broader strategy to cement itself as a global hub for digital assets. Already, the government has made headway by enabling crypto payments, introducing digital asset regulations early, and promoting homegrown blockchain ventures. In December, it took a major step by rolling out its first official stablecoin, AE Coin. Then, last month, local investment group MGX committed $2b to Binance in one of the largest-ever crypto deals. Looking ahead, the launch partners believe the new stablecoin will strengthen the UAE’s digital infrastructure and position the country at the forefront of global fintech innovation. UAE’s Fintech Push Expands Into Emerging Sectors Like IoT And AI H.E. Mohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ, said the initiative “marks a pivotal step in our commitment to strengthening the UAE’s digital infrastructure ecosystem.” He further added that it would offer a secure and scalable solution for the increasingly connected economy. FAB, the UAE’s largest lender, is expected to issue the stablecoin once it receives regulatory clearance. Meanwhile, Group CEO Hana Al Rostamani described the project as a “ground-breaking development” that could revolutionize trusted blockchain payments across industries. Similarly, Syed Basar Shueb, CEO of IHC, said the venture would open vast opportunities and further drive fintech innovation in the region. The stablecoin is not only intended for conventional payments. In addition, its design will support machine-to-machine and AI-driven transactions. This shift signals a focus on sectors such as autonomous finance and the Internet of Things. Guillaume de La Tour, CEO of the ADI Foundation, noted that the blockchain network would enable “secure, transparent, and efficient transactions at scale,” a crucial advantage for economies aiming to digitize sustainably. With over $225b in assets, ADQ has been leading a flurry of investments to build Abu Dhabi’s digital economy. Now, this latest stablecoin project fits into a broader effort to modernize payment systems. It also supports the goal of diversifying economic pillars and attracting global fintech talent to the Gulf nation.

Speaking to Cointelegraph in Dubai, Collins said that while USD-backed stablecoins may currently dominate, other currencies and assets may compete to back stablecoins. He said: “The stablecoin definitely helps preserve the dollar dominance, especially in the crypto space. The dollar is kind of the reserve currency of crypto. But now there are other currencies coming into play. But more importantly, it's not currencies. It's other types of backing.” Collins said that these other assets used to back stablecoins may compete with US dollars by bringing a higher yield to users. Interview with Tether co-founder Reeve Collins in Dubai, UAE. Source: Cointelegraph Tether co-founder says tokenized assets can back stablecoins Collins, who works bringing stablecoin yield for users through Pi Protocol, told Cointelegraph that apart from currencies, money-market funds, other commodities and gold could back stablecoins in the future. “When you can back it with money market funds, for instance, that generate a higher yield than T-bills and other things like that that are coming onchain, where there’s a lot of yield that will be generated. Those will take precedence,” Collins said. Collins said these will “start winning” because they bring higher user returns. Furthermore, the executive also said RWA tokenization could play a role in stablecoin backing. The executive told Cointelegraph that since all types of assets can be tokenized, these can be used to back stablecoins in the future. “You’re going to have a lot of choices other than just dollars,” he added.

However, the project said that the tokens were not tradable yet. According to Collins, the stablecoin entry of a Trump-backed project means that stablecoins are now “fully accepted.” The executive believes everyone will get involved in stablecoins because of the move. This includes institutions, governments and financial technology companies. “The President of the United States launched a stablecoin. It’s impressive. It lays the foundation for the rest of the world to do it as well,” he said.

This upward move followed positive market sentiment, likely driven by recent developments around crypto-based ETFs. While the structure of the rally remains complex, analysts are closely watching several important price levels for signs of continued bullish rally. Short-Term Structure Supports Further Upside XRP has continued to form higher highs and higher lows, a classic sign of upward momentum. Price action is currently following a diagonal wave pattern, a type of bullish structure that is less powerful than a strong impulsive trend but can still support further gains. The recent swing low at $2.11–$2.12 (April 24) now serves as a critical support level. As long as XRP stays above this range, the bullish scenario remains intact. A drop below this level would call for a re-evaluation of the short-term structure. The next upside targets are in the $2.46 to $2.55 range. This area aligns with the 138% Fibonacci extension level, which is often considered a key milestone in wave-based analysis. Reaching this zone would complete a larger third wave in the current five-wave pattern. Larger Structure Still Unclear, But Bullish Signs Emerging XRP is still trading within a long-term descending parallel channel on the daily timeframe, meaning the broader trend remains bearish for now. However, there are growing signs that this trend may be losing strength. On the 3-day chart, the bearish divergence in the RSI—active since earlier in the year—is close to being invalidated. If the RSI moves above its previous high, and the price breaks out above the $2.50 level, that would serve as a strong signal of a trend reversal. This would shift XRP out of short-term relief rallies and into a more defined bullish trend.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-29 03:59:17

The integration is designed to offer a transparent and accessible secondary market for tokens subject to vesting schedules or early contributor lockups, crypto.news can exclusively report. According to a Tokenomist report earlier this year, the sector is estimated to hold more than $100 billion in value. SecondSwap is a decentralized exchange focused on locked and vesting digital assets. Following its launch on Ethereum ( ETH ) in February, SecondSwap’s expansion to Avalanche ( AVAX ) introduces native smart contracts designed for managing token lockups, secondary trading, and price discovery directly on-chain. Bringing transparency to locked token trading Traditionally, trading locked tokens has been limited to private, off-market transactions. The downside is that it often lacks transparency and carries settlement risks. “Today’s secondary market for locked tokens remains largely manual, opaque, and inefficient,” Kanny Lee, Founder of SecondSwap, said in the press release. “SecondSwap is transforming this model by bringing locked token trading fully on-chain, with smart contract execution that delivers transparent pricing, verifiable asset transfer, and real-time settlement.” Projects using SecondSwap can issue, price, and trade locked assets without relying on third-party services. Investors can benefit from a platform offering a bidding mechanism that allows users to propose discounts and select preferred vesting periods. Lot sizes consist of three, six, and 12 month lockup periods which means better access for a broader range of investors, not just institutional participants. Early users who whitelist their wallets and place bids can potentially access discounted tokens compared to prevailing market prices. Expansion supports Avalanche’s DeFi growth plans Justin Kim, Head of Asia at Ava Labs, said the launch fits into Avalanche’s broader strategy to expand DeFi infrastructure and support tokenized asset markets. “SecondSwap perfectly aligns with Avalanche’s mission to digitize, democratize, and de-risk asset ownership,” he said. SecondSwap’s expansion follows a $1.2 million seed funding round led by GSR and Animoca Ventures. The company says it plans to continue building tools to support on-chain lifecycle management for token projects, aiming to reduce volatility tied to unlock events and improve overall market efficiency.",News|Exclusive|Exchange|Trading,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-29 04:06:14

The confusion stemmed from an old filing dated April 15, which resurfaced online and was incorrectly shared as a new development. Despite the rumors spreading quickly across social media, ProShares made no official announcement. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart , while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has indeed given its approval, the launch date has been pushed back and is now expected sometime in the short to medium term. Meanwhile, Brazil has already taken the lead by approving the first XRP ETF. ProShares Gears Up for Major XRP Futures Products ProShares has ambitious plans for XRP exposure. The company is preparing to launch three XRP futures ETFs: Ultra XRP ETF offering 2x leveraged returns Short XRP ETF offering -1x inverse returns Ultra Short XRP ETF providing -2x inverse exposure These products are aimed at institutional investors looking for regulated ways to speculate on XRP’s price swings—without the complications of holding the asset directly. Futures ETFs also help bypass many of the security and regulatory hurdles typically associated with direct crypto ownership. Teucrium Breaks Ground, ProShares Poised to Follow Teucrium made history earlier this month by launching the first XRP futures ETF on the New York Stock Exchange on April 8. The fund saw encouraging trading volumes from day one, signaling strong market appetite for XRP-based investment vehicles. ProShares’ upcoming entries are expected to further deepen the XRP ETF market. Spot XRP ETFs: Still in Limbo While futures ETFs are gaining momentum, spot XRP ETFs remain stuck in the regulatory pipeline. ProShares, along with firms like Grayscale and 21Shares, is still waiting for the SEC’s green light. After facing initial delays in April, most applications are now looking toward a second decision window by late May. Some cases may not see a final verdict until mid-October.

According to prediction market Polymarket, there is currently a 6% chance that Trump will announce a Bitcoin reserve before the 100-day milestone ends tomorrow. This speculation follows recent comments from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, who appeared on Bitcoin Magazine to discuss the administration’s evolving stance on digital assets. Lutnick opened up about a strong shift away from the previous administration’s restrictive approach to cryptocurrency, saying, “Under Biden, it was treated like you were doing something wrong… That’s over now.” Treating Bitcoin Like Gold Lutnick said that the Trump administration sees Bitcoin not as a currency, but as a commodity, similar to gold or oil. “There’s only so much of it,” he explained. “Bitcoin is like gold to me… It should be treated like a commodity.” He added that once the U.S. formally accepts Bitcoin as a commodity, it could open the door for widespread use, including buying, selling, and holding it as an asset—just like gold. “No one stops someone from selling oil or gold,” he said. “Bitcoin should be the same.” Potential Role in Trade and GDP Lutnick also revealed that the Bureau of Economic Analysis is exploring the idea of treating Bitcoin similarly to gold in economic statistics, such as trade balances and GDP. While he didn’t confirm any official plans, he said it’s “a good idea” that is under consideration. The Commerce Secretary emphasized the importance of making government data more transparent, hinting that new classifications could emerge to help Americans understand how Bitcoin fits into national economic metrics. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve? Although Lutnick didn’t confirm whether the U.S. already holds Bitcoin in a strategic reserve, he did mention that discussions are ongoing. “When the administration wants to come out with those answers, we will,” he said, but declined to provide details on holdings or key management. He reiterated that Bitcoin remains on the administration’s agenda and praised Trump’s commitment to supporting the crypto community. “Trump promised to support Bitcoin, and he’s delivered,” Lutnick stated. “After tackling trade and global peace efforts, Bitcoin will definitely be back on the agenda.”",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-29 04:11:37

XRP’s ETF Greenlight and Near Protocol’s AI Revolution Fuel Hype,https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-top-crypto-presale-with-377-roi-xrps-etf-greenlight-and-near-protocols-ai-revolution-fuel-hype/,"When institutions start moving, the rest of the market tends to wake up fast. Fresh from XRP’s ETF-driven resurgence and Near Protocol’s growing AI-driven blockchain ecosystem, it’s clear that serious players are planting flags. Yet while XRP and Near are busy securing regulatory attention, a new contender is quietly igniting an early buying frenzy: Qubetics. It isn’t just another project riding the wave—it’s engineering a whole new way for businesses and users to interact with blockchain seamlessly. The world isn’t looking for another meme coin. It’s hunting for the top crypto presale opportunities that offer real-world utility, easy usability, and serious upside. XRP is proving it can scale regulatory walls, Near Protocol is betting big on the future of AI and decentralized apps, and Qubetics? It’s laying down the rails for a multi-chain, multi-application financial ecosystem that works right out of the box. Qubetics ($TICS) doesn’t just tackle the gaps others have left—it obliterates them. Between its QubeQode and Qubetics IDE, it gives builders, businesses, and everyday users tools to create and manage digital assets without gatekeepers. Those sniffing around for the top crypto presale worth a second look would be crazy to sleep on this. Qubetics ($TICS): Shaping Blockchain’s New Financial Era Qubetics has a simple mission: build smarter, faster, and easier blockchain tools for the next billion users. Its QubeQode and Qubetics IDE open the floodgates for easy development, seamless multi-chain interaction, and cross-border asset management. For businesses and individuals fed up with clunky wallets and expensive bridges, Qubetics offers a future that actually works. Presale Performance and ROI Analysis The Qubetics crypto presale is now in its 32nd stage. Over 510 million $TICS tokens have been sold to more than 25,400 holders, raising a sharp $16.5 million. Current price? $0.2093 per token. Stage 1 early adopters who bought in at $0.01 are already sitting on a 1993% return. Even today, those jumping in have an eye on: 377% ROI when $TICS hits $1 after the presale. 2,288% ROI at $5. 2,766% ROI at $6. 4,677% ROI if it hits $10. A monster 7,066% ROI if $TICS smashes through $15 post-mainnet launch. The window isn’t closed—but it’s getting narrower every day. XRP: Gaining Momentum from ETF Greenlights XRP is finally flexing after years of regulatory battles. Trading around $2.24, XRP has not only held above its crucial 200-day EMA at $1.98 but rallied over 8% last week, flipping the $2.23 resistance into fresh support. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) holding at 57 signals healthy bullish momentum. Should XRP continue climbing, a retest of its March 24 high of $2.50 looks within reach—with $3.00 not too far behind if momentum keeps snowballing. With ProShares securing SEC approval for XRP futures ETFs, institutional adoption is no longer a “what if” for XRP. It’s real, it’s happening, and it redefines how the market values top crypto presale opportunities connected to institutional-grade blockchains. Near Protocol (NEAR): Betting Big on AI and Decentralization NEAR is playing the long game, building infrastructure for the AI-powered, decentralized future. Trading around $2.61, Near Protocol recently got a massive boost: Bitwise filed the first Near Protocol ETF paperwork with the State of Delaware. Though formal SEC filing is still ahead, the momentum is clear. NEAR focuses on user-friendly decentralized app development with a specific edge in AI integrations. Positioned as a sleek alternative to Ethereum and Solana, NEAR’s ecosystem could ride the next big AI and blockchain convergence wave. ETF tailwinds, a crypto-friendly SEC under President Trump, and a rapidly growing developer base make NEAR a top crypto presale adjacent project not to overlook. Final Thoughts Those who hesitate now risk missing some of the highest-quality opportunities the blockchain space has seen in years. Qubetics isn’t waiting for the market to hand it a crown—it’s building a decentralized empire from the ground up. XRP is rewriting its legacy with institutional strength, and Near Protocol is laying new tracks for the AI-blockchain boom. For participants seeking a top crypto presale with genuine upside and real-world use cases, Qubetics stands out as a move that future headlines will call “obvious.” The presale door is open—but not for long.

Data from Elections Canada, reported by the CBC, shows Poilievre lost his Ottawa-area seat to Liberal Bruce Fanjoy on Monday night after a 5-week election cycle triggered by Carney, the current Prime Minister, last month. Overall, the Liberal party took approximately 162 seats as of 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time, which is enough to form a minority government. This is fewer than recent polls forecast, which projected that a Carney-led Liberal party would hit majority government territory — 172 seats — given the threats U.S. President Donald Trump made to the country's sovereignty and the punitive tariffs the White House was directing northward. However, CBC News noted as of midnight that votes were still coming in and it is not yet clear if the Liberals will win enough seats to form that majority government. If present results stand under the U.K.-inspired Westminster system under which Canada operates, the Liberals would need the support of another opposition party, such as separatist-minded Bloc Quebecois, or the left-leaning New Democrat Party to pass bills in the House of Commons. A Conservative-led non-confidence motion , should it have the support of another party, would be sufficient to trigger another election — though its far too early for this to be considered. Unlike the United States, where crypto played an important role in moving the needle on winning Congressional races, and helping put Trump back in the White House, it seemed to be a muted affair in Canada. While both Carney and Poilievre have discussed crypto in the past, the issue didn't come up for either campaigns even though it was an important issue for many Conservative Members of Parliament. On Polymarket, a contract asking bettors to predict the next Prime Minister of Canada crossed the $100 million mark (in U.S. dollars) in volume, and a dozen other election related questions had close to another $100 million in volume collectively.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains the market cornerstone, Ethereum (ETH) continues scaling its infrastructure, Ripple (XRP) expands global payments, and Solana (SOL) accelerates blockchain speed innovation. Yet, a rising star is capturing investor attention: MAGACOINFINANCE . History shows that those who position into strong projects before the crowd often achieve the most significant rewards. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Capturing Early Investor Momentum Few projects have demonstrated early success as quickly as MAGACOINFINANCE .

Kaspa (KAS) is reshaping blockchain scalability with its breakthrough blockDAG architecture. While these projects continue building strength, MAGACOINFINANCE offers rare early-stage positioning before mass market recognition takes hold. Why Analysts Are Calling MAGACOINFINANCE a Strategic Entry Investor interest and analyst sentiment are aligning quickly around MAGACOINFINANCE . With its strong market fundamentals, early community engagement, and disciplined growth trajectory, MAGACOINFINANCE is setting up as one of the most compelling early entries heading into 2025. Strategic investors are moving now to capture this opportunity before listings and wider attention drive it forward. Final Word While Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Ripple (XRP) , and Solana (SOL) continue leading headlines, MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly earning its place among the top opportunities of the next cycle.

In the last two weeks, BTC has climbed nearly 15%, recovering steadily from its recent period of correction. While the momentum appears measured compared to past breakouts, the underlying market data suggests that structural shifts are underway that could influence the next major move. So far, several indicators are pointing toward improving sentiment, particularly within the derivatives market, which now dominates Bitcoin’s overall trading volume. Recent observations from analysts highlight a shift in the balance of trading activity, hinting that long positions are regaining strength over shorts. Meanwhile, updated cycle models suggest Bitcoin may still have room to extend its current trend, with structural similarities emerging between the present market and the 2017 cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Highest Exchange Outflows In 2 Years, What This Means For Price Bitcoin Net Taker Volume Turns Positive, What Does It Signal? According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the 30-day moving average of Bitcoin’s Net Taker Volume has returned firmly to positive territory. Net Taker Volume is an indicator that compares the relative size of long and short positions in the derivatives market over a given period. A positive reading indicates that buying pressure (long positions) outweighs selling pressure (short positions), while a negative reading suggests the opposite. Darkfost noted that derivatives markets now account for roughly 90% of total Bitcoin trading volume, surpassing spot and exchange-traded (ETF) volumes. As a result, shifts in derivatives sentiment can often foreshadow broader price movements. The return of the Net Taker Volume into positive territory suggests that speculative participants are positioning for continued upside. This realignment in the derivatives market, if sustained, could act as a catalyst to reinforce Bitcoin’s recent gains and set the stage for further price discovery. Cycle Model Adjustments Point to Uptrend Continuation In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Mignolet provided insight into Bitcoin’s longer-term trend outlook. Using a refined cycle model based on market capitalization data, Mignolet suggested that traditional cycle indicators have been slow to reflect the latest recovery. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Sees Short-Term Dip — Bulls Plot Their Next Move To address this lag, adjustments were made to the model’s time series to detect earlier shifts in market behavior. Mignolet observed that what appeared to be a “bear market” zone under traditional models was, in reality, a buying opportunity within an ongoing upward cycle. The current market structure, according to Mignolet, resembles the later stages of the 2017 bull market rather than the early phases of a new downturn. If this parallel holds, Bitcoin could still have significant upside potential before entering a major correction phase.

Lawyers for Samourai Wallet CEO Keonne Rodriguez and chief technology officer William Hill said in an April 28 letter to Manhattan federal judge Richard Berman that they jointly requested with the government “for a continuance of the pretrial motions schedule by 16 days.” The Samourai executives' lawyers said on April 10 that they wrote to Acting Manhattan US Attorney Jay Clayton to request the dismissal of the case after an April 7 memo from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche shuttered the Justice Department’s crypto team. “On April 24, 2025, defense counsel met with the prosecutors and their supervisors in person at the U.S. Attorney’s Office to discuss this request,” the lawyers said. “The Defendants believe that a continuance of the pretrial motions schedule is warranted to permit Defendants to avoid the significant expense of preparing their motions while the Government determines its position,” the letter stated. It added that prosecutors agreed to adjourn “without expressing any views on the merits.” Samourai Wallet’s Rodriguez and Hill were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business in April 2024, to which they both pleaded not guilty. Blanche’s memo said, “The Department of Justice is not a digital assets regulator,” and it would abandon enforcement and investigations besides those which “focus on prosecuting individuals who victimize digital asset investors, or those who use digital assets in furtherance of criminal offenses.” An excerpt of the letter to Judge Berman. Source: PACER Currently, motions in the Samourai executives' case are due May 13, responses are due on June 10, and replies on June 24. The letter proposes to put this back to May 29 for motions, June 26 for responses, and July 10 for replies. The continuance would not affect the trial date, which is slated for early November. Quashing crypto litigation list lengthens The move is the latest in a long list of court actions to have prosecutors' crypto cases quashed under the Trump administration's favorable stance toward the industry.

Despite 15 XRP ETF filings from firms like Grayscale, Bitwise, and even Canary Capital, BlackRock has made no move. But their silence may be more strategic than it seems. An expert’s conversation with a BlackRock insider revealed two dates to watch: May 1 and June 9. The reason behind these dates remains under wraps, but there’s growing speculation that something major could be brewing. Why Is BlackRock Holding Back? BlackRock’s hesitation isn’t because they dislike XRP. According to industry whispers, it’s all about timing and leverage. By staying out of the current rush for XRP ETFs, BlackRock avoids the risk of rejection from the SEC. If others get denied, they escape the headlines. If approval comes later, they can jump in—well-prepared and with full force. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : ProShares XRP ETF Won’t Launch on April 30, Says Bloomberg Analyst James Seyffart , Some analysts suggest this is also a negotiation tactic. Behind the scenes, BlackRock could be pressuring Ripple, the company behind XRP, to strengthen its partnerships, improve institutional demand, and build strong custody solutions. That way, when BlackRock finally enters the game, they’re stepping into a market that’s ready for prime time. What If the SEC Clears XRP? If the SEC officially declares XRP a non-security , it could be a game-changer. Liquidity would surge, institutions could jump in without fear, and demand for an XRP ETF could skyrocket. And if that moment comes, BlackRock would be perfectly positioned to enter with a trusted product, perhaps even dominating the space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Traders in the region took their cue from Wall Street, where major indexes finished Monday almost unchanged ahead of a heavy week of earnings reports and economic figures likely to stir fresh swings. With Tokyo shut for a holiday, moves in Asia centered on Hong Kong and Shanghai. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index advanced 0.5% to 22,070.23. The Shanghai Composite inched 0.1% lower to 3,286.49 after flipping between small gains and losses. South Korea’s Kospi jumped 0.8% to 2,568.62, while Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 also rose 0.8% to 8,061.90. Taiwan’s Taiex added 0.5%. U.S. Futures ticked higher in the overnight session, and oil prices eased. For a second straight session, trading volumes were light. The quiet spell has been a relief after weeks of abrupt moves sparked by shifting hopes that President Donald Trump might soften his stance on trade. So far, little progress is visible. Washington and Beijing each say the other must act first. Scott Bessent thinks China wants a de-escalation Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC he thinks China “wants a de-escalation” but warned he carries “an escalation letter in my back pocket, and we’re very anxious not to have to use it.” Speaking later to Fox News, he added, “Maybe they’ll call me one day.” Since April 2—dubbed “ Liberation Day ” by the White House—Trump has ordered tariff increases on Chinese goods that together reach 145%. Beijing has answered with duties of up to 125% on imports from the United States, while carving out a few exemptions. Many market watchers say the tit-for-tat measures risk tipping the U.S. economy into recession if left in place. Before Monday’s trading began, the S&P 500 erased roughly half of its slide, which had taken it nearly 20% below the record it set earlier this year. Reports to date show the U.S. economy is still expanding, though momentum is slowing. Economists surveyed expect Wednesday’s first-quarter reading to show growth cooled to an annual rate of 0.8%, down from 2.4% in the final three months of last year. Most numbers so far reflect conditions before the April 2 tariff announcement, raising the stakes for fresh figures. Friday’s jobs report will reveal how many workers employers hired in April; forecasts point to a pullback to 125,000 from March’s 228,000. Households appear to be feeling the strain. Recent surveys indicate consumers have grown markedly less upbeat about the future. The Conference Board’s latest consumer confidence reading is due later Tuesday. Bond yields stayed lower after retreating from an unusual spike earlier in the month that rattled Wall Street and Washington. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 4.21% early Tuesday. That earlier surge had raised fears that global investors were questioning the U.S. bond market’s standing as a dependable haven. Energy markets were softer. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped 33 cents to $61.72 a barrel in electronic trading. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 32 cents to $64.46. In currency dealings, the dollar fetched 142.36 Japanese yen, up from 142.02 yen late Monday. The euro eased to $1.1401 from $1.1422. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Garlinghouse emphasized that the financial system is entering a new phase, driven by blockchain technology and the concept of an “internet of value.” Garlinghouse pointed out that the payments infrastructure, particularly the SWIFT network, has existed for over 40 years. He acknowledged that while it has functioned effectively, it remains limited by outdated frameworks . Brad Garlinghouse: “We’ve used the same cross-border system for 40+ years — it worked, but it’s outdated.” “Upgrading SWIFT is like making a horse and buggy go faster… but why not just switch to a Ferrari? That’s #XRP .” #XRPCommunity #XRPHolders pic.twitter.com/S2Uv4blJl7 — BULLRUNNERS (@BullrunnersHQ) April 25, 2025 Ripple’s Approach Versus Traditional Networks Comparing Ripple’s approach to the existing financial system, Garlinghouse highlighted the company’s focus on democratizing payments, dramatically reducing costs, and increasing speed. He contrasted Ripple’s vision with the current operations of SWIFT, which he described as a closed network. While acknowledging that SWIFT has made progress through initiatives like GPI, he suggested that incremental improvements are insufficient compared to the potential of blockchain innovation. XRP has been pitched by many experts as a replacement for SWIFT , as it offers much faster transactions at a fraction of the cost. Garlinghouse drew attention to the broader shift seen during the rise of the Internet, noting that technologies such as TCP/IP and HTTP were foundational to the Internet of Information. He positioned Ripple’s work as playing a similar role in creating an internet of value, where value can move as easily as information does today. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Interoperability and a Decentralized Future A key part of Garlinghouse’s remarks centered on the importance of interoperability. He stressed that Ripple envisions a future composed of many interoperable blockchain networks, rather than a single dominant player. This, he argued, would dramatically reduce the friction and costs associated with cross-border payments. Garlinghouse has previously championed inclusion in the crypto space, and he acknowledged that Ripple is not the only company contributing to this transformation. He highlighted the broader ecosystem of blockchain developers and innovators who are working toward the same goals. He noted that the competition has also benefited SWIFT, pushing the legacy system toward modernization efforts. Shifting From Outdated Systems to Advanced Solutions While Garlinghouse recognized SWIFT’s recent updates and positive steps, he emphasized that they are ultimately limited improvements on an outdated foundation. Referring to the evolution needed in financial infrastructure, he stated that upgrading SWIFT is “like making a horse and buggy go faster.” In contrast, blockchain-based systems represent a fundamentally different and more advanced solution. He said, “If we can actually just move to a Ferrari, let’s do that.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to SoSoValue data , IBIT pulled in $970.93m, underlining the renewed appetite among institutional investors for crypto assets. The surge comes amid a broader recovery in Bitcoin markets. Investors have been steadily returning to Bitcoin-linked products, buoyed by signs of resilience in the asset despite volatility in equities. Crypto supporters have pointed out Bitcoin’s relative stability compared to US stocks during periods of economic uncertainty, a trend that has reignited discussions around Bitcoin’s potential as a safe-haven asset. Nearly *$1bil* into iShares Bitcoin ETF today… 2nd largest inflow since Jan 2024 inception. I still remember when there was ""no demand"". — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) April 29, 2025 The IBIT fund is part of a wave of spot Bitcoin ETFs that launched on Jan. 11. That day marked a turning point for the industry, opening the door for traditional investors to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin through regulated market vehicles. Nine new funds debuted alongside Grayscale’s long-running Bitcoin Trust, which converted into an ETF structure the same day. Strong BlackRock IBIT Inflows Contrast With Outflows From Rival Funds James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet, said the current momentum stems from multiple factors. He noted that President Donald Trump’s recent silence on crypto matters had helped market sentiment. “Historically, his comments have coincided with price drops, though correlation is not causation,” he said. Toledano added that easing rhetoric around tariffs and the Federal Reserve has lifted investor confidence, alongside the strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs that reflect renewed institutional support. Despite IBIT’s strong performance, the broader Bitcoin ETF market showed mixed momentum, signaling that investor demand remains selective. Image Source: SoSoValue Monday’s inflows were heavily concentrated in BlackRock’s IBIT, which brought in $970m. In contrast, Fidelity’s FBTC recorded outflows of $86.8m, while Grayscale’s GBTC saw $42.66m in net outflows. Despite IBIT’s Gains, Broader Bitcoin ETF Market Shows Strain Ark Invest’s ARKB fund posted the largest single-day outflow among major ETFs at $226.3m. Despite IBIT’s strong performance, the broader Bitcoin ETF market showed mixed momentum, signaling that investor demand remains selective. The rising demand shows how Bitcoin’s narrative as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty is gaining traction again. With US equities under pressure and global markets seeking direction, both gold and Bitcoin have benefited from a pivot toward alternative stores of value.

Senate Bill 1025 was approved by the Arizona House by a vote of 31 to 25, according to the state legislature’s website . The bill, sponsored by Republican Senator Wendy Rogers, is a daring step toward incorporating cryptocurrency into state-level financial strategy. It permits the state treasury to invest up to 10% of public funds in Bitcoin ( BTC ). By a vote of 37-19, SB1373, a companion measure, was also approved by the legislature. It suggests establishing a reserve fund run by the state treasurer with assets seized during criminal proceedings, with a broader focus on digital assets. Both bills position Arizona as a national frontrunner in digital asset adoption, ahead of similar efforts in states like Texas and New Hampshire. A Bitcoin reserve , according to proponents, could diversify state assets, help protect against inflation, and get Arizona ready for a financial future driven by blockchain. They point to Bitcoin’s decentralization and fixed supply as its main advantages over fiat money. You might also like: New Hampshire Bitcoin Reserve Bill passed Senate committee While SB1025 stipulates that Bitcoin must be kept in a segregated Federal Reserve account, SB1373 allows the treasurer to lend assets from the fund, as long as risk is kept to a minimum. However, both bills now face an uncertain future at the desk of Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs. On Apr. 17, Hobbs posted on X that she would veto every bill until the Republican-controlled legislature passes a “serious, bipartisan funding solution that protects healthcare for Arizonans with disabilities.” She criticized a proposed budget as “unserious and a complete nonstarter,” referencing a $122 million funding shortfall in the state’s Division of Developmental Disabilities. While Hobbs has yet to comment directly on the crypto bills, her veto threat casts doubt over their prospects. In the past few weeks, she has already rejected 15 bills and holds the highest veto rate of any U.S. governor in 2024. Arizona’s bold crypto move could inspire other states if it survives the governor’s desk.

According to the company’s Apr. 28 official announcement , the Coinbase Bitcoin Yield Fund is designed to offer long-term exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC ) while providing a 4–8% net annual returns in BTC. The fund uses a conservative strategy focused on lowering both investment and operational risks, two major concerns for institutions entering the crypto space. Unlike traditional assets or staked tokens like Ethereum ( ETH ) or Solana ( SOL ), Bitcoin does not naturally generate yield. Most Bitcoin yield products require investors to take on higher risks, such as lending Bitcoin or selling options. However, Coinbase said CBYF will avoid these riskier methods. Instead, it will use third-party custody integrations for trading, helping to minimize counterparty exposure. The fund will officially launch on May 1, 2025, and is currently available only for non-U.S. investors. Subscriptions and redemptions will occur monthly, with a five-day notice period. The strategy has an estimated $1 billion capacity, and qualified custodians will handle asset storage.

The launch coincides with growing institutional interest in Bitcoin. According to SoSoValue data , since their launch, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds have registered a cumulative total net inflow of $38.05 billion as of Apr. 28. Strategy and other corporate holders have also been keeping up their aggressive accumulation. Strategy now has more than 553,000 BTC after recently acquiring 15,355 BTC for $1.4 billion. Meanwhile, more and more institutions are expressing interest in purchasing Bitcoin. Cantor Fitzgerald, SoftBank, Bitfinex, and Tether have announced plans to launch 21 Capital, a $3.6 billion Bitcoin investment venture.

Mastercard’s “integrated, 360-degree approach” includes partnerships with several leading crypto platforms, including MetaMask, Kraken, Gemini, Bybit, Crypto.com, and Binance. Global Stablecoin Payments The firm claims that users will be able to pay with and spend the stablecoins in their crypto wallets via traditional cards at over 150 million merchant locations worldwide that accept Mastercard. On the merchant side, Mastercard is working with Nuvei and Circle to enable merchants to accept Circle’s USDC stablecoin.

JPMorgan and Standard Chartered are connected to MTN today, it added. “To realize its potential, we need to make it as easy for merchants to receive stablecoin payments and for consumers to use them,” said Jorn Lambert, chief product officer at Mastercard. Unlocking the potential of stablecoins to streamline payments is “core to how we navigate the rapidly changing world,” he added. Haider Rafique, chief marketing officer at OKX, said, “Our strategic partnership with Mastercard to launch the OKX Card reflects our commitment to making digital finance more accessible, practical, and relevant to everyday life.” Mastercard launched a self-custodial crypto payments card in Europe in September 2024. MetaMask Launches New Card On April 28, decentralized crypto wallet MetaMask announced a new “Metal Payment Card” in partnership with fintech firms CompoSecure and Baanx. The card, backed by Mastercard’s global network, enables direct spending from MetaMask self-custody wallets with no pre-loading funds or converting crypto to fiat before spending. Transactions are verified via smart contract in under five seconds, and it operates on the Linea network, which is secured by Ethereum. “For too long, crypto users have been locked out of everyday finance,” said Ale Machado, Product Manager at MetaMask. “The MetaMask Card changes that. It allows millions of users worldwide to finally bridge the gap between the blockchain and the real world without sacrificing control or security,” he added. There is currently a waiting list for the card, and it is only available in certain countries.

As part of the experiment, AI-powered accounts faked a variety of personas, including a rape victim, a person opposed to specific social movements and a trauma counselor specializing in abuse, moderators of the r/changemyview subreddit said in an April 26 post. “Our sub is a decidedly human space that rejects undisclosed AI as a core value,” the moderators said. “People do not come here to discuss their views with AI or to be experimented upon.” The researchers used AI to generate responses but attempted to personalize the replies based on information from the original posters’ prior Reddit history , such as political orientation, gender, age, and ethnicity, according to a draft of the paper. Moderators of the r/changemyview subreddit say researchers at the University of Zurich conducted an unauthorized experiment within their community. Source: Reddit Over the four-month experiment, Zurich University’s fake AI accounts posted 1,783 comments and received 137 deltas — a mark showing when another Reddit user acknowledged the account had persuaded them to change their opinion on an issue. The researchers said in a post to the subreddit that all comments were manually reviewed before posting to ensure they met the community guidelines and to “minimize potential harm.” The university team argued that the potential benefits of this research substantially outweigh its risks. Source: Reddit The university team argued that the “potential benefits of this research substantially outweigh its risks” because they have found that the large language models used in the experiment can be highly persuasive, surpassing all “previously known benchmarks of human persuasiveness.” “Our controlled, low-risk study provided valuable insight into the real-world persuasive capabilities of LLMs — capabilities that are already easily accessible to anyone and that malicious actors could already exploit at scale for far more dangerous reasons,” the researchers said. At the same time, the researchers said the experiment shows that distinguishing humans from AI still faces significant challenges because nobody in the subreddit discovered the AI bots during the entire experiment. The r/changemyview board has 3.8 million members and ranks among the top 1% of subreddits by size. Reddit considers legal options The Reddit board’s moderators said they were unaware of the experiment and have asked the university for an apology and to block the publication of the research. Reddit might also be considering legal action, as the platform’s chief legal officer, Ben Lee, said in a follow-up April 28 post that the experiment broke the site’s user agreement and rules, and all known accounts associated with the University of Zurich research effort were now banned. “We are in the process of reaching out to the University of Zurich and this particular research team with formal legal demands,” Lee said. “We want to do everything we can to support the community and ensure that the researchers are held accountable for their misdeeds here,” he added. Related: White House receives over 10,000 comments on AI development plan In its response to the subreddit, the University of Zurich’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences Ethics Commission said it had investigated the incident and promised to coordinate better with test subjects in the future. The lead investigator for the project was also issued a formal warning. “This project yields important insights, and the risks are minimal. This means that suppressing publication is not proportionate to the importance of the insights the study yields,” the ethics commission said. The University of Zurich did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cointelegraph did not immediately receive a response to questions sent to an email address associated with the experiment.

In an Apr. 28 press release , payment card manufacturer CompoSecure announced that it is partnering with MetaMask, Mastercard, and Baanx to launch the MetaMask metal payment card. A global rollout is planned for the second quarter of 2025. The new card will let users pay directly from their self-custody MetaMask wallets at millions of merchants worldwide. Unlike conventional crypto debit cards, there is no need to preload or convert assets beforehand. Users have total control up until the point of sale thanks to a smart contract that instantly validates and processes the transaction on-chain at checkout.

The announcement was made in an Apr. 28 blog post. Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak have been named co-executive directors under the new arrangement. They will work with Bastian Aue and Josh Stark, who are joining the management team with focus areas like organizational strategy and project execution. The management team will handle day-to-day operations and strategic execution, while the board will focus on setting the long-term vision and ensuring compliance. The board includes four members. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s ( ETH ) co-founder, will offer “technical and intellectual guidance” to the ecosystem. Aya Miyaguchi, the Foundation’s president , will help shape its long-term vision and manage key external relationships. Patrick Storchenegger, a Swiss legal expert, will make sure the Foundation complies with Swiss regulations as a Swiss non-profit.

The board also has the power to appoint or remove executive directors if needed. Wang and Stańczak shared that their top priorities for the next year include scaling Ethereum’s layer-1, improving connections between layer-1 and layer-2 networks, and making the network easier to use for both developers and users. They also reaffirmed a commitment to censorship resistance, open-source development, privacy, and security. Stańczak will serve a two-year term while continuing his work with Nethermind and a soon-to-be-launched Ethereum-focused venture fund. The leadership changes coincide with calls from some Ethereum community members for the Foundation to play a bigger role, particularly in fields like decentralized finance.

Analysts and AI-driven platforms have weighed in with fresh forecasts for XRP’s future, offering a wide range of potential valuations for 2030, 2035, and 2040. While short-term market trends show XRP struggling to gain momentum, many analysts have high expectations, with some suggesting it could hit $1,000 sooner than many expect. Changelly’s Year-by-Year XRP Forecasts Changelly’s analysts present one of the most structured outlooks for XRP. Their projections indicate that by January 2030, XRP could be priced around $11.4. By mid-2030, they expect a rise to approximately $16.22, potentially closing the year near $18.73. Looking further, Changelly provides insights for 2034, anticipating that the digital asset could start that year at $52 and reach as high as $88 by December. By 2040, Changelly outlines a highly bullish scenario, with XRP projected to open at $162, jump to $769 by mid-year, and reach an end-of-year value of approximately $1,450. Grok’s Broad Range of Scenarios Grok, xAI’s model, delivers a broad spectrum of possible outcomes for XRP. For 2030, Grok estimates prices ranging from $4.67 to $26.97, with alternative forecasts suggesting it could trade between $15.02 and $29.85, with a potential peak of $48.03. By 2035, Grok’s analysis points to a range between $6.44 and $14.95 in conservative scenarios, while some forecasts place XRP higher, between $23.39 and $27.04. The model’s outlook for 2040 has low-end estimates around $15.02 and high-end projections suggesting values up to $179.83, with a chance to go as high as $1,450, matching up with Changelly’s forecast. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 ChatGPT’s Prediction OpenAI’s ChatGPT adopts a more measured approach, projecting that XRP could reach between $10 and $15 by 2030, assuming growth in cross-border payments and expanded institutional partnerships. ChatGPT believes Ripple’s global network expansion could push XRP to between $25 and $40 by 2035. Looking toward 2040, the AI model sees the asset trading between $50 and $100 or higher, contingent on sustained technological relevance and favorable regulatory developments. Gemini’s Outlook for XRP Google’s Gemini AI model offers a more aggressive outlook. If Ripple achieves major success in the global financial sector, Gemini predicts the digital asset could be worth between $35 and $64 by 2030. For 2035, the model suggests a price between $71 and $150, fueled by the broader adoption of tokenized assets and financial technologies. In the most optimistic scenario for 2040, Gemini foresees XRP reaching values between $76 and $1,868, largely depending on full-scale institutional integration and regulatory clarity.

A new report by Nansen shows that Tether’s USDt commands around 66% of the stablecoin market, significantly ahead of its rivals. At the same time, regulatory tensions are flaring, with Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long criticizing the US Federal Reserve for maintaining policies that favor stablecoins issued by major financial institutions. Long and other crypto advocates are now calling on Congress to pass legislation to create a more even playing field for the industry. Tether Maintains Commanding Lead in Stablecoin Market Amid Rising Competition Despite the rapid emergence of new players in the stablecoin ecosystem, Tether’s USDt remains the undisputed leader, commanding the lion’s share of the US dollar-pegged stablecoin market. A new report published by Web3 research firm Nansen on April 25 highlights the resilience of Tether’s dominance even as competitors like Circle’s USDC and Ethena’s USDe ramp up their efforts to close the gap. According to Nansen’s data, Tether (USDT) holds a commanding 66% share of the stablecoin market, significantly outpacing USDC , which accounts for around 28%. Ethena’s USDe stablecoin, despite its rapid rise in recent months, trails far behind with just over 2% of the total market. Tether has 66% of stablecoin market share (Source: Nansen) The data sheds light on a key point: even as new entrants innovate and offer different incentives, liquidity and user trust remain the ultimate determinants of success in the stablecoin sector. Nansen anticipates that, in a dynamic where users overwhelmingly gravitate toward the most liquid and perceived safest options, the stablecoin market will likely continue to operate under a ”winner-takes-most” paradigm. The report also highlights Tether’s remarkable profitability, which further cements its market leadership. In 2024 alone, Tether is estimated to have earned nearly $14 billion in profits. Tether generates revenue by accepting dollars in exchange for newly minted USDT and investing the underlying reserves into highly liquid, interest-bearing assets such as US Treasury bills. This strategy has allowed the company to capitalize on higher interest rates and market demand without significantly altering the fundamental trust model behind the stablecoin. Nansen noted that users are prioritizing liquidity and perceived safety over potential returns. “Given the growth of USDT and USDC, the users are clearly expressing that they do not necessarily care about the yield — they are forgoing it to Tether and Circle — they simply want access to the most liquid and least-likely-to-depeg stablecoin out there,” the firm said. Competitive Landscape: USDC’s Accelerated Growth and New Entrants While Tether continues to dominate, Circle’s USDC has seen an uptick in adoption since November 2024, coinciding with US President Donald Trump’s election victory. The renewed political climate has brought a more favorable regulatory environment for crypto in the United States, boosting institutional confidence in Circle’s US-regulated offering. USDC has seen faster growth than USDT since November (Source: Nansen) USDC’s transparency and regulatory status have made it particularly attractive to financial institutions that demand compliance clarity. However, competition in the sector is heating up fast, with major traditional finance players like Fidelity, PayPal, and several banking institutions making strategic moves into the stablecoin space. Notably, payment giant Stripe recently announced plans to create a new stablecoin product, leveraging its 2024 acquisition of Bridge, a stablecoin platform. Meanwhile, PayPal’s PYUSD and Ripple USD are steadily gaining traction among retail and institutional users alike. Nansen's analysis suggests that although USDC has been growing faster than USDT in recent months, the sheer scale and liquidity of Tether will likely maintain its first-mover advantage for the foreseeable future. Among the new generation of stablecoins , Ethena’s USDe stands out for its unique value proposition. Since launching in early 2024, USDe has offered users an average annualized yield of about 19%, according to Ethena’s website. This yield-bearing structure has proven attractive, particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector and on centralized exchanges (CEXs) where users seek higher returns. While its current market share remains modest, Ethena’s strategic integrations and compelling yield profile position it as a formidable competitor moving forward. Still, the path to challenging Tether’s dominance remains steep, given the network effects and trust that established players enjoy. Outlook: A “Winner-Takes-Most” Future Nansen’s report concludes with a sober reflection: even as competition broadens and innovation flourishes, the stablecoin market is not likely to fragment evenly across multiple players. Instead, liquidity, trust, and regulatory certainty will drive users to consolidate their activity around a few dominant issuers. For now, Tether remains the undisputed heavyweight, leveraging its scale, profitability, and liquidity advantages to maintain a massive lead. However, the rapid acceleration of USDC, the expansion plans of traditional financial institutions, and the emergence of novel offerings like USDe indicate that the stablecoin battleground is far from static. In the coming months and years, market watchers will be keenly observing whether Tether can defend its dominance — or whether a changing regulatory environment and technological innovation will finally tilt the balance in favor of its fast-rising competitors. Caitlin Long Blasts Federal Reserve for Favoring Big-Bank Stablecoins, Urges Swift Congressional Action In other stablecoin news, Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long has sharply criticized the US Federal Reserve for quietly maintaining an anti-crypto policy that favors stablecoins issued by major financial institutions, despite recent moves to relax certain crypto partnership guidelines for banks. In a detailed thread posted to X on April 27, Long accused the Fed of ”regulatory favoritism” that could tip the balance of the emerging stablecoin market toward big banks at the expense of innovation and competition. While the Federal Reserve's recent policy update rescinded four prior guidelines that restricted crypto partnerships, Long pointed out that a critical Jan. 27, 2023, policy statement — issued in coordination with the Biden administration — remains firmly in place. That statement effectively blocks banks from issuing stablecoins on permissionless blockchains and from engaging directly with crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana. “THE FED HAS MAINTAINED A REGULATORY PREFERENCE FOR PERMISSIONED STABLECOINS (ie, big-bank versions),” Long emphasized. She warned that this entrenched preference gives traditional financial institutions a ”head start” in the race to launch private stablecoins, while independent innovators and startups are forced to wait for comprehensive federal stablecoin legislation to pass through Congress. Calls for Swift Legislative Action Long’s criticism was not limited to the Federal Reserve; she also called on Congress to expedite its efforts to enact a federal stablecoin bill. “Congress should hurry up,” Long urged, arguing that new legislation could override the Federal Reserve’s restrictive stance and level the playing field for non-bank stablecoin issuers. The fate of the US stablecoin market has become a pressing issue in Washington, D.C., with several competing proposals seeking to regulate how stablecoins are issued, backed, and supervised. While a consensus has yet to emerge, the stakes are growing as financial giants like Fidelity, PayPal, and Stripe move into the sector. Beyond stablecoins, Long highlighted several operational challenges the Fed’s policy creates for banks attempting to engage with digital assets. Under current rules, banks are prohibited from acting as principals in crypto markets, which prevents them from market-making in major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Additionally, she flagged a significant hurdle for banks offering crypto custody services: covering gas fees for on-chain transactions. While such fees are an essential and standard practice for custodians handling blockchain transactions, the Federal Reserve’s rules currently restrict banks from facilitating these payments, effectively hamstringing their ability to compete with non-bank crypto custodians. Summarizing her concerns, Long said the Fed’s actions are deliberately keeping “sand in the wheels” of banks entering the crypto custody and asset management sectors, while at the same time pushing permissioned stablecoins backed by established financial institutions to the forefront. In a scathing remark on the public messaging around the Fed’s recent announcement, Long said, “The Fed definitely won on PR spin — its press release listed a long list of guidance it rescinded but omitted ANY mention of the guidance it kept. That duped a lot of smart people, understandably.” Political Reactions: Senator Lummis and Industry Leaders Respond Long’s comments found support among prominent crypto advocates on Capitol Hill. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a longtime champion for digital asset innovation, blasted the Fed’s maneuver as little more than “lip service.” Lummis specifically cited Section 9(13) of the existing Fed policy, which categorizes Bitcoin and other digital assets as “unsafe and unsound” — a section that remains unrescinded. “The Fed is saying one thing and doing another,” Lummis remarked, signaling potential legislative action to counterbalance the Fed’s lingering anti-crypto stance. However, reactions across the broader crypto industry were mixed. Some, like Michael Saylor of Strategy, interpreted the Fed’s policy rollback as a step in the right direction. In an April 25 X post, Saylor said the changes mean that “banks are now free to begin supporting Bitcoin,” reflecting a cautiously optimistic view that regulatory barriers are gradually being lowered, even if unevenly. The debate over the Federal Reserve’s role in shaping the future of crypto banking is unlikely to abate soon. The current regulatory environment reflects a deep and growing divide between financial institutions pushing for clearer, innovation-friendly rules and regulators who remain wary of systemic risks posed by digital assets. As Congress deliberates on stablecoin legislation, and as more traditional financial institutions prepare to roll out blockchain-based products, the future landscape of stablecoins and crypto banking remains in flux. For Caitlin Long and other crypto advocates, the message is clear: without swift and decisive action from Congress, the Fed’s quiet preference for permissioned stablecoins could solidify the dominance of big banks in a sector that was once envisioned as an open, decentralized alternative to traditional finance.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-29 05:30:00

Chung predicts Bitcoin will rise to $210,000, driven by institutional adoption and expanding global liquidity. Chung said in his statement, “There has been no change in our market outlook. Our target price for Bitcoin remains at $210,000.” Stating that they also maintain their targets for Ethereum, Chung stated that they expect the ETH/BTC ratio to remain stable at 0.05. Despite the macroeconomic outlook and market reactions developing differently than expected, Chung sees this process as a “healthy correction.” According to him, this correction paved the way for Bitcoin’s repositioning as a mainstream asset.

However, it acts like digital gold in times of crisis.” According to Chung, this 'safe haven' function of Bitcoin comes to the fore in times when doubts about the stability of the US dollar-centered financial system increase. Russia's attack on Ukraine (2022), the Silicon Valley Bank collapse (2023) and recent economic tensions are cited as examples of this situation. *This is not investment advice.

The appeal centers on the ongoing case against Roman Storm, co-founder of Tornado Cash, a decentralized crypto mixer. In a letter dated April 28 and addressed to White House crypto advisor David Sacks, the group urged President Donald Trump to halt what it called a Biden-era Department of Justice (DOJ) campaign that unfairly targets software developers. Roman Storm Indicted for Alleged Role in $1B Crypto Laundering Storm was indicted in August 2023 for allegedly aiding in the laundering of more than $1 billion through Tornado Cash. His trial is scheduled for July, while his co-founder, Roman Semenov, remains at large, reportedly in Russia. The DeFi Education Fund argues that holding developers criminally liable for how others use their open-source code is a dangerous precedent. “This is not only absurd in principle,” the letter stated, “but it sets a precedent that potentially chills all crypto development in the United States.” The group also claimed the DOJ’s actions conflict with earlier guidance from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), issued during Trump’s first term. That guidance clarified that developers of self-custodial, peer-to-peer protocols are not considered money transmitters and should not be subject to such regulations. “This kind of legal environment does not just chill innovation — it freezes it,” the letter warned. “It empowers politically-motivated enforcement and puts every open-source developer at risk.” Supporters of the petition include industry leaders such as Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam, Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang, and Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko. At the time of writing, 232 signatures had been collected. 2/ The Biden-era DOJ sought to criminalize open-source software development.

But the group emphasized that such goals will be impossible to achieve if developers face criminal prosecution for building non-custodial tools. Variant Fund’s chief legal officer Jake Chervinsky echoed the sentiment, calling the DOJ’s case against Storm “an outdated remnant of the Biden administration’s war on crypto.” “There is no justification in law or policy for prosecuting software developers for launching non-custodial smart contract protocols,” Chervinsky said. DOJ Files Charges Against Tornado Cash Devs The U.S. Department of Justice charged Storm and fellow co-founder Roman Semenov in August 2023, accusing them of helping launder over $1 billion in cryptocurrency, including funds linked to North Korean hacker group Lazarus. Semenov, a Russian national, remains a fugitive. Tornado Cash’s third co-founder, Alexey Pertsev, was arrested in the Netherlands in August 2022 and is currently in pre-trial detention. In 2022, the U.S. Treasury’s OFAC sanctioned Tornado Cash , citing its role in enabling anonymous cryptocurrency transactions. The agency acted after Tornado Cash facilitated the laundering of over $7b in virtual currency since 2019. The sanctions targeted Tornado Cash for failing to implement strong controls against misuse by cybercriminals. Despite its public focus on privacy, the platform was repeatedly used to launder cybercrime proceeds.

The community quickly picked up the move and most criticized it as a potential dump scheme. TRUMP to Exchanges The meme coin has raised numerous questions ever since its launch just before Donald Trump’s inauguration in mid-January. The centralization, token unlock plan, as well as the massive price surge and subsequent painful crash, led to a lot of controversy and even reports about investigating the team behind it and the current POTUS. The price decline was halted last week when news emerged that the top 220 holders will have a chance to attend a special dinner at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C., scheduled for May 22. Expectedly, crypto investors rushed to buy the token, pushing its price up by roughly 100% within hours and days. Prominent names like Justin Sun were revealed to be among the leaders in terms of TRUMP holdings, which would grant them a special VIP reception and a private White House tour. However, there were also reports about whales cashing out on big profits due to quick and speculative trading after the dinner news came out. Some even shorted the asset on Hyperliquid, anticipating another price slump. Now, though, Lookonchain reported that what many had feared might have started happening – the team behind the coin disposing of large portions after the price climb.

Why would anyone make such transfers, knowing that everything is visible on the blockchain? The community quickly raised important questions about the political influence of such tokens related to prominent figures and their impact on the market. MELANIA Team Doing the Same? Although the First Lady has not promised anything similar, the token named after her also experienced a modest price uptick in the past week, going from $0.375 to over $0.55 before correcting to the current $0.44. In the meantime, Lookonchain noted that the team behind the MELANIA token had begun a DCA strategy for direct sales, which actually coincided with the price surge to a local top. The #Melania team didn’t just add or remove liquidity to sell $MELANIA, they also employed a DCA strategy for direct sales! 2 days ago, they sold 1.18M $MELANIA for 4,230 $SOL ($632K) using the DCA strategy.

According to their latest report, Bitcoin could reach around $120,000 , driven by recent strong market performance and growing investor interest. At the moment, Bitcoin is trading in the mid-$90,000 range, and experts believe several global factors could impact its movement in the coming weeks. These include the upcoming U.S. Federal Reserve meeting in May and ongoing inflation concerns. However, some analysts suggest that the worst may be over for now, which could open the door for further gains. Bitcoin’s Current Price Action Bitcoin recently reacted strongly around a key support zone between $93,220 and $94,244. According to crypto analysts, the price dropped from a recent high last Friday in a typical three-wave pattern, followed by signs of a recovery. Analysts have outlined several possible short-term scenarios, most of them optimistic. One of the leading views is that if Bitcoin continues to hold its support levels, it could move higher in the short term. The next major price target for Bitcoin is around $96,275. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered Eye Crypto Comeback in the U.S. , Choppy Market, But Bulls Still Active Although Bitcoin has shown some positive moves , the market has been described as “choppy” in recent days.

If Bitcoin manages to break through this, it could see further gains — but experts warn the market is unpredictable right now. Despite the ups and downs, no clear market top has been confirmed, and all major support levels are still holding. Many believe there’s a good chance Bitcoin could push higher soon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43932850,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153557,1745905232,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Arizona’s Bold Step: Historic Bitcoin Bills Pass Legislature,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/arizona-passes-bitcoin-bills/,"A significant development is unfolding in the United States, particularly for those watching the intersection of government and digital assets. The state of Arizona has taken a notable step, with its House of Representatives passing two distinct but related Arizona Bitcoin Bills . These pieces of legislation signal a growing interest among state governments in exploring the potential roles of cryptocurrencies, specifically Bitcoin, within their financial frameworks. This move is drawing attention nationwide, raising questions about the future of State Crypto Investment and digital asset integration at the local level. What Are the Arizona Bitcoin Bills All About? The two bills in question, SB1373 and SB1025, address different aspects of how Arizona could potentially engage with Bitcoin and other digital assets. Their passage through the House marks a critical milestone, bringing the state closer to potentially enacting laws that could see it holding or investing in cryptocurrencies. Let’s break down what each bill proposes: SB1373: Establishing a Digital Asset Strategic Reserve Fund This bill focuses on creating a dedicated fund managed by the state treasurer’s office. The primary purpose of this fund would be to hold a digital asset strategic reserve. Funds for this reserve would come from appropriations made by the state legislature. Interestingly, the bill also proposes that confiscated cryptocurrencies could be directed into this fund. Think of it as a state-level digital asset stockpile, potentially aimed at long-term value preservation or strategic use. SB1025: Permitting Public Funds to Invest in Crypto This bill takes a different approach, focusing on allowing existing state public funds to diversify into cryptocurrencies. It proposes that these funds could allocate up to 10% of their total holdings into digital assets. This is a significant proposal, as it opens the door for state pension funds, endowment funds, or other public investment pools to gain exposure to the crypto market. Both bills saw majority support in the House, though with differing margins. SB1373 passed with 37 votes in favor and 19 against, indicating stronger bipartisan or broader support. SB1025 passed with a narrower margin of 31 votes in favor and 25 against, suggesting more debate or reservations surrounding the direct investment of public funds into a volatile asset class like cryptocurrency. Why Consider a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve? The concept of a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve , as proposed in SB1373, is relatively novel for a state government. While countries like El Salvador have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and hold reserves, state-level initiatives in the U.S. have primarily focused on blockchain technology adoption or accepting crypto for taxes. A strategic reserve suggests potential motivations such as: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential hedge against the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to the state’s holdings. Future Value Potential: Betting on the long-term appreciation of Bitcoin. Attracting Innovation: Signaling that Arizona is forward-thinking and open to digital asset technology, potentially attracting crypto businesses and talent. Managing Confiscated Assets: Providing a structured way to handle and potentially gain value from cryptocurrencies seized in criminal activities, rather than simply liquidating them immediately. The idea of directing confiscated crypto into this reserve is particularly noteworthy, turning what was once considered contraband into a potential state asset. The Implications of Public Funds Investing in Bitcoin SB1025’s proposal to allow up to 10% of Public Funds Bitcoin and other crypto investments is perhaps the more debated of the two bills. Investing public funds carries a high degree of responsibility, as these often represent taxpayer money or retirement savings for state employees. Allowing allocation to a volatile asset class like cryptocurrency raises valid concerns: Volatility Risk: Cryptocurrencies are known for significant price swings, which could impact the stability and value of public funds. Security: The secure storage and management of digital assets require specialized expertise and infrastructure to prevent theft or loss. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving, which could pose risks for institutional investors. Fiduciary Duty: State treasurers and fund managers have a fiduciary duty to manage funds prudently. Investing in crypto could be seen by some as conflicting with this duty due to the inherent risks. However, proponents might argue that a 10% allocation limit provides a degree of risk management while allowing funds to potentially benefit from the high growth potential of the crypto market and diversify away from traditional assets. What’s Next? The Governor’s Desk With both bills having successfully navigated the Arizona Legislature Crypto debate and secured passage in the House, the next critical step is for them to reach the desk of Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs. The governor has the authority to sign one or both bills into law, veto them, or allow them to become law without her signature. Her decision will be pivotal in determining whether Arizona officially embarks on this path of state-level digital asset engagement. The governor will likely weigh the potential benefits outlined by proponents against the risks and concerns raised by opponents. Her decision could set a precedent for other states considering similar moves. Potential Benefits and Challenges Let’s summarize the potential upside and downside: Potential Benefits: Potential appreciation of state assets Diversification away from traditional financial systems Hedge against inflation Attracting crypto industry businesses and talent to the state Modernizing state financial management Finding a productive use for confiscated digital assets Potential Challenges: High volatility and potential for significant losses Security risks (hacking, loss of keys) Regulatory uncertainty and potential future restrictions Public and political opposition Complexity of managing digital assets Establishing clear guidelines for investment and security Looking Ahead: What This Means for State Crypto Adoption Arizona’s move is being watched closely by other states. Should one or both of these bills become law, it could serve as a significant case study for state-level adoption of digital assets. It highlights a growing willingness among some policymakers to seriously consider cryptocurrencies not just as a speculative asset class for individuals, but as a potential tool for state finance and asset management. The debate surrounding these bills reflects the broader national conversation about how governments should interact with rapidly evolving digital technologies. While challenges remain, the passage of these bills through the Arizona House is a clear indicator that the discussion around State Crypto Investment is moving from theoretical to legislative. Conclusion: A Turning Point for Arizona and State Crypto? The passage of SB1373 and SB1025 by the Arizona House of Representatives represents a potentially historic moment for state engagement with cryptocurrencies. By proposing a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and allowing Public Funds Bitcoin investment up to 10%, Arizona is exploring uncharted territory in state finance. While the path forward depends on Governor Hobbs’ decision, the fact that these bills advanced this far signals a notable shift in how state legislatures are beginning to view digital assets. This development underscores the increasing relevance of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in mainstream financial and governmental discussions, setting a precedent that could influence legislative efforts in other states across the U.S. To learn more about the latest crypto legislation trends, explore our article on key developments shaping Bitcoin institutional adoption.",Bitcoin News|Crypto News|Arizona|BITCOIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|Legislation|State Investment,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-04-29 05:40:32

The state-level push also coincides with federal initiatives to create a national crypto reserve. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s Strategy expanded its Bitcoin holdings to 553,555 BTC, which is now valued at close to $50 billion. Analysts like Peter Chung of Presto are still very bullish about BTC, and predicted that Bitcoin could still hit $210,000 by the end of 2025, due to healthy market corrections, institutional growth, and Bitcoin’s role as both a high-risk asset and a digital safe haven. Bitcoin Reserve Legislation Gains Momentum in Arizona Lawmakers in the Arizona House of Representatives passed two bills that could enable the state to create a reserve fund using Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. During a third reading on April 28, Senate Bill 1025 (SB1025), which proposes amending Arizona’s statutes to allow for a strategic Bitcoin reserve, secured approval with 31 members voting in favor and 25 opposed. A separate but related bill, SB1373, which is aimed at establishing a broader state-level digital assets reserve, passed with a 37–19 vote. Votes for SB 1025 (Source: Arizona State Legislature ) State Representative Jeff Weninger spoke on SB1025, and said that around 15 other states are considering similar legislation. He explained that the bill will initially allow, but not require, the state treasurer to invest up to 10% of Arizona’s funds into Bitcoin and other digital assets. He suggested that although uptake might be slow at first, having the legislative framework in place would prepare the state for a future increasingly centered on digital currencies. The passage of these bills is the closest any US state has come to formally adopting a Bitcoin or cryptocurrency strategic reserve. Other states, like New Hampshire, are also advancing similar initiatives , and a bill recently passed the New Hampshire House. It is now awaiting a Senate floor vote. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs previously indicated that she would veto any new bills until lawmakers secured a bipartisan funding agreement to support healthcare for Arizonans with disabilities. However, after the passage of such a funding package on April 24, there is now more potential for her to actually approve SB1025 or SB1373. These state-level moves are taking place alongside a federal push to establish a national crypto reserve. In March, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order proposing the creation of a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve” and a “Digital Asset Stockpile.” Meanwhile, Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced legislation that will allow the federal government to hold more than one million BTC. This will be done by partly incorporating assets that were seized through civil or criminal forfeiture. Saylor’s Firm Strengthens Bitcoin Bet US companies are also stuffing their coffers with Bitcoin. Michael Saylor’s firm Strategy recently expanded its already massive Bitcoin holdings with a major new purchase even as Bitcoin’s price surged past $90,000. In an announcement that was shared on April 28, Strategy revealed that it acquired 15,355 Bitcoin between April 21 and 27, and spent approximately $1.42 billion at an average price of $92,737 per BTC. This acquisition increased Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings by about 3%, and brought the firm’s total stash to 535,555 BTC valued at over $50 billion. Strategy BTC update (Source: Strategy ) This was also Strategy’s largest Bitcoin buy since late March, when the company purchased 22,048 BTC for $1.92 billion at an average price of $86,969 per coin. According to Saylor, the company’s Bitcoin yield stands at 13.7% year-to-date. In a post on X, Saylor stated that as of April 27, Strategy holds 553,555 BTC that was acquired for roughly $37.90 billion at an average price of $68,459 per Bitcoin. The Bitcoin yield, which reflects the percentage change in the ratio between BTC holdings and diluted shares, reached 74% in 2024. Strategy expects this figure to rise even more in 2025. Strategy’s latest Bitcoin accumulation came during a strong bullish period for Bitcoin, with the cryptocurrency rising about 8% from around $87,000 to nearly $94,000 between April 21 and 27. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $94,680, which means that it was maintaining gains above its Jan. 1 price but still below the all-time high. As the company strengthened its Bitcoin position during the rally, Saylor continued to voice bullish sentiments on social media. On April 25, he reminded followers that they could still buy Bitcoin for under $100,000. Earlier in the week, he urged the community to “stay humble” and “stack sats,” linking the message to Strategy’s expanding Bitcoin timeline. Meanwhile, Strategy’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy seems to be paying off nicely for shareholders as well, with the company’s market capitalization approaching $100 billion. Its stock , MSTR, climbed roughly 23% year-to-date. Bitcoin’s Path to $210K Backed by Institutional Growth Peter Chung, the head of research at quantitative trading firm Presto, recently reiterated his bullish prediction that Bitcoin will reach $210,000 by the end of 2025. In an April 28 interview with CNBC, Chung pointed to institutional adoption and global liquidity expansion as the main forces driving his outlook. He acknowledged that market conditions in 2025 have not matched earlier expectations, due to the challenging macroeconomic environment and mixed market reactions. However, he described the recent market corrections as a “healthy” development that strengthened Bitcoin’s foundation as a mainstream financial asset. Chung placed a lot of emphasis on Bitcoin’s dual identity, and called it both a “risk-on asset” influenced by user adoption and network effects, and a “digital gold” that serves as a safe haven during financial crises. He explained that Bitcoin acts as a high-risk asset most of the time but tends to behave more like gold during moments of instability, like the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict or the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. According to Chung, although Bitcoin underperformed gold during the recent market turbulence, it still has the potential to catch up and even outperform traditional safe-haven assets before the end of 2025. He also reaffirmed Presto’s positive outlook on Ethereum, and still has confidence in the ETH-to-BTC valuation model due to Ethereum’s ongoing network improvements. The broader market sentiment supports Chung’s view of increasing institutional interest in Bitcoin. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley recently pointed out that Bitcoin’s rise to $94,000 was fueled largely by institutions rather than retail investors, with Google search volumes for ”Bitcoin” remaining low. Horsley said that financial advisers, corporations, and even nation-states are now actively participating in Bitcoin investments. Corporate treasuries currently hold close to $65 billion worth of Bitcoin, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET . Additional optimism came from analysts at Standard Chartered and Intellectia AI, who stated that growing institutional demand from ETFs and macroeconomic hedging strategies could more than double Bitcoin’s price in 2025.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-29 05:46:22

43933111,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153556,1745905828,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Alibaba Unleashes Powerful Qwen 3 Large Language Models,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/alibaba-qwen-3-models/,"In the fast-paced world of technology, where innovation drives progress, the competition among AI Models is heating up. This race directly impacts the digital infrastructure and tools that underpin everything from financial markets to decentralized applications. Recently, Chinese tech giant Alibaba made a significant move, unveiling its latest family of artificial intelligence models: Alibaba Qwen 3 . This release is poised to intensify the global AI development race, presenting a compelling challenge to established players like Google and OpenAI. What Sets Alibaba Qwen 3 Apart? Alibaba’s announcement introduces a new generation of AI Models , ranging in size from 0.6 billion to a massive 235 billion parameters. The company suggests that these models not only match but, in some scenarios, surpass the capabilities of current leading models from competitors. A key characteristic highlighted by Alibaba is the ‘hybrid’ nature of the Qwen 3 family. Hybrid Functionality: These models can switch between a detailed ‘reasoning’ mode for complex tasks and a faster, ‘non-thinking’ mode for simpler requests. This flexibility allows users to manage computational resources effectively. Scalable Size: The diverse range in parameter count means Qwen 3 can be applied to various tasks, from smaller, more focused applications to large-scale, complex problem-solving. Multilingual Support: Qwen 3 supports an impressive 119 languages, significantly broadening its potential global reach and application. Extensive Training: The models were trained on a vast dataset of nearly 36 trillion tokens, including textbooks, question-answer pairs, and code snippets, contributing to their claimed improved performance over the previous Qwen 2 series. Benchmarking AI Reasoning and Performance A critical aspect of any new AI model is its performance on established benchmarks. Alibaba has provided internal results suggesting strong capabilities for the Alibaba Qwen 3 models, particularly in areas requiring complex thought and problem-solving. This focus on AI Reasoning is a major theme. According to Alibaba’s data: The largest model, Qwen-3-235B-A22B (though not yet publicly available), reportedly outperformed OpenAI’s o3-mini on programming contests (Codeforces), challenging math problems (AIME), and tests specifically designed to assess reasoning ability (BFCL). The largest publicly available model, Qwen3-32B, remains competitive against several proprietary and Open AI Models , including DeepSeek’s R1, and surpassed OpenAI’s o1 model on tests like the LiveBench accuracy benchmark. Beyond benchmarks, Alibaba claims Qwen 3 excels in practical capabilities such as tool-calling, following instructions, and handling specific data formats, making them versatile for various applications. The Rise of Open AI Models and Geopolitical Context A significant point of interest, especially for those in the decentralized tech space, is the availability model. Most of the Alibaba Qwen 3 models are available, or will soon be, under an ‘open’ license via platforms like Hugging Face and GitHub. This move aligns with a growing trend of releasing powerful AI capabilities to the broader development community. This trend of advanced Open AI Models keeping pace with closed-source systems was highlighted by Tuhin Srivastava, co-founder and CEO of AI cloud host Baseten. He noted that state-of-the-art open models like Qwen 3 will be used domestically in China, despite U.S. restrictions on chip sales. This reflects a dual reality in the industry: businesses are both developing their own tools (facilitated by open models) and purchasing solutions from companies like Anthropic and OpenAI. The emergence of capable models from China, such as the Qwen series, puts increased pressure on American AI labs. It also underscores the impact of geopolitical factors, like restrictions on chip technology, on the global AI landscape. The development of powerful Large Language Models is now intertwined with international policy and competition. Conclusion: A New Player in the AI Arena The launch of the Alibaba Qwen 3 family marks a notable step forward in the evolution of AI Models . With claims of performance rivaling leading competitors, a flexible ‘hybrid’ architecture, extensive language support, and a commitment to releasing many variants under an ‘open’ license, Alibaba is positioning itself as a major force in the global AI race. This development highlights the increasing sophistication of non-Western AI labs and the ongoing trend of powerful models becoming accessible to a wider community, shaping the future of technology and its applications worldwide.

Speaking at a BRICS gathering of senior diplomats in Rio de Janeiro, Wang warned that using tariffs as bargaining chips lets the United States demand “exorbitant prices from all countries.” He told emerging nations that “if one chooses to remain silent, compromise and cower, it will only make the bully want to push his luck more.” The remarks come while the Trump administration hints at new trade tools aimed at Beijing. To reinforce the message, the Chinese Foreign Ministry released a video with bilingual subtitles on Tuesday. “China won’t kneel down,” the narrator said. “Standing up for ourselves keeps the possibility of cooperation alive, while compromise snuffs it out.” The clip said Beijing would hold firm for the good of the wider world. Asian markets inched higher The offshore yuan gained 0.2 percent, its strongest level in more than three weeks, after the People’s Bank of China set a higher daily reference rate on Tuesday. Chinese shares in Hong Kong climbed as much as 1.1 percent, while mainland stocks slipped slightly in afternoon trade. Volumes stayed below average. Beijing is pushing to cast itself as a defender of free trade when U.S. tariffs threaten to reshape the global economy. The government has often urged partners not to cut side deals with the U.S. president. “They want to show resolve because they believe that showing weakness is playing a losing card,” said Dylan Loh, an assistant professor at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. “But that does not mean they won’t want to cut a deal or create off ramps.” Washington says Beijing must make the first move to cool tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Monday that the administration keeps an “escalation ladder” but is “anxious not to have to use it.” He argued that China’s reported suspension of 125 percent tariffs on some U.S. imports, including medical gear, plane leases, and several semiconductor items, signals a desire to dial down the fight. “What we haven’t done is escalate by embargoing those goods or putting a trade ban on those goods, which we could if we needed to, to gain more leverage,” Bessent added in a separate Fox News interview. He suggested that Washington could bar certain exports if Beijing did not return to the talks. China has denied trade negotiations China denies that any negotiations are underway. Officials say discussions can start only after all U.S. tariffs are lifted and both sides treat each other as equals. Beijing is also working to cushion its economy from further shocks. Analysts at Nomura estimate the tariff lineup could cost as many as 15.8 million Chinese jobs. Goldman Sachs warns that clothing industries and chemical manufacturers are particularly exposed because a large percentage of their exports go to the United States. On Monday, Chinese ministries promised help for exporters hit by tariffs. They also said the central bank will release more liquidity and cut interest rates “at an appropriate time” to support growth. Exports accounted for one-third of China’s economic expansion last year. As both capitals trade words and prepare new tools, Wang urged BRICS partners not to kneel down. “The United States, which has long benefited from free trade, is now going so far as to use tariffs as a bargaining chip,” he said.

SOL price is now consolidating and might climb further above the $155 resistance zone. SOL price started a fresh increase above the $140 and $142 levels against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $145 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $152 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $155 resistance zone. Solana Price Consolidates Gains Solana price formed a base above the $135 support and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . SOL gained pace for a move above the $140 and $142 resistance levels. The pair even spiked toward the $155 resistance zone. A high was formed at $153.30 before there was a pullback. The price dipped below $150. A low was formed at $145 and the price started a consolidation phase above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from $153.30 swing high to the $145.54 low. Solana is now trading below $152 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $152 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $149.50 level. The next major resistance is near the $150 level. The main resistance could be $152 and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from $153.30 swing high to the $145.54 low. A successful close above the $152 resistance zone could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $155. Any more gains might send the price toward the $165 level. Downside Correction in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $150 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $147 zone. The first major support is near the $145 level. A break below the $145 level might send the price toward the $138 zone. If there is a close below the $138 support, the price could decline toward the $132 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $147 and $145.

However, a renowned on-chain sleuth has linked the surge to suspicious Bitcoin (BTC) transactions. Related Reading: XRP Price Shoots For 20% Surge To $2.51 Amid Pullback To Breakout Zone Monero Soars After $330 Million BTC Theft Privacy and security-focused token Monero saw its price soar 52% to a four-year high on Monday. The cryptocurrency surged from its recently reclaimed $220-$230 support toward the $340 resistance, hitting $347 in the early hours of Monday. Amid the massive surge, on-chain detective ZachXBT has linked the pump to a “suspicious transfer” from a potential victim of social engineering. The crypto sleuth explained that a suspicious transfer of 3,520 BTC, worth around $330.7 million, was made on Sunday night. According to the post, the funds were laundered via more than 6 instant exchanges shortly after the initial transfer, being swapped for XMR, seemingly based on timing analysis and the Monero price jump. An X user suggested the stolen Bitcoin was “likely from the Bitstamp hack that occurred in 2014.” The internet detective denied the idea, stating that the victim was likely an OG Bitcoiner. Meanwhile, others questioned whether the wallet owner made the transactions or if it was a theft. ZachXBT detailed multiple factors that led him to believe it was likely a theft, including the wallet being a longtime BTC holder and a Gemini, River, and Coinbase user. Additionally, he noted that the $330 million in Bitcoin was suddenly moved and transferred in small increments to instant exchanges, creating hundreds of orders. This would make the owner lose multiple 7-figures to fees, making it inefficient for a normal person. The crypto sleuth also considers that the theft isn’t likely related to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, which recently stole $1.5 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH) from crypto exchange Bybit. Is XMR Near A Breakout? Since the pump, Monero has retraced around 25% from today’s high to trade between the $250-$260 range. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital noted that XMR has successfully retested its $214 range’s low as support amid the market recovery. Notably, the cryptocurrency has been moving within the $112-$214 price range since 2022, surging above the range’s resistance line amid the November post-US elections breakout. After the Q3 2024 rally, Monero entered its key $214-286 range, which has previously worked as a key support and resistance area. After breaking out of the range’s upper boundary, the cryptocurrency rallied to its 2018 all-time high (ATH) of $542 and its 2021 high of $480. During the Q1 2025 retraces, the XMR dropped below the $214 mark, testing the $200 area as support before bouncing. Similarly, the early April pullback sent the cryptocurrency toward this level, finally reclaiming it two weeks ago. Since then, the cryptocurrency has rallied toward the $220-$230 range, fueled by the ongoing market recovery, but was ultimately rejected at the key resistance level. Today’s recent pump has seen Monero break above the $230 mark for the first time since February. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Bulls Push for Breakout — Is a Sharp Rally Next? Despite the alleged laundering-driven surge, the analyst affirmed that the cryptocurrency has now “repeated early 2021 history,” where the token reclaimed its current range and retested its lower boundary before breaking out to cycle highs. If history repeats and XMR’s price holds its current range, it could position itself for a surge above the $300 barrier.

His analysis compares a historic breakout in late 2017 that led to a 20-fold increase in value within months. JD emphasizes the similarities between the current structure and the previous breakout, indicating a possible repeat of the past pattern. He described the current setup and subsequent surge as a biblical move and has high expectations for the asset. The chart focuses on XRP’s two-month candlestick. The analyst highlights a long-term symmetrical triangle formation , from which XRP has recently broken out. He visually connects this to a similar breakout that preceded the 2017 surge. According to JD, the current conditions mirror those from the previous cycle. #XRP – are you mentally prepared to take PROFITS when the BIBLICAL MOVE comes? Last time SRSI was above 80, $XRP 20x+! *Important TIP* – Read my TOP strategy! Lets make sure we be the 5% who TPs before it crashes 90% on top of Dumb Money! I called bottom, I'm calling TOP NEXT!… pic.twitter.com/rnd7YtQoF6 — JD (@jaydee_757) April 26, 2025 Importance of the Stochastic RSI Signal A major component of JD’s analysis centers around the Stochastic RSI (SRSI) indicator. The chart shows that XRP’s SRSI has crossed above the 80 level, a technical threshold that historically signaled a major upward move. JD notes that the “last time SRSI confirmed crossing above 80, XRP 20x+ within months before the 90% crash.” He points out that the SRSI confirmation was an early warning before XRP’s historic rally. In the current chart, JD says the coming days are crucial for the validation of this pattern, as he expects confirmation in the coming week. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strategy for Taking Profits JD also stresses the need for mental preparation, urging investors to be ready to take profits during the expected move. He warns followers to be among the 5% that take profits, and not to fall into the trap of “dumb money” behavior by holding too long. JD has consistently called out dumb money investors for years, as they refuse to be objective with their trading and let greed influence their decisions. He advises being among the disciplined few who realize profits before any sharp crash that could follow. He adds a lighter note by sharing his top strategy, recommending using Jim Cramer and Edward Farina’s public trading behavior as contrarian indicators: “When they buy, we sell! When they sell, we buy!” Preparing for a Critical Moment JD concludes his analysis by reminding followers that he accurately called the market bottom and now aims to call the top. The emphasis throughout his post remains on taking action at the right time based on clear technical signals. While JD did not set a specific target, another well-respected analyst recently set a target of $110 . He also expects the digital asset to repeat its 2017 pattern.

After briefly hitting an all-time high of $109,000 , Bitcoin is gearing up for another rally, with experts predicting even bigger gains in the second quarter of 2025. Meanwhile, a powerful message is coming from Washington: Bitcoin’s future is firmly rooted in American soil. Howard Lutnick Unveils Bold Bitcoin Expansion Plan for the U.S. In a recent interview, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick unveiled an aggressive plan to supercharge the Bitcoin industry. Lutnick said the government is now ready to fully embrace Bitcoin, revealing initiatives to allow miners to build private power plants and data centers near natural gas fields. “America is ready to welcome Bitcoin with open arms,” Lutnick stated. The move marks a sharp turn from the regulatory hostility seen under the previous administration. Now, with SEC Chair Paul Atkins taking charge , the crypto community is anticipating clearer and more transparent regulations . The SEC’s recent dismissal of all crypto cases has already injected fresh confidence into the market. Bitcoin Mining Accelerator Launches One of the biggest developments is the Investment Accelerator , launched by the Commerce Department on March 31, 2025. The initiative aims to fast-track Bitcoin mining projects, helping companies secure permits, understand regulations, and start operations quickly. Lutnick also highlighted the plan for miners to build private power plants near natural gas fields , allowing them to tap waste gas for energy. This strategy could “turbocharge” Bitcoin mining in the U.S., reducing dependency on traditional power grids while promoting energy efficiency. Bitcoin: A Commodity, Not a Currency During the discussion, Lutnick made another critical point: Bitcoin is a commodity , not a currency—placing it alongside gold and oil. He hinted that Bitcoin could soon be integrated into the Bureau of Economic Affairs’ official economic statistics , further cementing its role in America’s GDP and trade reports. “Bitcoin’s economic significance is undeniable. It’s time we treat it that way,” Lutnick added. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin All-Time-High in Q2 or $100k Again This Week? , The Trump Administration’s Full Support for Bitcoin Lutnick made it clear that the Trump administration is taking a fundamentally different approach compared to the Biden era. He called out the previous administration’s hostile stance toward crypto businesses and emphasized that this new pro-Bitcoin attitude is here to stay. Notably, the administration now has strong Bitcoin advocates, including AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks , helping to shape a bullish future for the industry. “When America embraces something, it doesn’t turn back,” Lutnick concluded. With political backing, regulatory clarity, and investment incentives lining up, Bitcoin’s next big chapter in the U.S. may just be getting started. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

43933541,https://square.htx.com/?p=44055,1745906700,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/100/default.png,HTX Launches Real-Time Deposits & Withdrawals Tracking to Help Users Stay Ahead,https://square.htx.com/htx-launches-real-time-deposits-withdrawals-tracking-to-help-users-stay-ahead/,"Singapore April 27, 2025 – As crypto trading activity surges, the speed and efficiency of on-chain transactions have become critical to the user experience. Whether it’s reloading your account to seize a crypto gem or securing instant asset arrivals during extreme market swings, deposit and withdrawal speeds remain a top priority for users. To help users gain better visibility into the status of their deposits and withdrawals, the leading exchange HTX has officially launched its Real-Time Deposit and Withdrawal Status feature. This new feature brings full transparency to asset transfers, further boosting HTX’s operational efficiency and enhancing the overall user experience. Why Real-Time Tracking Matters: Solving a Common User Pain Point For users who frequently move crypto assets, transaction completion time is a constant concern. Many have encountered situations like: ● A delay in deposit crediting – unsure whether the delay is with HTX or pending blockchain confirmations. ● Waiting hours for a withdrawal – wondering if it’s due to network congestion, node issues, or even an address input error. ● Wanting to contact customer support but unsure if the issue with their order is a real problem. For example, during a major market event, users may rush to transfer assets but end up waiting hours for the transaction to complete, due to a lack of insight into blockchain network status. In this case, users could miss the optimal trading opportunity. This is especially common during sudden market volatility or when network traffic surges on popular assets. Such delays not only impact user confidence but can also restrict trading strategy flexibility. HTX’s new Real-Time Deposit & Withdrawal Status feature addresses this core issue by offering users complete transparency and better arrival time expectations. Key Benefits: Full Transparency Before You Deposit or Withdraw The new feature comes with three major upgrades to improve deposit and withdrawal visibility and enhance users’ ability to anticipate and plan: 1. Network Status at a Glance: Instantly see the current blockchain status for each cryptocurrency, whether it’s operating normally, congested, or under maintenance. Users do not need to search through announcements or contact support and just open the page and check in real-time. This helps you avoid operating during congested periods. 2. Smart Arrival Time Estimates: HTX provides estimates of arrival times based on the asset type, blockchain confirmation speeds, and real-time network conditions. This helps users better plan their transactions and stay in control of their timing. 3. Automatic Alerts for Abnormal Conditions: If a cryptocurrency faces temporary blockchain or node issues, HTX will automatically flag it. This helps users avoid failed deposits or withdrawals and reduces the risk of stuck funds, further enhancing asset security. Recommended Best Practice: Always Check Before You Act Don’t wait anxiously after initiating a transaction. Simply check the network status first to avoid unnecessary delays! It’s easy to use, even for beginners: ● Web: Log in to HTX’s official website (htx.com), scroll to the bottom, and under the Products section, click on Deposit & Withdrawal Status to view real-time updates. ● App: Open the HTX App, tap More on the homepage, and select Deposit & Withdrawal Status to instantly access information for all supported coins or tokens. Closing On/Off-Chain Transaction Time Gap: Faster, Smarter, and Safer In today’s multi-chain, cross-chain asset environment, HTX’s new feature isn’t just a convenience but a key tool for improving operational efficiency and safeguarding assets. For institutional users, real-time tracking helps optimize large fund transfers. For retail users, it reduces transaction anxiety and improves certainty around operations. In a rapidly changing crypto market, knowing exactly where your funds are at every moment is the first step to seizing opportunities. With the launch of the Real-Time Deposit & Withdrawal Status feature, HTX gives users a live navigation map for fund movement, making asset transfers more manageable and trading decisions more confident. Looking ahead, HTX will continue to listen to user needs, refine product experiences, and build a smarter, more efficient, and more secure crypto trading environment.

Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund ADQ, the United Arab Emirates' largest bank, First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), and the massive conglomerate the International Holding Company, have partnered to launch the stablecoin , pending regulatory approval, three companies said on April 28. The trio said the stablecoin would be regulated by the UAE’s central bank and backed by the country’s currency, the dirham. It will also support use cases such as machine-to-machine and artificial intelligence. Source: IHC The goal is to place the UAE at the “forefront of global blockchain innovation,” while also strengthening the digital infrastructure, according to ADQ. If it gets the nod from regulators, the new stablecoin will operate on the ADI blockchain , created by the ADI Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping established financial systems and governments advance and adopt blockchain technology. Established in 2018, ADQ is a sovereign wealth fund focused on critical infrastructure and global supply chains. Meanwhile, IHC is one of the UAE’s largest investment firms and conglomerates with a market value of over $243 billion that has ties to the ruling family of Abu Dhabi, the country’s capital. FAB is the largest bank in the UAE, formed in 2017 through a merger between First Gulf Bank (FGB) and National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD). Countries line up to challenge US dollar stablecoins Other countries have also announced plans to launch stablecoins backed by currencies other than the US dollar. The market cap of US dollar-denominated stablecoins crossed $230 billion in April, an increase of 54% since last year , with Tether ( USDT ) and USDC ( USDC ) dominating 90% of the market. Related: UAE stablecoin issuer gets nod from central bank A Russian finance ministry official has floated a plan for the country to develop its own stablecoin after a freeze on wallets linked to the sanctioned Russian exchange Garantex by US authorities and stablecoin issuer Tether. However, an April 23 report from investment banking giant Citigroup predicts the stablecoin supply will remain US dollar-denominated, with non-US countries promoting national or central bank digital currency .

Rumors claimed that the SEC was set to declare XRP as an official U.S. strategic reserve asset, with a major announcement seemingly coming from Paul Atkins at 1:00 PM EST. However, the XRP community quickly called for sources, as there was no official confirmation or announcement regarding this development. “So in less than 30 minutes we will hear that XRP is the strategic reserve?” a user questioned, which showed skepticism.

He also expressed confidence that an XRP ETF will launch by the end of the year. ProShares XRP ETF Not Launching On April 30 XRP led the altcoin rally yesterday, gaining over 7%, following the SEC’s approval of ProShares’ XRP Futures ETFs. However, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart clarified that there is no official launch date yet. The false reports were based on an outdated regulatory filing, which led to widespread confusion online. He said that a launch is expected in the near future. ProShares also confirmed that no ETF launches are scheduled for April 30.

43933978,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153592,1745907645,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,OpenAI Bug: Alarming AI Safety Failure with Minors on ChatGPT,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/openai-chatgpt-safety-bug/,"In the rapidly evolving world of AI, where platforms like ChatGPT are becoming increasingly integrated into daily life and even education, the findings of a recent investigation by Bitcoin World have raised significant concerns. This probe uncovered a critical bug within OpenAI’s system that allowed accounts registered to minors to generate graphic erotic content, directly contradicting the company’s stated policies. OpenAI Confirms Alarming ChatGPT Vulnerability The investigation by Bitcoin World revealed that OpenAI’s popular chatbot, ChatGPT , contained a flaw that permitted it to generate explicit content for users identified as being under the age of 18. OpenAI has since confirmed the existence of this bug and stated that it is actively working on deploying a fix. The company acknowledged that such responses should not have been possible for younger users, emphasizing that protecting younger users is a top priority. According to an OpenAI spokesperson, their Model Spec is designed to strictly limit sensitive content like erotica to narrow contexts such as scientific, historical, or news reporting. The bug, however, allowed content generation outside these established guidelines. This confirmation underscores the challenges in maintaining strict control over advanced AI models, even for a leading organization like OpenAI . How Did Minors Access Explicit Content? Bitcoin World conducted extensive testing by creating multiple Minors accounts with birthdates ranging from 13 to 17 years old. Despite OpenAI’s policy requiring parental consent for users aged 13-18, the platform currently lacks verification steps during sign-up, allowing any child with an email or phone number to create an account. The testing process involved starting fresh chats and using prompts designed to probe the system’s guardrails. Often, after only a few messages and nudges, ChatGPT would begin generating sexual stories. In some instances, the chatbot even prompted users for more explicit details or specific scenarios, demonstrating a clear failure in the intended content filters for younger users. While ChatGPT sometimes issued warnings about its guidelines not allowing fully explicit content, it occasionally proceeded to write descriptions of genitalia and explicit actions. This inconsistent application of filters highlights the ‘brittle’ nature of current AI control techniques, as noted by experts. Navigating OpenAI’s Evolving AI Policy This incident occurs against the backdrop of recent shifts in OpenAI’s AI Policy . In February, OpenAI updated its technical specifications to be more permissive regarding sensitive content, aiming to reduce ‘gratuitous denials’ for adult users. They also removed certain warning messages related to terms of service violations. While these changes were intended to allow for a broader range of appropriate content for adults, such as depictions of sexual activity in specific, non-exploitative contexts, the bug demonstrates how these policy adjustments can have unintended negative consequences, particularly when safeguards for vulnerable groups like minors are not perfectly implemented or maintained. The company has signaled a willingness to allow some forms of ‘NSFW’ content for adults, with CEO Sam Altman expressing interest in a ‘grown-up mode’ for ChatGPT . However, ensuring robust age verification and content filtering remains a critical challenge when relaxing restrictions for adult users. Broader Implications for AI Safety The discovery of this bug in OpenAI ‘s system raises significant questions about overall AI Safety , especially concerning the protection of vulnerable populations. The fact that a similar issue was found in Meta’s AI chatbot after leadership pushed to remove sexual content restrictions suggests this isn’t an isolated challenge but a systemic risk as AI platforms become more powerful and widespread. This vulnerability is particularly concerning given that OpenAI is actively pitching ChatGPT for use in schools and classrooms. While OpenAI provides guidance documents warning educators that the output may not be appropriate for all ages, the reliance on potentially fallible technical controls poses a risk. Experts caution that techniques for controlling AI behavior can be ‘brittle’ and prone to failure, making rigorous testing and robust safeguards paramount before widespread adoption in sensitive environments. The incident serves as a stark reminder that as AI capabilities expand, continuous vigilance and improvement of safety protocols are essential to prevent misuse and protect users, particularly minors.

This uptick in inflow can now be recorded as the fifth-largest in terms of Bitcoin volume on an ETF. However, this surge in inflow was even more impressive when observed in dollar terms—this addition barely missed being the largest on record, following only the $3.33 billion from November 18, 2024, and the $2.91 billion from December 1, 2024. More and more institutions are now involved with Bitcoin ETFs, clearly demonstrating a renewed interest in this digital asset. Although the price of Bitcoin itself is quite high (surpassing $30,000 per coin), institutions appear ready to commit real money. To investors (big and small) still sitting on the Bitcoin sidelines, these developments might serve as a wake-up call. Last week, US spot #Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net inflow of 31,323 $BTC , equivalent to approximately $2.9 billion. In #BTC terms, it was the fifth-largest weekly inflow on record. pic.twitter.com/PbQ8rUTJQB — glassnode (@glassnode) April 28, 2025 A Resurgence in Institutional Interest The recent inflow of capital into Bitcoin ETFs demonstrates something entirely different from what we usually witness in Bitcoin market cycles. It reflects a dramatically renewed institutional confidence in the digital asset as a whole, pointing to an ever-increasing importance of Bitcoin in financial portfolios. The fact that this capital is entering the market at high price levels is a critical point, too: Typically, when institutions enter the Bitcoin market, it’s during corrections or periods of relative stagnation, waiting for lower entry points. Last week’s figures, then, suggest that Bitcoin is an institutional “buy” at current price levels. Bitcoin ETFs have become an increasingly popular investment vehicle for institutional players who wish to gain exposure to Bitcoin but prefer not to deal directly with the cryptocurrency. These vehicles make it easy for such investors to gain entry into the Bitcoin market, at the same time allowing them to remain in a regulatory environment and custodial arrangement with which they are comfortable. Bitcoin’s price has remained strong for a sustained period of time, and this significant influx of capital seems to make it even that much clearer that financial circles are adopting the digital currency and that it’s an asset class that’s becoming much more widely accepted. Institutions diversifying portfolios could look at anything, but here we are with Bitcoin as a primary candidate in that respect, especially given its potential as a long-term store of value and a non-correlated asset that’s much more likely to hold firm in an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Ethereum ETFs Show Signs of Positive Sentiment Shift Separately, but just as importantly, U.S.-based Ethereum ETFs have recorded their first positive net inflow after eight consecutive weeks of outflows. The inflow was relatively modest at 40,000 ETH, but it could signal a turning point in investor sentiment toward Ethereum and its role in institutional portfolios. Although institutional investors have not shown the same overwhelming interest in Ethereum as they have in Bitcoin, this slight rebound seems to indicate that the market is starting to reevaluate Ethereum’s worth. And why not? It’s been making some impressive moves. Certainly, some may question whether it’s accurate to claim that Ethereum has been making “upgrades” when it seems to have been mostly “rebuilding.” But again, that’s a topic for another day. The influx of investment into Ethereum ETFs is a sign that investors are looking for diversified exposure to the growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and smart contract platforms—of which Ethereum is the clear leader. Despite a somewhat rocky price. There are two indicators that show some exciting interest for Ethereum as an asset. The first is the positive inflow into Ethereum ETFs, which reached nearly $50 million in the launch’s first week. The second is that a recent study conducted by the London-based investment firm Crypto & Etc Portfolio Labs found that nearly 53% of institutional investors now hold Ethereum as part of their crypto assets. Looking Ahead: A Positive Outlook for Crypto ETFs The markets for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs show that institutional interest in investing in cryptocurrencies is still very much alive. Of the two, Bitcoin remains the clear favorite, seeing far larger influxes of institutional cash than its nearest crypto competitor, Ethereum. The latter has, however, seen a slight rebound in recent weeks (ending 18 September), suggesting that institutional strategies for diversifying into the crypto space may not be limited to just the two aforementioned heavyweights. The larger trend of institutional participation in Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs appears set to continue. Both assets are now well integrated into traditional financial markets. Institutional acceptance of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs reflects the wider recognition of digital assets as serious contenders for inclusion in any diversified investment strategy. Meanwhile, the development of Bitcoin and Ethereum investment products that allow institutions to participate in these markets while sidestepping the direct risks these assets can pose is a serious sign of crypto thesis evolution. With even more institutional money landing in the arena, profits for both Bitcoin and Ethereum could grow, possibly setting the stage for updated investment products to be dropped into the mix and truly bringing crypto to the masses. The maturation of the appeal of the crypto market to institutional investors suggests that the digital asset space will continue to be a money magnet, even if it sometimes behaves like a mediocre digital asset. With record inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and a potential shift in sentiment for Ethereum, the future of cryptocurrency investments looks promising. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

These offerings are enabling users to simultaneously maximize their holdings and fulfill the DeFi promise of participating in a network’s growth, all without compromising liquidity or access to their assets. One of the most thrilling developments from Core Blockchain has been the introduction of liquid staking. This is the process through which token holders can earn rewards for consensus while maintaining access to their assets—their tokens, essentially. Liquid staking has emerged as a favorite among holders of tokens in the Core ecosystem. It is significant not only because it offers yet another way for token holders to earn passive income; it is also significant because it is a feature that exists in the Core ecosystem itself. The attraction of liquid staking is clear. Staking, while rewarding, makes demands of the user: it immobilizes the tokens until the end of the staking period, which can be anywhere from a month to a few years, during which the user can’t access their assets or participate in other DeFi activities. In contrast, liquid staking solutions like stCORE simply allow the user to earn the staking reward and still engage freely in DeFi protocols like @colend_xyz, which can sometimes yield APY opportunities that are several hundred basis points above what you might get with a traditional staking setup. stCORE Sets New Record in Circulating Supply The rise of liquid staking is evident in the rapidly increasing circulation of stCORE tokens. Recent reports show that the stCORE token’s circulating supply has reached an all-time high of 18.7 million , signifying that users are more confident and committed than ever to the @Coredao_Org network. Furthermore, the robust and growing supply of stCORE underscores an increasing adoption of not just the Core DAO network but also the Core Blockchain, which together offer staking products that maintain liquidity while maximizing staking rewards. stCORE’s success stems from two distinct advantages. For one, it allows users to earn staking rewards. For another, it lets them keep their tokens liquid and usable within the wider DeFi ecosystem. The selling point here is flexibility, a quality which, in our experience, has not often been part of DeFi decisions. stCORE may be DeFi’s first instance of enabling earn-and-spend solutions that allow a user to feel rich in both spheres. DeFi Participation Meets Network Security For numerous DeFi aficionados, engaging in staking is frequently viewed as a compromise between network security and a maintaining of flexibility. Users who stake $CORE help keep the network safe, but part of that request necessitates locking up the tokens that are staked. This naturally imposes a big limit on what users can do with the staked tokens and the non-staked tokens that are part of the user’s portfolio. And this is what makes staking a tricky proposition when it comes to the DeFi space. The stCORE protocol permits liquid staking. This resolves a conundrum that staked-core participants face. CORE token holders can now earn yields by using CORE in DeFi protocols. At the same time, they can stake the CORE token and earn reward tokens. This setup appears to be a winner all around, much like DeFi that works with liquidity. Most of the time, staked assets are illiquid and stakers do not participate in the main DeFi scene. The main advantage of stCORE over models used by other blockchains seems to be this DeFi aspect. The Core Blockchain network keeps on growing and evolving, with its main goal being to offer flexible staking solutions to drive further adoption and increase engagement across the network’s ecosystem. From what I can tell, this ecosystem includes the network itself, users who perform transactions with the network, stakers, and developers who create applications that run on the network. I assume I could call all of these parties “ecosystem participants.” What sorts of products do this company offer those across the ecosystem? Looking to the Future of Core Blockchain’s Staking Solutions Liquid staking with stCORE has become a solution seen as offering clear advantages to users. With a surge of user interest, the supply of stCORE tokens is climbing, which in turn pushes the stCORE platform toward assured growth. As the DeFi ecosystem keeps blooming, a platform where you can get flexible, liquid staking solutions becomes something of a beacon. The tokens you earn for staking with these staked assets become a flexible form of collateral. This is how the Core Blockchain distinguishes itself in this space. The achievement of stCORE also showcases a larger trend in the cryptocurrency realm: a migration towards more intuitive, adaptable DeFi solutions that respect both the kinds of earnings users want to see and the kinds of liquid assets that allow them to do more over the crypto sphere. In the maturity stage of this industry, we’re very certain that products like liquid staking are going to be very, very important to the future of blockchain and DeFi. They give users tools to not only maximize whatever holdings they have at the moment but also participate in the way decentralized networks grow and secure themselves against all sorts of threats. Core Blockchain’s emerging staking solutions are projected to keep pulling in more and more users and developers. The company is pretty clearly making inroads into DeFi, and its ever-expanding reach seems likely to further entrench its industry position as a go-to leader. A recent op-ed on Medium by Core DAO makeup artist Jonathan Liu outlined what he sees as the major staking opportunities that should keep coming to Core Blockchain and its community over the next few months.

He suggested that this behavior was likely linked to the approval of an XRP ETF. In his post, Van Code noted that XRP’s independent movement was unusual. “Even XLM is not in sync anymore,” he remarked, pointing to the broader impact this approval might have beyond XRP itself. Ok. Now we see a decoupling of XRP from BTC and rest of crypto. Even XLM is not in sync anymore. Likely due to SEC approving first ETF. Wait until all are approved and trading kicks in. The lock up of XRP will be massive. pic.twitter.com/TWHO88rRYZ — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) April 27, 2025 The True Impact of XRP ETFs One community member clarified that the approved ETF was for futures, not spot trading, questioning its immediate significance. While multiple firms have applied for spot ETFs , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to approve any of these products. Van Code acknowledged this point but reiterated that the broader implication was more important than the specifics of the ETF itself. He argued that, while the futures ETF alone would not immediately generate massive trading volumes, the regulatory acceptance implied by its approval was critical. Van Code explained that the approval of ProShares futures ETF products , which is set to launch on April 30, is symbolic, as it shows the end of regulatory headwinds. He emphasized that the approval also signals a welcoming attitude from Wall Street toward XRP, suggesting its eventual integration into mainstream financial trading systems would validate the digital asset.

One user noted that previous instances of apparent decoupling from Bitcoin had not lasted, but remains hopeful that things will be different this time. Another commenter doubted the possibility of true independence from Bitcoin’s influence while crypto markets remain speculation-driven, stating, “We are tied to BTC unfortunately, and so far that hasn’t changed.” Van Code remains focused on the underlying shifts he sees taking place. If XRP becomes embedded within larger trading ecosystems as Van Code suggested, its trading patterns could diverge more permanently from Bitcoin. Additionally, he predicted a significant lock-up of XRP once more ETFs are approved and trading activity from institutional investors increases. Institutions are eyeing XRP , and a major market shift could occur soon. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Recent on-chain data reveals a significant movement of the TRUMP token , sparking widespread discussion and speculation. What Exactly Happened with the TRUMP Token Movement? According to insights shared by prominent on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X (formerly Twitter), an address strongly suspected of being linked to the team behind the TRUMP memecoin initiated a massive transfer approximately nine hours ago. The transfer involved 1.346 million TRUMP tokens. At the time of the transfer, the value of these tokens was estimated to be a staggering $19.53 million. This isn’t just a small movement; it represents a substantial portion of the token’s circulating supply and value. The destination of these tokens is particularly noteworthy: major centralized crypto exchange platforms. Here’s a breakdown of where the tokens were sent: Binance: 700,000 TRUMP tokens (worth around $10.21 million) OKX: 350,000 TRUMP tokens (worth around $5.08 million) Bybit: 296,000 TRUMP tokens (worth around $4.32 million) Depositing such a large volume of tokens onto exchanges is a move that market watchers pay close attention to, and for good reason. Why Are Transfers to a Crypto Exchange So Significant? In the world of digital assets, tracking movements on the blockchain provides valuable clues about potential future actions. Generally speaking, when large amounts of a specific token are deposited onto centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, OKX, or Bybit, it is often interpreted as an indication that the holder intends to sell those tokens. Think of it like moving a large amount of stock from a brokerage account into a trading account – you’re positioning yourself to potentially liquidate that position. Conversely, large withdrawals from exchanges are often seen as a signal that the holder intends to ‘hodl’ (hold) the tokens for the long term, moving them into private wallets for safekeeping. However, it’s crucial to understand that a deposit does not automatically equal a sale. There could be other reasons, although selling is typically the most common interpretation for such large volumes. Who is the Team Behind Donald Trump Crypto (TRUMP Token)? The TRUMP token is part of a trend of political-themed memecoins that have gained traction, particularly those related to prominent political figures like Donald Trump crypto projects. It’s important to clarify that while the token is associated with Donald Trump, it is not officially endorsed or managed by his campaign or himself. It’s a third-party creation that leverages his name and likeness for its theme. The ‘team’ behind the token typically refers to the developers or initial holders who launched and manage aspects of the token’s ecosystem or treasury. Their actions, especially large token movements, are closely watched by the community and potential investors. Leveraging On-Chain Data to Understand Market Moves This entire analysis is possible thanks to on-chain data . The blockchain is a public ledger, meaning every transaction is recorded and transparently viewable (though the identity of the wallet owner is often pseudonymous). On-chain analysts specialize in tracking these movements, identifying large transactions, and often linking addresses to known entities or groups based on transaction history and patterns. The benefit of on-chain data is that it provides real-time, verifiable information about the flow of assets, offering insights that traditional market analysis might miss. It allows investors and observers to see potential supply changes hitting exchanges before they might impact price charts. What Could This Mean for the TRUMP Memecoin ? The potential implications of this large deposit depend heavily on whether the tokens are actually sold and at what price. If the team decides to sell the entire $19.5 million worth of TRUMP tokens on the open market, it could significantly increase the selling pressure and potentially lead to a notable price drop for the TRUMP memecoin . Memecoins are often highly volatile and sensitive to large buy or sell orders, especially from wallets perceived to be associated with the project’s founders or large holders. A large sell-off could trigger panic among smaller holders, leading to further selling. However, it’s also possible the tokens are being moved for other strategic reasons, such as: Providing liquidity on exchanges. Preparing for potential partnerships or distributions (less likely for this type of token). Consolidating funds from multiple wallets. Setting up advanced trading strategies (e.g., derivatives trading). Without confirmation from the address owner or the team, interpreting on-chain data always involves a degree of speculation. Challenges and Actionable Insights The main challenge here is the ambiguity. While the deposit strongly suggests an intent to sell, it’s not guaranteed. Investors should be cautious about making hasty decisions based solely on this information. Actionable Insights: Monitor Closely: Keep an eye on the price action of the TRUMP token on the mentioned exchanges (Binance, OKX, Bybit) and overall market sentiment. Consider Risk: Understand that large deposits like this increase the potential risk of a significant price decline if a sale occurs. Do Your Own Research: Don’t rely solely on social media posts or single data points. Look for corroborating information or official announcements (though official communication from memecoin teams can be unreliable). Avoid Panic Selling: If you hold TRUMP tokens, evaluate your position based on your own risk tolerance and investment strategy, rather than reacting impulsively to potential news. Concluding Thoughts on the TRUMP Token Transfer The movement of $19.5 million worth of TRUMP tokens to major exchanges is undoubtedly a significant event that warrants attention. While the most common interpretation is preparation for a potential sale, the exact outcome remains to be seen. This highlights the power of on-chain data in providing transparency into market movements and the inherent volatility and speculative nature of assets like the TRUMP memecoin . For those interested in the intersection of politics and crypto, or simply tracking unique market dynamics, this development serves as a key data point in the ongoing story of the Donald Trump crypto ecosystem.

In the past day, team-connected wallets were sending tokens to centralized exchanges. A wallet linked to the Official Trump (TRUMP) token sent out transactions to centralized exchanges in the past day. The tokens flowed into Binance, OKX, and Bybit, which are among the most active markets for TRUMP. The flagged address transferred out all TRUMP, leaving only a small dust balance. Following last day’s active trading, TRUMP fell to $14.04, with relatively high trading volumes of $1.5B in 24 hours. The token is down by 6.9%, after facing selling pressure on DEX pairs. The team wallets deposited a total of 1.346M TRUMP, valued at $19.58M. The deposits coincided with a weakening TRUMP price, down from a peak of $15.59. TRUMP to feel selling pressure from token unlocks Based on recent trading activity, both retail and whales are becoming exit liquidity for the team. The selling arrives just days after one of the first team unlocks, which can now be sold at a higher price range. TRUMP will continue to unlock $6.89M of tokens each day in the coming week, based on its predetermined calendar. The team moved tokens just as other whales and willing buyers were actively trading the hype. In the past day, TRUMP saw a mix of whales realizing profits and others trying to build larger TRUMP positions. The token also caused peak transfers on Solana. Whales are still accumulating TRUMP, aiming for the top 25 positions in the holders’ leaderboard . The 25th largest holder now carries 113,989.238 TRUMP, raising the bar for other buyers. Just a day ago, the cutoff amount was at around 109K TRUMP.

The asset remains attractive for its high liquidity on multiple markets, and even the token unlocks are seen as bullish, as long as the token gains hype and visibility. Open interest for TRUMP remains permanently elevated, at over $480M. For the past week, open interest climbed from the previous baseline of $280M. Traders still do not dare to short the token, instead taking mostly long positions in anticipation of ongoing price strength. While the Trump Dinner incentive is seen as a gimmick, the announcement managed to boost the market’s momentum, keeping TRUMP to its higher price range. TRUMP also gains attention from the activities of World Liberty Fi and the recently launched USD1. The new stablecoin already has a supply of over $500M, and has been accumulated by market makers.

That marked a week of inflows for the first time since late March, coming as bitcoin’s appeal as a safe-haven asset continues to gain favor among investors. BlackRock’s IBIT led flows at $970 million, while Ark’s ARKB lost $200 million. BTC held above $94,000 in Asian morning hours on Tuesday, a resistance level whose break traders say could clear the path to a move toward $100,000. XRP, ether (ETH), Cardano’s ADA and BNB Chain’s BNB remained flat, while Solana’s SOL was down 2%. Monero (XMR) dropped 8.5% after a sudden 40% surge on Monday, a move that came as a hacker swapped over $330 million of BTC to the privacy-focused token, per prominent blockchain sleuth ZachXBT . Among mid-caps, Nexo (NEXO) zoomed 8% after announcing it would return to the U.S. after a two-year regulatory hiatus with a focus on AI applications. Some traders eye data releases in the week ahead for cues on positioning, with market sentiment generally dented after U.S. tariffs. “Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have sustained gains made last week. Right now, traders are waiting for GDP, unemployment data, and a number of other economic data indicators set to be released in the US this week, so not much has changed yet,” Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “The US dollar continues to dip, as institutional investors diversify their holdings into other currencies. This could explain why demand for Bitcoin has been strong as well,” Mei added. The widely-tracked dollar index, a measure of the greenback against six global currencies, is down nearly 6% in the past month — its biggest fall since 2022. Elsewhere, a correlation between bitcoin and an increase in M2 money supply is gaining traction among some traders. However, responses to viral online posts overlaying the two charts appear to be overblown in their eventual impact on prices. M2 supply is the total amount of money in an economy, including cash, checking accounts, savings accounts, and other easily accessible funds. Bitcoin prices can rise if M2 increases because people may buy BTC to protect their wealth from inflation. Conversely, if M2 shrinks, bitcoin prices might drop since investors shy away from riskier bets. “One of the recent and prevailing narratives suggests that BTC is about to break higher as a delayed reaction to the increase in M2 money supply,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “While we are not strict subscribers to this view as there are a lot more nuances behind the data, we are bullish on BTC in the medium term due to expectations of monetary and fiscal easing in response to tariff-driven slowdowns,” Fan added.",Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-29 07:23:33

Its price shot up to $94,300, marking a new milestone that could be the start of a larger uptrend. Recent data from across the blockchain ecosystem suggest that this latest price movement is more than just a short-lived relief rally. We’d seen something like that before in late 2022, and then again in early 2023. Individual and institutional demand for Bitcoin seems to have shifted back into a higher gear. And this time, there are important differences to note that argue for this price movement being more sustainable. A very clear signal comes from on-chain data that shows a sharp increase in the balances held by short-term traders. This segment of the market, nowadays more associated with speculative interest than ever, seems to be full throttle in returning to the crypto universe. If on-chain activity and prices keep trending up, this might actually be a sustainable rally instead of a pump clearly bound for a dump. The returns of short-term traders have often been linked to the early phases of significant upward price movements in Bitcoin. These traders appear to react to and trade on the kinds of market price momentum that more fundamentally driven market participants would tend to ignore. In any case, the presence of these traders once again indicates that the crypto market is functioning and drawing in yet another set of high-risk, high-reward speculative investors. Bitcoin saw an significant increase in short-term traders' balances last week, pointing to renewed speculative demand. If this influx persists, it supports the view that the current move is more than a relief rally and could be the opening leg of a broader uptrend. pic.twitter.com/uUfojXK4Dl — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) April 28, 2025 Profitability Metrics Signal Strength When Bitcoin hit the $94,300 milestone, investor profitability measures jumped right alongside. The “Percent Supply in Profit” measure—a gauge of how much of the existing Bitcoin supply is currently held at a profit—has shot up to 87.3%. To put this in perspective, back when Bitcoin was flirting with similar price levels much earlier this year, only 82.7% of the supply was in profit. Profitability has not only improved but is suggesting even better things ahead. Current holders are enjoying gains, but significant shifts in supply recently suggest many new holders acquired Bitcoin near recent dip prices. It looks more and more like a ‘strong hand’ accumulation of an asset reflecting long-term confidence. Bitcoin just pushed to $94.3K — and investor profits are surging. Percent Supply in Profit has bounced back to 87.3%, up from the March lows. For context: when $BTC last hit ~$94K, only 82.7% of supply was in profit. Nearly 5% of supply changed hands at lower prices — a strong… pic.twitter.com/9kl5umS42j — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) April 28, 2025 This level of profitability is particularly noteworthy because of its close historical correlation with the start of euphoric market phases. In past market cycles, when sustained supply profitability has moved up and tested the 90% level, we often have seen that preceding massive price expansion as investor optimism turns into market-wide buying pressure. Record ETF Inflows Reinforce Institutional Interest Further lending weight to Bitcoin’s bullish outlook is the nonstop jackpot of capital gushing into U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs. These ETFs witnessed a net inflow of $3.06 billion during the most recently completed full trading week (April 21 to April 25, Eastern Time)—the second-highest weekly inflow on record. During the last trading week (April 21 to April 25, ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net inflow of $3.06 billion, marking the second-highest weekly inflow in history. Spot Ethereum ETFs ended an eight-week streak of net outflows, posting a net inflow of $157 million last week.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 28, 2025 These figures signal a wonderful return of institutional demand. Big inflows into regulated ETFs imply that traditional finance is now quite cozy with Bitcoin, and sees it as a core portfolio asset, not a fringe, speculative play. Should these big inflows persist, they will not only prop up prices but also lend an air of legitimacy to the crypto ecosystem. Notably, ETF inflows are not happening in a vacuum. They sit within a wider context of an uptick in retail interest, a gelling of network fundamentals, and a ramping up of accumulation behavior. You put all that together, and it’s a potent story. It’s a price appreciable story, most definitely in the short to medium term. A Bullish Convergence of Signals As short-term trading activity increases, supply profitability returns, and inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) near record levels, Bitcoin looks to be entering what could be a very powerful bullish cycle. These three factors paint a picture of a market that’s gaining strength on several fronts. Although the crypto world continues to be volatile and vulnerable to fast changes in sentiment, current on-chain and market data indicate that the recent price surge is underpinned by more than just optimism or sound bites. If accumulation, profitability, and institutional buying continue on their present upward course, Bitcoin might not only overcome its former all-time high but could also breach new levels of unaided price discovery in what would appear to be yet another momentum-driven bull market.

A staggering 15.4 million active addresses buzzed with activity just last week. In stark contrast to the Layer 1 noise, Ethereum’s Layer 2 networks hummed along at a record 6.65 times more activity than Ethereum’s own Layer 1 (which is quite the circumspect conundrum, if you think about it). All of this is good news for Ethereum—an almost undisputed foundation for on-chain activity and value—and not just because it makes a good segue into the not-so-nice underlying economic picture. Record Activity and L2 Growth Signal Strength—And Strain The rapid growth in active addresses and L2s indicates that user demand and innovation across Ethereum are off the charts. At the same time, however, the unmitigated success of Ethereum and L2s leads to intensifying economic pressure for the Ethereum base layer. As Ethereum scales and becomes more friendly to L2s—thanks to the development of such technologies as “blobspace”—it is giving up the most profitable parts of its economy: gas fees during times of network congestion and the fat margins associated with MEV (Maximum Extractable Value). Ethereum Ecosystem just hit a new ALL-TIME HIGH! 15.4M active addresses +62.7% surge in just 7 days Layer 2 dominance at record 6.65x ETH is scaling and thriving. Ignore the noise. pic.twitter.com/Lb1XqSiJj3 — Leon Waidmann (@LeonWaidmann) April 28, 2025 Ethereum is positioning itself as a settlement and data availability layer for the long-term scalability of DApps. The immediate implication of this is that most of the transaction revenue is now being captured by Ethereum’s Layer 2 solutions. These solutions, in particular, the recent rollup designs, are functioning quite well; in fact, they’re doing so well that they’re returning over 90% profit margins, which is quite a bit lower than what was being returned last year. And on top of that, these profit margins are being returned by Layer 2 solutions that are now processing the bulk of transactions in the Ethereum economy. Compounding this issue further is the growing trend of apps seizing their own MEV, rather than permitting L1 validators to extract it. Innovations like Aave’s integration with Chainlink’s Secure Value Recovery (SVR) allow DeFi protocols to directly reclaim MEV that would otherwise leak to miners or validators. Moreover, major applications like Uniswap are considering or have already launched their own app-specific chains or L2s—pushing even more value capture away from Ethereum’s base layer.

This shift in value flow means Ethereum must now support an “insane” amount of on-chain volume and activity to sustain a meaningful revenue model. In contrast to its 2021 peak, when high fees created a lucrative environment for the protocol and its validators, today’s race to lower transaction costs—while positive for users—threatens the sustainability of Ethereum’s core economics if the volume doesn’t scale up proportionally. The real success of Ethereum’s scaling roadmap may undermine its capacity to produce sizable revenue unless it hits an adoption level well above present standards. In a world where L2s are hyper-efficient, Ethereum must ensure that a truly massive volume of transactions get settled on-chain to counteract the ever-thinning margins we’re taking per transaction. Ethereum faces a serious revenue problem. That’s hardly news. But the stakes are higher than they might seem, as innovations like account abstraction and paymaster systems take away the need to hold ETH for gas. If access to Ethereum’s Layer 2 (L2) networks and every asset issued on Ethereum doesn’t require holding Ethereum itself, what’s the incentive to maintain the token as even a store of everyday value? As the very systems that Ethereum enabled become ever more sophisticated, L2s still appear to be in their infancy. A Modest ETF Rebound Offers a Glimmer of Optimism Notwithstanding these structural issues, Ethereum was able to bask in a ray of sunshine last week. Following not one, but eight full consecutive weeks of outflows, U.S.-based spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a net inflow of $157 million. While this would be modest in any scale of comparison to the mega-inflows being directed toward Bitcoin ETFs, it could well be a nascent turn in institutional sentiment toward Ethereum itself. The renewed interest could also conflate something as well: Ethereum’s long-term potential, especially as the network itself evolves toward a scalable, modular architecture. During the last trading week (April 21 to April 25, ET), spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a net inflow of $3.06 billion, marking the second-highest weekly inflow in history. Spot Ethereum ETFs ended an eight-week streak of net outflows, posting a net inflow of $157 million last week.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) April 28, 2025 Nevertheless, this by itself might not suffice to counter the imminent problems facing Ethereum’s economic design. The network has to find a way to balance the conflicting demands of scalability and decentralization against the not-too-distant prospect of its native token losing much of its value. To summarize, Ethereum is at a crossroads. Its ecosystem has never been more active or dominant, yet its economic underpinnings seem to be shifting from the original design. If Ethereum can adapt its economic model to fit with its technological trajectory, it will have met one of the most important challenges facing any blockchain platform.

According to a press release shared with Cointelegraph, the integration enables users to trade over 1 million Solana-based tokens directly through the 1inch decentralized application (DApp), benefiting from maximal extractable value-protected swaps, optimized rates and open-source smart contract infrastructure. The move brings 1inch’s Fusion protocol to Solana for the first time. Fusion enables users to define their ideal swap parameters, which are then executed by competing professional market makers, or “resolvers,” using Dutch auction mechanics. Combined with Solana’s ultra-fast block times, the setup promises more efficient and seamless trading execution than other networks. A 1inch representative told Cointelegraph that users could expect “minimal fees” when executing swaps on Solana. “Users may expect costs of less than one cent,” they said. Related: Solana’s Loopscale pauses lending after $5.8M hack 1inch to launch crosschain swaps for Solana In addition to enabling Solana-based swaps, 1inch revealed plans to roll out crosschain functionality in the coming months, aiming to allow swaps between Solana and more than 10 other blockchains already supported by 1inch. “At this stage, there is no fixed launch date,” the 1inch representative said. “However, development is progressing well, and we expect the feature to go live in the coming months.” 1inch’s crosschain swaps functionality. Source: 1inch The representative said that crosschain swaps will initially support the 10 blockchains already integrated into 1inch’s crosschain swap ecosystem. The final list will be confirmed closer to launch. 1inch’s expansion into Solana comes as the blockchain has outperformed Ethereum and layer-2 networks in several key DeFi metrics. Over the past three months, it posted a 33% higher DEX trading volume ($539 billion), handled 400% more transactions, and hosted 180% more active addresses than its rivals, according to data from Dune Analytics. Related: Solana whale sits on $153M profit after 4-year staking play “Both Solana and Ethereum play critical roles in the evolving DeFi landscape,” the 1inch representative said. They said that while Ethereum’s network effects and liquidity depth continue to dominate today, Solana’s performance improvements and growing adoption make it a serious contender. The integration also includes access to six APIs through the 1inch Developer Portal, giving builders tools to create new DApps and services on top of the 1inch-Solana infrastructure. On Sept. 12, 2024, 1inch first revealed the details of its solution to crosschain interoperability issues when it published a white paper about the intent-based, crosschain interoperability protocol it was developing. On Sept. 18, 2024, the DEX aggregator revealed “Fusion+” to allow users to swap their digital assets crosschain while retaining self-custody of the assets.

Consider This ADA Rival Instead,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/should-you-invest-in-cardano-ada-before-it-reaches-1-consider-this-ada-rival-instead/,"The crypto market sees contention about investing in Cardano (ADA) prior to it reaching $1 price level because ADA prices increased to $0.69 following a 9% uptick. On the other hand the entry of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) into the market has become interesting because its presale has raised $7.2 million and has sold 425 million tokens to 9,100 holders. The current phase 4 value of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at $0.025 to attract new investors. The lending protocol design of this DeFi project stands different from the general blockchain objectives of Cardano. Will Mutuum Finance (MUTM) achieve better results than the ongoing ADA upward trend? Cardano’s Steady Climb The digital currency Cardano (ADA) experiences increased popularity as it maintains its current trading rate at $0.69 and achieves a 14.99% weekly growth. Whale wallets continue to purchase tokens when prices drop which increases the market sentiment in a positive direction. Market signals indicate rising bullishness due to a 1.06 long-to-short indicator and 0.0096% funding rate. The price position above $0.67 at the 61.8% Fibonacci level indicates the potential to reach $0.80 once it surpasses the $0.71 level of the 200-day EMA. BitcoinOS integration and potential ETF approval fuel optimism. Recent whale transactions of 180 million tokens in Whale sell-off activities show signs of profit distribution which reduces the momentum of the rally. The expansion of Cardano proceeds at a dependable pace which encounters specific obstacles. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) speeds through its phase 4 presale stage from a total of 11 phases as tokens currently sell for $0.025. The funding trajectory of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates intense holder interest because they accumulated $7.2 million from 9,100 investors. Announced token price changes from Phase 5 will raise the cost to $0.03 while maintaining current buyer profits at 20% from the current value. The planned price for MUTM tokens at the exchange allows users to achieve 140% profit while trading at $0.06. Market analysts forecast MUTM tokens to reach a value of $3 after launch which would result in an astonishing ROI of 11,900%. The certification audit through CertiK for smart contracts will feature forthcoming results presented on social media platforms to strengthen trust among users. Innovative Lending Model The decentralized lending system offered by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes it among other financial products. Through overcollateralized pools users can earn interest by accessing mtTokens that exhibit increasing value. Through a buy-and-distribute action the platform utilizes revenue to purchase MUTM tokens which reward staking participants and increases market demand. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently launched a platform feature to display holders in the top 50 positions while offering bonus tokens to these members based on their standings. The current speed of Phase 4 sales makes investors realize they need to join now because prices will soon increase. Strategic implementation is the advantage of this model because Cardano’s DeFi development moves gradually. Mutuum’s Edge in 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands as a superior investment option compared to Cardano (ADA) with its $0.80 target. The phase 4 price of $0.025 offers investors a chance to buy MUTM at a low price point as its listing price maintained a 140% gain and post-launch projections indicate a 11,900% ROI at $3. The development timeline of Cardano extends toward the future yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) focuses on providing DeFi applications immediately. The current time requires investors who want high yields to put their attention on Mutuum Finance (MUTM).

Following a move above $95,000, Bitcoin is currently trading at $94,686, reflecting a modest 0.7% gain over the past 24 hours. Although the asset has demonstrated resilience following its recent correction, its latest price action indicates a pause in its upward momentum as market participants reassess near-term direction. So far, analysts have looked into BTC’s spot market activity and key on-chain indicators to determine whether Bitcoin can sustain its broader recovery. New insights from CryptoQuant analysts particularly highlight important developments related to buying and selling behavior on major exchanges, alongside critical metrics that could influence the confirmation of a continued bullish trend. These metrics may provide clues as to whether Bitcoin can maintain its current levels or if additional corrective phases are possible. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV At Critical Breakout Point – Is A Price Rally Imminent? Binance Spot Buying Volume Outpaces Selling for the First Time in Six Months According to CryptoQuant analyst Joao Wedson, a significant shift has occurred in Bitcoin’s spot trading activity on Binance. For the first time in six months, the Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) on Binance spot markets has turned positive, meaning cumulative buying volume is now exceeding selling volume. The CVD measures the accumulated difference between buy and sell volumes, providing insight into the net pressure in the spot market over time. Wedson noted that since Bitcoin’s recent low around $75,000, the Binance Spot CVD has been trending upward, suggesting growing buying interest relative to selling. Historically, Binance’s spot CVD has shown a consistent downtrend since 2021, with limited periods of sustained positive momentum. Given Binance’s influence as the largest global exchange, the recovery of the CVD metric is being viewed as an important development to gauge risk appetite and broader market sentiment. Bitcoin STH-Realized Price Emerges as a Key Threshold for Bull Run Confirmation In a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst, CryptoMe, emphasized the importance of Bitcoin’s relationship to the Short-Term Holder Realized Price (STH-Realized Price) when evaluating the sustainability of a bull market. The STH-Realized Price represents the average purchase price of coins held by short-term holders, typically considered an important support or resistance level during market cycles. CryptoMe explained that during historical bull runs, Bitcoin tends to maintain its price above the STH-Realized Price. In the current environment, Bitcoin is testing this level, and its ability to decisively break above it could signal a continuation of bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Perpetual Swaps Signal Short Bias Amid Price Rebound – Details The analyst advised that as long as Bitcoin remains below the STH-Realized Price, maintaining a hedge in derivatives markets could be a prudent strategy. Conversely, if the price moves above this threshold, closing hedge positions and focusing on spot investments could align with market structure trends.

Dogecoin Is Trading Around The Lower End Of An Ascending Channel In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has shared a technical analysis (TA) pattern that the monthly price of Dogecoin has been showing recently. The pattern in question is an “Ascending Channel,” which is a type of Parallel Channel. Parallel Channels form when an asset’s price consolidates between two parallel trendlines. The upper line is likely to provide resistance in the future, while the lower one support. A break out of either of these levels can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. Related Reading: Why Has Bitcoin Rally Stalled? On-Chain Data Provides Hints Parallel Channels can be of three types. The most basic one involves trendlines that are parallel to the time-axis. This case emerges when consolidation happens in a sideways manner. The other two types form when the asset consolidates at an angle. When this happens in the up direction, the channel forming is known as an Ascending Channel. Similarly, a downward consolidation results in a Descending Channel. In the context of the current topic, the former of the two is of interest. Since an Ascending Channel represents a phase of net upward consolidation in the price, its upper line connects together higher highs and the lower one higher lows. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Ascending Channel that the 1-month price of Dogecoin has been stuck inside for the last several years. As is visible in the above graph, the 1-month Dogecoin price has recently fallen to the lower level of this long-term Ascending Channel and appears to be slipping under it. If the memecoin now sees a sustained move down, a breakout toward the downside could be confirmed. In the scenario that it can recover above the lower level of the channel again, however, its path may once again become that charted out by the pattern. The bottom level of the Ascending Channel isn’t the only one that the asset is very close to breaking above; there is also the 0.786 Fibonacci Retracement level. Fibonacci Retracement levels are based on ratios from the famous Fibonacci series. The 0.786 Fibonacci Retracement line from the chart is situated around the $0.20 price level. The next major level, the 1.000 Retracement, corresponds to DOGE’s ATH of around $0.74. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Sell, But Bitcoin’s Key Investors Are Buying As Martinez explains, If Dogecoin $DOGE can secure a monthly close above $0.20, it could pave the way for a rally toward its all-time high of $0.74. Such a breakout would signal strong bullish momentum and potentially attract increased investor interest. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.17, up over 9% in the last week.

43935998,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153600,1745911842,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Galaxy Digital’s Massive $42.52M ETH Transfer to Coinbase Sparks Interest,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/galaxy-digital-eth-transfer-2/,"Get ready to dive into the latest significant move in the institutional crypto space! A substantial crypto transfer has caught the eye of blockchain watchers, involving major players like Galaxy Digital and Coinbase . When large sums of digital assets shift hands, especially from wallets linked to prominent financial firms, it always raises questions and prompts analysis within the community. This particular movement, involving a considerable amount of Ethereum ( ETH ), is no exception. What Happened with Galaxy Digital’s ETH? According to reports from the blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain, citing data from Arkham, wallets identified as belonging to the crypto financial services giant, Galaxy Digital , recently executed a significant move. Over a period of eight hours, these wallets transferred approximately 23,900 ETH . At the time of the report, this amount of Ethereum was valued at a staggering $42.52 million. The destination for this large volume of ETH was identified as the major cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase . This isn’t just a typical retail transaction. Moves of this magnitude, originating from wallets linked to institutional entities like Galaxy Digital , are often indicative of strategic decisions related to trading, liquidity management, or other financial operations within the crypto market. Tracking these movements provides valuable insights into the activities of large-scale participants. Understanding the Role of OTC Wallets The report specifically mentioned that the funds originated from OTC wallets linked to Galaxy Digital . But what exactly are OTC wallets, and why is their activity noteworthy? OTC stands for Over-The-Counter. OTC desks facilitate large trades directly between two parties, bypassing public exchanges like Coinbase ‘s retail or standard trading platforms. This is often preferred by institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals for several reasons: Minimize Price Impact: Large buy or sell orders placed directly on an exchange can significantly move the market price. OTC trades happen off-exchange, reducing this risk. Privacy: While blockchain transactions are public, linking them directly to a specific entity’s wallet involved in a large OTC deal requires sophisticated analysis, offering a degree of privacy compared to public order books. Execution Certainty: OTC desks can guarantee a specific price for the entire large order, unlike exchanges where large orders might be filled at multiple prices as the market moves. Therefore, the movement of funds from OTC wallets to an exchange like Coinbase could suggest that the ETH was being prepared for a potential sale or for use in trading strategies facilitated by the exchange’s infrastructure. It highlights the ongoing activity in the institutional OTC market, where large volumes of digital assets are frequently traded away from the public eye. Why Move Funds to Coinbase? Moving such a large sum of ETH to Coinbase , a leading cryptocurrency exchange, can signal several possibilities for Galaxy Digital : Preparation for Sale: The most common interpretation of funds moving from institutional wallets to exchanges is that the holder intends to sell the assets. Selling 23,900 ETH on Coinbase would provide liquidity. Liquidity Management: Galaxy Digital , as a financial services firm, manages significant digital asset holdings. Moving ETH to an exchange could be part of their broader strategy for managing liquidity, facilitating lending, or engaging in yield-generating activities available on the platform. Trading Purposes: The funds could be moved to participate in active trading strategies on Coinbase , potentially involving pairs other than ETH/USD, or utilizing derivatives products if applicable. Internal Transfers: While less likely for such a specific move to an exchange from an OTC wallet, it could theoretically be related to internal restructuring or allocation of assets within Galaxy Digital . Given the nature of Galaxy Digital ‘s business, which includes trading, asset management, and advisory services, any of these reasons are plausible. The sheer size of the crypto transfer , however, makes it a notable event for market observers. Implications of This Large Crypto Transfer While an OTC trade itself doesn’t directly impact public exchange prices, the subsequent movement of assets to an exchange like Coinbase can have implications. If the transferred ETH is indeed intended for sale, it represents potential selling pressure entering the market. However, it’s crucial to remember that the presence of funds on an exchange doesn’t automatically mean they will be sold immediately or all at once. Market participants often watch these large institutional transfers closely. They can influence sentiment, leading some traders to anticipate potential price movements. For ETH holders and traders, this move by Galaxy Digital serves as a data point indicating potential institutional activity that could affect supply dynamics on exchanges. Key Takeaways: A significant volume of ETH ($42.52M) moved from wallets linked to Galaxy Digital . The funds originated from OTC wallets , highlighting institutional trading activity. The destination was Coinbase , a major exchange, suggesting potential preparation for sale or liquidity management. This crypto transfer is being monitored by analysts using platforms like Lookonchain and Arkham. The Growing Transparency Through Blockchain Analytics This event underscores the increasing transparency offered by blockchain analytics platforms like Lookonchain and Arkham. These tools allow anyone to trace the flow of digital assets, even those originating from institutional players and OTC wallets . While the identities behind all wallets aren’t always public, sophisticated analysis can link addresses to known entities like Galaxy Digital , providing unprecedented insight into market structure and participant behavior. This transparency is a key benefit of public blockchains, offering a contrast to the often opaque world of traditional finance. What Does This Mean for You? For the average crypto enthusiast or investor, this specific crypto transfer by Galaxy Digital isn’t necessarily a direct call to action. However, it’s a valuable piece of information for understanding the broader market landscape. It confirms that large institutions remain active in the space, utilizing both OTC channels and major exchanges like Coinbase for their operations. Keeping an eye on such institutional flows, often reported by analytics firms, can help inform your perspective on potential market dynamics and sentiment, particularly concerning assets like ETH . In Conclusion The movement of $42.52 million in ETH from Galaxy Digital ‘s OTC wallets to Coinbase is a significant event in the institutional crypto world. It highlights the continued use of OTC desks for large-volume trades and the subsequent use of exchanges for potential liquidity or trading activities. While the exact intention behind this specific crypto transfer remains known only to Galaxy Digital , blockchain analytics provide the transparency for the market to observe and interpret such large-scale movements. As the crypto market matures, understanding the actions of major players like Galaxy Digital becomes increasingly important for navigating its complexities.

After Bitcoin’s massive surge last week, profits are flooding into riskier assets, setting the stage for altcoins to take the spotlight. Bitcoin has held strong above $94,000 despite macro uncertainty. While altcoins have remained relatively neutral today, they have posted gains of 5-13% over the past week. The latest Santiment analysis shows a rise in both price action and the social media volume across the crypto market in the past week. Bitcoin leads the way with a 23.21% rise in social volume, followed by Ethereum, XRP, and meme coins like TRUMP and PEPE seeing notable attention. Wrapped TRON, TRUMP Tokens Surge 150% On the price side, several altcoins outperformed, with Wrapped TRON and Trump-themed tokens posting massive gains of over 150%. Sui, UGold, and PEPE were among the top gainers. The total market cap grew over 10% to $3.81 trillion, and the trading volume surged 21.38%, which shows growing momentum in the market. The TRUMP token spiked both in price and social volume around April 23, driven by strong community hype before slightly cooling off. There has been a rising interest in altcoins over the past month. The increase in social volume and BTC price strongly hints at an upcoming altseason. Altcoins Gain Attention as Social Volume Peaks The social volume for altcoins has also steadily increased, peaking around April 23-26. Altcoins’ share of total discussions rose after April 17, which shows that market participants are shifting focus to higher-risk, higher-reward assets. Bitcoin’s price has also been rising, which creates a favorable condition for an altcoin rally. Although there was a slight pullback in volume and dominance, it could be a temporary sign to stay cautious in the short term. It is also important to note that there has been a big jump in discussions around memecoins like Doge. Analyst Ash Crypto , in his recent X post, warned users against selling altcoins at a 50% loss, suggesting that holding them could lead to gains (5x-20x) in the next year.

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre — also known as AUSTRAC — said many crypto exchange providers are no longer operating, yet remain on the official register, and now risk being deregistered if they fail to voluntarily withdraw. In a Tuesday press release , AUSTRAC said there are currently 427 registered crypto exchanges, but AUSTRAC is contacting those that appear to no longer be trading. “Businesses registered with AUSTRAC are required to keep their details up to date; this includes details about services that are no longer provided. Our intelligence shows cryptocurrency can be exploited by criminals for money laundering, scams and money mule activities, and we’re seeing far too many people falling victim to scams involving digital currency.” AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas You might also like: Australia cracks down on crypto ATM providers over anti-money laundering rule compliance As AUSTRAC noted, all crypto exchanges and ATM providers must be registered before offering services to exchange cryptocurrency for cash or vice versa as they pose a risk of being misused. Thomas said businesses offering cryptocurrency exchange services are in a “high risk sector,” and because AUSTRAC registration gives them legitimacy, inactive ones can be targeted and taken over by criminals. AUSTRAC said it may cancel registrations where there are “reasonable grounds” to believe the business is no longer operating, adding that these cancellations will be published on AUSTRAC’s website. The agency also plans to launch a publicly searchable register so consumers can check whether a crypto exchange is registered and under regulatory oversight.

The legislation, called the Arizona Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act ( S.B. 1025 ), allows the state treasurer and retirement system to invest as much as 10% of available funds in crypto. “This bill represents an emerging approach by a state government to integrate cryptocurrency into public financial management, reflecting the growing mainstream acceptance of digital assets,” the bill summary read. Passed on Monday, the bill has been sent to the governor’s desk for approval, Bloomberg Government reported . ARIZONA JUST BECAME THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO PASS STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE LEGISLATION IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE. ONTO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK! pic.twitter.com/GLTBdNTkpq — Dennis Porter (@Dennis_Porter_) April 28, 2025 Notably, Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs has recently pledged to veto all bills until the legislature passes a bill for disability funding. She has so far turned down 15 bills sent to her desk in the last week alone. What Does the Arizona Bill Say The SB1025 bill focuses exclusively on Bitcoin as an investment asset. The legislation defines how Arizona manages its public monies from the state treasury and pensions. Further, the state of Arizona “may store” its public fund’s crypto holdings in a “secure, segregated account within the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,” if the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury establishes a Bitcoin reserve. The bill has been co-sponsored by Republicans Sen. Wendy Rogers and Rep. Jeff Weninger. If signed into law, Arizona would become the first state to fully integrate crypto into its finances. US States Weigh to Establish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Other US states, such as Utah, passed Bitcoin-related legislation last month, but removed the Bitcoin reserve provision during final approval. Meanwhile, Texas and New Hampshire have seen similar legislation, with the Texas Senate approving its Bitcoin reserve bill on March 6. Recently, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear officially signed House Bill 701 , known as the “Bitcoin Rights” bill, into law. Kentucky has become one of the latest states to enact legislation protecting digital asset users and operations. Besides, Missouri is also weighing whether to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve.

Bittensor ( TAO ) jumped 12% to hit an intraday high of $388 on April 28 before cooling down a bit to around $372 by press time. That’s an 18% gain over the past week, and it’s now up a massive 120% from its monthly low. Its market cap has also exploded, sitting at over $4.32 billion, way up from around $1.95 billion at the start of April. As of April 29, morning Asian time, its daily trading volume was 87% higher than the previous day at over $208 million, indicating a rise in trading activity. The surge followed a sharp increase in futures open interest in recent days, which hit a 3-month high of $258 million on April 25, way up from about $155 million just a month ago, per data from CoinGlass. The simultaneous rise in price and open interest typically signals strengthening bullish sentiment. On top of that, funding rates have flipped positive again, showing that traders are willing to pay a premium to stay long. Right now, the long/short ratio for TAO/USDT on Binance is sitting at 1.14, meaning more traders are betting on the price going up rather than down. A ratio above 1 generally signals a bullish bias. You might also like: TAO price action shifts hints at 200% rally potential, but one key confirmation remains TAO’s recent price surge appears tied to renewed attention after Grayscale spotlighted its Bittensor Trust in an April 28 X post . Although the trust launched back in August 2024, the announcement has reignited interest within the TAO community. As one of the most prominent names in crypto asset management, Grayscale ’s involvement adds institutional credibility. Meanwhile, the crypto community appears bullish on TAO. CoinMarketCap’s data shows that 83% of traders are expecting short-term gains, and TAO has stayed in positive social sentiment territory for 12 straight days. It’s even trending on Google as more investors and traders catch onto the hype. TAO price analysis On the 1-day USDT chart, TAO recently broke out of a multi-month falling wedge pattern, a setup often considered bullish in technical analysis. When price breaks above the upper trendline of this pattern, it typically signals the continuation of an upward trend. TAO price, CMF chart — April 29 | Source: crypto.news Currently, TAO is moving within an ascending channel and is approaching key resistance near the $400 level. Based on the chart structure, it appears poised to test and possibly break through this level soon. Adding to the bullish case, the Chaikin Money Flow has climbed to 0.13, suggesting increased buying pressure. If this upward momentum continues, TAO’s price could see further gains in the short term. TAO 50-day and 200-day EMA chart — April 29 | Source: crypto.news Additionally, a golden cross has just formed on the daily chart, where the 20-day EMA (blue) has crossed above the 50-day EMA (green). This is generally viewed as a bullish signal. The last time this crossover occurred, TAO surged nearly 140% within a month. If the current setup follows a similar path, TAO could potentially breach the $485 resistance level, which his up nearly 30% from its current price, in the coming weeks. Analysts remain optimistic that the current momentum could extend further, and some are already eyeing higher targets. According to analyst Quinten, TAO’s recent breakout above $360 is significant, and a retest of that level as support could pave the way for a move toward the $485 target.

The $970 million inflow on Monday marks a powerful comeback in investor interest, particularly among institutions looking to add Bitcoin to their portfolios. Nearly *$1bil* into iShares Bitcoin ETF today… 2nd largest inflow since Jan 2024 inception. I still remember when there was ""no demand"". — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) April 29, 2025 Selective Appetite for Bitcoin ETFs While IBIT saw massive gains, other Bitcoin ETFs struggled. Fidelity’s FBTC posted about $87 million in outflows, while Grayscale’s GBTC lost $42 million . Ark Invest’s ARKB had the roughest day, seeing over $226 million in outflows. This growing divergence suggests that while investors are returning to crypto, they are being highly selective — and BlackRock seems to be winning their trust . The spike in BlackRock Bitcoin ETF inflow also comes alongside a broader uptick in Bitcoin sentiment. As stock markets wobble and economic uncertainty builds, many are turning to Bitcoin again — viewing it as a hedge much like gold. Supporters argue that Bitcoin’s relatively steady performance in recent weeks makes it an attractive place to park capital during turbulent times. Politics, Fed Policy, and Market Mood Adding to the improving market sentiment, Unity Wallet’s COO James Toledano noted that easing fears around tariffs and a more optimistic Federal Reserve outlook have helped lift investor confidence. Interestingly, he also pointed out that former President Trump’s recent silence on crypto , a departure from his typically market-moving comments, may have helped calm nerves — though he acknowledged it’s hard to directly connect the two. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: Still Finding Their Footing BlackRock’s IBIT belongs to a new generation of spot Bitcoin ETFs that debuted in January, allowing both regular and institutional investors to access Bitcoin through traditional market channels. While the broader spot ETF market is still stabilizing, BlackRock’s overwhelming inflows show where momentum is clearly building . Adding more perspective, a crypto analyst highlighted that the gap between BlackRock’s IBIT holdings and MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin stash is narrowing rapidly .Currently, IBIT holds 573,869 BTC , compared to MicroStrategy’s 553,555 BTC .

One of them is a plan to launch spot Bitcoin ETF within this year. According to a report by local media Edaily, the People’s Power Party announced trading for digital asset spot ETF will be permitted this year. For the first time, traders in the country will be able invest in exchange-traded funds linked to major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). Representative Park Soo-min said its about time South Korea allowed for crypto-backed ETFs in the market, considering other countries like the U.S., Hong Kong, and the U.K. have already taken the lead. “Hong Kong and the U.K. have also approved spot ETF trading in succession. Korea has no time to delay,” said Park. The decision is part of a series of regulatory changes proposed by the ruling party to accelerate the crypto industry in the country. Starting from the second quarter of this year, companies will be able to trade in digital assets.

Another major breakthrough is the abolishment of the “One Crypto Exchange, One Bank” policy. Under the policy, crypto exchanges in South Korea are only allowed to be tethered to one bank at a time. It was done to prevent financial crimes such as money laundering and to detect suspicion transaction. However, the South Korean government realized that this policy is extremely restrictive for crypto exchanges that wish to establish partnerships with multiple banks. In addition, the People Power Party also announced the creation of a token securities STO bill, which would include a stablecoin regulation system that meets global standards, basic laws for improving digital assets, and establishment of a new taxation system for crypto. “We will not allow the authorities’ outdated regulations to hinder the growth of virtual assets that can help finance grow,” said Rep. Park. In order to implement these changes, the Party wants to form a special committee on virtual assets directly under the People Power Party presidential candidate. The committee plans to take the lead in institutionalizing virtual assets, creating a foundation for industrial innovation within the crypto landscape. According to a recent report by Hana Bank, young South Korean investors are leaning towards crypto investments. Not only that, the data showed that more than 30% of South Korea’s wealthy investors prefer crypto for long-term investments, outpacing interest in gold or property.

The Ethereum Foundation (EF), a cornerstone entity behind the Ethereum blockchain, recently made a significant announcement that signals a move towards greater organizational clarity and efficiency. This development is particularly noteworthy for anyone following the evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem and the structures that support its continued growth. The news centers around a revamped management and board structure, designed to clearly delineate responsibilities and streamline operations. What’s Happening with the Ethereum Foundation Structure? The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has unveiled a new organizational blueprint. According to a blog post on their official website, this restructuring aims to provide much-needed clarity on the roles and responsibilities within the foundation. This isn’t just an internal shuffle; it’s a strategic move to ensure the EF can effectively support the decentralized Ethereum network while maintaining robust internal governance. The core of the revamp involves establishing distinct functions for the management team and the board: Management Team: This group will be the engine driving the EF’s day-to-day activities. Their focus is on strategic planning and operational execution. Think of them as the implementers, tasked with bringing the EF’s vision and initiatives to life. Board: The board takes on a higher-level oversight role. They are positioned as a security council, primarily responsible for ensuring compliance, particularly with Swiss regulations (as the EF is based in Switzerland). A critical function of the board is also the selection and, if necessary, termination of executive directors. This separation of powers is a common practice in traditional organizational structures, brought into the unique context of a leading blockchain organization . It aims to prevent potential conflicts of interest and ensure accountability. Meet the New EF Management Team and Board The announcement also introduced the key individuals who will fill these crucial roles. Understanding who is in these positions provides insight into the future direction and operational focus of the Ethereum Foundation. The new management team is composed of: Hsiao-Wei Wang: Serving as a Co-Executive Director. Tomasz K. Stańczak: Serving as the other Co-Executive Director. Bastian Aue: His focus areas include organizational strategy, hiring and training initiatives, and stewarding EF resources and projects. Josh Stark: He will concentrate on project execution, managing communications and marketing efforts, and stewarding. This team brings together individuals with diverse skill sets necessary for managing a complex organization supporting a global, decentralized network. The board comprises a mix of foundational figures and legal expertise: Vitalik Buterin: The founder of Ethereum, providing historical perspective and visionary input. Aya Miyaguchi: Serving as President of the board. Patrick Storchenegger: Bringing essential Swiss legal counsel to ensure regulatory compliance. Hsiao-Wei Wang: Uniquely positioned to also serve on the board, acting as a crucial bridge between the board’s oversight function and the management team’s execution responsibilities. This composition suggests a focus on strategic direction, legal soundness, and maintaining a connection between the foundational principles and the operational realities. Why is This Revamp Important for Ethereum Governance ? While the Ethereum Foundation is not the central governing body of the decentralized Ethereum network itself (which is governed by its community, developers, and users through various consensus mechanisms and EIP processes), the EF plays a significant role in funding research, development, and ecosystem growth. Therefore, the clarity and efficiency of the EF’s internal structure indirectly impact the health and progress of the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Key benefits of this restructuring include: Increased Accountability: Clearly defined roles make it easier to understand who is responsible for what, improving accountability within the organization. Improved Efficiency: With distinct operational and oversight teams, decision-making and execution processes can potentially become faster and more focused. Enhanced Compliance: Placing compliance firmly under the board’s purview, especially with specific legal expertise like Swiss counsel, strengthens the EF’s ability to navigate the complex regulatory landscape facing crypto news organizations and projects globally. Better Strategic Alignment: A management team focused on strategy and execution can work more effectively towards the EF’s stated goals, guided by the board’s high-level oversight. This move reflects a maturing blockchain organization , adapting its internal structure to meet the demands of supporting a multi-billion dollar global network. It signals a commitment to professionalization and robust internal controls. Challenges and Considerations While the revamp brings clear benefits, managing the relationship between a centralized foundation and a decentralized network always presents unique challenges. The EF must continue to balance its role as a steward and supporter without becoming a single point of control or authority over the protocol’s development, which is a common concern in the decentralized community. The success of this new structure will depend on effective communication and collaboration between the management team and the board, as well as continued transparency with the broader Ethereum community. What Does This Mean for the Ecosystem? For developers, researchers, and projects funded or supported by the EF, this restructuring could mean clearer lines of communication and potentially more streamlined processes for engagement. For the wider Ethereum community, it represents the EF strengthening its internal foundation, which is crucial for its long-term ability to support research, development, and ecosystem initiatives. In essence, a more organized and accountable Ethereum Foundation is better equipped to contribute positively to the decentralized future of Ethereum. Conclusion: A Step Towards Stronger Foundations The Ethereum Foundation’s decision to revamp its management and board structure is a significant step towards enhancing organizational clarity, efficiency, and compliance. By clearly defining the roles of operational management and strategic oversight, the EF aims to strengthen its internal governance. This move, while internal to the foundation, is crucial for its continued ability to support the decentralized Ethereum network effectively. It reflects the growing maturity of the ecosystem and the increasing importance of robust organizational structures even within the decentralized world of blockchain. The new leadership is now tasked with navigating the complexities of supporting a global network while adhering to the principles of transparency and accountability that are vital to the crypto space.

The OCCRP reported on April 28 , citing leaked company records and bank statements, that nearly half of the €100 million ($114 million) raised during Bankera’s ICO was transferred to a bank in Vanuatu. The institution had been purchased by Bankera’s founders, Vytautas Karalevičius, Justas Dobiliauskas, and Mantas Mockevičius. Bankera Founders Used ICO Funds to Build Real Estate Portfolio The report alleges that the Vanuatu bank then issued millions of euros in loans to companies owned by the trio, enabling them to build a portfolio of luxury real estate, including a villa on the French Riviera and upscale properties in Lithuania, where Bankera was originally founded. The leaked documents reportedly show that funds were funneled through loans to related companies and directly to the founders for “personal use.” Lawyers for the founders denied that the ICO was fraudulent but declined to address specific transactions. Bankera had promoted itself as the “bank for the blockchain era,” offering services such as crypto holding, trading, and investment products. Its ICO attracted investors with promises of discounted rates and weekly payouts in BNK tokens. However, one investor told the OCCRP that the payouts quickly “dropped significantly below the promised amount” before the revenue-sharing program was halted entirely in 2022. The company also pledged to secure a European Union banking license, a promise that has yet to materialize. Despite raising €100 million during its ICO, the fully diluted market value of Bankera’s BNK token now stands at just $975,710, according to CoinGecko data. Bankera remains active, offering crypto-related financial services and maintaining a visible presence on LinkedIn and, to a lesser extent, X (formerly Twitter).

SEC Drops Dragonchain Crypto Lawsuit Over ICO Last week, the SEC filed a joint motion with blockchain company Dragonchain to dismiss its ongoing lawsuit against the firm. The SEC originally launched legal action against Dragonchain in August 2022, accusing the firm and its affiliates of conducting an unregistered securities offering through their 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). Under former Chair Gary Gensler, the SEC pursued aggressive enforcement actions against numerous crypto projects, asserting that many digital assets qualified as unregistered investment securities. However, with President Donald Trump’s reelection and Gensler’s departure, the SEC has softened its stance on cryptocurrency regulation. The newly formed Crypto Task Force has focused on clarifying which digital assets fall outside the agency’s jurisdiction, recently stating that most meme coins are not considered securities.

In the memo filed late Monday, the DOJ urged the court to impose a 20-year prison sentence, calling the crimes a “deliberate, calculated” fraud that caused nearly $7 billion in customer losses and left thousands financially devastated. Mashinsky, who pleaded guilty in December to misrepresenting the safety of customer deposits and manipulating Celsius's CEL token, “refuses to accept responsibility” for his crimes and continues to shift blame to regulators, market conditions and even his victims, prosecutors said. “Mashinsky’s crimes were not the product of negligence, naivete, or bad luck,” they wrote. “They were the result of deliberate, calculated decisions to lie, deceive, and steal in pursuit of personal fortune.” At its peak in 2021, Celsius managed more than $20 billion in customer crypto assets. Mashinsky aggressively marketed the platform as a safe alternative to banks, promising high yields and low risk. Prosecutors said those promises were a sham: Celsius took uncollateralized loans, made risky trades and secretly used customer assets to manipulate the price of its CEL token — all while publicly assuring customers their funds were safe. Mashinsky personally sold over $48 million worth of CEL at inflated prices , prosecutors said, even as he told customers he was ""HODLing"" alongside them. When Celsius collapsed into bankruptcy in July 2022 , about $4.7 billion in customer funds were trapped. Post-bankruptcy, customers were left with a shortfall exceeding $1 billion. Adjusting for today's crypto prices post-2024's "" Trump-trade "" rally, prosecutors estimate the total loss is closer to $7 billion. Prosecutors warned that anything less than a significant prison sentence would fail to reflect the gravity of Mashinsky’s conduct, undermine respect for the law, and send the wrong message to other crypto executives tempted to chase personal enrichment at the expense of their customers.

A significant development highlighting this trend comes from Paris, where a promising fintech firm is making waves. Let’s dive into how Blockchain B2B Payments are getting a major boost. Next Generation Secures Crucial Seed Funding Crypto Investment Paris-based fintech firm Next Generation has successfully closed a significant seed funding round, securing $5 million . This investment is a powerful vote of confidence from international investors, with notable participation from firms based in Cyprus and Austria. For a startup in the innovative, often complex space of blockchain and digital assets, securing this level of early-stage investment is a critical milestone. Seed funding like this provides the necessary capital to move from concept and initial development to launching and scaling a viable product. Why is this funding so important? It validates the market need for Next Generation’s solution. It provides the resources to build and launch the core technology. It signals investor confidence in the team and their vision. It allows the company to attract talent and build out necessary infrastructure. This funding round is not just about the money; it’s about gaining strategic partners who believe in the potential of leveraging blockchain technology to revolutionize B2B financial operations. What Problem is Next Generation Solving with Blockchain B2B Payments ? Traditional B2B payment systems, while functional, are often plagued by inefficiencies. Think about it: High Costs: Transaction fees, foreign exchange costs, and intermediary fees can add up significantly. Slow Settlement Times: Cross-border payments can take days to clear, impacting cash flow for businesses. Lack of Transparency: Tracking payments can be difficult, leading to reconciliation headaches. Operational Complexity: Managing multiple currencies, different banking systems, and compliance requirements is cumbersome. Enter blockchain technology. By utilizing a distributed ledger, payments can potentially become faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Next Generation aims to harness these benefits specifically for the B2B sector. Building the TradFi DeFi Bridge : Connecting Worlds Next Generation’s core mission is to build a blockchain-based B2B payment ecosystem. But it’s not just about digital assets; it’s about creating a seamless connection between traditional finance (TradFi) and the burgeoning world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital assets. This TradFi DeFi Bridge is crucial because most businesses still operate predominantly within the traditional banking system, yet the advantages offered by digital assets (like stablecoins for rapid settlement) are becoming undeniable. The ecosystem aims to allow businesses to: Initiate payments using traditional currency or digital assets. Execute transactions quickly and securely on a blockchain network. Benefit from reduced costs and increased transparency. Potentially access new forms of liquidity or financial services offered within the digital asset space, all while remaining compliant with existing financial regulations. This bridge is vital for mainstream adoption, enabling businesses to dip their toes into the digital asset pool without needing to abandon their existing financial infrastructure entirely. The Rise of Digital Asset Payments in Business While consumer adoption of cryptocurrencies for payments has seen its ups and downs, the potential for Digital Asset Payments in the B2B space is arguably much stronger and more compelling. Businesses are driven by efficiency, cost savings, and speed – areas where digital assets, particularly stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, can offer significant advantages. Consider these potential use cases for digital assets in B2B: Cross-Border Supply Chain Finance: Faster, cheaper payments between suppliers and manufacturers across different countries. Intercompany Settlements: Streamlining payments between subsidiaries of a large corporation. Bulk Payments: Efficiently paying out affiliates, freelancers, or partners globally. Treasury Management: Utilizing digital assets for faster fund transfers and potentially new yield opportunities. Next Generation’s platform aims to facilitate these types of transactions, making the use of digital assets for business payments practical and accessible. The Broader Impact of Fintech Funding in This Space The investment in Next Generation is indicative of a broader trend: increasing Fintech Funding flowing into companies that are building the infrastructure to connect traditional finance with the digital asset world. Investors recognize the immense potential for disruption and efficiency gains in areas like payments, lending, and asset management by leveraging blockchain technology. This funding environment fosters innovation and competition, ultimately leading to better solutions for businesses and consumers alike. It signals that the financial industry is moving towards a more integrated future, where digital assets play a crucial role alongside traditional financial instruments. Benefits of Next Generation’s Approach: Efficiency: Streamlined payment processes reduce manual work and errors. Speed: Near-instantaneous settlement for cross-border transactions. Cost Reduction: Lower transaction fees compared to traditional methods. Transparency: Immutable transaction records on the blockchain improve auditability. Accessibility: Potential to connect businesses in regions underserved by traditional banking. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving globally. Adoption Hurdles: Educating businesses and integrating with existing ERP/accounting systems. Scalability: Ensuring the blockchain network can handle high volumes of B2B transactions. Security Risks: Protecting against hacks and smart contract vulnerabilities. Actionable Insights for Businesses: Businesses should start exploring how blockchain and digital assets could impact their payment and treasury operations. While Next Generation’s platform is just launching, staying informed about these developments is key to future-proofing your financial infrastructure. Consider: Assessing current B2B payment pain points (cost, speed, complexity). Researching potential blockchain/digital asset solutions relevant to your industry. Engaging with fintech providers building in this space. Understanding the regulatory environment in your operating regions. Conclusion: A Promising Step for the Future of Business Payments Next Generation’s successful Seed Funding Crypto round and their focus on building a Blockchain B2B Payments ecosystem that acts as a robust TradFi DeFi Bridge is a significant development. It underscores the growing momentum behind leveraging digital assets to solve real-world business problems, specifically in the often-antiquated B2B payment sector. While challenges remain, the infusion of Fintech Funding into companies like Next Generation suggests a future where Digital Asset Payments are not just possible, but a preferred method for businesses seeking efficiency and innovation. This is a space to watch closely as Next Generation moves towards launching its platform and demonstrating the tangible benefits of its vision.

Three major UAE organizations, International Holding Company (IHC), ADQ, and First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB), have come together to launch a brand-new stablecoin backed by the UAE Dirham. However, Abu Dhabi’s ambitious plan challenges the dominance of US dollar-backed stablecoins, as other countries also look to create their national alternatives. Safe, Fast, and Global Payments The stablecoin will be issued on the ADI blockchain , a homegrown technology. The goal is to make payments safe and easy for people, businesses, and organizations, both in the UAE and worldwide. Today, IHC, alongside @Adq_Official and First Abu Dhabi Bank @FABConnects , announced plans to launch a new Dirham-backed stablecoin, which will be fully regulated by the Central Bank of the UAE and issued by FAB. The new #stablecoin will transform payments and business… pic.twitter.com/gWnVjX0LoC — IHC (@ihc__official) April 28, 2025 This stablecoin will help with everyday payments and more complex digital transactions. Since it’s backed by the local currency and follows the Central Bank’s rules, it will be safe and legal. First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) will issue the coin once it gets approval from the Central Bank of the UAE. This partnership combines strong financial support, new technology, and official regulation. UAE Going Beyond Payments This stablecoin isn’t just for simple transactions. It’s also made for the future, supporting payments between machines and AI-powered transactions. The goal is to create a digital currency that works in new areas like smart finance and the Internet of Things (IoT), helping the UAE stay ahead in these fast-growing fields. Pushing UAE’s Fintech Vision This step is part of the UAE’s larger goal to be a leader in digital finance. Last year, the country introduced its first official stablecoin, AE Coin. Recently, a local company, MGX, invested $2 billion in Binance , proving how committed the region is to crypto and blockchain. Syed Basar Shueb, CEO of IHC, said the new stablecoin is an important step for digital finance. He is proud that IHC is using its blockchain skills in the project and that the partnership shows the UAE’s focus on leading digital currencies. Even Mohamed Hassan Alsuwaidi, CEO of ADQ, believes this project will make the UAE’s digital systems stronger. Countries Consider Stablecoins Not Backed by USD As the UAE moves forward with its stablecoin, other countries like Russia are also exploring their own. Russia is considering a stablecoin backed by its currency after facing US sanctions. Many countries are looking into stablecoins tied to their currencies or central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). However, a report from Citigroup suggests , US dollar-backed stablecoins still lead the market, with Tether holding 90% of the $230 billion market, a 54% increase from last year.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-29 07:53:43

Continue Capital , a prominent blockchain technology investor and a major participant in the Uniswap ecosystem, has executed a substantial transfer involving the UNI token . According to observations shared by on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X, Continue Capital moved a considerable amount of UNI tokens to Unichain . This transaction highlights the ongoing strategic activities of large holders within the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. What Was the UNI Token Transaction? The core of the recent activity involves the movement of 1.5 million UNI tokens. At the time of the transfer, this volume of UNI was valued at approximately $8.12 million. The destination for these tokens was the Unichain platform. This type of large-scale movement by a significant entity like Continue Capital is often watched closely by market participants seeking clues about potential shifts in strategy or platform utilization. Why is Continue Capital’s Move to Unichain Significant? Understanding the context of Continue Capital’s position in the market helps illuminate the importance of this transaction. Continue Capital is known as a major player, particularly within the Uniswap ecosystem. Their address holds a substantial portfolio, valued at roughly $942 million in various digital assets. Their involvement with Uniswap is deep, with a significant portion of their holdings actively deployed: Around $162 million is currently deployed as liquidity within Uniswap V4, demonstrating their commitment to the core decentralized exchange protocol. Another $119 million is specifically allocated to liquidity incentive programs operating on Unichain . The recent transfer of 1.5 million UNI tokens to Unichain likely relates to these ongoing liquidity incentive programs or other strategic positioning within the Unichain ecosystem. It underscores the investor’s active management of their substantial UNI holdings and their engagement with platforms complementary to Uniswap. The Role of On-Chain Data This event was brought to light through On-chain data analysis. On-chain analysts monitor public blockchain ledgers to track the movement of assets between addresses. This transparency allows for insights into the activities of large holders, often referred to as ‘whales’. Tracking these movements can provide valuable information, such as: Identifying potential shifts in investment strategy. Observing participation in specific protocols or programs (like Unichain liquidity incentives). Gauging sentiment or conviction based on accumulation or distribution patterns. The work of analysts like @ai_9684xtpa is crucial for the community to stay informed about the flow of significant capital within the decentralized finance space. What Can We Learn from This? The transfer by Continue Capital serves as a reminder of the dynamic nature of large-scale crypto investments. Major holders are constantly optimizing their positions, seeking yield, participating in governance, or providing liquidity across various platforms like Uniswap and Unichain. For those interested in the UNI token or the Uniswap/Unichain ecosystems, observing the actions of entities like Continue Capital can offer insights into areas of focus or potential growth within these protocols. While the exact strategic reasoning behind this specific $8.12 million move is not fully detailed in the initial report, its destination on Unichain suggests a continued commitment to activities on that platform, potentially related to the incentive programs where they already have significant capital deployed. Conclusion: Tracking the Whales Continue Capital’s movement of $8.12 million in UNI token s to Unichain is a notable transaction that highlights the ongoing strategic positioning of major investors in the DeFi space. As a significant participant in Uniswap and a holder of substantial assets, their activities are closely watched. This transfer, revealed by on-chain data , likely reinforces their involvement with Unichain’s liquidity programs, demonstrating active management of their vast holdings. Keeping an eye on such large movements provides valuable context for understanding trends and capital flows within the decentralized finance ecosystem.

Musk attributed the figures to his AI firm’s model Grok, which placed China’s GDP in 2025 reaching $35.29 trillion. This is compared to $28.78 trillion for the United States and $21.99 trillion for the EU. In a post on April 29, Musk talked about the numbers and said, “This comes as a surprise to most people.” The numbers he gave suggest that China’s economy is about 1.23 times bigger than the US economy and 1.6 times bigger than the EU economy, based on PPP figures. This comes as a surprise to most people https://t.co/0UXAuA6BE4 — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 29, 2025 World Economics also published projections that were in line with Musk’s claim. It estimates China’s 2025 GDP to be $43.2 trillion, up from $41.3 trillion in 2024 and 26% higher than the World Bank’s official figures. China’s economic state stronger than US in 2025 The National Bureau of Statistics, which assessed China’s GDP on April 16, announced that it reached 31.88 trillion yuan, or approximately $4.4 trillion, a 5.4% increase year over year in real terms. Yup. China has a huge population, an education system that focuses on science & engineering, and little red tape when it comes to mega projects. The US will fall further behind if nothing is done. Complicancy is the enemy. — Sam Kampner (@KampnerSam) April 29, 2025 Total retail sales of consumer goods in the first quarter stood at 12.5 trillion yuan ($1.7 trillion), a 4.6% increase compared to the same period in 2024. Growth in March reached 7.7%, the highest since December 2023. Online retail sales climbed upwards of 7.9% to 3.6 trillion yuan ($493.2 billion) in the same period. Total trade volume reached 10.3 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) in the first quarter, up 1.3% year-on-year. Exports rose 6.9% to 6.1 trillion yuan ($834.4 billion), but imports fell by 6% to 4.2 trillion yuan ($567.5 billion), against the backdrop of weak domestic demand. Total trade reached 3.8 trillion yuan ($512.5 billion). US economy slows down on tariffs account On the other side, the United States appears to be heading into a slower growth phase in early 2025. Still, the US Treasury Department has stated that official GDP data for the first quarter will not be released until after this week’s meeting of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee (TBAC) on April 29. According to a Wall Street Journal survey conducted in mid-April, the median forecast for US GDP growth in Q1 stands at just 0.4% on an annualized basis. This marks a notable decline from the 2.4% pace recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024. Survey responses varied, with some economists projecting as little as 0.1% growth, and others on the higher side. The forecasts came before President Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on new reciprocal tariffs on April 9, and will likely be revised on the lower side. On Wednesday, April 30, the Bureau of Economic Analysis will give its first estimate of growth for the first quarter. Analysts think the top number will be low, and many institutions think the number will either stay the same or go down. Goldman Sachs thinks it will go down by 0.2%, while Bank of America thinks it will go up by 0.4%. Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, offered one of the most pessimistic estimates, suggesting GDP may have shrunk by 1.4% in the first quarter. He resonated his predictions to weaker consumer spending and delayed business investment. “There’s a high likelihood of a contraction in the first quarter,” Adams reckoned.

US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Record $591 Million Net Inflows as BTC Holds Above $94,000 BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the largest spot bitcoin ETF by net assets, was the only fund to record net inflows among its peers, with a massive inflow of $970.9 million, according to SoSoValue data. Other major ETFs including Ark and 21Shares’ ARKB, Fidelity’s FBTC, Grayscale’s GBTC, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL all saw net outflows. Specifically, ARKB saw $226.3 million in outflows, while FBTC saw $86.9 million in outflows from the fund. Despite the heavy inflows into IBIT, total trading volume across 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs fell from $3.3 billion on Friday to $2.4 billion on Monday. However, cumulative net inflows into these ETFs now stand at $39.02 billion. Bitcoin itself remained resilient amid the ETF activity, trading at $94,659 after briefly breaking above $95,000 early Monday, according to price data from The Block, up 0.2% over the past 24 hours. The sustained momentum follows last week’s impressive $3 billion in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, the highest weekly since November 2024, underscoring strong investor appetite for Bitcoin exposure via regulated products. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs also posted positive figures, attracting $64.1 million in net inflows and marking the third consecutive day of gains. The consistent inflows underscore growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies even amid broader market uncertainty and tightening monetary conditions. *This is not investment advice.

Tech giants are scaling back data center plans as execs quietly delay projects and cut power commitments amid trade war uncertainty. While semiconductor stocks suffer, three crypto projects are sidestepping the AI hardware crisis and building software-first solutions immune to supply chain chaos. NVIDIA's epic fall continues to signal a retreat for the wider tech market. The AI chip leader—briefly the world's most valuable company last year—has watched its stock plummet some 20% in 2025 as tariff threats and Chinese competition hammer its once-untouchable business model. This collapse has dragged down the entire ""Magnificent Seven,"" wiping out an insane $5 trillion in market value since their peak. It seems like the challenges are only piling on for NVIDIA. According to the Wall Street Journal , China's Huawei is about to test its Ascend 910D chip, aimed squarely at dethroning NVIDIA's H100 processor. With sample batches expected by late May, NVIDIA's hardware dominance faces its most serious challenge yet—sending shares down in Monday's pre-market trading. However, the main problem for AI-driven tech stocks right now is more fundamental as President Trump’s tariffs continue to spook the market. This primarily comes down to the fragile, global supply chains that fuel the AI economy. As Pat Lynch from commercial real estate firm CBRE told Reuters , ""Much of the electrical infrastructure and data center equipment is manufactured outside of the U.S.” “In many cases this equipment is in short supply and demand is high globally. Tariffs will likely make this more challenging, especially if foreign suppliers divert this equipment to other markets."" AI infrastructure plans hit the brakes Major cloud providers, such as AWS, have grown far more cautious in leasing large clusters of power, according to Wells Fargo analysts last week —a momentous change compared to the bullish ‘all-in’ behavior we’ve witnessed over the last couple of years. Pullbacks in infrastructure investment across the tech ecosystem directly impact NVIDIA, whose expensive AI accelerators power these data centers. Some analysts highlighted that the Magnificent Seven’s valuations had been ‘defying gravity’ for too long—it was only a matter of time before they came plunging back to something more realistic. 🚨 Investing Lesson Alert! 🚨""Buying the dip"" works… until it doesn’t. The Magnificent 7’s crash to $15.1T shows:➡️ Valuations matter: Nvidia’s peak 70x P/E couldn’t defy gravity forever.➡️ Dip-buying ≠ free money: Bull markets and bubbles magnify the reward & hide the… pic.twitter.com/C1XKa2bwDY — Ben Woodward, CFA (@BennettWoodman) April 26, 2025 However, not everyone thinks the AI market’s downward spiral will last. Eric Schiffer, CEO of Patriarch Organization, thinks investors are overreacting : ""The market has massively discounted the near-term spending for AI and it is wrong. The large tech players cannot afford to lose the AI race."" Even so, it’s looking rocky for tech stocks right now, and the smart money is heading elsewhere. As supply chains and tariff concerns continue to paint a volatile picture, certain crypto projects offer exposure to AI's potential without the same vulnerabilities. Here are three projects positioned as the best crypto to buy amid today's uncertainties: Bitcoin Pepe: Unleashing Bitcoin's untapped potential Bitcoin Pepe is doing what many thought impossible—bringing meme trading to Bitcoin's ecosystem. For years, Bitcoin's slower transaction speeds have forced traders to newer chains for quick moves, leaving a $2 trillion market largely untapped for viral assets. The project's PEP-20 token standard is the secret sauce here, creating what users are calling ""Solana on Bitcoin""—high-speed transactions on crypto's most trusted foundation. This could finally bridge the generation gap between Bitcoin purists and the new generations of traders who demand instant settlement. Early backers have poured $7.2m into the presale, sensing the massive opportunity that opens when you connect Bitcoin's security with the explosive growth of meme markets. At just $0.031 in stage 9, BPEP could become the gateway that finally brings Bitcoin's massive liquidity into the fast-moving meme economy. CartelFi: The meme coin money printer CartelFi is solving the ultimate meme coin paradox: how to earn passive income without selling your moonshot tokens. Until now, investors faced an impossible choice—hold for massive gains or sell for yield. CartelFi eliminates this dilemma entirely. Instead of just watching your favorite viral tokens sit still, the platform puts them to work earning impressive yields without sacrificing any potential gains. When prices surge, you'll profit twice—once from the market movement and again from the accumulated returns that kept building even while you waited. Over $1,150,000 raised.And the price is about to go up.Lock in, this is your last chance.I won't tell you again.Buy $CARTFI | https://t.co/wFuio1bJVX pic.twitter.com/li4jHuwOfn — CartelFi (@CartelFi_) April 28, 2025 What makes this truly game-changing is the token's deflationary mechanism. Up to 50% of all platform revenue goes toward buying and burning CARTFI, creating constant upward pressure as usage grows. Currently at $0.0389, early investors are positioning themselves in what could become the default yield platform for the entire meme ecosystem. PepeX: The fundraising revolution PepeX is tearing down the walls between great ideas and capital. While traditional fundraising remains locked behind venture capital firms and their exclusive networks, PepeX brings the vision of truly permissionless project creation to life. The platform's one-click deployment system lets anyone tokenize a concept within minutes, while the integrated AKIRA AI Growth Engine handles marketing and community building automatically. This means founders can focus on building rather than constant promotion. Most importantly, PepeX's revolutionary 5/95 token model prevents the infamous founder dumps that plague crypto, capping creator allocations at just 5% while reserving 95% for the community. Having raised $1.6m already and priced at just $0.0243, PEPX represents early access to what could become the default launchpad for crypto's next generation of breakout projects. Where smart money is moving as NVIDIA struggles NVIDIA's dramatic fall from grace has exposed serious weaknesses in the hardware-dependent AI narrative that dominated markets in 2024. While physical chips remain vulnerable to tariffs and supply chain disruptions, crypto projects that build software solutions continue to advance. Bitcoin Pepe , CartelFi, and PepeX are three brilliant examples of projects that leverage existing blockchain infrastructure without depending on semiconductor supply chains. For investors hunting for the best crypto to buy while avoiding the carnage in traditional AI stocks, these projects are building digital-first solutions that remain insulated from the trade tensions threatening NVIDIA's once-unstoppable rise.

What you need to know,https://cointelegraph.com/explained/is-the-paws-telegram-mini-app-legit-what-you-need-to-know?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"What is the Paws Telegram Mini App? Paws is a Telegram-based Mini App created by the same team behind other projects, such as Notcoin and Dogs. If you’ve been cruising around Telegram lately, chances are you’ve stumbled upon Paws, the viral crypto Mini App that’s got everyone tapping, clicking and inviting their friends like it’s 2010 FarmVille all over again. Originally launched in October 2024 on The Open Network (TON) blockchain , Paws exploded in popularity with its ultra-simple tap-to-earn concept. Think of it as a gamified rewards engine embedded directly in Telegram, where users rack up points by completing tasks, referring others and interacting with mini-game elements. Within just eight days of going live, Paws pulled in over 20 million users, and within a few months, that figure soared past 80 million. But the real twist? Paws, in March 2025, migrated from TON to Solana, a move that brought more scalability, lower fees and deeper integration with a broader decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Alongside this shift came the launch of the PAWS token — used for governance, staking, in-game purchases and more — positioning Paws as more than just a viral hit. The app’s core philosophy is simple: You create value every time you engage online, so why not earn for it? With no extra downloads needed, Paws is frictionless. You just activate the bot on Telegram (@PAWSOG_bot), and you’re in. From there, it’s all about interacting: tap items, read posts, join groups, complete quizzes, and get rewarded with points that convert into real tokens. So, is it legit? Before answering that, we’ll unpack how it actually works. How does the Paws Telegram Mini App actually work? Paws has a simplified interactive interface that allows users to earn points and stay involved in its gamified engagement economy. Once you launch the Mini App via its official Telegram bot, you’re welcomed into a digital world that rewards you for social activity. You’re not mining crypto, solving puzzles or trading tokens — you’re completing micro-tasks like tapping virtual objects, joining Telegram channels, referring friends or answering simple quizzes. Every action earns you points, which are later converted into PAWS tokens. These tokens can then be staked, used in Paws’ upcoming in-app economy, or possibly traded depending on future listings. The simplicity is what makes it addictive, and the referral model makes it viral. And here’s the kicker: You don’t even need a separate wallet app. The Paws Mini App syncs with existing wallets like Phantom on Solana or Telegram-native wallets (TON-based). It’s designed for ease, especially for people new to crypto. Why Paws migrated to Solana and why it matters At first, Paws ran on TON, but in a move that surprised some and excited others, Paws announced a major shift to Solana in early 2025. In early 2025, Telegram introduced a policy mandating that all Mini Apps and third-party crypto wallets on its platform exclusively operate on TON. This move forced projects like Paws to choose between remaining confined to TON or migrating to a different blockchain. Paws opted to migrate to Solana , a decision that has had significant implications:​ User base migration: Over 80 million Paws users transitioned to Solana, leading to more than 9 million downloads of the Phantom crypto wallet and the creation of over 1 million new Solana addresses. NFT integration: PAWS introduced non-fungible token (NFT) vouchers on the Solana-based marketplace Magic Eden, resulting in over 100,000 transactions within two weeks. Ecosystem expansion: The migration has allowed Paws to evolve from a viral Telegram application into a full-fledged Web3 brand, with plans to integrate DeFi features, gaming partnerships and social engagement tools. This strategic move not only circumvented Telegram’s restrictive policies but also positioned Paws to leverage Solana’s scalability and active DeFi ecosystem, paving the way for broader adoption and innovation. Did you know? The migration to Solana led to over 9 million new downloads of Phantom Wallet, with more than 1 million fresh Solana addresses created by Paws users. That’s one of the biggest onboarding waves in Solana’s history. Is Paws legit or just another hype train? Paws has demonstrated substantial growth and user engagement; however, users must do their own research before joining in. Let’s get to the big question: Is Paws legit? Paws has demonstrated substantial growth and user engagement. The following help to make a better assessment on how to approach Paws:​ Pros: Developed by a team with a track record (Notcoin and Dogs). Successful migration to Solana indicates long-term planning and future orientation. Rapid user adoption and community growth.​ Cons: Limited transparency with no public team page or comprehensive white paper . Potential for bot-driven airdrop farming, as has been seen on Telegram Mini Apps. The project is navigating regulatory uncertainty, particularly as airdrops via Telegram Mini Apps remain in a legal gray area, often lacking clear Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. So, what’s the verdict? While Paws appears to be a well-used platform for casual engagement, users should conduct thorough research and exercise caution, especially when considering financial investments. What’s next for Paws? As the platform matures and cements its place, the team behind it has hinted at a much bigger vision: one that turns Paws from a simple viral game into a dynamic Web3 super app. Here’s what’s reportedly on the roadmap: In-app marketplace: Users will soon be able to spend their PAWS tokens within an integrated marketplace. This could include digital goods, services and utility items tied to the app’s gaming ecosystem, such as power-ups, skins or access to exclusive features. NFT rewards and avatar customization: Paws plans to introduce customizable avatars powered by NFTs. These will not only let users personalize their experience but also function as tradable digital assets. The team has already launched early NFT vouchers on Solana’s Magic Eden, showing a clear direction toward gamified asset ownership. Social leaderboards and guild mechanics: Paws is building out more community-first features. Competitive social leaderboards will reward the most active players, while upcoming guild mechanics will allow users to team up, compete and share rewards, blending social gaming with decentralized coordination. DeFi integrations: With its migration to Solana, PAWS has opened the door to deeper DeFi utility. Upcoming features could include staking, lending pools, yield-based games or partnerships with native Solana DeFi protocols, adding more financial layers to the Paws economy. With a user base now exceeding 80 million and growing, Paws is laying the groundwork to evolve into a full-blown Web3 social and gaming hub — though its rapid rise also warrants caution, as regulatory clarity and long-term sustainability remain key concerns. The PAWS airdrop: What you need to know No viral Web3 game is complete without an airdrop, and Paws is no exception. Users who engage with the app, tapping, referring and completing tasks earn points, which are later converted into PAWS tokens. These tokens are distributed via an airdrop, and the team has already completed early reward rounds with plans for future drops as the ecosystem expands. The PAWS token officially launched on March 18, 2025. Here’s a breakdown of the key events that took place:​ March 11-15: Withdrawals opened to exchanges. March 17: Token deposits became available on exchanges. March 18: Withdrawals to Phantom Wallet and the official PAWS listing commenced.​ The airdrop distribution was as follows:​ 62.5% allocated to Paws app users. 7.5% reserved for established Solana communities. The remaining percentage is designated for ecosystem growth, partnerships and liquidity. Despite the successful migration and platform enhancements, the PAWS token launch faced some challenges:​ Price volatility: The token experienced a significant drop in value shortly after launch. Airdrop confusion: Many users were unsure about eligibility criteria, leading to dissatisfaction. Communication gaps: Delays and a lack of clear communication regarding the token generation event (TGE) affected community trust on X. As of April 2025, the PAWS token is listed on a few exchanges, including Bybit , MEXC and KuCoin . There’s growing speculation that listings on more centralized exchanges (CEXs) may follow, especially given the size of the community and early engagement. Did you know? After migrating to Solana, Paws launched NFT vouchers on Magic Eden. In just two weeks, these NFTs generated over 100,000 transactions.",Paws|Telegram|App,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MINING|SOL|TON|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-29 08:10:00
43937143,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153630,1745914259,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Asia FX Surges as US Dollar Weakens Amid Tariff Fears,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/asia-fx-dollar-forex/,"For those tracking global financial shifts, especially cryptocurrency enthusiasts who watch macro trends for potential market impact, the recent movement in currency markets offers a compelling narrative. We’re seeing a notable trend: Asian currencies are strengthening against a softening US Dollar . This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a significant development driven by several factors, particularly the lingering specter of tariff uncertainty . Understanding the Shift in Asia FX What exactly is happening with Asia FX ? Currencies across the Asian region, from the Japanese Yen to the South Korean Won and others, have been appreciating. This collective gain signals a broader shift in investor sentiment and capital flows. Historically, a strong US Dollar often put pressure on emerging market currencies, including those in Asia. The current scenario reverses that trend, presenting new dynamics for global trade and investment. Several factors contribute to this strength: Weakening US Dollar: The primary driver is the US Dollar’s retreat from its recent highs. Improved Risk Sentiment: A perceived reduction in immediate global economic risks can encourage investment in non-dollar assets. Local Economic Recovery Hopes: Prospects for economic recovery in various Asian nations provide underlying support for their currencies. Why is the US Dollar Wallowing? The other side of the coin is the US Dollar ‘s current weakness. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, has been trading near multi-year lows. This decline isn’t arbitrary; it’s linked to several economic and political undercurrents in the United States. Key reasons for the dollar’s slump include: Monetary Policy Expectations: Expectations of lower interest rates or continued quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve can reduce the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Fiscal Stimulus Measures: Large government spending packages can sometimes dilute currency value over time. Global Economic Recovery: As other economies recover, the relative strength of the US economy might diminish, impacting the dollar. Trade Policy Uncertainty: This is where tariff uncertainty plays a significant role. How Does Tariff Uncertainty Impact Forex? Tariff uncertainty refers to the lack of clarity or ongoing changes regarding import and export duties between major trading nations, particularly between the US and its key partners, many of whom are in Asia. This uncertainty creates ripples across global financial markets, and the Forex market is particularly sensitive. Here’s how tariff uncertainty affects currencies: Trade Flows: Tariffs alter the cost of goods, impacting import and export volumes. Changes in trade balances directly influence demand for currencies. For example, if a country exports more, demand for its currency increases. Investor Confidence: Uncertainty makes businesses and investors hesitant. This can lead to reduced foreign direct investment and portfolio investment, impacting capital flows and currency values. Economic Growth Outlook: Prolonged trade disputes can dampen economic growth prospects for involved nations, influencing central bank policies and currency strength. Safe-Haven Demand: In times of high uncertainty, investors often seek safe-haven assets. While the dollar traditionally served this role, persistent uncertainty originating from US policy can paradoxically weaken its safe-haven appeal compared to other assets or currencies. The current environment, marked by ongoing trade discussions and potential policy shifts, keeps investors cautious regarding the US economic outlook relative to other regions, benefiting currencies like those in Asia FX . What Does This Mean for Currency Markets and Investors? The dynamics in currency markets driven by the weak US Dollar and strengthening Asia FX have practical implications: For Asian Exporters: A stronger local currency makes their goods more expensive abroad, potentially impacting competitiveness. For Asian Importers: A stronger local currency makes imported goods cheaper, which can help control inflation. For US Businesses: A weaker dollar makes US exports cheaper and imports more expensive. For Forex Traders: This creates trading opportunities based on the expected direction of various currency pairs (e.g., USD/JPY, USD/KRW, etc.). For Global Investors: It influences the returns on foreign investments when converted back to their home currency. Navigating this landscape requires careful analysis of economic data, central bank communications, and geopolitical developments, especially those related to trade policy and tariff uncertainty . Actionable Insights for the Current Forex Environment Given the current trends in Forex , what should market participants consider? Monitor Trade Negotiations: Keep a close eye on any developments regarding trade talks between the US and Asian nations. Positive or negative news can quickly shift currency sentiment. Analyze Economic Indicators: Pay attention to GDP growth, inflation, and employment data from both the US and key Asian economies. These provide clues about central bank intentions. Understand Carry Trade Dynamics: With potential interest rate differentials shifting, carry trade strategies (borrowing in a low-interest currency to invest in a high-interest one) might become more or less attractive, influencing capital flows into Asia FX . Risk Management: Volatility can increase when markets are driven by political factors like tariff uncertainty . Employ robust risk management strategies if trading currencies. The interplay between macroeconomics, monetary policy, and trade politics makes the current currency markets fascinating but complex. Summary: A Shifting Currency Landscape In conclusion, the narrative of Asia FX gaining ground while the US Dollar weakens is a significant development in global currency markets . This shift is heavily influenced by factors like monetary policy expectations and, crucially, lingering tariff uncertainty . For anyone involved in international trade, investment, or Forex trading, understanding these dynamics is key. The environment remains fluid, and staying informed on economic data and trade policy news will be essential for navigating the opportunities and challenges presented by this evolving landscape.

With new partnerships with OKX and Nuvei, stablecoins will soon work just like regular money, creating a seamless experience for everyone. In a press release on Monday, the company notes that its new partnerships will create a complete system where consumers can spend stablecoins and merchants can accept them. Mastercard Partners with OKX, MetaMask, and Others Through partnerships with platforms like MetaMask, Kraken, and OKX, consumers can earn rewards, pay, and spend stablecoins at over 150 million merchants worldwide using traditional cards. Mastercard is collaborating with OKX to launch the OKX Card, offering seamless access to funds. It has teamed up with Nuvei and Circle to enable stablecoin payments like Circle’s USDC, ensuring smooth transactions regardless of how a consumer chooses to pay. It also works closely with Paxos to enable this functionality across Paxos-issued stablecoins. Trusted Usernames and Real-Time Transactions Mastercard said that while stablecoins are fast and cost-effective, current user experiences lack verification and transparency. Their Crypto Credential solves this by allowing users to send and receive digital assets with trusted usernames. Partners like Wirex, Bit2Me, and Mercado Bitcoin are already part of the Mastercard Crypto Credential ecosystem. Furthermore, Mastercard’s Multi-Token Network (MTN) enables real-time payments across markets and currencies. Partners like Ondo Finance use tokenized assets, while banks like JPMorgan Chase and Standard Chartered are already connected to MTN, unlocking new digital asset opportunities. “ When it comes to blockchain and digital assets, the benefits for mainstream use cases are clear , ” said Jorn Lambert, chief product officer at Mastercard. “To realize its potential, we need to make it as easy for merchants to receive stablecoin payments and for consumers to use them, ” he added.

Solana has experienced whale accumulation despite remaining trapped within the volatile $100-$150 price range where it currently trades at $139.72. Meanwhile Mutuum Finance (MUTM) moves forward strongly during its phase 4 presale as investors have accumulated 425 million tokens and raised $7.2 million at $0.025. The combination of a DeFi lending model and buyback system attracts investors to this project while Cardano and Solana experience unstable market conditions. The market change indicates investors increasingly search for newer investment potential. Cardano’s Flickering Rally Although Cardano maintains bullish momentum in the market it faces early warning signals. Whale wallets holding between 1 and 10 million ADA have caused the price to move between $0.668-$0.709 as they increased from 2,405 to 2,408 in number. The small increases suggest that investors feel optimistic about the situation. The Average Directional Index (ADX) at 30.17 indicates a cooling downtrend after falling from its previous level at 32.76. ADA’s price movement may drive it to $0.77 in case of an upside breakout yet a drop beneath $0.668 could trigger a market drift to $0.59. The market scrutiny on Cardano intensifies as investors monitor decreasing trading volume and market stability which causes some traders to explore other options. Solana’s Whale-Driven Tease The Solana price shows signs of a potential breakout because whales continue to hold more than 10,000 SOL within addresses that have reached 5,019 while starting from 4,943 addresses. The price, up 4% weekly to $139.72, rides above the 50-day moving average, signaling short-term strength. Solana continues to trade within the price range of $100-$150 while its price fluctuations reflect general market crypto volatility. Financial experts predict the price of Solana will increase to between $160 and $180 in May. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Phase 4 presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) drives intense investor passion because it trades at $0.025. The project has earned $7.2 million after 9,100 holders purchased 425 million tokens. Phase 5 of the presale will launch at $0.03 after the current price of $0.025 while delivering a 20% profit boost to existing buyers. The tokenomics structure at token listing shows an estimated 140% increase to reach $0.06 price which analysts project will turn into $3 upon launch resulting in a 11,900% market change. A new system pays additional tokens to the 50 most dedicated holders in order to create strengthened loyalty. Certik is currently auditing smart contracts while the team expects to share updates through their social media platforms. Mutuum’s DeFi Edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes itself in the market by combining peer-to-contract and peer-to-peer lending structures. Users can use mtTokens to generate profits from deposited assets and borrowers require assets with excess value to obtain loans through Mutuum Finance. MUTM channels its platform income through a purchasing-distributing system to repurchase tokens that benefit stakeholders and boost currency value. The lending system provides investors with the stability which absent in both Solana and Cardano’s market volatility. The upcoming $0.03 token price rise has investors hurrying to purchase Mutuum tokens due to their practical benefits as well as their potential for development. Rival Outshines Stagnant Giants Both Cardano and Solana maintain unpredictable market movements which connect their price performance to unpredictability in technical adjustments and financial market volatilities. Mutuum Finance has gained traction through its successful presale campaign alongside its DeFi innovation in the market. The entry price of $0.025 continues to become scarce while investors have an opportunity to buy ahead of expected future prices which could reach $3 from an initial listing gain of 140%.

Haedal, a prominent liquid staking protocol built specifically for Sui, has just pulled back the curtain on a crucial aspect of its ecosystem: the Haedal tokenomics for its native asset, HAEDAL. This announcement, shared via their official Medium blog, provides essential details for anyone interested in participating in the Haedal protocol or the broader Sui ecosystem. What Exactly is the HAEDAL Token? At its core, the HAEDAL token is designed to be the lifeblood of the Haedal protocol. While the initial announcement focuses on the supply and distribution, native tokens in such protocols often serve multiple purposes, potentially including: Governance: Allowing token holders to vote on key protocol decisions, upgrades, and parameters. Utility: Potentially used within the protocol for specific functions or accessing features. Value Accrual: Mechanisms where protocol revenue or value is directed back to token holders. Understanding the Haedal tokenomics is key to grasping the potential role and value flow within this growing Liquid staking platform on Sui. Diving Into the Haedal Tokenomics: Supply and Circulation The announcement clearly outlines the foundational numbers for the HAEDAL token: Total Supply: The maximum number of HAEDAL tokens that will ever exist is capped at 1 billion . This fixed supply is a common feature in many crypto assets, providing scarcity. Initial Circulation: A significant detail for market participants is the initial circulating supply. At launch, only 19.5% of the total supply will be in circulation. This means approximately 195 million HAEDAL tokens will be available initially. The initial circulation percentage is a key factor influencing early market dynamics and price discovery for any Crypto token launch . This structure suggests a controlled release, with the majority of tokens becoming available over time, likely through vesting schedules and ecosystem incentives. How Are the 1 Billion HAEDAL Tokens Allocated? The distribution plan reveals how Haedal intends to utilize its native token to foster growth, reward participants, and ensure the long-term health of the protocol. Here’s a breakdown of the allocation: Let’s look at the numbers: Allocation Category Percentage of Total Supply Approximate Token Amount Ecosystem Incentives 55% 550,000,000 HAEDAL Liquidity Fund 10% 100,000,000 HAEDAL Investors 15% 150,000,000 HAEDAL Team and Advisors 20% 200,000,000 HAEDAL This allocation strategy provides insights into Haedal’s priorities: Ecosystem Incentives (55%): This is the largest slice, emphasizing the protocol’s focus on growth, user adoption, and rewarding participation in Liquid staking and other protocol activities on the Sui network . This could include staking rewards, yield farming incentives, or grants for developers building on Haedal. Team and Advisors (20%): A standard allocation for core contributors. These tokens are typically subject to vesting schedules, aligning the team’s long-term success with that of the protocol and token holders. Investors (15%): Allocated to early backers who provided funding. Like the team allocation, these tokens are usually subject to vesting to prevent immediate large sell-offs after the Crypto token launch . Liquidity Fund (10%): Essential for ensuring healthy trading markets for the HAEDAL token on exchanges. This fund helps provide liquidity, potentially supporting price stability and accessibility for users. Understanding these allocations is crucial for anyone analyzing the long-term prospects based on the Haedal tokenomics . When Can You Claim Your HAEDAL Tokens? For those who are eligible for a token claim (details of eligibility were not in the provided snippet, but often relate to early users, stakers, or community members), the announcement included a specific time: Claim Availability: HAEDAL token claims will commence from 12:00 UTC today . This provides a clear actionable insight for eligible participants, marking a significant milestone for the HAEDAL token launch . What Are the Potential Benefits and Considerations? Based on the revealed Haedal tokenomics and the nature of liquid staking protocols on the Sui network , here are some points to consider: Potential Benefits: Participation in Governance: If HAEDAL includes governance rights, holders can influence the future direction of a key Liquid staking protocol on Sui. Earning Potential: The large ecosystem allocation suggests potential opportunities to earn HAEDAL through staking, providing liquidity, or other protocol interactions. Growth of Sui Ecosystem: A successful Haedal protocol and HAEDAL token can contribute positively to the overall growth and activity on the Sui network . Considerations: Vesting Schedules: While not detailed in the snippet, the vesting periods for team and investor tokens will impact future supply and potential selling pressure. Market Volatility: Like all cryptocurrencies, the HAEDAL token will be subject to market fluctuations, especially around the initial Crypto token launch . Protocol Adoption: The long-term value will heavily depend on the successful adoption and usage of the Haedal liquid staking protocol itself. Summary: A New Chapter for Haedal and Sui Liquid Staking The unveiling of Haedal tokenomics marks a pivotal moment for the protocol and its community. With a clear structure for the 1 billion HAEDAL tokens, including significant allocations for ecosystem growth and a defined initial circulating supply of 19.5%, Haedal is setting the stage for its native token’s role within its Liquid staking operations on the Sui network . The upcoming token claim availability at 12:00 UTC today is an important next step, allowing eligible users to acquire their HAEDAL tokens. As the protocol develops and the token circulates, the focus will be on how these tokenomics drive participation, contribute to the Sui ecosystem, and fulfill the promise of the HAEDAL token .

Officials in Brussels, Berlin, and beyond are trying to handle the chaos that’s come from the White House since January. The mess includes rising tensions over trade and growing confusion around the US role in Ukraine. Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, told CNBC on Tuesday that it’s been “very intense” and “disruptive.” Speaking on “Europe Early Edition,” she said, “It’s unlike anything else we’ve seen before from the US administration.” She described dealing with Trump’s team as full of “unpredictability.” In her words: “This is how we have been operating to try to manage with the new administration.” Trump’s trade moves slam Europe with tariffs and confusion The EU is now stuck in limbo over Trump’s trade rules. Right after he got back in office, he threw a 20% duty on all EU exports to the US Then he suddenly pulled it back, calling for talks instead. European officials had their own tariffs ready to strike back, but those plans got shelved when Trump paused his own. Despite that pause, Europe is still getting slammed with tariffs on aluminum, steel, and cars. Nothing’s settled. Even if both sides manage to cut a deal, the EU still expects to get hit with the ripple effects from Trump’s fight with China and other trade partners. At the IMF World Bank Spring Meetings, European Central Bank officials didn’t hide their frustration. They said the trade mess could hit the region’s economic growth, and no one’s really sure how it might affect inflation. Everyone kept using the same word: uncertainty. Robert Holzmann, the head of Austria’s central bank, told CNBC, “We have not seen this uncertainty now for years.” He said until things calm down, major decisions are on hold. “Unless the uncertainty subsides, by the right decisions, we will have to hold back a number of our decisions, and hence, we don’t know yet in what direction monetary policy should be best moved.” Klaas Knot, who runs The Netherlands Bank, said it reminded him of the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. He said, “In the short run, it’s crystal clear that the uncertainty that is created by the unpredictability of the tariff actions by the US government works as a strong negative factor for growth.” Not everyone sees a total breakdown coming. Joerg Kukies, the acting German finance minister, told CNBC he didn’t think the situation was “anywhere near a crisis moment.” He added that it would take much more for US-Europe trust to collapse, but it’s clear things are getting worse, not better. US stance on Ukraine leaves Europe exposed Europe’s second problem is Trump’s changing position on Ukraine. Leaders don’t know how much longer the US is going to back Ukraine’s defense against Russia. During his campaign, Trump said he’d end the war in a single day. He’s already walked that back. While talks about a possible ceasefire started early in his second term, there’s been no progress at all. Kallas said the EU has done more than anyone to support Kyiv. “We have supported Ukraine more than anybody else,” she said. She admitted the US has given “a great share” as well, but warned that if Washington pulls out now, things get much harder. “If they are not supporting Ukraine anymore then it’s becoming more difficult,” she said. Kallas said the EU might manage the financial side of Ukraine’s support alone. “I think in terms of the monetary means we can do this,” she told CNBC. But on military support, it’s a different story. “Of course the question regarding some military capabilities is much more difficult,” she said. She also made one thing clear: Europe expects the US to stay in the fight. “I hope the US remains on the right side of history,” Kallas said. By Monday, she added that more pressure had to be placed on Russia to even get close to peace talks. With Trump backing away from clear positions and the US refusing to fully commit to its previous stance, Brussels is being forced to rethink its own defense and diplomatic strategy.

Analyst Calls ETH ‘Digital Gold With Yield’,https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-to-17k-analyst-calls-eth-digital-gold-with-yield/,"Bankless co-founder and longtime Ethereum (ETH) advocate Ryan Sean Adams has ignited fresh discourse after projecting a $17,000 target for ETH, nearly 9 times its current price. His thesis is quite simple: the cryptocurrency can grow to a $2 trillion market cap by becoming the ultimate store of value, a fusion of monetary premium and staking-based income, or as he called it, “digital gold with yield.” Blue-Money Gospel The $17,000 price target gained traction earlier in the year when pseudonymous analyst Kiu_Coin argued that Ethereum was undergoing a classic “shakeout,” a brutal sell-off designed to flush out weak hands before a parabolic rally. The analyst drew parallels to ETH’s 2020 slump, which preceded a 1,310% surge in 2021, claiming history was repeating itself. In a recent post on X, Adams amplified the narrative, arguing that the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could potentially mirror Bitcoin’s $2 trillion valuation while offering staking rewards. However, he insists that Ethereum must adopt BTC’s playbook and follow what he calls the “ Blue-Money Gospel .” “Money is belief encoded as code,” he wrote, urging ETH holders to “stake, evangelize, and shame anyone who sells.” In the analyst’s words, “Without ETH, there is no DeFi. Without ETH, there are no cypherpunk values.” The gospel reframes ETH as more than just gas for decentralized applications. Adams argued that Ethereum, especially in its post-Merge and EIP-1559 form, is not merely programmable money but a commodity with a monetary premium backed by real yield and deflationary mechanics. Supporting this view is Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest, which in January likened ETH staking returns to yield-bearing U.S. Treasury bills, further reinforcing its “digital bond” depiction. Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian also echoed similar sentiments in a recent Bankless episode, suggesting that Ethereum’s biggest failure is not technical, but narrative-driven. According to him, ETH has unintentionally shifted to being valued like a discounted cash flow asset when it should be promoted as a store-of-value commodity. “Ethereum, the tech, is the most bullish thing in crypto,” Kazemian said. “But ETH, the asset, needs fixing.” Price Reality As expected, Adams’s bullish outlook has also drawn skepticism from BTC purists and ETH critics alike. Boyd Cohen dismissed the ETH-as-gold angle, stating, “Bitcoin is absolutely scarce and Ethereum is absolutely not.” Meanwhile, Swan Bitcoin’s John Haar challenged the very premise of ETH’s value proposition, asking, “Yield from users doing what? ETH isn’t money.” The ETH/BTC ratio has also become a focal point for critics who argue Ethereum is steadily losing ground as a monetary asset after the metric not long ago plunged 77% from its December 2021 peak. The cryptocurrency has staged a noteworthy recovery in recent days. Following a brutal Q1 and a plunge to $1,400 in April, ETH’s price has surged nearly 30% to trade at just under $1,800. However, broader metrics are still grim, with the asset down 44% year over year and 63% below its $4,878 peak. The post Ethereum to $17K?

Onchain data shows strong accumulation from new and momentum buyers with minimal profit-taking. Bitcoin could rally toward $110,000–$115,000 helped by a “max buying” zone. Bitcoin ( BTC ) is charging toward a potential new all-time high near $115,000, as a surge in profitable supply signals growing bullish momentum and a classic setup for market euphoria. Nearly 87% of Bitcoin supply in profit As of April 28, approximately 86.9% of all Bitcoin coins were in profit, according to on-chain data resource CryptoQuant . Historically, the metric’s climb into the 85–90% range has signaled a transition from healthy optimism to speculative euphoria among traders. Between October and December 2024, for instance, Bitcoin’s price climbed from around $80,000 to over $100,000, a rally coinciding with Bitcoin’s profitable supply rising from under 80% to as high as 99%. Bitcoin percent supply in profit. Source: CryptoQuant In his April 28 post, CryptoQuant-based analyst DarkFrost reminded that Bitcoin’s euphoric phases may not last for longer timeframes, leading to sharp corrections as holders begin realizing gains. BTC’s price established a record high of nearly $110,000 in January, with its profitable supply hitting 99%. But the cryptocurrency dropped by over 30% afterward. Similar profit-taking behaviors have led to price corrections in the past, as shown above. “Currently, the supply in profit has climbed back above 85%, which is fairly positive,” DarkFrost writes, noting that its recovery from the recent bottom of 75% is still better when compared to 45-50% lows witnessed during bear market corrections. Besides, the BTC supply in profit still remains below 90%. Crossing above 90% has historically preceded profit-taking behavior among traders, suggesting that there’s more room to grow for BTC prices in the coming days. DarkFrost argues: “Of course, there are certain levels that are more ""comfortable"" than others, but generally, an increase in the supply in profit tends to fuel bullish phases.” Additional onchain data also supports the bullish outlook. Bitcoin’s First Buyers and Momentum Buyers are actively accumulating, while Profit Takers remain relatively quiet, according to Glassnode metric tracking BTC’s cumulative supply per cohort. BTC relative strength index of cumulative supply per cohort. Source: Glassnode This means fresh demand is coming in without heavy selling, a key ingredient for keeping the rally strong as anticipated by DarkFrost in the analysis above. Bitcoin “max buying” zone hints at $115,000 In late April, Bitcoin bounced strongly from the $89,000–$90,000 support zone, a key horizontal level from prior price action strengthening the case for more upside. The area, according to chartist CryptoCaesarTA , now acts as a “max buying” zone where buyers have aggressively stepped in to limit Bitcoin’s drawdowns. BTC/USD weekly price chart.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $3.26. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $5.30 and an average forecast price of $5.10. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The network has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 soon?

EOS price analysis gives out a relatively bullish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. Coin value has appreciated to a $0.696 high in the last 24 hours. This increase refers to a balanced trading setup for now. From an overall view, the currency gained up to 4.52% of its value today. Technical indicators also give out a positive verdict with respect to the market scenario. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 35% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS above $1. Why is EOS up? EOS is in ascent with bullish pressure. The coin increased to $0.696 in the past 24 hours. EOS price will increase further if further support from the buyers is experienced. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed was $1.34 in December; EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the end of 2027 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again by the end of 2031. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $5.30 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 63rd ranked cryptocurrency. It also observed good bullish sentiment in November last year when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $5.30 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings. It peaked at around $3.27 and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.67 level at the start of April.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|ICO|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-29 09:40:00

When a protocol suffers a significant breach, the focus quickly shifts from the initial loss to the potential for recovery. This is precisely the situation the Solana-based DeFi protocol, Loopscale, has been navigating following a substantial exploit. The good news breaking recently is the significant progress made in the Loopscale recovery efforts, bringing a measure of relief to the community and highlighting the complex dynamics of dealing with digital asset theft. What Happened During the Solana Exploit Affecting Loopscale? Earlier, Loopscale faced a challenging period after experiencing a major exploit that resulted in the loss of approximately $5.8 million in digital assets. This incident was a sharp reminder of the vulnerabilities that can exist within DeFi protocols, even on robust blockchains like Solana. Exploits like these can shake user confidence and pose significant questions about the overall DeFi security landscape. While the specific technical details of how the exploit occurred were not fully elaborated in the initial announcements, the financial impact was immediate and substantial, putting the protocol’s future and its users’ funds at risk. How Did the Loopscale Recovery Unfold? The path to recovery in cryptocurrency exploits is often fraught with difficulty, making Loopscale’s recent announcements particularly noteworthy. The protocol shared via its official communication channels that it had successfully recovered an additional $2.14 million from the exploiter. This follows an earlier recovery, bringing the total amount returned so far to a more significant figure. The latest recovery of 14,463 WSOL (Wrapped Solana), valued at roughly $2.14 million at the time of the transactions, occurred in two distinct phases: A transfer of 10,000 WSOL (approximately $1.48 million) A subsequent transfer of 4,463 WSOL (approximately $660,000) These amounts are in addition to the 5,000 WSOL (approximately $740,000) that was returned the day prior. This step-by-step return of funds suggests a deliberate process, possibly part of a negotiation, which is not uncommon in attempts at crypto exploit recovery . The Hacker’s Terms: Bounty or Bust? Interestingly, Loopscale had previously indicated that the individual responsible for the exploit had reached out and expressed a willingness to return the stolen assets. The condition for this return, as stated by the protocol, was in exchange for a bounty. Offering a bounty to an exploiter is a controversial but sometimes effective strategy used in the blockchain space. It incentivizes the return of funds that might otherwise be permanently lost and can potentially save the protocol and its users from total financial devastation. While the specific terms of the bounty were not disclosed, the fact that funds are being returned suggests that some form of agreement or negotiation is underway. This aspect of the Solana exploit affecting Loopscale adds a layer of complexity to the incident, moving beyond a simple theft to a more intricate interaction between the protocol and the exploiter. Why is Crypto Exploit Recovery So Challenging? Recovering funds after a blockchain hack is notoriously difficult for several reasons: Pseudonymity: While transactions are public, identifying the real-world identity of the hacker behind the wallet addresses is challenging. Global Nature: Jurisdictional issues make legal pursuit complicated across borders. Speed: Stolen funds can be quickly moved, laundered through mixers, or swapped for other cryptocurrencies, making tracing difficult. Decentralization: The very nature of decentralization means there’s no central authority to simply reverse transactions. Given these challenges, the partial Loopscale recovery stands out as a positive development, demonstrating that while difficult, recovery is not always impossible, especially when exploiters choose to cooperate, often motivated by the prospect of a bounty or other factors. Implications for DeFi Security on Solana The incident serves as a case study for DeFi security practices and incident response. For users and developers within the Solana ecosystem and the broader DeFi space, it underscores the critical importance of rigorous smart contract audits, continuous monitoring, and robust security frameworks. While Solana provides a high-throughput blockchain, the security of individual protocols built on it remains the responsibility of their development teams. The Loopscale incident, like others before it, reinforces the need for constant vigilance and improvement in security measures to protect user assets from sophisticated attacks. What Does This Loopscale Recovery Signify? The partial recovery is a significant step forward for Loopscale and its community. While the majority of the stolen funds ($5.8M – $2.14M – $0.74M = $2.92M) are still outstanding, the return of a substantial portion provides some hope and potentially reduces the total loss for affected users. It also highlights the potential, albeit rare, for negotiation and recovery in the aftermath of a major exploit. The focus will now likely shift to how Loopscale plans to distribute the recovered funds and what measures are being put in place to prevent future incidents. In conclusion, the recent announcement of an additional $2.14 million recovered by Loopscale following its $5.8 million exploit is a positive development in a challenging situation. It demonstrates that even in the face of a significant blockchain hack , avenues for recovery can exist. While the full impact of the Solana exploit on Loopscale and its users is still unfolding, the successful return of a portion of the funds offers a degree of optimism and valuable lessons for the entire DeFi ecosystem regarding security, incident response, and the complex process of crypto exploit recovery .

The Bitcoin price posted its “strongest weekly gain since Trump’s election victory, but signs suggest another move could be brewing,” according to Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev. “ETF inflows into spot Bitcoin products topped $3 billion last week — the highest since November — providing structural support that could fuel further upside,” the analyst told Cointelegraph. Bitcoin investments have previously been a significant driver of Bitcoin’s upside momentum. Bitcoin ETFs accounted for an estimated 75% of new investment into Bitcoin when it recaptured the $50,000 mark in February 2024, a month after the debut of the US spot Bitcoin ETFs.

Why it matters: In a typical basis trade, investors buy spot bitcoin and short bitcoin futures to lock in the price gap. When the yield is high, demand for futures rises, boosting OI.

This futuristic scenario is rapidly becoming a reality, especially for enthusiasts of both luxury and digital assets. The latest exciting development comes from the world of high-end fashion and jewelry, signaling a significant step forward for cryptocurrency adoption in the luxury sector. This move by a renowned French jeweler is set to redefine how consumers can interact with premier brands and utilize their digital wealth. Which Luxury Brands Are Accepting Crypto Now? Messika Joins the Ranks The intersection of luxury goods and cryptocurrency has been a topic of growing interest. While some pioneering brands have dipped their toes into the space, the announcement from Messika, a celebrated Paris-based jewelry company, marks a significant moment. Known for its modern and dazzling diamond creations, Messika is now officially accepting cryptocurrency payments across its retail locations in Europe and the United States, as well as through its global online platform. This isn’t just a pilot program; it’s a full integration designed to cater to a clientele that is increasingly sophisticated and digitally native. The decision by Messika highlights a growing recognition among luxury brands that the holders of significant cryptocurrency wealth represent a valuable market segment eager for new ways to spend their digital assets. Exploring the Details of Messika Crypto Payments How exactly is Messika making this possible? The seamless integration of crypto payments is facilitated through a strategic partnership with Lunu, a leading crypto payment provider. Lunu specializes in enabling businesses to accept various cryptocurrencies and settle in traditional fiat currency, simplifying the process for merchants and customers alike. The collaboration allows Messika customers to make purchases using some of the most prominent and widely held cryptocurrencies in the market. According to reports, the accepted digital currencies include: Bitcoin (BTC): The original and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ether (ETH): The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, known for its smart contract capabilities. USDT: Tether, a popular stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, offering stability compared to more volatile assets. Solana (SOL): A high-performance blockchain platform known for its speed and efficiency. The inclusion of both established giants like Bitcoin and Ether, alongside a widely used stablecoin and a fast-growing alternative like Solana, demonstrates Messika’s intention to offer flexibility and cater to a broad spectrum of crypto holders. Why Pay with Bitcoin Luxury Goods? The Appeal for Consumers For customers holding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the ability to use them directly for luxury purchases offers several compelling advantages: Convenience: Skipping the step of converting crypto to fiat through an exchange can save time and potential fees. Liquidity: It provides a direct avenue to utilize accumulated digital wealth for tangible, high-value assets. Privacy: While not entirely anonymous, crypto transactions can offer a degree of privacy compared to traditional payment methods linked to personal banking information. Access to Global Markets: For international customers, paying in crypto can sometimes simplify cross-border transactions. The appeal to pay with Bitcoin luxury items isn’t just about convenience; it’s also about making a statement. It signifies participation in a modern, forward-thinking economy where digital assets are recognized and valued by prestigious brands. Ethereum Payment Jewelry and Beyond: The Expanding Horizon While Bitcoin often grabs headlines, the acceptance of Ethereum payment jewelry by Messika is equally significant. Ethereum’s network is the backbone for much of the decentralized finance (DeFi) world and the NFT market, representing a vast ecosystem of users with substantial digital holdings. Enabling Ether payments directly connects Messika to this wealthy and active community. The inclusion of USDT provides a stable option, shielding both the customer and the merchant from the price volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. This is particularly important for high-value transactions common in the luxury sector. Solana’s inclusion points towards an acknowledgment of newer, faster blockchain technologies and their growing user base. Solana USDT Payments: Catering to Diverse Crypto Portfolios The decision to accept a range of cryptocurrencies, including Solana USDT payments , reflects an understanding that crypto holders have diverse portfolios. It moves beyond simply accepting Bitcoin and Ether to embrace the broader digital asset landscape. This inclusivity is likely to resonate well with crypto enthusiasts who appreciate the flexibility. The process facilitated by Lunu ensures that while customers pay in crypto, Messika receives the equivalent value in fiat currency, mitigating the jeweler’s exposure to crypto market fluctuations. This backend conversion is key to making crypto payments viable for traditional businesses. What Does This Mean for the Future of Luxury and Crypto? Messika’s move is more than just a payment option; it’s a cultural shift. It signals that the luxury industry is increasingly willing to adapt to the evolving financial landscape and cater to a new generation of wealthy consumers who have made their fortunes in the digital realm. This trend is expected to continue, potentially influencing other high-end brands to explore similar integrations. This adoption by a mainstream luxury brand also lends further legitimacy to cryptocurrencies as a medium of exchange, moving them beyond speculative assets into practical tools for commerce. It bridges the gap between the digital economy and traditional high-street retail, creating new possibilities for both consumers and businesses. Benefits for Messika and the Luxury Sector Beyond catering to crypto-rich customers, accepting digital payments offers benefits for Messika itself: Market Expansion: Taps into a global pool of potential customers who prefer or exclusively hold crypto. Modern Image: Positions Messika as innovative and forward-thinking, appealing to younger, tech-savvy demographics. Potential Cost Savings: Crypto transaction fees can sometimes be lower than traditional credit card processing fees, especially for international transactions. Faster Settlements: Depending on the crypto and provider, settlement times can potentially be faster than traditional methods. This move sets a precedent and could encourage other players in the luxury watch, fashion, automotive, and art markets to follow suit, accelerating the integration of crypto into high-end retail. Challenges and Considerations While exciting, the adoption of crypto payments isn’t without its challenges: Volatility: Although Lunu handles the conversion to fiat for the merchant, the customer is still exposed to volatility until the point of sale. Regulation: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can present complexities. Technical Integration: Ensuring smooth and secure transactions requires robust technical infrastructure. Customer Education: Some customers may still be unfamiliar or hesitant to use crypto for payments. Despite these hurdles, the commitment from brands like Messika suggests that the perceived benefits outweigh the challenges, at least for now. Conclusion: A Sparkling Future for Crypto in Luxury Messika’s decision to accept Bitcoin, Ether, USDT, and Solana payments is a glittering example of how luxury brands are embracing the future of finance. By partnering with Lunu, the French jeweler is not only catering to a growing market of crypto holders but also setting a new standard for customer experience in the high-end retail space. This move underscores the increasing legitimacy and utility of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment for goods and services, even at the highest levels of commerce. As more consumers accumulate wealth in digital assets, the ability to spend that wealth directly on desirable items like Messika jewelry will become increasingly important, paving the way for wider crypto adoption across the luxury sector and beyond.

Recently, Hyperliquid (HYPE) generated $42.53 million in fees over the past month, but cracks are starting to appear. The RSI has recently plummeted from 60.93 to 42, indicating a fading bullish momentum and rising trader caution. However, the spotlight is swiftly shifting to a formidable competitor. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is an AI-powered meme coin capturing attention with its staggering 1,100% ROI potential and a unique fusion of meme culture and advanced technology. At a mere presale price of just $0.0000002, this AI token is making a significant impact. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Breaks Revenue Records And Encounters Major Price Resistance Hyperliquid (HYPE) continues to generate impressive revenue, bringing in $42.53 million in fees over the past month. Hyperliquid has consistently made high revenues, making almost $515 annually, according to Defillama. However, the Hyperliquid price has struggled to gain traction after testing the $19.26 resistance twice in recent days, failing both attempts and signaling a weakening trend that could soon produce a death cross. If bearish momentum continues, Hyperliquid (HYPE) could slip to key support at $16.82, with a break lower exposing deeper levels at $14.66, $12.42, and even $9.32 if selling pressure intensifies. On the flip side, a resurgence in bullish sentiment could shift the narrative. If momentum builds, the Hyperliquid price could once again challenge the $19.26 ceiling. The Hyperliquid price currently stands at $18.48 after a slight 4% rise. A clean breakout would likely drive the Hyperliquid price toward $21, and if buyers remain in control, the Hyperliquid price could rally as high as $25.87, reclaiming territory it hasn’t touched since February 21 and potentially reaching its all-time high of $35.20, achieved in December 2024. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Emerges As Crypto’s Sleeper Hit With 1,100% ROI Potential While Hyperliquid (HYPE) continues to dominate headlines with millions in fee generation and a critical price trend taking shape, a new contender is quietly gaining ground.

Of seven major legislative reforms, a landmark step is the greenlighting of spot Bitcoin ETF trading, which is set to be in place by the end of 2025, said local news outlet Edaily. For the first time, investors from South Korea will have the opportunity to invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that are tied to major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Representative Park Soo-min said such reforms were urgent, as major financial hubs like the U.S., Hong Kong, and the U.K. have already legalized similar financial instruments. Hong Kong and the U.K. have approved spot ETF trading one after the other. Korea cannot lose any time,” Park said. The approval is seen as a necessary step in assisting South Korea in remaining competitive in the rapidly evolving global crypto market. Facilitating Institutional Participation By the second quarter of 2025, 3,500 institutions and corporations, including 2,500 listed companies and 1,000 investment companies, will be able to trade digital assets freely. This is a dramatic shift from past restrictions that kept institutions out of the crypto space. Another major reform is the elimination of the limiting “One Crypto Exchange, One Bank” policy. Exchanges were limited to working with a single bank, primarily to combat money laundering. Exchanges will now be allowed to partner with multiple banks, promoting healthier competition and innovation. Other Reforms: Token Securities and Taxation The People Power Party also vowed to create a token securities (STO) bill, introduce a stablecoin regulation system within global standards, and implement a dedicated crypto taxation system. These steps are designed to build a stronger, safer foundation for industry expansion. There will be a special committee chaired by the presidential candidate that will oversee the regulatory implementation, with institutionalization of virtual assets and promoting industrial innovation. Crypto Investments Surging Among South Koreans A recent study by Hana Bank concluded that young South Korean investors now prefer crypto assets. In addition, more than 30% of the country’s wealthy now prefer cryptocurrencies as a long-term investment, surpassing traditional assets like real estate and gold.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-29 09:52:12

The $MBG token serves as both a utility platform and long-term investment resource for users accessing trading tools with additional DeFi solutions and institutional functions. What makes MBG different? Let’s break down its unique position in the current market. I. Tokenomics: The Secret to Long-Term Value $MBG’s tokenomics are designed to reward long-term holders while ensuring a deflationary trajectory that boosts value. Buyback & Burn Strategy: MultiBank Group has allocated $440 million to a buyback and burn program aimed at reducing the token supply by 50% over the next four years. Sustained Demand: The decrease in supply drives up scarcity which raises the worth of $MBG while the market value goes up. The strategic distribution model makes investors choose long-term holding that promotes sustained value growth. These measures will undoubtedly lead to a more valuable asset in the long run, as holders will benefit from increasing scarcity over time. II. $MBG’s Utility Across MultiBank Group’s Platforms One of the standout features of $MBG is its diverse utility, which extends across multiple platforms within the MultiBank Group ecosystem. Fee Reductions: The possession of $MBG tokens grants trading fee reductions across MultiBank FX, MEX Exchange and MultiBank.io therefore delivering concrete monetary advantages. Staking Rewards: By staking $MBG, users unlock high-yield APYs, bonus rewards, and a chance to participate in loyalty programs that offer exclusive perks. Exclusive Access: Holders of $MBG gain access to premium features and enhanced functionality across MultiBank’s services, which increases their overall trading efficiency. III. A Legacy of Trust: MultiBank Group’s Institutional Backing $MBG is not just another speculative asset; it's backed by one of the most established names in global finance. Over $29.36 billion in Daily Volume: MultiBank Group's massive trading volume ensures liquidity and a solid market for $MBG, making it a trusted token in the ecosystem. Global Regulation: MultiBank Group operates through 17 regulatory licenses which allows the firm to function inside a completely compliant space while $MBG obeys strict financial rules throughout various jurisdictions. Financial Stability: MultiBank Group’s impressive revenue, at over $361.8 million for 2024, offers investors confidence in the token's stability. IV. A Growing Ecosystem: $MBG’s Future in the Global Financial Market As the global financial market continues to evolve, MultiBank Group’s expansion will drive demand for $MBG. The group’s projections anticipate a $460 billion daily trading volume on MEX Exchange, further cementing $MBG’s potential for growth. V. Comparison with Other Exchange Coins MBG (MultiBank) distinguishes itself with strong regulatory coverage, holding 17 licenses across five continents, while BNB faces regulatory pressure in several regions, OKB operates with moderate regulatory exposure, and CRO has a licensed but narrower regulatory scope. In terms of TradFi access, MBG offers deep integration with over 20 years of experience in traditional finance, unlike BNB and OKB, which are primarily crypto-native with limited or no deep TradFi links. When it comes to burn mechanics, MBG implements a volume-linked model aiming for up to a 50% token burn, setting it apart from BNB’s quarterly auto-burns targeting a 50% token reduction. OKB burns 30% of spot trading fees, and CRO burns 20% of transaction fees, making MBG’s approach directly tied to real trading volume and long-term deflationary support. Regarding market phase, MBG is positioned as a high-growth, early-stage asset with significant upside potential. In contrast, BNB has matured into a top-tier market cap asset, while OKB and CRO occupy mid-cap positions with relatively stable or brand-focused growth paths. VII. Beyond Speculation: Institutional Focus in a Retail World While retail traders often chase short-term gains, institutional investors prioritize infrastructure, transparency, and risk mitigation. $MBG has been designed with this perspective in mind. Risk Management: Features like negative balance protection and no slippage execution make $MBG particularly attractive for institutional-grade strategies. Security Assurance: $MBG has passed an advanced 10/10 audit score from Hacken, offering investors peace of mind regarding its security standards. Fiat Accessibility: Through fiat-to-crypto ramps, including AED and other multi-currency options, $MBG ensures that real-world investors can easily interact with its utility. Institutional Onboarding: These features are not add-ons but foundational elements to onboard serious institutional capital into crypto, maintaining high standards and ensuring trust. VIII. Positioning for the RWA Boom As the cryptocurrency space evolves, Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization is expected to become a trillion-dollar trend. $MBG and its ecosystem are perfectly positioned to capitalize on this shift. Through regulated infrastructure, spot and derivative markets, and seamless cross-platform liquidity, $MBG offers not just token utility but a future-proofed digital finance experience. As tokenization of assets grows, $MBG will become more deeply embedded in MultiBank’s ongoing product iterations, offering investors a truly innovative, well-rounded financial ecosystem. IX. A Token Built for the Long Term $MBG is more than just a speculative asset; it is anchored in real financials, governed by decades of compliance-first operations, and structured for long-term growth. It offers a credible option for new entrants and institutions seeking exposure to digital assets without compromising on trust. $MBG represents a new type of token, one that is built from structure, supported by performance, and designed for a more mature and sustainable crypto economy.

In a sentencing memorandum filed on April 28 , federal prosecutors urged the court to impose a two-decade sentence, citing Mashinsky’s central role in a scheme that left customers unable to access nearly $4.7 billion in cryptocurrency when Celsius froze withdrawals in June 2022. The DOJ described the fraud as deliberate and calculated, not a result of misjudgment or market misfortune. Mashinsky Admitted $550M Crypto Fraud, Pocketed $48M, DOJ Says According to the court document, Mashinsky admitted in his December 2024 guilty plea that he spearheaded fraudulent activities that caused over $550 million in losses and netted him at least $48 million in personal gains. Prosecutors emphasized that Mashinsky’s actions were not accidental but rather “intentional efforts to deceive and steal,” designed to boost his own fortune at the expense of retail investors. At the height of its operation in 2021, Celsius claimed to manage over $20 billion in crypto assets, promoting itself as a safe and profitable alternative to traditional banking. However, the DOJ revealed that behind the scenes, the company engaged in risky lending practices, made speculative trades, and used customer funds to manipulate the price of its CEL token. DOJ Seeks 20-Year Sentence for Celsius Founder Alex Mashinsky Federal prosecutors called Mashinsky the architect of a ""years-long campaign of lies and self-dealing"" that left customers with billions in losses. pic.twitter.com/bppSCUCPim — Bingo666. (@Bingo666__) April 29, 2025 Mashinsky, despite assuring users that he was holding onto his CEL tokens, had actually sold more than $48 million worth of them at inflated prices. Celsius filed for bankruptcy in July 2022 , leaving around $4.7 billion in user assets locked on the platform. The DOJ argues that Mashinsky’s sentence should reflect the significant harm caused to investors and serve as a deterrent to similar misconduct in the crypto industry. Celsius Victims Demand Harsh Sentence for Mashinsky Last week, disgruntled investors from across the globe urged a federal judge to impose the maximum sentence on Mashinsky for his role in the company’s 2022 collapse. Over 200 victim impact statements were submitted to the court, with the majority demanding a severe punishment, citing financial ruin, emotional distress, and shattered dreams. One investor compared Mashinsky to Bernie Madoff and called for a life sentence, blaming him for pushing some victims to suicide. While his legal team has requested a sentence of just over a year, probation officers have recommended 15 years. The call for a harsh sentence comes amid a broader softening in crypto enforcement under the Trump administration, which has recently pardoned several high-profile crypto figures.

Circle, the company behind USDC , the world’s second-largest stablecoin, has scored In-Principle Approval (IPA) from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) . Here’s putting it in simpler words – Circle’s been given a major go-ahead to operate as a money services provider in the UAE – and it’s one step closer to full licensing. This gives it a strategic foothold in a region that is moving fast on digital finance, while the majority of the world is still figuring things out. Circle Is Going Where the Action Is This is a calculated expansion – and a very good one. Let’s be honest: the Middle East, and especially the UAE, has become a magnet for crypto and fintech innovators and it’s not hard to see why. With clear regulations, a forward-looking approach, and a serious appetite for Web3 infrastructure , Abu Dhabi is positioning itself as a launchpad for the next phase of finance and thus, crypto. “The UAE is paving the way for responsible innovators to build the internet financial system,” said Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Circle. The organization wants to build long-term here, in a place where regulation supports growth instead of stifling it. It’s also great timing-wise! Just weeks ago, Circle launched a cross-border payments network to expand USDC utility, which now has a circulating supply of $62 billion , up more than 40% in 2025 . Let’s also not forget that Circle also quietly filed for a U.S. IPO at the start of this month. The Middle East move fits right into that momentum. Circle Joins Forces with Hub71 Circle intends to build bridges wherever it can, and is planting deeper roots in Abu Dhabi through a new partnership with Hub71. Circle will work with Hub71 on programs through ADGM’s digital regulatory sandbox, giving founders access to grants, institutional connections, hackathons, and mentorship . The company will also join Hub71’s Digital Assets specialist ecosystem, contributing its stablecoin expertise to a community of 500+ startups and VC partners. “Circle’s expertise will enrich our digital assets ecosystem, providing Hub71 founders with greater access to resources, mentorship, and growth opportunities. Through this partnership, we are enabling the adoption of leading digital financial infrastructure that supports startup growth and drives the evolution of Web3 and digital finance from Abu Dhabi.” said Ahmad Ali Alwan, CEO of Hub71. Stablecoins Are Going Global – And Circle Knows It Circle was the first major stablecoin issuer to comply with the EU’s MiCA regulations , and just last month, it launched USDC in Japan through a partnership with SBI Holdings . Why does this matter? Because according to rwa.xyz data , there are $230 billion in stablecoins now in circulation, and growing fast. This isn’t a niche market anymore. What started as tools for crypto traders is now becoming a real-world alternative for payments, remittances – even better than traditional banks! By planting a flag in Abu Dhabi, Circle is signaling confidence: that regulation and innovation can grow together, and that the Middle East is ready for its stablecoin era.",News,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|USDC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-29 09:58:28

In just the past few months, several high-profile wallet exploits have shaken the crypto world, from sophisticated phishing campaigns to browser vulnerabilities that exposed users’ private keys. Crypto wallets are supposed to be the bedrock of democratized finance—tools that give users direct, sovereign control over their assets. Instead, they often feel like rickety scaffolding: unstable, unforgiving, and ready to collapse under the weight of a single mistake. You might also like: Web3 wallets: The digital payment solution for the next billion users | Opinion For all the innovation in web3, wallets remain one of its weakest links—and one of the biggest barriers to mainstream adoption. The core problem? An outdated reliance on seed phrases. This decades-old security model asks ordinary users to perform like cybersecurity experts, with no room for error. Forget your seed phrase, or store it insecurely, and your assets are gone forever. It’s a user experience nightmare masquerading as a security feature. This is not merely inconvenient—it’s actively deterring potential users. As an industry, we need to intervene. ETFs show users want crypto, but not wallets Take a look at the surge in crypto ETF inflows over the last year. Institutional and retail investors alike recognize crypto’s enormous potential and want exposure, yet overwhelmingly choose indirect investment vehicles like ETFs instead of direct asset ownership. Why is this happening when crypto offers so many compelling features, so many ways to increase your yield? It’s because the user experience is that bad. Crypto wallet interfaces are notoriously complex, security is overly burdensome, and recovery processes are unforgiving. Faced with the daunting task of navigating this hostile environment, mainstream users have understandably gravitated toward traditional financial structures, preferring familiarity and simplicity. This stark reality indicates that users are willing—even eager—to participate in the crypto ecosystem, but wallet usability and security barriers hold them back. Seed phrases: A dangerous UX failure At the heart of wallet design failures are seed phrases—12 to 24-word strings users must store securely, offline, without mistakes. Sounds simple. Except that thousands of hackers, some extremely sophisticated or even state-sponsored, actively target your device—your files, your browser cache, your clipboard data, anything they can access–trying to steal your seed phrase and drain your funds. Expecting everyday individuals, who are neither cryptographers nor cybersecurity specialists, to execute this task flawlessly is unreasonable. Seed phrases offer no second chances—misplacing or losing them means losing everything, permanently. Imagine if traditional finance operated this way—if accidentally losing or exposing your debit card number meant instantly losing every dollar in your bank account. The financial system would descend into chaos. Traditional finance institutions have long recognized that security must be robust yet forgiving, accounting for human error. Crypto wallet design, however, continues to rely on an outdated security model built around unrealistic expectations of user diligence. This disconnect has resulted in countless stories of lost funds due to forgotten seed phrases, devices malfunctioning, and simple human errors. Poor UX is a systemic risk to web3 Poor wallet UX does not merely inconvenience individual users—it presents a systemic risk to the broader web3 ecosystem. News headlines frequently highlight lost assets, phishing scams, and compromised wallets—all directly attributable to confusing interfaces and poor security designs. These stories erode trust, perpetuating the narrative that crypto is inherently unsafe and inaccessible. This perception of crypto as overly complicated and hazardous is driving potential adopters away. New users evaluating whether to enter the crypto market often read horror stories, not success stories, prompting them to seek safer and simpler traditional investment vehicles. Until UX improves to accommodate everyday users, crypto will remain confined to tech-savvy enthusiasts who can navigate the pitfalls—the groundswell of adoption we keep waiting for will never come. Innovation exists—why aren’t wallet providers adopting it? Modern cryptographic technologies—such as threshold signatures, multi-party computation , and seedless recovery—provide secure, user-friendly alternatives to traditional seed phrase-based security. Threshold signatures distribute signing authority across multiple devices or entities, eliminating single points of failure. MPC enables secure cryptographic operations without revealing private keys. Seedless recovery methods allow users to safely restore wallet access without risking permanent loss. Despite the availability and proven effectiveness of these solutions, wallet providers have shown frustratingly little urgency in adopting them. Many wallets continue to rely heavily on outdated methods simply due to inertia or misplaced priorities. By stubbornly clinging to obsolete designs, wallet providers risk not just individual user assets but the credibility and growth potential of the entire web3 ecosystem. It’s time for wallets to grow up As web3 leaders, we should look at retail ETF adoption and be furious. Every last dollar should be on-chain, helping to back the growth of protocols, not lining the pockets of institutions. Crypto’s UX is so bad that users are willing to pay ETF management fees to avoid it. Web3’s broader adoption and ultimate success depend on wallets becoming user-centric, secure, and forgiving. Only then can crypto break free from its niche constraints and fulfill its promise of revolutionizing finance for the masses.

However, the anticipated surge back over $100,000 has still not materialised. Is Bitcoin waiting for some kind of catalyst, or will it continue the upward grind as it passes through resistance laid down since late last year? The market can be as irrational as it likes Top indicators for Bitcoin, such as the Stochastic RSI, RSI, and the MACD, are providing very positive signalling for the king of the cryptocurrencies on the weekly time frame. Therefore, some might be wondering why a substantial surge hasn’t taken place yet? Firstly, the market is the market, and it can be as irrational as it likes, for as long as it likes. Secondly, there are just so many factors that affect the market, that it is just about impossible for anyone to take them all into account and calculate their impact at any given time. ETFs and treasuries buy vigorously Nevertheless, there are still plenty of reasons for Bitcoin holders to be glad. The U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs bought 6.31K BTC on Monday, adding to the 33.5K Bitcoin that was bought last week. 40,000 BTC in just 6 trading days for the ETFs, another 15,355 BTC for Michael Saylor’s Strategy, and an increasing group of corporate and sovereign treasuries also plundering what they can, is contributing to a general ‘number go up’ environment. $BTC price coming to decision point Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for $BTC shows that the price is funnelling into the apex of a triangle. If this breaks to the upside, we can perhaps see a continuance of bullish price movement. Even if the price breaks to the downside, given the generally positive market sentiment, it might just mean further sideways price action. $BTC lays down price structure Source: TradingView In the daily time frame it can be seen that the price action is not far off the middle of a range, which stretches from $91,300 up to $99,500. The current price action is all contributing to laying down price structure that can be used for future support. The next step up would likely be to $106,200, which may be in the process of becoming a structural support/resistance level. $BTC poised to surge higher Source: TradingView The weekly time frame provides the view that all is well with Bitcoin. So far at least, the price is holding above the support and looks as though it could be poised to climb higher. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart is signalling strong upside price momentum. If one looks left to the previous bull flag, it can be seen just how high the price climbed as the Stochastic RSI rose from the bottom to the top of its range. It might also be noted that the main upside price action did not really get going until the Stochastic RSI indicators reached the top.

The department blamed the spike on starting the quarter with way less cash than expected, a direct hit from Congress still not fixing the debt ceiling. In February, the Treasury figured it would have about $850 billion sitting in the bank by the end of March. That didn’t happen. Instead, the actual number fell to around $406 billion. Because the debt limit snapped back into place in January, the government couldn’t push out any new Treasuries to fill the gap. Even with that shortfall, officials are stubbornly sticking to their $850 billion cash target for the end of June, still betting lawmakers will finally deal with the ceiling mess. Treasury says cash shortage shaved $53 billion off estimate The Treasury said if it hadn’t started the quarter with less cash, the second-quarter borrowing number would have been $53 billion lower. “Excluding the lower than assumed beginning-of-quarter cash balance, the current quarter borrowing estimate is $53 billion lower than announced in February,” the department said in the Monday statement. Lou Crandall, a senior economist at Wrightson ICAP, warned before Monday’s announcement that the old February forecasts didn’t factor in new tariff hikes President Donald Trump slammed on imports. In a note, Lou said the extra tariff cash flowing in might help the Treasury manage its cash pile better. But the missing billions from the start of the quarter were already punching a hole through earlier projections. Before Monday’s update, Wall Street traders weren’t even close to agreeing on what the new borrowing number would be. Lou said he expected the Treasury would jack up its forecast if it kept assuming an $850 billion cash balance was possible by June. Over at JPMorgan Chase & Co., strategists were a lot more cautious, guessing that net marketable borrowing would land at $255 billion, with the cash balance dropping to $300 billion. The federal debt ceiling came back into force at the beginning of January. That immediately put the Treasury on a leash, blocking it from creating any more net debt. If Congress keeps dragging its feet, the department will be forced to slash bill issuance and bleed out its cash reserves even faster. Right now, the Treasury’s cash balance stands at about $563 billion, based on last Thursday’s numbers. It’s higher than the end-of-March disaster but still nowhere close to the dream $850 billion target that officials keep clinging to. Treasury outlines next quarter borrowing plans Looking past June, the Treasury expects to borrow another $554 billion between July and September. It’s assuming once again that it will have an $850 billion pile of cash at the end of the third quarter. But just like everything else, that number only holds if Congress finally raises or suspends the debt ceiling. The department said it will release its note and bond sale plans for the next few months this Wednesday. Dealers on Wall Street think the Treasury will leave those sale sizes the same, without any big shifts. Some analysts, including Lou, are starting to wonder if the Treasury will have to rethink its whole approach to cash management. Right now, the department targets a massive cash buffer. But Lou floated the idea that officials might shrink that target if the ceiling fight keeps getting worse. When reporters asked a Treasury official how they would announce a change in the cash balance strategy, the official reportedly said they’d likely do it through the quarterly refunding statement – just like they did during a similar situation back in 2015. Speaking during a call, the official made it clear that no decision had been made yet, but if they were going to change course, that’s how the world would hear about it.

Historic Cycles Point to Explosive Price Prediction,https://cryptonews.com/news/will-bitcoin-surge-alongside-gold-historic-cycles-point-to-explosive-price-prediction/,"Bitcoin (BTC/USD) is regaining momentum as a macro hedge, with its correlation to gold snapping back into positive territory. As of April 25, the 30-day Pearson correlation between Bitcoin and gold stood at 0.54—up sharply from a low of -0.67 in February. That reversal reflects a renewed alignment between two key safe-haven assets amid growing global uncertainty. In February, Bitcoin tumbled 17% from $102,000 to $84,000, while gold ticked up from $2,800 to $2,850. That divergence sparked a rare dislocation in the correlation, but it proved temporary. Since March, Bitcoin has rallied over 10%, while gold gained 5%, both tracking renewed demand for alternative stores of value. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index has slid by 4%, reinforcing the appeal of inflation-resistant assets. Historical data supports the likelihood of this “recoupling” continuing. Since 2020, Bitcoin’s correlation to gold has fallen below -0.50 on 18 occasions. In 17 of those cases, it rebounded above 0.5 within a week. Bitcoin Outpaces Gold, Signals Liquidity Rotation Bitcoin is not only re-aligning with gold—it’s also beginning to outperform it. Macro analyst Ted (@TedPillows) noted the shift in a recent tweet: “$BTC is catching up really fast now. Since the bottom, BTC is nearly 25% and is now outperforming Gold and SPX. Interestingly, Gold is trending down, which shows that liquidity rotation from Gold to BTC has started. I already said that before: ‘When Gold pumps, BTC pumps even harder.’” This supports a broader narrative of capital rotating away from traditional safe havens into higher-beta assets as macro risks evolve. Bitcoin’s relative strength—paired with its speculative upside—is once again making it a favorite among risk-on institutional players. Key trends to watch: BTC outperforming gold and the S&P 500 since March Correlation rebound from -0.67 to 0.54 Continued weakness in the U.S. Dollar Index Trump Tariffs Reignite the “Digital Gold” Trade Bitcoin’s rebound also mirrors recent macro developments. After President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement, BTC surged over 10%, while gold rose 5%. The U.S. Dollar Index dropped 4% in response, underlining renewed pressure on fiat confidence. This macro backdrop reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a hedge in periods of policy and geopolitical strain: BTC climbed more than 10% Gold rose 5% DXY declined 4% With trade policy uncertainty and upcoming economic data releases, investors are again seeking exposure to scarcity-based assets. Bitcoin’s digital scarcity narrative is resonating anew. Technical Setup: Bitcoin Targets $98K Breakout Technically, Bitcoin is consolidating just below $95,000, holding above its rising trendline and the 50 EMA ($94,015). Recent support near $93,760 has held twice, while resistance remains at $95,850. A confirmed breakout could open the door to $97,500 and $98,800. For traders: Entry idea: Above $96,000 on volume Stop-loss: Below $94,000 Upside targets: $97,500 and $98,800 MACD momentum is neutral for now, but any bullish volume spike could trigger an impulsive move higher. The trend is intact, and historical correlation patterns hint this may only be the beginning. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5M Milestone as 80% Yield Fuels Staking Surge Investor interest in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) remains strong, with $5,099,050 raised out of a $5,841,511 target.

While expectations for the XRP ETF have increased following the conclusion of the long-running SEC-Ripple case, the launch of futures ETFs before the spot ETF caused great excitement. At this point, news that ProShares would launch its XRP ETF on April 30 had created excitement in the crypto community, but it turned out to be fake news. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart revealed that there is no official XRP ETF launch date yet. Seyffart noted that the ProShares XRP futures ETF will not start trading on April 30. The analyst said that the XRP ETF does not have a confirmed launch date yet, but is expected to start trading in the short to medium term. “Many are reporting that ProShares will launch an XRP futures ETF on April 30. However, we have confirmed that this is not the case. No specific launch date has been set yet but we believe they will eventually launch an XRP ETF. “This is likely to be launched in the short term and possibly in the medium term.” A ProShares spokesperson also denied the reports, saying: “ProShares does not have any ETF launches scheduled for Wednesday, April 30. We have no further news to share at this time.” While no official launch date has been announced, ProShares is gearing up to launch three XRP futures ETFs: an Ultra XRP ETF offering 2x leverage, a Short XRP ETF offering -1x inverse leverage, and an Ultra Short XRP ETF offering -2x inverse leverage. These ProShares ETFs will be the second, third, and fourth XR ETFs to be approved in the U.S. Since Teucrium launched its first XRP futures ETF on April 8, the ETF has begun trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/egrag-crypto-forecasts-9-5-to-27-xrp-price-rally-heres-the-timeline/,"In a recent post, crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO shared an in-depth analysis of the XRP/BTC trading pair, suggesting that a major move could be imminent within the next six months. Accompanying his post was a detailed chart illustrating key Fibonacci levels, moving averages, and a symmetrical triangle formation that may signal a significant price breakout. #XRP / #BTC – MAX 6 Months Left to Valhalla! I have posted many discussions about a hot summer ahead in the crypto world and specifically in #XRP and #Alts . The chart below suggests the following: 1⃣ Closing below the 21 EMA on 2 Weeks Time Frame, isn't favorable for us,… pic.twitter.com/TW6q8Ti5lM — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) April 27, 2025 EGRAG CRYPTO emphasized that he has previously discussed the likelihood of a “hot summer” for cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP and alternative coins, and reinforced this view with his latest chart. The analyst outlined that a close below the 21-week EMA would not be favorable. However, he stressed that maintaining a position above the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level (0.00001552 BTC) is crucial if the 21 EMA is lost. EGRAG CRYPTO warns that falling below this threshold could undermine the bullish structure he is monitoring. On the other hand, a close above the 0.786 Fibonacci level (0.000029 BTC) would serve as an early bullish indicator, suggesting that the bullish formation is beginning to play out. Key Indicators for Formation Validation EGRAG CRYPTO identified the 1.0 Fibonacci level (0.00044 BTC) as a decisive marker. A successful close above this level would confirm that the bullish structure has been activated. At that point, the analyst explained that he would shift focus to analyzing both the XRP/USD and BTC/USD trading pairs to determine whether XRP is outperforming Bitcoin or if Bitcoin itself is declining relative to XRP. He noted that either scenario would provide critical insights into whether Bitcoin is approaching the final phase of its USD-denominated market cycle. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to the chart and commentary, the measured target for the full formation lies between the 1.414 and 1.618 Fibonacci extension levels. Specifically, the chart labels these targets around 0.00009500 BTC to 0.00014000 BTC. Based on Bitcoin’s USD valuation, this could translate to an XRP price between $9.50 and $27.00. Chart Structure and Future Implications The attached chart from EGRAG CRYPTO displayed a symmetrical triangle pattern combined with a bullish pennant, providing what he described as “double targets.” If confirmed by price action respecting the specified Fibonacci levels, the breakout from this consolidation structure would point towards a significant revaluation of XRP against Bitcoin. Historical cyclical patterns were also marked, with previous major bottoms highlighted in yellow circles, suggesting a repeatable behavior pattern is emerging. EGRAG CRYPTO bases part of his analysis on these past trends, indicating that XRP might enter another phase of outperformance against Bitcoin. Finally, EGRAG CRYPTO encouraged the XRP community , referred to as the “XRP Family,” to remain steady and strong through the coming months. He reiterated that the technical setup indicates a critical timeframe, projecting that a resolution of this pattern should occur no later than September 1, 2025, as noted on his chart.

If you’re a user of Bithumb , one of South Korea’s leading digital asset exchanges, there’s an important announcement you need to be aware of regarding your Ethereum holdings and other related tokens. Get ready for a temporary pause in deposit and withdrawal services for ETH and all Ethereum-based assets. Understanding the Upcoming Ethereum Hard Fork So, what’s causing this temporary disruption on Bithumb ? The reason is a significant event happening on the Ethereum network itself: an upcoming hard fork on the Ethereum mainnet. For those new to the blockchain world, a hard fork is essentially a major upgrade to the network’s protocol. Think of it like a software update for the entire blockchain – but one that isn’t backward compatible. It requires all participants (like nodes, miners, and exchanges) to upgrade to the new version. These upgrades are crucial for improving the network’s efficiency, security, and scalability. While beneficial in the long run, they require careful preparation from all involved parties to ensure a smooth transition and prevent potential issues. What Bithumb Announced About ETH and ERC-20 Tokens According to an official announcement on their website, Bithumb will be temporarily suspending deposits and withdrawals specifically for: Ethereum (ETH) All Ethereum-based tokens (these are typically known as ERC-20 tokens, which run on the Ethereum blockchain) This suspension is scheduled to begin on May 7th at 05:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) . The exchange explicitly stated that this action is in preparation for the upcoming Ethereum mainnet hard fork. The exact duration of the suspension wasn’t specified in the initial snippet, but such measures usually last until the exchange is confident that the network upgrade is stable and their systems are fully compatible with the new chain version. Why Your Crypto Exchange Needs to Take Action You might wonder why a crypto exchange like Bithumb needs to halt deposits and withdrawals just because the underlying network is upgrading. It’s a necessary precaution to protect user funds and ensure the integrity of transactions. Here’s why: Preventing Transaction Issues: During a hard fork, there’s a brief period where the network might be in transition. Transactions sent during this time could potentially get lost, stuck, or even processed incorrectly if the exchange isn’t fully synchronized with the new chain. Ensuring Wallet Compatibility: Exchanges manage large volumes of user funds in wallets that interact directly with the blockchain. They need to ensure their wallet infrastructure is fully compatible with the post-fork network rules. Snapshotting Balances: Some hard forks might involve a snapshot of balances at a specific block height, especially if a new token is being introduced (though this is less common for standard Ethereum upgrades like this seems to be). Exchanges need to be prepared for this. Security and Stability: Pausing services allows the exchange to monitor the network’s stability after the fork and ensure their systems are secure against any unforeseen issues arising from the upgrade. By temporarily suspending these services, Bithumb minimizes the risk of errors, lost funds, or discrepancies for its users during this critical network transition period. How Does This Affect Bithumb Users? For users holding or trading ETH and ERC-20 tokens on Bithumb , the primary impact is straightforward: No Deposits: You will not be able to deposit ETH or any ERC-20 tokens into your Bithumb wallet from an external wallet or another exchange starting May 7th, 05:00 UTC. No Withdrawals: You will not be able to withdraw ETH or any ERC-20 tokens from your Bithumb wallet to an external wallet or another exchange starting May 7th, 05:00 UTC. Trading: The announcement snippet doesn’t explicitly mention trading suspensions. Typically, during deposit/withdrawal halts for hard forks, trading pairs involving the affected assets remain active on the exchange’s internal order book. However, it’s always best to check Bithumb’s official announcement for confirmation on trading status. This means if you need to move your ETH or ERC-20 tokens onto or off Bithumb , you must complete those transactions before the May 7th 05:00 UTC deadline. Preparing for the Upcoming Hard Fork : Actionable Insights Given this announcement, here are some actionable steps Bithumb users should consider: Plan Ahead: If you need to deposit ETH or ERC-20 tokens onto Bithumb for trading or any other reason, do so well before May 7th, 05:00 UTC. If you need to withdraw ETH or ERC-20 tokens from Bithumb to an external wallet or another platform, initiate the withdrawal request well before the deadline. Don’t wait until the last minute, as network congestion or processing delays could cause issues. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on Bithumb’s official website and communication channels (like their announcements page or social media). They will provide updates on the status of the suspension and, crucially, announce when deposits and withdrawals are expected to resume. Monitor the progress of the Ethereum hard fork itself through official Ethereum channels or reputable crypto news sources. Be Patient: Understand that the suspension is temporary and necessary for the security and stability of your assets on the platform. Avoid attempting to deposit or withdraw affected tokens during the suspension period, as this could lead to complications. This temporary measure is a standard procedure undertaken by major exchanges like Bithumb during significant network upgrades. It reflects their commitment to protecting user assets and ensuring the platform’s compatibility with the evolving blockchain landscape. Conclusion: Navigating the Temporary Pause on Bithumb In summary, Bithumb is proactively preparing for the upcoming Ethereum hard fork by temporarily halting deposits and withdrawals of ETH and all ERC-20 tokens starting May 7th at 05:00 UTC. This is a necessary step for any responsible crypto exchange to ensure the safety and integrity of transactions during a major network upgrade. While inconvenient, this temporary suspension is crucial for a smooth transition post-fork. Users are advised to complete any necessary deposits or withdrawals before the deadline and monitor Bithumb’s official announcements for updates on the resumption of services.

Over the past seven days, it increased by more than 9% and is currently trading at around $2.30. In this article, we take a closer look at the top 5 XRP price predictions to watch as we approach the month of May. Will the old saying “sell in May and go away” turn out to be true once again? 5 Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions to Watch in May First in line we have an analysis from the popular analyst on X using the monicker Ameba. He took it to social media recently, to reveal that the first target he is looking at is located at around $2.90. This would represent an increase of around 26%. I wanted to see a tap of [the] mid range, which is what happened over the weekend shortly after [the] weekly open. The next play wto the upside would be above the mid range for me, on a potential breakout scenario. Source: X It appears that this particular notion is also supported by another trader. Joe Swanson bases his analysis on an inverse Head & Shoulders pattern which, according to him, has been broken to the upside, confirming a bullish wedge breakout and flipping the key resistance to support, while also forming a higher low. Momentum [is] building for a storng move up! – He said, attaching a chart with a $3 price prediction in the short term. Duo Nine, a well-known trading analyst noted in a Ripple price analysis for CryptoPotato that even if the bulls are able to make it to $3, they would have to face a considerable selling pressure. That’s stemming from the fact that this level has been tested twice in the near past. The XRP price got rejected twice there. Another XRP price prediction comes from Crypto Virtuos, who told his 81,000 followers that the next target to keep an eye on is $2.5. This would represent an increase of around 10% from current prices. As previously posted, XRP has broken out and is looking strong. Initial target is $2.5. This is the biggest hurdle on the way right now. Start of the week looks good. Source: X More Shocking XRP Price Predicitons While the above three seem more conservative to the opportunistic traders, here are some wild and borderline unrealistic Ripple price predictions . Some of the following are not predicted to happen in May but are worth watching nonetheless, especially if the fundamentals behind them start yielding merit. First in line, we have Oscar Ramos. He cited an analysis by Bitwise, outlining that when XRP ETFs are approved in the US, the asset’s price will go parabolic. His target is around $29 by 2030. Next in line is another popular XRP price commentator on X called Brett, who said XRP could reach between $33 and $50 by 2027, citing Sistine Research. This would materialize a rally between 1500% and 2500%. And lastly, the most outrageous prediction for XRP’s valuation . John Squire, a social media influencer with around 500,000 followers said that it’s possible for the cryptocurrency to reach $100. Of course, to sound the side of objectivity, this would put XRP’s total market cap at around $6 trillion, which is twice as large as the entire crytpocurrency market right now. Why is the XRP Price Up This Week? Price predictions aside, it’s worth noting that there are some fundamental developments behind XRP’s recent price movements . The most evident one is that ProShares received the SEC’s approval to launch three separate XRP ETFs. Namely, these are the Ultra XRP ETF (2x leverage), Short XRP ETF, and Ultra Short XRP ETF (-2x leverage). As the names suggest, these are not spot XRP ETFs – they are based on derivative products and do not require ownership of the underlying asset. Although this is not what the community expected, the positive impact on the market seems clear as many investors take it as a positive signal coming from the country’s financial watchdog.

According to an April 29 announcement, with this latest addition, Phoenix’s Bitcoin mining capacity in Ethiopia reaches 132 MW. The firm’s global capacity now reportedly exceeds 500 MW. Phoenix’s co-founder and CEO, Munaf Ali, said the firm’s strategy relies on “securing prime locations with abundant, low-cost energy.” “Initiatives like our latest expansion in Ethiopia are pivotal steps, not only creating significant value today but also solidifying our position,” he said. Related: Arkansas city rejects crypto mining proposal after community pushback Building on previous agreements The news follows Phoenix Group signing an agreement that secures the right to 80 MW of power in Ethiopia in January. An announcement published at the time noted that the new Bitcoin mining site was scheduled to go live in the second quarter of 2025. The 52 MW site will be developed in two phases, with the first one using just 20 MW to power 5,300 air-cooled mining units with an expected hashrate of 1.2 exahashes per second. In the second phase — expected to reach completion by the end of Q2 2025 — the site will use the full 52 MW, water cooling, and produce an estimated 2.4 exahashes per second of hashrate. An exahash is a unit of computational power used mainly to measure the speed of cryptocurrency mining networks, especially Bitcoin. Exahashes quantify how many trillions of calculations a mining network can perform per second. Reza Nedjatian, the CEO of the firm’s mining, artificial intelligence and data center subsidiary, highlighted that the plant will be powered by renewable energy: “With 132 MW now running on clean hydropower, we’re proud to set a new benchmark for sustainable mining in Africa and deliver large-scale operations in energy-rich regions.” Related: LAPD recovers $2.7M worth of Bitcoin miners stolen in airport heist A fast-burn company Phoenix Group became a publicly-traded company following its late 2023 listing on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange .

Over the past month, the price of PI has dropped by 26%, currently trading around $0.5786, down 6% in the last 24 hours. Its weak performance has shaken the investor’s confidence as it shows fewer signs of a rebound. Pi Network’s -0.11 correlation with Bitcoin is adding to the concerns, as it tends to decline when Bitcoin rises. Even with Bitcoin approaching $100,000 and the broader market rallying, Pi Coin may continue to face further setbacks. 10 Million Tokens Unlocked Today Today, Pi Network unlocked 10.1 million PI tokens . 11.22 million tokens are scheduled to be unlocked tomorrow, April 30, marking the largest release this month. In total, over 100 million tokens were unlocked in April, contributing to an 80% price drop from its February high of $2.98. Unlocks are set to nearly double in May, with 197 million tokens expected to be released. This surge in supply could intensify selling pressure on Pi Network’s price. 1.56 billion PI tokens will be unlocked over the next year, around 134 million each month. The largest unlock will be in December 2027 with 432.3 million tokens. This could affect PI’s price by increasing supply, especially if demand goes down. Pi Network needs a long-term solution to manage this pressure. Analysts Bullish Despite Price Drop Despite ongoing token unlocks and recent price drops, analysts think Pi Network (PI) could reach $5, driven by growth in its ecosystem and better market conditions. Some analysts suggest that Pi Network could reach $3 by June if market conditions remain favorable. This depends on key developments, including rumors of possible token burns to reduce its supply. However, its supply concerns and especially the upcoming token unlocks could limit its potential. Analyst Dr. Altcoin thinks Pi Network’s price could start rising in mid-May, particularly during the Consensus Summit from May 14-16, 2025.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-29 11:34:23

Despite the dip from prices above $0.20 this past week, Hedera remains largely bullish. The altcoin could see fresh traction following a key strategic partnership. The HBAR Foundation’s support for Hedera continues with a new real-world asset (RWA) tokenization initiative, a move that adds to the network’s RWA adoption. HBAR Foundation and Tokeny partner to drive tokenization on Hedera On April 28, Tokeny, an on-chain finance infrastructure platform, announced it was teaming up with The HBAR Foundation. The platforms want to bring scalable, compliant, and eco-friendly tokenization solutions to institutions via Hedera. Tokeny will leverage Hedera’s enterprise-grade, carbon-negative ledger. In this case, the aim is to tap into Hedera’s growth to bring tokenized financial products to institutional investors, a move that potentially positions HBAR as a key player in the digital finance space. Commenting on the partnership, Tokeny’s CEO Luc Falempin said: “Tokeny’s technology was designed from the start to meet the needs of institutions. Building on Hedera unlocks a powerful combination with enterprise-grade tokenization infrastructure on a network built for speed, security, and sustainability.” What does this mean for HBAR? HBAR Foundation and Tokeny’s collaboration builds on the existing framework of the non-profit ERC-3643 Association, with the main goal being to standardize RWA tokenization. HBAR Foundation @HBAR_foundation · Follow We’re excited to announce that @TokenySolutions , the leading onchain operating system for compliant asset tokenization, has integrated with @Hedera to scale institutional asset tokenization on the network 🏦 Watch on Twitter View replies 5:48 pm · 28 Apr 2025 485 Reply Copy link Read 18 replies Tapping into Hedera’s energy efficiency platform and Tokeny’s sustainability-focused solutions could drive new demand for HBAR-powered tokenized assets, including real estate, equities, and debt instruments. “This collaboration reinforces Hedera’s position as a leader for compliant digital finance and opens the door for institutions to confidently launch tokenization strategies onchain,” Sabrina Tachdjian, director of fintech & payments at The HBAR Foundation, said. While the partnership has not sparked a major uptick for HBAR’s price , the potential is in what the deal promises. HBAR price currently stands at $0.1899 with a 24-hour trading volume of $191 million. Hedera’s low-cost, high-speed network is poised for a tokenized securities explosion. HBAR chart by CoinMarketCap As institutions begin to bring assets onto Hedera, they can easily do so within just a few weeks via Tokeny’s white-label solution. It also means seamless integration of on-chain finance APIs into businesses’ existing systems. Users will not suffer the high costs and time-consuming development. If HBAR can hold above support and reclaim $0.20, sustained upward momentum could push Hedera’s native token higher. Supply wall hurdles may be at $0.26 and $0.35, the latter having recently signalled a local top.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Tron holds steady, Lightchain AI is quickly gaining ground with its AI-powered vision, raising questions about whether TRX can keep up in an increasingly intelligent blockchain future. Table of Contents Tron’s strengths and challenges Could Lightchain AI overtake Tron’s success? Exciting future for Tron and Lightchain AI Tron ( TRX ) has held its position as a steady performer in the crypto space, but as 2025 unfolds, a new contender is quickly rising through the ranks, Lightchain AI. While Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) continue to battle scalability and market fatigue, Lightchain AI is making headlines with a presale that’s already raised over $19.6 million at a token price of just $0.007125. Investors are drawn to its innovation, strong community support, and early momentum. Unlike legacy chains tied to past cycles, Lightchain AI represents a new generation of blockchain thinking. As it continues to gain traction, many are beginning to question whether Tron can maintain its edge, or if Lightchain AI is poised to take the spotlight in the next bull run. Tron’s strengths and challenges Tron has some strengths with high transaction speeds of up to 2,000 TPS, low transaction fees, and strong footing in the stablecoin transfer market, especially USDT. The delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism allows for enhanced scalability and energy efficiency, making it an appealing platform for developers and businesses. But Tron also has its fair share of challenges. This includes concerns regarding centralization, as a limited number of nodes possess significant control over the network space. Also, the U.S. SEC has sued founder Justin Sun over alleged unregistered securities offerings and market manipulation, raising questions about Tron’s regulatory standing. So, while the Tron’s basic structure is sound and strong, its future also relies on these issues being resolved. Newer blockchain projects with advanced technologies are also competitive threats. Even if TRX is known to be relatively fast, it doesn’t have the AI-driven innovation and deep decentralization that new platforms like Lightchain AI can provide. Furthermore, the absence of significant layer-2 solutions and interoperability advancements could hinder Tron’s future growth. As the blockchain industry continues to evolve, Tron’s ability to adopt and integrate emerging technologies will be critical in maintaining its relevance and market position. You might also like: SOL, Lightchain AI, XRP target new highs in May: Which is the leading option? Could Lightchain AI overtake Tron’s success? Lightchain AI (LCAI) is emerging as a formidable rival to Tron by combining blockchain technology with artificial intelligence, something Tron has yet to incorporate. While Tron emphasizes fast transactions and DeFi solutions, Lightchain AI is designed to optimize decentralized AI computations, creating a more advanced and versatile ecosystem. Its capacity to handle AI workloads efficiently sets it apart from traditional blockchains that focus mainly on financial use cases. As the need for AI-integrated blockchain solutions grows, Lightchain AI has the potential to draw in developers, businesses, and institutional investors seeking real-world AI applications. Tron’s strength lies in its established DeFi ecosystem, but without embracing AI innovation, it may fall behind more adaptable technologies. If Lightchain AI maintains its current momentum, it could surpass Tron in adoption rates and long-term value. Exciting future for Tron and Lightchain AI The future of Tron and Lightchain AI is full of potential, driven by their ability to adapt to evolving blockchain trends and technological breakthroughs. Tron has already made its mark as a high-speed, low-cost network, excelling in DeFi and stablecoin transactions. But to stay ahead, it needs to push boundaries, think AI-driven features or enhanced interoperability that could take its ecosystem to the next level. Lightchain AI, on the other hand, is laser-focused on the future. Built for the next generation of decentralized intelligence, it’s designed to run AI computations directly within its blockchain framework. This unique capability gives it a major edge over traditional networks like Tron. As AI adoption skyrockets, LCAI is well-positioned to lead the way, offering innovative solutions that merge AI and blockchain seamlessly. The big question? Can Tron innovate fast enough to remain relevant in this increasingly AI-powered blockchain landscape, or will LCAI become the new front-runner? One thing’s for sure, the race to the top will be fascinating to watch. For more information on Lightchain AI, visit the website , whitepaper , X , or Telegram .

Our supply estimate is based on bitcoin’s deterministic issuance schedule, which will approach ~20.5 million units by 2030. Digital gold contributes the most to our bear and base cases, while institutional investment contributes the most to our bull case. Nation-state treasuries, corporate treasuries, and Bitcoin’s decentralized financial services contribute relatively little in each case. Price targets in this article rely on assumptions made regarding the total addressable markets (TAMs) and penetration rates discussed below. Bitcoin may fail to reach these price targets if any of the TAMs or penetration rates are not met. Risks and limitations exist that may prevent our forecasts from being realized. In ARK’s Big Ideas 2025 report, we updated our bitcoin price targets for 2030, projecting bear, base, and bull cases of ~$300,000,~$710,000, and ~$1.5 million per bitcoin, respectively, as shown below.

For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. This forecast relies on data that have not been verified, and are subject to numerous criteria, assumptions, risks, and limitations that are inherently uncertain, and there will be variations with real life that could cause substantially different results. The forecast includes assumptions on the future use cases for bitcoin and the levels at which those use cases will contribute to bitcoin’s price appreciation, which are subject to change or revisions over time, that are influenced by ARK’s subjective judgments and biases that heighten the risks and limit the uses of the forecast as a decision-making tool. Given the unpredictable nature of markets and other future events, relying on forecasts is inherently risky. While we believe that there is a sound basis for the forecasts presented, they are provided for illustrative purposes only and no representations are made as to their accuracy. This article unpacks the modeling methodology and assumptions supporting those price targets, including the expected total addressable markets (TAMs) and penetration rates. Price Targets And Assumptions Our price targets are the sum of TAM (Total Addressable Market) contributions at the end of 2030, based on the following formula: Our supply estimate is based on bitcoin’s deterministic issuance schedule, which will approach ~20.5 million units by 2030. Each variable contributes to the price target as follows: Anticipated contributors to capital accrual (primary): Institutional investment, primarily through spot ETFs. Referred to by some as “digital gold,” bitcoin is a nimbler, more transparent store-of-value relative to gold. 1 Emerging market investors seeking a safe haven that can protect them against inflation and devaluation. Anticipated contributors to capital accrual (secondary): Nation-state treasuries, as other countries follow the US with bitcoin strategic reserves. Corporate treasuries, as more companies diversify fiat cash with bitcoin. Bitcoin on-chain financial services, as Bitcoin substitutes for legacy finance. Excluding digital gold, which our model penalizes because it is the most direct, zero-sum competitor to bitcoin, we assume conservatively that the TAM of the contributors listed above (specifically 1, 3, 4, and 5) grows at a compound annual growth rate ((CAGR)) of 3% over the next six years. For the sixth contributor—bitcoin’s on-chain financial services—we assume a 6-year CAGR ranging from 20% to 60%, relative to the value accrued as of year-end 2024, as follows: Finally, we delineate the TAM and penetration rate contributions to the bear, base, and bull price targets, respectively, as follows: Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2025.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon. As shown in the chart above, digital gold contributes the most to our bear and base cases, while institutional investment contributes the most to our bull case. Interestingly, nation-state treasuries, corporate treasuries, and Bitcoin’s decentralized financial services contribute relatively little in each case. In the tables below, we detail our forecasted relative contributions of the six sources of capital accrual to the bear, base, and bull cases, respectively. 1. Potential Contributor To Capital Accrual: Institutional Investment Institutional Investment Projected Total Addressable Market (TAM) Global Market Portfolio Ex Gold (2030) ~$200 trillion Assumed Penetration Rate Bear Case Base Case Bull Case 1% 2.5% 6.5% Contribution To Price Target Bear Case Base Case Bull Case 32.7% 34.3% 43.4% Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2025. This ARK analysis is based on a range of external sources as of December 31, 2024, which may be provided upon request. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon. According to State Street, The Global Market Portfolio 2 is defined as: All investable capital assets corresponding to its market value divided by the sum of the market values of all assets. As the sum of all holdings that result from the collective decisions of investors and issuers, as well as suppliers and demanders of capital, the Global Market Portfolio can be seen as a de facto proxy for the investable opportunity set available to all investors globally. As of 2024, the global portfolio’s TAM, excluding gold’s 3.6% share, is ~$169 trillion. Applying an assumed 3% CAGR results in a value of ~$200 trillion by 2030. We then assume 1% and 2.5% penetration rates for the bear and base cases, respectively, both of which are lower than gold’s 3.6% share today. As a result, the bear and base cases represent conservative views on bitcoin’s adoption. In the more aggressive bull case, we assume that bitcoin penetration hits 6.5%, nearly double gold’s current share. 2. Potential Contributor To Capital Accrual: Digital Gold Digital Gold Total Addressable Market (TAM) Gold Market Cap (2024) ~$18 trillion Assumed Penetration Rate Bear Case Base Case Bull Case 20% 40% 60% Contribution To Price Target Bear Case Base Case Bull Case 57.8% 48.6% 35.5% Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2025.

For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon. The contribution of digital gold assumes a TAM relative to gold’s current market capitalization. Given our aggressive penetration rate, we penalize gold’s expected TAM in 2030 by assuming no growth. In our view, bitcoin as digital gold is an appealing narrative and will drive penetration. 3. Potential Contributor To Capital Accrual: Emerging Market Safe Haven Emerging Market Safe Haven Projected Total Addressable Market (TAM) M2 3 Monetary Base of Emerging Markets (2030) ~$68 trillion Assumed Penetration Rate Bear Case Base Case Bull Case 0.5% 2.5% 6% Contribution To Price Target Bear Case Base Case Bull Case 5.5% 11.5% 13.5% Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2025. This ARK analysis is based on a range of external sources as of December 31, 2024, which may be provided upon request. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency.

The Emerging Market Safe Haven TAM is based on the monetary base of all developing nations—also known as “non-advanced” economies according to the IMF/CIA definition. 4 In our view, this bitcoin use case has the greatest potential for capital accrual. In addition to its store-of-value characteristics, bitcoin’s low barriers to entry provide individuals with internet connections in emerging markets access to an investment alternative that may provide capital appreciation over time—as opposed to defensive allocations like the US dollar—to preserve purchasing power and avoid the devaluations of their own national currencies. 4.

Forecasts are inherently limited and cannot be relied upon. Bitcoin's native financial services are an emerging contributor to capital accrual. Among prominent examples, layer 2s 6 like the Lightning Network are dedicated to scaling bitcoin’s transaction capacity, while Wrapped BTC (WBTC) on the Ethereum network enables bitcoin to participate in decentralized finance. Such on-chain financial services are becoming increasingly important features of the bitcoin ecosystem. As a result, we believe a baseline CAGR of 40% is a realistic expectation between now and 2030. ARK’s Assumptions Applied to Active Bitcoin Supply Although not included in ARK’s Big Ideas 2025 report, other experimental modeling methods estimate bitcoin’s price in 2030. One technique is to leverage bitcoin’s on-chain transparency to estimate bitcoin’s liquid supply—which we call “active” supply—by discounting lost or long-held coins. Based on this methodology, active supply can be calculated by multiplying bitcoin’s expected supply in 2030 by the “liveliness” metric that measures the amount of bitcoin that has moved over time, from 0% to 100%—in other words, the true “float” of the asset, as shown below. Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2025, based on data from Glassnode as of December 31, 2024. For informational purposes only and should not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any particular security or cryptocurrency. As the chart depicts, bitcoin’s network liveliness has remained near ~60% since early 2018. In our view, that magnitude of liveliness suggests that ~40% of supply is “vaulted”—a concept we explore in-depth in the ARK whitepaper Cointime Economics: A New Framework for Bitcoin On-Chain Analysis . We then apply our same bear- and base-case TAMs and penetration rates to a projected active supply of 60% by 2030—assuming stable liveliness over time—as follows: On that basis, we arrive at the following price targets, which are roughly 40% higher than our base model, which does not account for bitcoin active supply and network liveliness: Source: ARK Investment Management LLC, 2025.

This forecast relies on data that have not been verified, and are subject to numerous criteria, assumptions, risks, and limitations that are inherently uncertain, and there will be variations with real life that could cause substantially different results. The forecast includes assumptions on the future use cases for bitcoin and the levels at which those use cases will contribute to bitcoin’s price appreciation, which are subject to change or revisions over time, that are influenced by ARK’s subjective judgments and biases that heighten the risks and limit the uses of the forecast as a decision-making tool. Given the unpredictable nature of markets and other future events, relying on forecasts is inherently risky. While we believe that there is a sound basis for the forecasts presented, they are provided for illustrative purposes only and no representations are made as to their accuracy. Importantly, the estimates constructed with this more experimental methodology are more aggressive than those in our bear, base, and bull cases. With a more conservative bias, our official price targets focus only on total bitcoin supply. That said, we also believe that this more experimental exercise highlights that bitcoin’s scarcity and lost supply are not reflected in most valuation models today. Important Information The forecasts and price estimates herein are subject to revision by ARK Invest (“ARK”) and provided solely as a guide to current expectations. Forecasts regarding broad markets and bitcoin are not, and are not intended to be, representative of any ARK-managed investment product or the characteristics of any ARK portfolio. FORECASTS ARE HYPOTHETICAL AND HIGHLY SPECULATIVE, AND PRESENT MANY RISKS AND LIMITATIONS. While ARK believes that there is a sound basis for the forecasts presented, they are provided for illustrative purposes only and no representations are made as to their accuracy. The recipient is urged to use extreme caution when considering the forecasts, as they are inherently subjective and reflect ARK’s inherent bias toward positive expected results. Any positive results should be viewed as a measure of the relative risk of bitcoin, with higher forecasts generally reflecting greater risk. There is no guarantee that any results will align with the forecasts, and they might not be predictive. Some or all results may be substantially lower than projected results. The forecast has not been achieved by bitcoin, and like all modeled, projected, or hypothetical information, it is important to note that there are multiple versions of a model, and ARK has a conflict of interest in that we have an incentive to show you the best performing results. These forecasts rely on models, which have several inherent limitations, including: 1) reliance on a variety of data obtained from sources that are believed to be reliable, but might be incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete and ARK does not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information obtained from any third party, 2) potential inclusion of inherent model creation biases, data discrepancies and/or calculation errors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, and 3) NO reflection of the impact that material economic and market factors might have had and do not involve market risk. The forecasts rely on assumptions, forecasts, estimates, modeling, algorithms and other data input by ARK, some of which relies on third-parties, that could be or prove over time to be incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete. The forecasts are based on a variety of criteria and assumptions, which might vary substantially, and involve significant elements of subjective judgment and analysis that reflect our own expectations and biases, which might prove invalid or change without notice. It is possible that other foreseeable events that were not taken into account could occur. The forecasts contained herein represent the application of the simulation models as currently in effect on the date first written above, and there can be no assurance that the models will remain the same in the future or that an application of the current models in the future will produce similar results because the relevant market and economic conditions that prevailed during the period will not necessarily occur. The results will not be updated as the models change, or any information upon which they rely changes. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to bitcoin specifically that cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of forecasts, all of which can adversely affect actual results. For these reasons, forecasted results will differ, and could differ significantly from actual results. FORECASTS ARE PRESENTED FOR ILLUSTRATIVE PURPOSES ONLY. Bitcoin is subject to rapid price swings, including as a result of actions and statements by influencers and the media, changes in the supply of and demand for bitcoin, and other factors. There is no assurance that bitcoin will maintain or increase its value over the long term. Bitcoin is largely unregulated and bitcoin investments may be more susceptible to fraud and manipulation than more regulated investments. Bitcoin is subject to unique and substantial risks, including significant price volatility and lack of liquidity, and theft. 1 The term “digital gold” is only meant to compare bitcoin to gold as a store-of-value.

Some Analysts Favor MUTM Over Stalling Meme Coins,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/best-crypto-to-buy-now-some-analysts-favor-mutm-over-stalling-meme-coins/,"The post Best Crypto to Buy Now? Some Analysts Favor MUTM Over Stalling Meme Coins appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News When major holders begin shifting their stakes, it often signals a turning point in the market. These whales, having captured significant gains from crowded trades, are now exploring fresh opportunities. One project attracting their attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), hailed by some analysts as the best crypto to buy now thanks to its tangible utility and revenue-driven tokenomics. Several high-net-worth wallets have quietly taken profits and redeployed capital into new protocols offering real yield. In an environment where meme coins have plateaued, large players are asking what cryptocurrency to invest in next. Their focus has moved toward platforms delivering real-world financial services—like lending, borrowing, and stablecoin minting—instead of purely speculative tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is built on a non-custodial framework that gives users full control over their assets. Depositors supply stablecoins—such as USDC or DAI—to earn a dynamic APY, while borrowers lock collateral to access liquidity without selling holdings. When you deposit, you receive mtTokens, which grow in value as the protocol allocates a portion of its fees to buy back MUTM and distribute it to participants. In contrast to meme-driven tokens with unpredictable supply sinks, MUTM’s buyback mechanism ties demand directly to usage. As more users borrow and lend, fee revenue funds ongoing token repurchases. This creates a steady buying pressure, setting the stage for long-term crypto investment that isn’t reliant on social media hype. Mutuum’s lending suite offers two modes. In the pool-based system, users deposit assets like ETH or USDC into smart-contract pools. Lenders earn an APY that adjusts with demand—single digits when utilization is low and mid-teens when borrowing spikes. Under the peer-to-peer model, individuals can negotiate terms directly for less common tokens. For example, an investor holding LINK could agree to lend it at 12% APY with a 75% LTV, tapping liquidity without relinquishing exposure to price gains. Consider borrowing against Ethereum as an example. With ETH trading around $1,800, locking in 2 ETH (worth $3,600) lets you borrow up to 75%—about $2,700 in stablecoins. This setup protects lenders with ample overcollateralization while letting borrowers keep potential upside on their ETH holdings. Currently, MUTM is in its presale phase at $0.025, its lowest available price. Eleven scheduled rounds will incrementally raise the token cost, and more than half of the current phase has already sold to over 9,000 holders. Early investors secure a 140% gain upon listing at the fixed launch price of $0.06—an opportunity that won’t last long. Analysts foresee further gains after exchange listings. Projections suggest MUTM could climb into the $2–$4 range within months, implying 80x–160x returns from today’s level. To illustrate, a $2,000 investment at the presale price could expand to $160,000–$320,000 when MUTM hits $4. Such figures are grounded in the protocol’s roadmap: growing lending volume, a forthcoming overcollateralized stablecoin, and continuous buybacks. Community incentives reinforce this momentum. A live dashboard features a top-50 holder leaderboard, awarding bonus MUTM to those who retain their rank. This gamified element encourages ongoing engagement and keeps MUTM visible across social channels and crypto charts. Mutuum’s stablecoin will be minted algorithmically when users deposit collateral above a set threshold and burned upon repayment or liquidation, preserving its peg to the US dollar. Interest from stablecoin loans flows directly into the treasury, adding another revenue stream for token repurchases. This integrated approach to product development is rare among low-cap cryptocurrencies, making MUTM a compelling crypto investment for those seeking real utility. As whales reposition their holdings, investing in platforms with genuine earnings potential has become a priority. Mutuum Finance’s blend of transparent mechanics, tangible use cases, and a ground-floor presale price positions it as a leading contender among the next big crypto projects. For anyone mapping out crypto predictions this cycle, MUTM offers a clear answer to what crypto to buy today, combining measurable utility with explosive upside potential.

Long live Neo. The original Neo blockchain, named Neo Legacy following its replacement by Neo N3, is officially being powered down in October. It leaves behind a fitting legacy, as the blockchain that’s credited with kickstarting China’s love for smart contract chains and tokenization. Famously once billed as the “Chinese Ethereum,” Neo began life as AntShares before rebranding to Neo .Now, it’s time to say goodbye to Neo Legacy, which has outlived its usefulness and been replaced by better tech. As the Neo team formally prepares to sunset the blockchain that’s been running strong for eight years, it’s taken the time to acknowledge the benchmarks and milestones that tell the Legacy chain’s history. Neo Team Hits the Kill Switch The idea of obsoleting a blockchain feels strange since decentralized networks by their nature are meant to live forever – or at least until the last node operator unplugs. In the case of Neo, the name and the network isn’t being killed stone dead: it’s already been replaced by Neo N3 , and the shutdown of Neo Legacy is merely a formal note to remaining devs and users to move operations to the chain’s successor if they haven’t already.The Legacy testnet is poised to close on June 1, before the Legacy mainnet follows suit on October 31. Prior to this, a final snapshot of the network will be taken. This can be thought of as a time capsule, or perhaps a cryogenically preserved image of the Legacy chain in its final state. This isn’t being done just for posterity, incidentally: the eight years of blockchain data that the network has accrued continue to have value in attesting to various events that occurred onchain, and thus there is an economic and historical imperative to preserve this data. Nostalgia for Neo In its announcement confirming the legacy chain’s closure, the Neo team took time out to highlight the data points that attest to its impressive benchmarks. During its lifespan, the chain has produced over 14 million blocks, processed over 281 million transactions, and prompted the creation of nearly 3 million addresses. More poignantly, its team adds that “It's where many Neo developers began their journey and brought their dreams to life.” But those dreams haven’t been put on pause: they’ve merely moved to Neo N3, which launched in 2021 as the next-gen successor to Neo Legacy. With developers and users having known for years that the Legacy chain was poised to be wound down, the official closure date won’t come as a shock. But it’ll nevertheless give crypto OGs a few feels as they think back to Neo’s remarkable run during the 2017 bull run, and the associated highs and lows that followed on a network that captured the industry’s imagination, not just in Asia, but around the world. So long Neo Legacy and thanks for the memories. Now it’s over to Neo N3 and its EVM sidechain Neo X for more of the same. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

On Tuesday, the White House announced plans to rescind duties on foreign-made parts used in US automobile manufacturing, which could provide relief to the auto sector. Still, a Reuters poll of economists shows that the majority believe the global economy is at high risk of recession in 2025. Many of the respondents see tariffs and trade disruptions as contributors to weakening business sentiment and slowing growth. Some analysts are hopeful of a positive market correction. “ Longer-term structural tailwinds for gold prices are likely to keep the broader upward trend intact ,” said Yeap Jun Rong, a strategist at IG. Seven days of US economic data Markets are preparing for a flood of US economic data, beginning with job openings and employment figures due later today. Investors will also be watching Wednesday’s release of the ADP private payroll survey, which is expected to show a decline in job creation to 124,000 in April from 155,000 in March. The first estimate of the first-quarter gross domestic product is also due tomorrow. Forecasts suggest a modest uptick following 2.4% annual growth in the previous quarter. Economists say consumer and business behavior ahead of the April 2 tariff announcements may have distorted the data, as many front-loaded purchases were made before duties took effect. A read on inflation also arrives Wednesday with the release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, closely tracked by the Federal Reserve . The March reading could show minimal movement, with annual inflation ticking down slightly. The week concludes on May 2 with the government’s April non-farm payrolls report. Predictions point to a fall to 130,000 from March’s 228,000. Comerica Bank Chief Economist Bill Adams said Monday that early data suggest the economy may have contracted in the first quarter. “ The labor market probably softened in April, with a lacklustre increase in employment and an uptick in the unemployment rate ,” Adams noted. He also predicted a drop in job vacancies for March and a decline in consumer confidence, in line with other household sentiment surveys. Congress will also return to session and is expected to engage in budget negotiations, priorities given to the 2017 tax cuts extensions. Meanwhile, the public awaits the White House’s decision on immigration, tariffs, and other policy fronts. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The initiative marks a departure from the anti-mining policies of the Biden administration (e.g., it proposed a 30% excise tax on electricity costs for Bitcoin mining operations, known as the Digital Asset Mining Energy DAME tax), aiming to solidify the US’s position as the world’s leading mining hub. The US is already responsible for roughly 75.4 percent of global hashrate (according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance study ), with states like Texas leading due to abundant renewable energy and favorable regulations. The new administration has clear ambitions to increase this proportion. On March 31, 2025, the Department of Commerce established the Investment Accelerator, a one-stop office to help companies navigate federal, state, and local regulations when setting up major projects in the US, including Bitcoin mining operations. The program will help miners build dedicated power plants to power their projects, instead of relying solely on the existing power grid. By simplifying formalities, the Accelerator promises to save months compared to typical infrastructure timelines. Lutnick believes the advantage will attract global investment and drive rapid capacity expansion. The Secretary emphasized that the off-grid model will let miners control the cost of power and bypass congested transmission networks. Lutnick, a long-time Trump confidant and crypto advocate, underscores that this push aligns with the administration’s broader efforts to treat Bitcoin as a strategic commodity, akin to gold or oil, and to position America at the forefront of digital-asset innovation. With the US already accounting for more than three-quarters of the network’s hashing power, further capacity growth under the new framework could solidify American dominance at an unprecedented level. Environmentalists who often cite Bitcoin’s ecological impact can rest easy. The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance’s new “Cambridge Digital Mining Industry Report” reveals that sustainable energy use in Bitcoin mining jumped to 52.4% in 2025 – up from 37.6% in 2022 – led by 42.6% renewables and 9.8% nuclear, while natural gas has overtaken coal as the principal power source (38.2% vs 8.9%) – all improving the sector’s environmental footprint.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-29 11:51:35

This massive capital influx shows institutions are piling back into crypto, with BlackRock’s IBIT fund alone pulling in nearly $1.5 billion. Bitcoin has climbed steadily to $95,000 amid this buying spree, delivering its strongest weekly performance since the post-election rally. And it’s not just Blackrock’s ETF which is benefitting from Bitcoin’s brilliant performance of late, but ARK’s Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), which pulled in over $620 million, while Fidelity’s FBTC fund added some $574 million. Above : CoinMarketCap Given the volatility afflicting traditional financial markets right now, Bitcoin is proving remarkably resilient, reigniting conversations about whether it can behave somewhat like gold. “Net spot ETF inflows, which are a barometer of institutional interest in Bitcoin, have ramped up,” Simon Peters of eToro told Bloomberg . “With gold at record highs, could investors also be seeing Bitcoin, dubbed as ‘digital-gold’ due to its similar scarcity characteristics, as a potential safe haven?” ETF buying surge signals major market shift Bitcoin’s current price will look extremely modest if institutional in-flows are maintained, which have exceeded the expectations of even bullish analysts. For example, Michael Saylor of Strategy predicts that BlackRock’s IBIT fund will be the largest ETF in the world in the next 10 years.

BTC fundamentals have turned bullish, not a bad setup to break all time highs. I took a break from X to enjoy the NZ summer but every week I put out a series of analysis to my subscribers (this is a hobby, NOT a long term project). Thought I'd post this update publicly. — Willy Woo (@woonomic) April 27, 2025 As Bitcoin rides this ETF wave higher, the smart money isn’t just heading into Bitcoin—it’s hunting for the next big winners that could deliver even more explosive gains. With billions flooding into crypto, these three projects look like the best crypto to buy while Bitcoin ETFs drive this market-wide revival: Bitcoin Pepe: Unlocking Bitcoin for meme traders Bitcoin Pepe bridges two powerful forces in crypto—Bitcoin’s $2 trillion market cap and the explosive growth potential of meme coins. While Bitcoin ETFs push BTC higher, its slow transaction speed has kept it out of the viral meme market—a problem Bitcoin Pepe solves completely. The PEP-20 token standard creates what traders call “Solana on Bitcoin”—combining institutional-grade security with the speed needed for meme trading. Think of it as connecting two massive but separate pools of capital. At $0.031 in stage 9, BPEP represents early access to what could become the primary gateway between Bitcoin’s massive liquidity and the high-octane meme sector. As ETF billions drive Bitcoin higher, Bitcoin Pepe stands ready to channel that momentum into the most dynamic corner of crypto. CartelFi: Earning yield without selling memes CartelFi fixes arguably meme coins’ greatest problem of all—they sit idle in wallets, generating zero returns while holders wait for major price action. Instead of forcing traders to sell their potential moonshots, CartelFi lets them earn substantial returns while keeping full price exposure. Through specialized liquidity pools built specifically for viral tokens, meme holders can deposit their assets and start earning immediately. Meanwhile, up to 50% of all platform fees automatically buy and burn CARTFI tokens, creating steady buying pressure as users grow. Priced at $0.0389, CARTFI stands out as the best crypto to buy for investors seeking both meme coin moons and consistent long-term yields. As this ETF-fueled rally brings fresh attention to crypto, platforms turning speculative assets into productive ones capture value from both worlds. PepeX: Democratizing crypto innovation PepeX eliminates the gatekeepers between ideas and funding. In a nutshell, the platform lets anyone launch a project as a tradable token in minutes, while its built-in AI marketing tools handle growth organically—something previously available only to well-connected founders. What makes PepeX unique is its founder-friendly yet investor-protective system. The innovative token distribution grants just 5% to project creators while 95% goes to the community. This structure keeps founders honest and focused on long-term success rather than quick profits. At $0.0243 after raising $1.6m, PEPX offers ownership in crypto’s answer to NASDAQ—the infrastructure powering the next generation of projects. Why these three projects could outshine Bitcoin The $3.2 billion ETF tsunami marks a turning point for crypto markets. While institutional money drives Bitcoin higher, the real opportunity for retail investors lies in projects solving fundamental problems in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin Pepe capitalizes on the speed gap between Bitcoin’s security and meme trading needs. CartelFi transforms dormant meme holdings into yield-generating assets. PepeX breaks down barriers between innovators and funding sources. Each targets a specific friction point that becomes more valuable as the market expands. These aren’t just random altcoins hoping to ride Bitcoin’s coattails. They’re infrastructure plays positioned exactly where fresh capital will need solutions. For investors looking beyond the obvious Bitcoin ETF story, these projects represent the best crypto to buy during this exciting market transition.",Information,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-29 11:53:40

Besides, the platform is about to experience one of the biggest unlocks, which is expected to kick off volatility. Many believe that the SUI is displaying a similar intensity to that Solana displayed just before the 2021 bull run. If things go in its favor, the SUI price appears to be at the foot of a massive explosion that may elevate the levels to a double-digit figure. The crypto space is expected to witness a couple of token unlocks this week , which are expected to shake the entire market. One of the popular memecoins, TRUMP, is expected to witness an unlock of $7.35 million worth of tokens per day this week, while SUI has the largest. The foundation is about to unlock nearly $200 million worth of tokens. A huge number of tokens are expected to flood the market, due to which the volatility is expected to increase. Now that the SUI price has been facing equal bullish and bearish pressures for the past few days, here’s what’s next for the popular crypto. The weekly chart of SUI flashes massive bullish signals as the token is about to begin the third phase of its bull run. The price has displayed a similar price action in early 2024 and also at the end of the year. Interestingly, the price has broken out of the falling wedge, and if it repeats the previous action, the SUI price is expected to go 4x or 5x rally to mark a new ATH. Besides, the weekly MACD, which displays a drop in the selling pressure, is about to undergo a bullish crossover. This substantiates a bullish claim, as the SUI price is displaying a similar pullback as it did before triggering a rise to a new ATH at around $5.32. The current trade setup suggests the price may rise above $4 in a short while, probably soon after the token unlock, which may attract significant bearish action, dragging the price close to $3. However, the rebound that could follow may initiate a fresh bull run towards a new ATH, somewhere above $7.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-29 11:57:07

Through a partnership with payments platform Nuvei and stablecoin issuers Circle and Paxos, the payments giant will now allow merchants across its massive global network to accept payments in stablecoins. The announcement, made on April 28, marks a crucial turning point in integrating blockchain-powered money into the traditional payments ecosystem. The collaboration means that over 150 million merchants in Mastercard’s network can now opt to receive their payments in stablecoins like USDC and USDP, regardless of the customer’s original payment method. Whether a shopper uses fiat, crypto, or a card linked to their digital wallet, merchants have the flexibility to settle in digital dollars—minimizing volatility and simplifying cross-border transactions. Mastercard’s Chief Product Officer, Jorn Lambert, framed the initiative as part of a “360-degree approach” to bridge crypto and commerce. “The mainstream use cases are clear,” Lambert said, emphasizing the need to make it seamless for both consumers and merchants to transact using stablecoins. A Crypto Card for the Masses To further expand its footprint in the crypto space, Mastercard has teamed up with crypto exchange OKX to launch the OKX Card, a new crypto-enabled payment card designed to give users direct access to their digital funds. The card allows consumers to spend stablecoins effortlessly, integrating crypto into daily purchases with traditional payment convenience. Haider Rafique, OKX’s Chief Marketing Officer, hailed the partnership as a “significant step” toward embedding stablecoins in real-world payments. The move is also part of Mastercard’s larger effort to normalize crypto usage, building on past collaborations with exchanges like Binance, Kraken, and Crypto.com to launch crypto debit cards. And the momentum doesn’t stop there. On the same day, wallet provider MetaMask also joined forces with Mastercard to unveil a card that lets users spend self-custodied crypto using smart contracts—bringing near-instant processing speeds to point-of-sale transactions. Stablecoin Market on the Rise The backdrop for Mastercard’s aggressive expansion into stablecoins is a rapidly growing market. According to Artemis and Dune, active stablecoin wallets have surged over 50% in the last year. Meanwhile, the overall stablecoin market has ballooned to $230 billion—up 54% year-over-year—with Tether and USDC capturing 90% of that share. Citigroup recently forecasted that the stablecoin market could reach a staggering $3.7 trillion by 2030, driven by increased regulatory clarity and institutional support.

Trump’s trade war with the entire world has had the largest short-term impact on crypto markets, as crypto prices have wavered amid macroeconomic worry and uncertainty. Higher prices on electronics mean Bitcoin ( BTC ) miners are finding it harder to break even, and de-dollarization concerns abound. Still, crypto markets have shown some resilience and cause for optimism in the administration’s crypto-friendly policies. A number of pro-crypto leaders have been appointed to key government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The crypto industry’s long-awaited regulatory framework is also imminent. Trump’s first 100 days have seen remarkable changes for the crypto industry, and it appears that things are only getting started. Here’s a look at what’s happened so far. Jan. 20 — Trump’s first 100 days kick off with a memecoin On Jan. 20, while Trump was sworn into office in the rotunda of the Capitol Building, his family’s crypto investment firm, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), launched its second token sale of WLFI tokens. Massive demand saw prices initially spike, though the true value of the tokens, if any, is yet to be determined, as WLFI is currently not transferable and cannot be traded on any exchanges. The memecoin served as a kickoff for Trump’s crypto agenda, which has seen unprecedented support for the industry in Washington, DC, along with a slew of moral and ethical concerns among observers and lawmakers. Related: Trump’s WLFI crypto investments aren’t paying off Jan. 20 — Pro-crypto leaders head up federal agencies on “day one” The president of the US sets the tone for several federal regulators, including those overseeing crypto. Trump immediately set out to appoint a number of pro-crypto lawyers and businessmen to head up the SEC, the CFTC and other critical federal agencies. Trump nominated businessman Paul Atkins to lead the SEC on “day one” of his presidency. Atkins would replace Gary Gensler, who was perceived by many in the crypto industry as an enemy to adoption and the industry’s progress. Also on day one, Trump appointed businessman and crypto investor David Sacks as chair of the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology — or the crypto and AI “czar.” Atkins wouldn’t be confirmed by the Senate until April 9 and sworn in on April 21. But in the meantime, Trump also tapped former CFTC Commissioner and crypto proponent Brian Quintenz to head up that agency. Jan. 21 — $500-billion Stargate AI initiative In a press conference, Trump announced a $500-billion private-led AI infrastructure investment called “Stargate.” The president claimed the project — led by ChatGPT creator OpenAI, SoftBank and Oracle — would create some 10,000 American jobs. Trump said the US needed to lead the world in AI innovation and keep development onshore. “China is a competitor, others are competitors. We want it to be in this country, and we’re making it available,” he said. OpenAI claimed that the project would “not only support the re-industrialization of the United States but also provide a strategic capability to protect the national security of America and its allies.” Jan. 21 — Pardon for Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht Trump announced on Truth Social that he had called the family of Silk Road 2.0 founder Ross Ulbricht after commuting his sentence. After his arrest in 2013, Ulbricht was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 without the possibility of parole for his role in facilitating the trafficking of narcotics and other illicit substances. Ulbricht’s case became a rallying point for libertarian movements and prison reform advocates alike. Libertarian-minded crypto advocates supported Ulbricht, as his platform was one of the first places people could actually spend Bitcoin. Crypto advocates supported Ulbricht, with many believing he did nothing wrong. Source: The Bitcoin Historian Freeing Ulbricht was one of the many campaign promises Trump made to the crypto community . Jan. 23 — Ban on digital dollar, establishing a crypto working group With an executive order, Trump established an internal working group to focus on making the US “the world capital in crypto.” The order also prohibited “the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use” of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC). CBDCs are a contentious issue in the crypto community, with many privacy activists claiming that they are another form of state surveillance and government control. Enthusiasm over their creation from central bankers has further set the more libertarian-minded crypto community against their creation. Trump signing the executive order.

Feb. 1 — Trade war begins with tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada One of the promises of the Trump campaign was to rectify the “bad deals” that the US had with many of its oldest allies and most important trading partners. Just over a week after he was sworn into office, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, citing border security concerns and the supposed proliferation of cross-border trade of fentanyl from those countries. The same day, Canada announced retaliatory measures. On Feb. 3, Mexico promised to step up security of its northern border, responding to American requests for increased patrols. This led Trump to reverse initial tariff plans on both countries. The unexpected hostile tariffs from a close partner and ally sent stock and crypto prices tumbling. They marked the beginning of the macroeconomic uncertainty that has come to characterize the early days of the Trump administration. Feb. 12 — Vinnik-Foegel prisoner swap with Russia Alexander Vinnik, the convicted money launderer who funneled Bitcoin stolen in the infamous Mt. Gox hack through his crypto exchange BTC-e, returned to his home country of Russia . Vinnik pled guilty to money laundering conspiracy charges in 2024. BTC-e processed more than $9 billion in transactions and had over 1 million users worldwide, many of whom were in the US. Vinnik was exchanged for American schoolteacher Marc Fogel, who was teaching at the Anglo-American School of Moscow and had been in a Russian jail since 2021 after being arrested for illegal possession of cannabis. Feb. 18 — Bankman-Fried makes veiled plea for release In an interview with The New York Sun, the former CEO of now-defunct crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, addressed his controversial political contributions , saying the Republican Party was always “far more reasonable.” Bankman-Fried, or SBF, made widely publicized contributions to the Democratic Party as he purportedly tried to influence democratic policymakers’ approach to the digital asset industry. It later became known that SBF was playing both sides of the aisle, donating significant funds to Republicans, though the exact amount remains unknown. In the interview, SBF likened his position to that of Trump, claiming that he’d been unfairly treated by the criminal justice system. SBF called into question the conduct of the federal judge overseeing his trial, Judge Lewis Kaplan. “I know President Trump had a lot of frustrations with Judge Kaplan. I certainly did as well.” Observers saw the interview as an attempt to elicit a pardon from Trump. Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin advocate facing criminal tax evasion charges, has made an outright appeal . March 7 — Trump establishes Bitcoin reserve and crypto stockpile On March 7, the 46th day of Trump’s presidency, he signed an executive order establishing a “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.” Trump made big promises about crypto adoption on the campaign trail, including the possibility of a long-sought-after Bitcoin reserve. The US reserve, however, would fall short of expectations among Bitcoin maximalists. Rather than create a concrete plan for the US government to purchase and hold Bitcoin, it merely created a single reserve to pool all Bitcoin the government had seized during criminal proceedings. While the order does state that the government may purchase additional Bitcoin, it must do so in a budget-neutral fashion. In tandem with the Bitcoin reserve, Trump also established a US Digital Asset Stockpile containing other cryptocurrencies such as Ether ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), XRP ( XRP ) and Cardano ( ADA ). March 7 — White House Crypto Summit Leaders of the crypto industry descended on Washington for a meeting at the White House to discuss a wide range of topics related to crypto regulation and the development of the industry in the US. Attendees included Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and “crypto czar” David Sacks. While some attendees, including Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov, were optimistic about the event’s focus on strengthening the US crypto industry, some crypto luminaries who were not on the list were less impressed. Cardano and IOHK co-founder Charles Hoskinson, who did not attend the event, noted in a video stream that real change — i.e., legislation — must be made in Congress. “Everybody focuses on the White House because it’s simple and easy to do so. [...] And as much as we, as an industry, want this to be a short process, it’s going to be a long and methodical process,” Hoskinson said. Others put it more simply: Source: George Mandrik March 25 — WLFI goes stablecoin WLFI expanded its offerings in March with the soft launch of its stablecoin USD1. The coin, “100% backed by short-term US government treasuries, US dollar deposits, and other cash equivalents,” launched on the Ethereum and BNB Chain networks. News of the token’s launch came just days after WLFI secured more than $500 million by selling its own WLFI tokens. US lawmakers subsequently called for an ethics probe into WLFI and cited the president’s ability to influence stablecoin policy as a major conflict of interest with the project. Related: Atkins becomes next SEC chair: What’s next for the crypto industry April 2 — Liberation Day Doubling down on his belligerent trade policy, Trump levies tariffs on all US trade partners on what he dubs “Liberation Day.” At a special event at the White House, Trump signed an executive order levying reciprocal tariffs on every country with a tariff on US goods, starting at a 10% minimum. Markets saw a spate of red across the board following the order, and many economic observers raised concerns over a looming recession. Crypto miners based in the US were further squeezed as their operation costs, namely for buying new mining rigs, increased significantly. Former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci told Cointelegraph, “I would say that he’s had the worst 95 days in modern presidential history. The markets recovered a little, but we’ve got $9 trillion taken from the stock market. You had a growing economy that’s now heading into a medium-sized recession, possibly a steep recession.” He said that Trump declared a trade war “without any real weaponry” and subsequently lied about progress when the president claimed China was attempting to negotiate. “The lies are ok — everyone accepts that he’s a congenital liar [...] but when you’re declaring war on people and then you’re lying, it’s really bad.” April 25 — $300,000-per-plate memecoin dinner raises call for impeachment Top Trump memecoin holders were reportedly offered an opportunity to have dinner with the president, sparking renewed concerns over his crypto project and prompting one US lawmaker to support impeachment. At a town hall meeting in his home state of Georgia, Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff said he “strongly” supports impeachment. “When the sitting president of the United States is selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him, there is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense,” he said. TRUMP holders can register to have dinner with the President. Source: gettrumpmemes.com Rumors on social media stated that $300,000 would grant tokenholders an audience with the president, a claim the Trump administration later denied . Trump’s first 100 days could jeopardize change The first 100 days of Trump’s presidency have brought unprecedented change to the crypto industry. Simultaneously, they have opened it up to increased criticism and controversy as the president’s personal ties with blockchain projects raise ethical questions. These controversies may well jeopardize the industry’s efforts to effect change in Congress, according to Scaramucci, who said, “Trump has so inflamed everything that he’s made it even hard for [stablecoin legislation] to happen.” The STABLE Act, which aims to provide guardrails for stablecoin issuance in the US, was introduced in the House of Representatives on March 26 and passed a committee vote on April 3 , with prominent Democrats dissenting. The bill will soon head to the floor for a general vote before going to the Senate. The Senate’s GENIUS Act has recently made headway, passing a vote in the Banking Committee , largely along party lines.

The dashboard offers real-time updates on key protocol metrics, reinforcing Falcon Finance’s commitment to transparency, operational security, and long-term user trust. The transparency dashboard real-time metrics includes: Total Reserves Protocol Backing Ratio Reserves with Third-party Custodians Reserves with Centralised Exchanges On-chain Reserves in Liquidity Pools On-chain Reserves in Staking Pools The reserves breakdown details the distribution of backing assets across third-party custodians, centralized exchanges, liquidity pools and staking pools. Falcon Finance safeguards the majority of its reserves through multi-party computation (MPC) wallets via integrations with Fireblocks and Ceffu. Assets remain securely stored within off-exchange settlement accounts, while trading activities are mirrored on centralized exchanges such as Binance and Bybit. This structure significantly reduces centralized counterparty risk and reinforces Falcon Finance’s focus on asset protection. To support strategy and trade execution, a limited portion of assets is allocated directly to Binance and Bybit. However, the majority of assets remain securely stored within Falcon Finance’s designated custodian accounts, maintaining rigorous standards for risk mitigation and asset integrity. In addition to centralized reserves allocation, Falcon Finance strategically deploys its reserves into on-chain liquidity pools and staking pools to expand its ability to capture yield opportunities without compromising security standards. An important feature of the Transparency Page is the Attestation section, where users can access Falcon Finance’s third-party audit reports and quarterly Proof of Reserves statements. Current reports include audits conducted by Zellic (March 2025) and Pashov Audit Group (February 2025). Falcon Finance has committed to publishing updated third-party Proof of Reserves reports on a quarterly basis, with the next report scheduled for the end of the second quarter. “Falcon Finance is committed to building systems that users can rely on, even in volatile markets. Our Transparency Page is part of our broader effort to ensure security, resilience, and transparency at every level.” said Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner of Falcon Finance. Falcon Finance continues to show strong growth momentum. Since the start of its closed beta phase, the protocol has attracted over 200 million dollars in total value locked. Falcon enables users to mint USDf by depositing a broad range of supported assets, including stablecoins such as USDC and USDT, and non-stablecoin assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and TON. The launch of the Transparency Page marks an important step in providing verifiable assurance that every USDf minted is fully backed by collateral of equal or greater value. About Falcon Finance is a next-generation synthetic dollar protocol designed to provide sustainable and competitive yield generation in all market conditions. Built on institutional-grade risk frameworks with a foundation of transparency, Falcon Finance sets a new benchmark for synthetic assets in decentralized finance.

By the end of 2025, the cryptocurrency might have risen to $200,000, a 65% gain from the Q2 aim and over 110% from its present price, according to this prediction, which implies a possible growth of around 25% from current levels. Bitcoin Surge Amid Rising Term Premium Analyst Geoff Kendrick emphasizes several key factors contributing to this optimistic view on Bitcoin’s price projection, pointing to the US Treasury term premium, which is currently at a 12-year high. According to the analyst, the term premium refers to the additional yield that investors demand for holding longer-dated Treasury bonds compared to shorter-term ones, indicating broader market conditions that could favor Bitcoin as an investment. Related Reading: Dogecoin On Track For $10+ Explosion By October 2025, Says Crypto Pundit In addition to macroeconomic indicators, Kendrick highlights the behavior of major large-cap investors, known as “whales,” These BTC holders have been actively accumulating the asset, a trend that suggests growing confidence in its value. For instance, Bitcoin proxy firm Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), founded by BTC bull Michael Saylor and currently the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency, has recently disclosed on Monday another round of weekly purchases. Potential Sideways Trading Ahead? Another noteworthy trend is the movement of funds into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which Kendrick interprets as a safe-haven reallocation from traditional assets like gold. In his view, this shift reflects a broader sentiment among investors who are increasingly looking at BTC as a viable alternative during uncertain economic times. As of Monday morning, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $95,300, remaining relatively flat for the year but up 51% compared to the same time last year. Related Reading: Justin Sun Bets Big On JUST Token – Here’s Why He Sees 100x Potential Kendrick cautions that historical patterns in Bitcoin’s price action indicate that sharp increases are often followed by extended periods of sideways trading. Conversely, Seeking Alpha analyst Damir Tokic offers a more cautious perspective on Bitcoin’s future trajectory. He notes that BTC could continue to decline alongside the Nasdaq 100 if the market selloff accelerates and investor sentiment deteriorates. However, he also acknowledges the potential for Bitcoin to solidify its position as a safe-haven asset, particularly if the US dollar continues to depreciate. When writing, BTC retraced below the $95,000 mark toward $94,560, still up 1.1% in the 24 hour time frame. Ethereum (ETH), however, has outperformed BTC’s price action with a nearly 14% surge in the weekly time frame, compared to Bitcoin’s 7.3% surge in the same time frame. Other major altcoins like XRP and Solana (SOL), have also seen notable price recoveries, recording gains of 10% and 6% in the weekly time frame.

Price Reacts!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/altcoin-founder-who-caused-7-billion-in-losses-sentenced-to-20-years-in-prison-price-reacts/,"The crypto winter was tough for both the crypto industry and investors. At that time, many companies went bankrupt one after another, and one of them was the crypto lending platform Celsius, which went bankrupt in 2022. Celsius founder and former CEO Alex Mashinsky, who was investigated for his crimes at Celsius, confessed in December 2024. He now faces a potential 20-year prison sentence. According to Coindesk, a 20-year prison sentence was sought for Alex Mashinsky for organizing a fraud that resulted in customer losses of approximately $7 billion. US prosecutors found Mashinsky guilty of deliberately misleading customers about the security of their deposits by manipulating the CEL token for his personal gain and asked the court to impose a 20-year prison sentence. “Celsius took out unsecured loans, made risky trades, and secretly manipulated the price of the CEL token using customer assets, all while publicly assuring customers that their funds were safe. Therefore, the Court should sentence Alexander Mashinsky to twenty years in prison as a just punishment for his years-long campaign of lies and profiteering that resulted in billions of dollars in losses and thousands of victimized customers.” They also added that although Mashinsky told clients he was “HODLing” with them, on the contrary, he personally sold $48 million worth of CELs at inflated prices. Despite the founder being charged with a hefty fine, CEL’s price has surprisingly surged by over 80% and is currently trading at $0.15. Still, the token is far from its former glory. CEL’s all-time high was $8.02 on June 4, 2021, meaning it has fallen over 98% from that level. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts now predict further upside, with price targets between $2 and $5. Outperforming the Elite Over the past 24 hours, many major cryptocurrencies have consolidated near their April 28 price levels or posted minor losses. One low-cap altcoin that stood out with a significant surge is Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL). Several hours ago, its valuation briefly climbed above $1.50, the highest level in more than two months. It later slightly retraced to the current $1.45 (representing a 15% rise on a daily scale). VIRTUAL’s market capitalization neared the $1 billion mark, thus positioning it as the 94th-largest cryptocurrency. VIRTUAL Price, Source: CoinGecko Perhaps the most evident factor igniting the asset’s rally is the support from Binance.US. The American subsidiary of the world’s biggest crypto exchange allowed deposits for VIRTUAL and introduced the VIRTUAL/USDT trading pair. Listing on major platforms typically leads to increased accessibility, boosted credibility, and higher liquidity for the involved cryptocurrencies, hence the price uptrend.

Earlier this month, Virtuals Protocol initiated the Genesis Launch – a token distribution mechanism for AI agents within its ecosystem. Shortly after , though , a project named PlayGameAI allegedly exploited the system by taking advantage of loopholes, deceiving users, and undermining trust. On April 28, Virtuals Protocol promised a compensation plan for affected participants. In a subsequent post on X, the entity revealed that all users who engaged with the project have been fully refunded . The only exception is three wallets that “did not bid for points but transferred VIRTUAL directly to PlayGameAI.” Virtuals Protocol is a decentralized platform that allows people to create, monetize, and co-own tokenized AI agents. The ecosystem is powered by VIRTUAL, which serves numerous functions. For instance, it is employed for transactions and governance decisions. The token saw the light of day at the end of 2023. It reached an all-time high of over $4.50 at the beginning of this year when its market capitalization exploded beyond $4.5 billion. Price Forecasts VIRTUAL’s latest rally caught the eye of many analysts who think there’s more room for growth. The X user 0xCB set $1.50 as a “breakout confirmation” and $3 as the “last barrier before $5 ATH retest.” “If BTC stays above $100K, new ATH is incoming unless force majeure hits (e.g., wars),” the analyst added. It is important to note that the largest cryptocurrency currently trades at around $95K and the last time it crossed $100,000 was in February this year. Degen Ape Trader also chipped in. The X user foresees “much higher” levels in the long term, predicting a rise to $2 after the breakout of $1.30.

The world’s first spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) is off to an impressive start in the first days of its launch, posting double-digit gains. Listed under the ticker XRPH11 on Brazil’s B3 stock exchange, the XRP HASH CI ETF ended the April 28 session trading at R$22.10 ($3.98), up over 1.22% for the day and has climbed 10.50% since going live on April 25. The standout performance followed a massive late-session surge, with the ETF spiking sharply from R$19.87 ($3.58) to R$22.10 ($3.98) in the final hour of trading. XRPH11 all-time price chart. Source: TradingView The ETF is issued by Hashdex, a Brazilian crypto asset manager that has previously launched similar funds for Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). XRPH11 offers direct exposure to the price of XRP, serving as a key entry point for institutional investors. XRP’s modest gains It’s worth noting that the spot ETF has largely mirrored XRP’s price performance over the period. Typically, a spot ETF is viewed as a trigger for a possible price rally. However, in this case, XRP has made only modest gains, a move that can be attributed to the relatively small size of Brazilian markets compared to the United States. In this context, attention has shifted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the possible approval of a similar spot product. A decision is expected later this year. For now, U.S. investors will gain access to an XRP futures ETF after ProShares received regulatory approval to offer the product. With new crypto-friendly leadership at the SEC, expectations are rising that approval of a spot ETF could be just around the corner as whales move massive assets amid growing hype. XRP price analysis As of press time, XRP was trading at $2.29, down almost 2% on the day but up 8.7% over the past week. XRP one-week price chart.

On Sunday morning, XRP experienced a sudden price spike, which CasiTrades attributes to the resurfacing of an old ETF-related article. The article appeared without a visible date, leading many to treat it as fresh news. According to the analyst, the resulting price action was not indicative of true organic buying pressure, but rather typical of weekend market behavior when liquidity is thinner and volatility can exaggerate price moves. Despite the brief surge, XRP moved above the $2.24 resistance level. CasiTrades pointed out that this resistance has been a major focus for several weeks. During the spike, XRP reached $2.27 but quickly faced strong rejection. As of the latest update, XRP is back retesting the $2.24 area now acting as resistance again. CasiTrades stressed that until XRP can reclaim and successfully close above $2.24, the technical structure remains vulnerable to a move toward deeper support levels. The $2.24 mark remains a critical level for maintaining bullish momentum. A confirmed reclaim above this level would be necessary to validate the continued upward trend . Failure to do so could open the door for a pullback toward lower Fibonacci support zones identified on the chart, including areas around $2.08 and $1.95, and further down toward the $1.87 to $1.85 range. Focus on Clean Technicals Over News Headlines The analyst reminded followers that the weekend session typically presents less reliable trading signals due to thinner market liquidity. Price movements can appear more dramatic in such conditions than during regular weekday trading sessions. Additionally, circulating outdated or misleading headlines can further distort short-term price action. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 CasiTrades stresses the benefit of focusing on clean technical chart patterns rather than reacting to external noise or sudden news events. In the posted chart, key Fibonacci levels were drawn to illustrate major support and resistance areas. Notably, the .382 Fibonacci level around $2.24 has been labeled as “major support” that now functions as resistance following the rejection. Other key levels identified include the .5 retracement at approximately $2.08 and the larger support zone between $1.87 and $1.85. The attached RSI (Relative Strength Index) indicator showed XRP approaching overbought conditions during the spike, suggesting the rally was unsustainable without significant volume or real buying interest. In closing, CasiTrades suggested that a bigger technical picture is forming beyond the immediate weekend volatility. While short-term reactions to headlines may generate temporary price movements, the real focus should remain on whether XRP can reclaim the $2.24 level with strong confirmation. Until that happens, the market structure remains cautiously neutral to slightly bearish, with attention on lower support areas if selling pressure increases.

As meme coins like Pepe Coin experience a surge in popularity, investors are beginning to focus on projects that blend community-driven excitement with real-world utility, and Coldware (COLD) has emerged as a prime example of this transition. Ethereum’s Impact on Meme Coins The recent performance of Ethereum (ETH) has played a key role in the Pepe Coin rally. As Ethereum pushes toward its $2,500 mark, it’s creating a positive sentiment in the broader market. Pepe Coin, being Ethereum-based, benefits from this momentum, with many investors predicting that meme coins tied to Ethereum could see similar price hikes. As Pepe Coin continues to ascend, many investors are now transitioning toward projects that offer greater utility and scalability, such as Coldware. Coldware (COLD) offers a Layer 2 solution for Ethereum and other blockchains, focusing on privacy, scalability, and cost-efficient transactions—making it a top choice for investors seeking to diversify into tokens with real-world utility. Pepe Coin’s Rise Amid Meme Market Sentiment Pepe Coin has experienced a steady rise in popularity, driven by community engagement, memecoin sentiment, and social media buzz. Over the past week, Pepe Coin's price has surged, gaining over 70%, approaching the crucial $0.000010 mark. This growth is indicative of the meme coin’s enduring appeal, as it continues to draw attention within the crypto space. A key factor contributing to Pepe Coin’s surge is its link to Ethereum, a blockchain known for powering the largest DeFi applications. As Ethereum approaches its $2,500 milestone, meme coins like Pepe Coin are expected to see further upside, especially as Ethereum’s growth signals a potential boost for Ethereum-based meme coins. Analysts believe that Pepe Coin could break through resistance levels, including the $0.00001072 level, and could continue its rise, hitting as high as $0.000014, representing a potential increase of 60%. Coldware as the Top Choice for the Future While Pepe Coin continues to ride the wave of meme-based excitement, Coldware (COLD) is emerging as the first choice for investors looking to diversify into projects with utility-driven growth potential. Coldware’s Layer 2 solutions address critical scalability and transaction cost issues in the cryptocurrency space, positioning itself as a project with long-term sustainability. For investors eager to enter the blockchain space, Coldware represents an opportunity to participate in cutting-edge technology that enables low-cost transactions, seamless interoperability, and scalable decentralized finance (DeFi)solutions. As Coldware gains traction in the crypto market, it could attract substantial investment inflows, particularly from users looking for long-term, functional crypto assets that go beyond the fleeting hype of meme coins. Pepe Coin and Coldware: Complementary Assets in a Shifting Market As the market sentiment switches from meme-driven excitement to utility-focused solutions, Pepe Coin and Coldware (COLD) can complement each other. While Pepe Coin continues to thrive on community-driven support, Coldware is setting itself up to attract a new wave of investors and users interested in scalable solutions that enhance DeFi applications. Both tokens could offer significant returns for investors as the cryptocurrency landscape matures. Investors should keep an eye on Coldware’s upcoming developments, which could catalyze a massive surge in interest and adoption in the coming months, particularly as the demand for privacy and scalability in DeFi continues to grow. Conclusion As the market sentiment shifts from meme coin frenzy to utility-driven projects, Coldware (COLD) offers a strong alternative for investors looking to capitalize on long-term potential. Pepe Coin’s current surge highlights the power of community-driven coins, but Coldware’s Layer 2 scalability provides a much-needed solution to the blockchain industry’s scalability problems. Together, these projects reflect the evolution of the crypto market—one that is increasingly looking beyond memes and toward functional, scalable solutions.

Miden closed its $25 million seed rounds led by a16z Crypto, 1kx, and Hack VC, with participation from Finality Capital Partners, Symbolic Capital, P2 Ventures, Delta Fund, MH Ventures, as well as from angel investors, including MakerDAO’s Rune Christensen and EigenLayer’s Sreeram Kannan. Miden is a zero-knowledge (ZK) proof -powered blockchain focused on high scalability through its hybrid consensus mode, which moves transaction execution from the mainnet on “edge devices,” referring to users’ devices. Designed for institutions that value confidentiality, Miden enables applications to execute both public and private transactions with full privacy, according to an April 29 announcement shared with Cointelegraph. Execution on edge devices can help with the “bottlenecks that limit traditional chains,” said Bobbin Threadbare, the co-founder at Miden and former engineer at Meta, adding: “It allows blockchains to scale without relying on supernodes or sacrificing decentralization, while making privacy a built-in feature instead of an afterthought.” The $25 million will be used to fund Miden’s development, and its mainnet launch is slated for the fourth quarter of 2025. Related: Coinbase to launch yield-bearing Bitcoin fund for institutions Miden is “the future of blockchains,” says Polygon Labs’ Nailwal “Miden is what the future of blockchains looks like. With edge execution at its core, it’s not just an upgrade — it’s the blueprint for the final form of blockchain architecture,” according to Sandeep Nailwal, the founder of Polygon Labs. “With ambitions to rival Solana, Sui, and Aptos — and to be the epicenter of crosschain liquidity for Agglayer as a native chain and help grow the Agglayer ecosystem— building independently naturally positions Miden to attract the capital and focus needed to compete at the highest level,” Nailwal added. Miden plans to airdrop around 10% of its native tokens to Polygon ( POL ) tokenholders and stakers to reward its native ecosystem. Related: BlackRock Bitcoin ETF buys $970M in BTC as inflows surge, boost market No existing blockchain is ready for mass adoption: Miden co-founder “The reality is that no existing blockchain is ready for mass adoption,” either lacking privacy, scalability, or Web3-native principles such as censorship resistance, according to Miden’s Threadbare. However, Miden’s infrastructure may be a “catalyst for large institutional adoption,” he claimed, adding: “The reality is that up until this point, blockchains have not been in the position to offer privacy without compromising on performance or programmability, which is a major issue.” Large tech firms joining the space require privacy solutions with regulatory compliance, leaving a significant gap for solutions like Miden, added the co-founder. Inco: the fourth layer of the blockchain stack Other industry watchers have also criticized the industry’s lack of confidentiality for limiting institutional adoption. Confidential computing technologies such as fully homomorphic encryption could unlock the next $1 trillion worth of capital for the crypto space with continued technological development, Remi Gai, the founder of Inco, told Cointelegraph.

In a world where volatility is the norm, HTX DeepThink aims to help readers “ Find Order in Chaos .” This week, Bitcoin surged to $95,000 as President Trump signaled a softer stance on tariffs, boosting market sentiment. However, uncertainty around trade negotiations persists. With critical economic data releases on the horizon, early May may offer a brief but significant liquidity window for crypto markets. In this edition of HTX DeepThink, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research breaks down the shifting macro landscape and outlines key risks and opportunities for the digital asset space. Trump’s Second 100 Days Agenda: Delivering on Promises, Catching the Next Wave In his first 100 days, President Trump swiftly implemented several crypto‐friendly measures, including refining the stablecoin regulatory framework and cutting government spending via DOGE. Next, the White House will focus on finalizing trade agreements and advancing a Russia–Ukraine peace effort, while pushing through the “Big, Beautiful” package—featuring large tax cuts, robust border security measures, and regulatory rollbacks—and securing Senate passage of the FIT21 bill to provide a clear framework for U.S. digital‐asset regulation. Last Week’s Market Recap: Decoupling and Key Drivers Last week, crypto markets initially decoupled from U.S. equities, driven by a weakening dollar, increased crypto allocations from traditional firms and financial institutions, rising on‐chain stablecoin issuance, and continued net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs—pushing Bitcoin up to $88,000. Later, softened rhetoric on tariffs from President Trump and Treasury Secretary Bissenet further boosted sentiment. However, while signals of trade progress were encouraging, actual agreements remain months away, and hard‐line tariff hawks within the administration continue to exert significant influence, posing major uncertainty for the outlook. Key Data Ahead: Short‐ and Medium‐Term Inflection Points This week’s macro calendar is pivotal. April 30 @ 12:30 UTC: U.S. Q1 GDP (expected 0.2–0.4%, down from 2.4%) and Core PCE (month-over-month: ~0.1%) May 2 @ 12:30 UTC: April nonfarm payrolls (estimated 130K vs. 228K prior) and unemployment rate (steady at 4.2%) If the data shows weakening growth but easing inflation, it will bolster mid-year rate-cut expectations and likely lift risk assets such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in tandem. Conversely, if all metrics exceed forecasts, rate-cut hopes may be delayed or rate-hike fears revived, driving Treasury yields and the dollar higher and weighing on the crypto market in the short term. In extreme cases: Negative GDP + job losses → panic sell-off, rebound on easing bets Hot inflation + stalled growth → stagflation risks emerge Fed Holds Steady: The “Self‐Preservation” Behind a Technically Valid Rate Cut As of now, the Fed’s reserve balances stand at about $3.3 trillion, overnight reverse repos at $94 billion, and the Treasury General Account remains high—conditions that technically allow for a rate cut. Yet in FY 2024, the Fed paid $226.8 billion in interest on reserves and RRP, while earning only $158.8 billion on Treasuries and MBS, resulting in a $77.5 billion net loss. A 0.3 ppt rate cut would reduce annual portfolio income by roughly $20 billion on $6.7 trillion of assets, widening losses and slashing remittances to the U.S. Treasury. To preserve its financial sustainability and political independence, the Fed has chosen to keep rates unchanged. Liquidity Window & Summer Risks: Timing the Optimal Entry If this week’s data align with a slowdown, May may offer a brief liquidity window as funds rotate back into crypto. However, once the debt ceiling is raised—likely in June to July—the Treasury will refill its TGA to $50–60 billion via new bond issuance, draining equivalent liquidity from markets. Short‐term rates will rise, and risk assets will come under pressure; historically, Bitcoin and the broader market have fallen about 5%–10% in the weeks following such TGA rebuilds. Investors should therefore capitalize on the early‐May window while hedging for the summer liquidity drain. Outlook: Stay Disciplined, Follow the Trend Against a backdrop of intersecting policy catalysts and liquidity shifts, near‐term tactics should focus on key data releases and the May liquidity window, while longer‐term attention centers on FIT21 implementation and continued institutional adoption of BTC and other assets like Solana. The next major uptrend may well arise under these dual tailwinds—seize the opportunity. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

In an April 28 co-authored blog post, the two stressed a renewed focus on Layer 1s (L1s), Blobs, and user experience (UX) to support global consumers of the Ethereum ecosystem. Ethereum’s Vision According to Buterin and Miyaguchi, the EF’s main goals are ensuring that ETH’s users benefit from its underlying properties as well as facilitating the ecosystem’s resilience and decentralization in a holistic way that addresses points of weakness in the stack. In line with this, the foundation has plans to maximize meaningful ETH usage across various applications such as decentralized finance, social media, and AI coordination platforms. Another core objective is to ensure the resilience of the blockchain’s technical and social infrastructure through decentralization, risk management, and diversified development teams. Key priorities outlined in the vision for the coming year include scaling the Ethereum mainnet, advancing blobs technology, and improving UX across the chain. It also emphasizes boosting L1 and L2 interoperability, refining the application layer, and giving more visibility to developers and applications at events such as Devcon. Blobs, introduced in the recent Dencun upgrade through EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), offer a more affordable way for L2 rollups to post data to the Ethereum mainnet. This addresses long-standing issues of high fees and network congestion. Further, the non-profit is focused on refining both user and developer experiences. For users, this means improving wallet usability, simplifying gas fee comprehension, and ensuring seamless interaction across L2 networks. For developers, Ethereum aims to streamline the building process through better tools, documentation, grants, and education. Leadership Changes At the same time, the organization announced the restructuring of its leadership to enhance strategic execution, strengthen internal operations, and further support the network as it expands. In March, the EF appointed Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz K. Stańczak as co-executive directors in changes aimed at balancing operational and technical expertise. Working closely with the broader management team, the pair will oversee strategic planning, ecosystem development, and daily operations. They are joined by Bastian Aue and Josh Stark, who have been brought on to strengthen areas such as organizational strategy, hiring, project management, and communications. In a joint statement, Wang and Stańczak committed to upholding four guiding principles: censorship resistance, open-source development, privacy, and security. Stańczak will focus on accelerating technical infrastructure execution during his two-year term, while Wang will serve as a strategic bridge between the board and operations.

The price could hit a high of $3.99 in 2025. XRP Price Today: XRP value has dropped 1.59% in 24 hours to $2.29. XRP has been making positive shifts in the crypto market. In a very recent XRP news, Japan’s banking sector is preparing for a major transformation, with nearly 80% of banks planning to adopt XRP in 2025. It has also surpassed Ethereum in trading activity. On the other hand, XRP ETFs are what every investor is curious about. In the latest update on the Ripple vs SEC case, Attorney Fred Rispoli has provided an updated timeline for the SEC v. Ripple case. He stated that the necessary documentation had already been produced following Alderoty’s declaration, and they are now awaiting a vote by the SEC Commission, which is expected in 30 days. Talking about the XRP price, it is down by 1.59% to $2.29. If the bullish momentum continues, XRP could aim at its resistance level of $2.54. On the flip side, if it loses out on steam, the XRP price could take a plunge to $2.098. Our Ripple XRP price prediction will explore the potential answers to questions such as “Will XRP reach $10 in 2025?” and “Will XRP go up?” What is the XRP price prediction for today? According to the XRP price analysis done by our expert panel, the XRP crypto price today could go as high as $2.54.

The RSI at 58.6 signals strengthening upside without overbought risk. Price structure suggests a potential breakout if the neckline resistance near $2.40–$2.50 is cleared. Consolidation post-downtrend adds credibility to reversal signals. XRP Price Prediction April 2025 High Price : $2.50 (key resistance level) Low Price : $1.85 (recent low before breakout) Average Price : $2.0 (current consolidation level) XRP Price Prediction 2025 The SEC believes that XRP can help release funds stuck in the U.S. Nostro accounts, which can then be used to buy more Bitcoins. There is more positive news for Ripple, as they have integrated their stablecoin RLUSD into their cross-border payments network: Ripple Payments . Moreover, JP Morgan Chase has approved XRP for use within its banking payment framework. If things go in favor of Ripple, the XRP price could surge to a maximum of $5.81 by the end of 2025. In contrast, if the lawsuit continues, the value of XRP could remain in a narrow range with a potential low of $2.3. That being said, we can expect an average Ripple price of $4.89. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Year Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) 2026 5.6 6.25 8.64 2027 7.15 8.89 12.25 2028 11.3 14.11 16.53 2029 13.98 16.48 21.12 2030 16.92 19.87 26.97 XRP Price Prediction 2026 XRP cost will likely witness strong growth in 2026. There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.64 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.6, with an average trading price of $6.25. This could be a result of Ripple’s role in CBDC development and XRP’s rising institutional demand. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.15 to $12.25. XRP price might record an average level of $8.89. The reason behind this surge could be due to Ripple’s increasing domination in the payment sector, accelerating XRP’s buying demand and utility. XRP Price Prediction 2028 In 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases, including new dApps and announcements regarding XRP. This might boost the dominance of XRP as the second-largest altcoin by market cap. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.3 to $16.53. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $14.11. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP’s price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $13.98 to $21.12, with an average price of $16.48. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple’s ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $16.92 to $26.97. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.87.

The news was broken by Crypto Rover on X recently. Reactions to this news have been positive, with many users saying that the altcoin season is back, while others sidelined the institutional confidence, stating, ""these suits are way too late for the party."" 💥BREAKING: BLACKROCK JUST BOUGHT $67.5 MILLION WORTH OF ETHEREUMBULLISH FOR $ETH 🚀 pic.twitter.com/FewXtCqQwa — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) April 29, 2025 This purchase has created a bullish ecosystem around Ethereum, which, despite its recent rejection at $1.8K, continues to remain stable, indicating that a major pump could be coming soon. The ripple effect of this growth could reach other ETH-based tokens, among which could be the best crypto to buy now to capitalize on the current bull run. BlackRock's Buying Frenzy and Technical Updates Are the Reason for People's Bullish Mood Regarding Ethereum The recent $67.5 million purchase isn't the only one making rounds inside the cryptosphere, because two days ago, the world's largest asset management company had already bought $54 million worth of ETH. Furthermore, the approval of the first spot Ethereum ETF back in early 2024 already set the tone that the altcoin would be accepted by the regulatory landscape. Technological updates are also coming, with Ethereum's Fusaka Hard Fork expected to take place in the third or fourth quarter of this year. Important Clarification on EOF debateThere's a significant EOF debate today, but one crucial misunderstanding needs to be addressed clearly:The current EOF discussion is NOT related to the upcoming Pectra upgrade, scheduled for May 7th. The Pectra upgrade does not include… — Tomasz K. Stańczak (@tkstanczak) April 28, 2025 This update had caused some controversy in the past, as the community believed that the EVM Object Format would be coming for the Ethereum Virtual Machine with this hard fork. However, that has been ruled out. Another major news coming from the technical front is that the Ethereum Spectra Update is set to land on May 7th. This update will focus primarily on optimization rather than a complete overhaul, introducing 11 Ethereum Improvement Proposals, five of which will focus on staking. These updates have contributed to the positive community sentiment around Ethereum. In terms of technicals, the ETH price recently rejected the $1.8K mark and is currently accumulating below that level. Recent action shows two inverted curves, and while the previous one led to a correction, the recent one could lead to a major surge. Also, the update proposals, including one that would increase the gas limit by 100x — theoretically increasing ETH's transaction speed to 2,000 TPS — could give the ETH price a much-needed boost in the future. So, while the technicals don't show much green, the updates and institutional adoption could lead to a parabolic price action for Ethereum. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Top 3 Picks Ethereum's potential surge could lift up other utility-focused tokens as well as meme coins. However, since the market is volatile, the best picks are among the recent crypto ICOs. Solaxy While not directly associated with ETH, Solaxy could gain from Ethereum's recent updates since it leverages both the Ethereum and the Solana ecosystems to provide a unique L2 solution. Built exclusively to help the Solana blockchain become more efficient, Solaxy is a meme coin project with a keen focus on utility, giving itself both short- and long-term perks. The project uses technologies like Hyperlane, Celestia, and ZK rollups to offer off-chain transaction solutions that make the Solana chain more scalable and fast. Unlike other meme coin projects that only highlight some underlying utility as a future vision, Solaxy has already made a lot of headway in that direction. For instance, the Solaxy Block Explorer has already gone live. Right now, developers say that Solaxy can sustain 140 kb/s with optimal configuration on the Solana mainnet, roll-up performance is being fine-tuned, and proper CORS has already been set up for bridging — meaning the project may continue to evolve as time goes on. With over $32 million raised at the time of writing, Solaxy could be the next big hit as both a meme coin and a utility token in 2025. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token is a cryptocurrency project powering Best Wallet, a robust cryptocurrency wallet offering multichain perks, allowing users to buy, sell, store, and transfer Ethereum and ETH-related cryptocurrencies, as well as other cryptos. The project has been designed to reduce the UI-related bottlenecks people face when interacting with the cryptocurrency market. The security features of Best Wallet focus on accessibility and protection, and unique staking perks have also been introduced. The core attribute of this cryptocurrency project, however, is the Token Launchpad. Designed to provide access to early investment opportunities, the launchpad lets investors buy crypto on presale while they are still at the zero stage. Other perks, such as staking, also make Best Wallet one of the best cryptocurrency wallets available. Additionally, the developers are very open and social, providing market insights as well as deep and basic crypto tutorials online via their official YouTube channel. Fantasy Pepe Pepe is considered a beta-play of Ethereum, and Fantasy Pepe could establish itself as an even better asset thanks to its unique use case that brings together the best narratives within the ecosystem. Fantasy Pepe is a P2E project with meme coin themes and AI-driven fundamentals that take a basic approach of giving users something to enjoy. The ecosystem comprises two teams — ChatGPT and DeepSeek — managing their football teams and going against each other in 60-second matches overseen by Grok, acting as a referee. This simple game invites players — FEPE holders — to wager on the outcome and win rewards. These rewards consist of everything from tokens to NFTs. There are also real-world rewards in the works that will come after Fantasy Pepe starts collaborating with international football teams. The combined factor of memes and gameplay makes it one of the best cryptos to buy now. Conclusion BlackRock's Ethereum purchase has once again highlighted the relevance of institutional interest. However, its impact on the ETH price remains to be seen, which has become especially important to note after Ethereum was rejected at $1.8K. Therefore, a better play is to dive into presales and find the best early-moving opportunities, which this ""best crypto to buy now"" list provides.

Sei ( SEI ) which had been forming consistently lower highs and lower lows since early January, has recently posted its first slightly higher high. The token is currently testing the key resistance level at $0.20, a zone that previously marked a lower high and also aligns with the descending trendline. SEI has reclaimed both the EMA-20 and SMA-50, and is now edging toward the SMA-100 at $0.22, a signal that a longer-term structural shift could be underway. Momentum indicators also support the bullish case. The MACD shows a positive histogram and a bullish signal line crossover, while the Relative Strength Index stands at 66, reflecting strong buying pressure as it nears the overbought zone. source: TradingView Looking ahead, the next immediate target for SEI price is around $0.25 — a key level where the price consolidated between Feb. 20 and early March before breaking down to the $0.22 zone. A successful breakout above $0.25 could open the door for a move toward the $0.30 level. A more ambitious target is around $0.40 — the first major lower high following the early January peak and a point of intersection with the descending trendline. A breakdown below $0.14 local support would invalidate the bullish outlook. You might also like: SUI or SEI: Which one will dominate the 2025 bull market? AI has a radical take The key catalyst that may propel SEI price to $0.40 and above is Canary Capital’s recent registration of the Canary Staked SEI ETF Trust in Delaware. Officially filed on April 23, this statutory trust represents the first step toward launching a staked SEI exchange-traded fund in the U.S. While the filing doesn’t make the ETF tradable yet, it establishes the legal framework for holding and managing SEI assets, including staking operations designed to generate additional yield. The next phase in the process involves Canary Capital submitting a Form S-1 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , detailing the ETF’s structure, staking mechanism, and distribution strategy for rewards. If approved, the staked SEI ETF could become one of the first staking-integrated crypto ETFs in the U.S., potentially boosting SEI’s price by attracting institutional demand.

If you are building a strategy for 2025, here are four standout names — plus one powerful newcomer you cannot ignore: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM : A rising project built around limited supply, strategic momentum, and real early investor demand. With an exclusive 50% bonus through the MAGA50X code, it is offering one of the sharpest early-stage entries of the cycle. XRP (XRP) : Expanding rapidly into cross-border financial services, XRP remains a favorite among institutional players despite regulatory battles. Solana (SOL) : One of the fastest Layer 1 blockchains, Solana is recovering strongly with new use cases in NFTs,and gaming. Kaspa (KAS) : Utilizing blockDAG architecture for ultra-fast confirmations, Kaspa is carving out a growing niche for speed-focused decentralized transactions. Aptos (APT) : Built by former Facebook engineers, Aptos aims to redefine Layer 1 efficiency with a focus on scalability and ease of development. Each offers unique strengths — but early entry timing remains the real difference-maker for maximizing future returns. Why MAGACOINFINANCE.COM Is Quietly Becoming a Top Pick While major names continue pushing forward, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is developing a different kind of momentum — one built not on hype but on authentic adoption and limited availability. Early market reactions suggest that this project has struck a chord with seasoned investors looking to position before the herd arrives. By combining a capped supply model with organic community-driven momentum, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is setting itself apart from countless projects that chase attention but fail to build lasting value. Conclusion While leading names like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL) , Kaspa , and Aptos present strong cases for 2025, early-stage movers like MAGACOINFINANCE.COM offer a different kind of opportunity — one where positioning early could make all the difference when the next cycle fully ignites.

Common , a new privacy-first DeFi platform built on Aleph Zero’s infrastructure, today announced the launch of its Web App, in collaboration with the partner responsible for the operation of Common Labs Inc. The mobile version, due at the end of May, will be the world’s first privacy-preserving mobile app in the crypto space that combines speed with ease of use. For this reason, Common represents a watershed moment for crypto mass adoption. The platform initially supports Arbitrum and Aleph Zero’s EVM, with plans to expand to additional chains, including Base and Ethereum, in the coming months. Common serves as the intuitive interface for Aleph Zero’s Shielder Network, a system of smart contracts, relayers, and zero-knowledge cryptography that enables private transactions across multiple chains. This infrastructure makes it possible for users to protect their onchain activity without relying on centralized exchanges. At the core of the experience is “Shielding” , the process of depositing tokens into a shielded pool to break the link between public wallet activity and future transactions. Users can later unshield by withdrawing to a fresh public address, maintaining privacy throughout. With subsecond proving times performed directly on the device, Common delivers seamless privacy without the usual waiting periods or technical barriers. Unlike other privacy solutions, Common does not commingle funds, preserving full provenance for compliance or auditing if needed. “Privacy shouldn’t be a luxury in crypto. It should be the default,” said Adam Gagol, Co-Founder of Aleph Zero and Co-Creator of Common Labs Inc. “We’ve spent years building the technical foundation to make that possible, and with Common, we’re finally delivering it in a way that anyone can use, without plugins, without compromises, and without needing to trust a third party. Privacy becomes something you tap, not something you configure. This launch is just the beginning of building a truly private, multichain financial layer for web3.” Privacy across chains at the touch of a button The Common Web App works with many popular wallets, such as MetaMask, Ledger (via Metamask), or Rabby, requiring no migration and allowing users to begin transacting immediately. The Mobile App will offer the same privacy benefits in a mobile-native experience, including fiat on-ramp support via Banxa and seamless dApp connectivity. As a non-custodial and completely decentralized platform, Common adheres to core DeFi principles. The entire platform is built on open-source, audited smart contracts, allowing users to verify rather than trust the system. Simple, cross-chain privacy This launch marks the first step in a larger rollout of Common’s ecosystem. Future features will allow users to: Shielded Yield: Earn yield on shielded assets through integrated strategies, without exposing wallet activity. Smart Yield: Automated strategies designed to allow users to set their strategy once and let the system optimize their returns, hands-free. Staking Rewards: Aligning platform growth and user commitment by distributing a share of privacy fees and yield success fees to stakers. Multichain Privacy: Extending privacy support to key EVM chains (e.g., Sonic, Berachain, Monad) and emerging Layer-2 networks. Seamless Private Bridging: Enabling private asset transfers between supported blockchains, simplifying multi-chain management. Enhanced Fiat Access & Payments: Streamlining access to/from TradFi via off-ramps, IBAN support, and crypto payment cards for everyday use.

43946162,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153704,1745933448,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto Industry Leaders Flock to Exclusive D.C. Club,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-leaders-dc-networking/,"Washington, D.C. is increasingly becoming a critical battleground for the future of the cryptocurrency industry. As regulatory discussions heat up and policy frameworks are debated, the importance of having a presence and building connections within the nation’s capital cannot be overstated. Against this backdrop, news has emerged that a new, highly exclusive private club is attracting significant attention from prominent figures in the crypto world, signaling a growing desire among Crypto Industry Leaders to engage directly with the heart of U.S. power. What is the Executive Branch Club? The buzz centers around the Executive Branch Club , a new members-only establishment co-founded by Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of former U.S. President Donald Trump. Positioned in the historic Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., this club isn’t your average social spot. It’s designed specifically to cultivate an elite network. Founders: Co-founded by Donald Trump Jr. Location: Georgetown, Washington, D.C. Opening: Expected to open its doors very soon. Target Audience: Wealthy CEOs, influential tech founders, and key policy experts. Membership: Reportedly carries a hefty $500,000 initiation fee. Exclusivity: Features a significant waiting list, underscoring its high demand and selective nature. The club’s stated aim is to provide a curated environment for influential individuals to connect, share insights, and potentially shape discussions on important issues ranging from technology and finance to policy and politics. Why Are Crypto Industry Leaders Interested in D.C. Networking? The presence of prominent figures from the digital asset space at the Executive Branch Club highlights a significant shift. For years, the crypto industry largely operated outside traditional financial and political spheres. However, as cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have grown in prominence and complexity, so too has the scrutiny from regulators and policymakers. Engaging in Crypto Networking in Washington, D.C. is no longer optional; it’s becoming essential. Here’s why: Policy Influence: Decisions made in D.C. regarding regulation, taxation, and legal status directly impact the future of crypto businesses and investments. Networking allows industry leaders to share their perspectives and potentially influence these outcomes. Information Gathering: Being close to the policy-making process provides invaluable insights into potential regulatory changes, allowing companies and investors to prepare proactively. Building Relationships: Establishing personal connections with policymakers, their staff, and other influential figures can open doors for dialogue and education about complex crypto topics. Legitimacy and Mainstreaming: The active participation of crypto figures in traditional D.C. power circles helps to legitimize the industry and integrate it further into the mainstream financial and political landscape. The club setting offers a less formal, yet highly effective, environment for these critical interactions compared to official meetings or public forums. Prominent Crypto and Tech Figures Joining the Fold The report specifically names several high-profile individuals with deep ties to the tech and crypto worlds who are reportedly drawn to the Executive Branch Club . These include: David Sacks: A prominent venture capitalist (Craft Ventures), co-founder of PayPal, and host of the popular All-In Podcast. Sacks has become an increasingly vocal commentator on technology, politics, and policy, often expressing views relevant to the future of innovation and regulation. His involvement signals the club’s appeal to the tech investment elite. Chamath Palihapitiya: Another well-known venture capitalist (Social Capital), former Facebook executive, and co-host of the All-In Podcast alongside Sacks. Palihapitiya is known for his outspoken views on various industries, including technology and finance, and his interest aligns with the club’s focus on connecting influential figures across sectors. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss: Co-founders of the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange and early Bitcoin investors. The Winklevoss twins have been active advocates for clear cryptocurrency regulation and have engaged with policymakers in the past. Their potential membership underscores the direct interest of major crypto platform operators in D.C. policy discussions. The presence of such heavyweights suggests that the club is successfully attracting the very demographic it targets – individuals with significant capital, influence, and a vested interest in the intersection of technology, finance, and government policy. Their participation in Crypto Networking within this exclusive environment could have ripple effects across the industry. The Growing Importance of D.C. Crypto Policy For anyone involved in digital assets, understanding and engaging with D.C. Crypto Policy is paramount. The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the United States is still evolving, with various government agencies – including the SEC, CFTC, Treasury, and Congress – grappling with how to classify, regulate, and oversee this new asset class. Key policy debates currently underway include: Whether specific cryptocurrencies are securities or commodities. How to regulate stablecoins. Taxation rules for crypto transactions and investments. Consumer protection and market integrity concerns. The potential for a U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Exclusive clubs like the Executive Branch provide an informal venue where industry leaders can discuss these complex issues directly with policymakers and other influential figures, potentially shaping narratives and fostering a better understanding of the technology and its potential. Benefits of Exclusive Networking for Crypto Leaders What specific advantages might Crypto Industry Leaders gain from membership in such a club? Direct Access: Unparalleled opportunity to interact directly with policymakers, legislative staff, and other figures shaping the regulatory environment. Informal Lobbying: The ability to informally advocate for policies favorable to the crypto industry and educate influential individuals on the nuances of digital assets. Strategic Alliances: Opportunity to build relationships with leaders from traditional finance, tech, and other sectors, fostering potential partnerships and collaborative efforts on policy issues. Intelligence Gathering: Gaining early insights into policy thinking and potential regulatory directions before they become public. Peer Networking: Connecting with other top-tier leaders facing similar challenges and opportunities in the rapidly evolving tech and crypto space. While traditional lobbying efforts and public forums remain crucial, these private networks offer a complementary avenue for influence and relationship building. Potential Challenges and Criticisms While the benefits for Crypto Networking are clear, the existence of such exclusive clubs also raises questions and potential criticisms: Elitism: The high membership fee naturally restricts access to a very small, wealthy group, potentially reinforcing perceptions of D.C. influence being available only to the privileged few. Transparency Concerns: Discussions held in private clubs are not subject to the same transparency requirements as public meetings or official lobbying disclosures. Regulatory Capture Risk: Critics might argue that such close ties between industry leaders and policymakers could lead to policies that favor specific interests over broader public good or fair competition. Optics: For an industry often championing decentralization and open access, associating with highly centralized, exclusive power structures might present an optics challenge. Navigating these perceptions while effectively engaging in D.C. remains a key challenge for the industry. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community What does this development mean for the broader crypto community, including investors, developers, and smaller businesses? Stay Informed: Recognize that policy decisions in D.C. are increasingly influenced by direct engagement from industry leaders. Pay attention to policy debates and proposed legislation. Support Advocacy Groups: While exclusive clubs cater to the elite, supporting broader crypto advocacy groups and lobbying efforts helps ensure a wider range of voices are heard in Washington. Understand the Landscape: Appreciate that the future of crypto is being shaped not just by technology and markets, but also by political and regulatory factors. Consider Local Engagement: While D.C. is central, state-level regulations are also important. Engage with policymakers at all levels where possible. The involvement of Donald Trump Jr. in co-founding a club that attracts these figures adds a layer of political intrigue and highlights the increasing entanglement of crypto with mainstream political dynamics. Conclusion: Crypto’s Expanding Footprint in D.C. The emergence of the Executive Branch Club as a potential hub for prominent Crypto Industry Leaders marks a significant moment. It underscores the industry’s maturation and its recognition of the critical importance of engaging with the political and policy-making apparatus in Washington, D.C. While the exclusive nature of such a venue might spark debate, the underlying trend is clear: the crypto world is actively seeking to build relationships and influence discussions where its future is being decided. As the club opens its doors, its role in shaping D.C. Crypto Policy and fostering elite Crypto Networking will be closely watched, offering a fascinating glimpse into the evolving intersection of technology, finance, and power in the nation’s capital.

Ethereum’s $51.8B TVL and 30% DEX weekly volume rise show robust network strength. A bull flag pattern on the ETH’s four-hour chart targets $2,100. Ether’s ( ETH ) price rose to a new range high at $1,860 on April 28, its highest value since April 2. Several analysts argue that the ETH price needs to hold above $1,800 to increase the chances of rising higher. “Once ETH confirms this 4H close above resistance [$1,800], Ether and altcoins will finally get their time to shine,” trader Kiran Gadakh said in an April 29 post on X. “I can feel it in my bones, $2,000 ETH coming fast.” ETH/USD 12-hour chart. Source: Kiran Gadak Popular analyst Nebraskangooner opined that if ETH faces high volume rejection from the $1,800 level, it might drop to test support levels around $1,600. Source: Nebraskangooner Ethereum ETF demand returns Several data metrics suggest that Ether is well-positioned to break out toward $2,000 in the following days or weeks. One factor supporting Ether's bull case is resurgent institutional demand, reflected by significant inflows into spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On April 28, Ethereum ETFs saw a net inflow totaling $64.1 million. This followed inflows totalling $151.7 million during the week ending April 25, the highest since February 2025. Spot Ethereum ETF netflows. Source: SoSoValue The increase in institutional demand was reinforced by net inflows of $183 million into Ethereum investment products last week, ending an eight-week streak of outflows, as reported by CoinShares. This trend reflects growing confidence among traditional finance players, as observed by market analysts like CoinShares' head of research, James Butterfill, who noted: “We believe concerns over the tariff impact on corporate earnings and the dramatic weakening of the US dollar are why investors have turned toward digital assets, which are being seen as an emerging safe haven.” Institutional buying creates sustained upward pressure on Ether’s price by absorbing the available supply. Strong Ethereum onchain activity is back Ethereum remains the undisputed top layer-1 blockchain with more than $51.8 billion in total value locked (TVL) on the network, according to data from DefiLlama. The chart below shows that Ethereum's TVL has increased by approximately 16% over the last seven days. Ethereum TVL and daily DEX volumes. Source: DefiLlama Aave was among the strongest performers in Ethereum deposits, with the TVL rising 13.5% over seven days. Other notable increases included Lido (12%), EigenLayer (13%), and Ether.fi (12%). Compared to other top-layer networks, the Ethereum network towers above its rivals in terms of TVL growth in the daily and weekly time frames, except SUI, which has seen a 47% increase in its TVL over the last seven days. Ethereum’s daily DEX volumes have increased by more than 30% over the last week, to $1.65 billion. However, this is significantly lower than the 78% and 44% increases on SUI and Solana, respectively. Related: Ethereum Foundation shuffles leadership, splits board and management ETH price bull flags targets $2,100 The ETH/USD pair has a good chance of resuming its upward momentum despite the rejection at $1,860, as the chart shows a classic bullish pattern. Ether’s price action over the past week has led to a bull flag pattern on the four-hour chart, as shown in the figure below. A four-hour candlestick close above the flag’s upper boundary at $1,800 on April 29 suggests the start of an upward move. The flagpole’s height sets the target, which projects Ether’s price ascent to $2,100 or approximately a 15% increase from the current price. ETH/USD 4-hour chart w/ bull flag pattern.

In 2024, around 5.14% of all stablecoin trading activities could be linked to high-risk addresses. In 2025, stablecoin activity grew as a whole, along with the inflow to high-risk addresses. The Bitrace Crypto Crime Report for 2024 showed stablecoin payments to high-risk addresses reached $649B worldwide. In 2024, overall stablecoin volumes expanded to over $450B per month, processing an estimated $14T for the whole year. Stablecoin usage increased in place of BTC or ETH payments, as a more intuitive tool. This also invited more scammers or hackers to use the dollar-denominated tokens. Based on Bitrace data, up to 5.14% of all crypto trading activity was linked to high-risk addresses. Online gambling and personalized scams saw increased inflows of stablecoins, with a growing share of USDC. | Source: Bitrace Stablecoin addresses were also closely watched for links to exploits or scams. As most of the highly active USDT tokens are on Ethereum, they were especially suited to the habits of DPRK hackers, who typically quickly swap and launder ETH-based tokens. However, the TRON-based USDT also occupied a significant share of risky addresses. TRC-20 tokens were often used in P2P markets, some of which still conceal illegal operations or are used for laundering. Crypto hacks as a whole slowed down, but various forms of laundering accelerated in 2024. TRON was especially vigilant about its stablecoin supply, deploying the T3 Financial Crime Unit in partnership with Tether. Bitrace tracks stablecoins to several illegal activities Stablecoins flow into several legally grey areas or outright illegal activities. The biggest share of flagged addresses belonged to grey or black markets. Fraud and online gambling were the new growth categories in 2024, surpassing the activity of 2023. Online gambling grew by 17.5% in the past year, for a share of $217B. While USDT was still the leading coin, USDC also grew its share of online gambling. A total of $86.3B in stablecoins flowed into various money laundering destinations. Part of the ability to launder funds was linked to the growth of Web3 facilities, including DEX, lending protocols, and privacy networks like ThorChain . The 2024 laundering trend extended into 2025, as hacking activity resumed. Even with a record supply of stablecoins, the share of those illegal activities remained relatively high as part of the overall turnover. In 2023, up to 5.49% of stablecoins went to dubious addresses, for a total of $574.4B. Bitrace’s estimate shows stablecoins are now more widely used for high-risk activities compared to the bull market of 2021 and 2022. Traders also shifted their selection of currencies, with TRC-20 USDT having the biggest share of grey-area activity. Ethereum-based USDC also increased its usage despite Circle’s attempts to position the stablecoin as fully regulated and transparent. Only a small fraction of those addresses have been exposed and frozen despite regular monitoring. Escrow platforms like Huione Guarantee are one of the key elements of laundering, expanding their volume to $2.64B in 2024. The increased activity of escrow services coincided with a spike of fraud activities. Personal fraud drew in $52.5B in stablecoin traffic for the whole of 2024, exceeding all yearly activity since 2021. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

This bold move raises questions about its impact on the broader crypto market. Attention now shifts to alternative cryptocurrencies that might experience a rapid surge. The anticipation builds as traders and investors eagerly await insights into potential winners in this evolving scenario. Cardano: Past Momentum and Current Price Levels Last month showed a modest gain of nearly 4% while the past six months delivered a strong rise of almost 97%. Price action has reflected steady strength, building a bullish backdrop over recent cycles. The weekly improvement of over 12% underscores recent buying interest and overall vigor in the coin during both short- and mid-term periods. ADA current price sits in a range between $0.47 and $1.02, with key resistance noted at $1.37 and a secondary resistance at $1.92. Support is found around $0.27. Bulls seem to hold slight control, though no clear trend has been established. Trading within these boundaries could be productive, with caution advised if prices dip toward the support level. Solana Price Fluctuations and Key Levels Overview Solana recorded a strong monthly gain of 17.05% amid a backdrop of a 6-month decline of 16.66%. Price action over the past month suggests a rebound from lower levels, while the half-year performance reflects broader market challenges. The data shows periods of recovery mixed with uncertainty, highlighting sentiment shifts during sideways movements and occasional surges. Current trading sees Solana’s price ranging between $97.94 and $165.67, with immediate resistance at $206.76 and support at $71.30. Bulls appear active given recent weekly gains of 6.79%, though the trend lacks clear direction. Trading within these bounds may favor short-term positions while maintaining careful risk management. SUI Soars Amid Market Momentum SUI experienced a 51.52% gain over the past month and a 68.02% rally in the last six months. Price growth has been strong and steady, reflecting positive market sentiment and growing investor interest during these periods. Currently, SUI trades between $1.74 and $3.03 with a nearby resistance at $3.78 and a second level at $5.07, while support stands at $1.21. The rising RSI near 75 and a 59.43% weekly increase indicate bullish pressure, though overbought conditions signal caution. Traders may find opportunities within these key levels, watching the resistance zone as a potential exit or reversal point while monitoring momentum for further confirmation. Conclusion If Trump establishes a strategic Bitcoin reserve, several altcoins may see a quick boost. ADA may benefit as it seeks more institutional interest. SOL could rise due to its fast transactions. SUI may gain attention as a newer player with potential. The move might spur broader interest in these coins, leading to increased investments and market activity. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

43946441,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153705,1745934050,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Supply in Profit Nears Critical Euphoria Zone,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-supply-in-profit/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing as a key on-chain metric signals a significant shift in the current Bitcoin landscape. According to data highlighted by CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost, the percentage of Bitcoin’s circulating supply held in profit has surged past the 85% mark. This isn’t just a number; it’s a strong indicator that the market is entering territory historically associated with heightened investor sentiment and potentially, peak phases of a market cycle . Understanding Bitcoin’s Supply in Profit So, what exactly is ‘supply in profit’? In simple terms, it’s the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply whose acquisition price (the price at which those specific coins last moved) is lower than the current market price. Think of it as tracking how much of all the Bitcoin out there is currently sitting on unrealized gains. Why is this metric important? Here’s a quick breakdown: Gauges Market Sentiment: A high percentage means most holders are profitable, generally indicating bullish sentiment and confidence. Identifies Potential Tops/Bottoms: Historically, extreme highs and lows in this metric have coincided with major market turning points. Reveals Selling Pressure Potential: While high profit can fuel further buying (FOMO – Fear Of Missing Out), it also means more coins are held by people who *could* sell to realize profits. Approaching the Euphoria Zone: What Does 85%+ Mean? The current climb above 85% places Bitcoin’s supply in profit squarely in a range that has historically preceded periods of intense market excitement, often dubbed the ‘ euphoria zone ‘. Data from past cycles suggests that when this metric pushes above 90% or even 95%, the market is typically experiencing peak bullishness. These phases are often characterized by rapid price increases, significant media attention, and high levels of retail investor participation. While reaching the euphoria zone doesn’t guarantee an immediate top, it serves as a crucial warning sign for seasoned investors. It suggests that a large portion of the supply is now held by those who are significantly profitable, increasing the potential for profit-taking events that could lead to price corrections. Comparing Current Trends to Past Bitcoin Market Cycles Looking back at previous Bitcoin market cycle s provides valuable context. Deep bear markets have historically seen the supply in profit plummet to levels as low as 45-50%. This indicates that during peak despair, more than half of the circulating supply was underwater, held by investors at a loss. This capitulation phase often marks the bottom. More recently, during significant price pullbacks within the current bull trend, the supply in profit has dipped to around the 75% level. These dips often aligned with critical support levels, providing opportunities for accumulation before the next leg up. The current surge back towards 90% from these levels highlights the strength of the recent rally but also brings the market closer to historical peak conditions. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Crypto Market What should investors take away from this? While a high supply in profit is bullish up to a point, nearing the euphoria zone necessitates caution. Here are some points to consider: Risk Management: As the market heats up, consider trimming positions or setting stop-loss orders to protect unrealized gains. Profit-Taking Strategy: Have a plan for when and how you might take profits, rather than getting swept up in the euphoria. Look Beyond Bitcoin: While Bitcoin often leads, analyze the health of the broader crypto market and specific altcoins using similar on-chain metrics where available. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Your strategy will depend on your investment horizon. Long-term holders might view this differently than short-term traders. It’s important to remember that on-chain metrics are tools for analysis, not crystal balls. They provide probabilities based on historical data, but the market can always behave differently. Conclusion: Navigating Peak Sentiment Bitcoin’s supply in profit climbing above 85% is a significant development, pushing the market closer to a state of historical euphoria. While this reflects strong recent performance and widespread profitability among holders, it also signals that the market is entering a phase where caution becomes increasingly important. Understanding this metric and its historical context within the market cycle is crucial for making informed decisions in the dynamic crypto market .

Market Experts Have Answers,https://thecoinrise.com/can-trump-coin-hit-80-ath-ahead-of-the-presidents-dinner-market-experts-have-answers/,"The upcoming US President’s dinner has thrust the Official Trump coin (TRUMP) into the spotlight, sparking speculation that it could reach a new all-time high. As the crypto space watches closely, market experts’ opinions remain divided on whether this bold prediction is realistic or destined to fade after the president’s dinner. At the same time, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has been making its own entrance into the market, backed by growing fanfare and a dedicated following. Now in its presale phase, market experts anticipate strong returns as interest in this new AI meme coin builds. Understanding TRUMP Coin’s Latest Surge And The Road Ahead The Official Trump coin is printing the green bar again on the weekly chart : an 81.72% surge in price. The reason behind the surge in Official Trump coin occurred on April 23, when it was announced that the top 220 holders of the Official Trump Coins would be invited to the US President’s dinner (Donald Trump), contributing to an increase in the token’s value. In addition, a key development that contributed to Official Trump coin’s surge aside from the president’s dinner was the delay in unlocking 40 million new tokens by 90 days. This postponement preserved the current circulating supply of 200 million TRUMP. However, market experts note that after the president’s dinner, when the unlock window opens in July, the market dynamics could change. According to the market experts, the introduction of new Official Trump coins may exert downward pressure on prices, particularly with the upcoming president’s dinner, as trading volumes decrease after the hype fades.

The financial world is keenly watching the US Dollar, which has been showing strength recently. This movement isn’t happening in a vacuum; it’s largely in anticipation of several crucial pieces of Economic Data set to be released soon. For those of you navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding these macroeconomic shifts is vital, as they can significantly influence market sentiment and capital flows. Why is the US Dollar Gaining Ground? The US Dollar often acts as a safe-haven asset during times of uncertainty or when markets anticipate significant policy shifts. Its recent upward trend is a classic example of markets positioning themselves ahead of potentially market-moving news. Traders and investors are adjusting their portfolios, betting on how the upcoming data might influence the Federal Reserve’s decisions on monetary policy. Several factors contribute to this positioning: Anticipation of Data: The primary driver is the market’s expectation that upcoming data releases will provide clarity on the health of the US economy. Monetary Policy Expectations: Stronger-than-expected data could reinforce the view that the Federal Reserve might maintain higher Interest Rates for longer, making Dollar-denominated assets more attractive. Global Economic Outlook: Compared to other major economies, the US might currently be perceived as relatively stronger, attracting capital inflows. What Economic Data Should We Watch? The calendar is packed with releases that could sway the Dollar’s trajectory. Here are some of the key reports on everyone’s radar: Consumer Price Index (CPI): This is perhaps the most watched report, detailing inflation at the consumer level. Producer Price Index (PPI): Measures inflation at the wholesale level, often seen as a leading indicator for CPI. Retail Sales: Provides insight into consumer spending, a major component of economic growth. Employment Data (like Non-Farm Payrolls): Indicates the health of the labor market, a key factor for the Fed. FOMC Minutes/Speeches: Commentary from Federal Reserve officials can offer clues about future policy direction. Each of these reports paints a part of the overall economic picture. Traders analyze them meticulously to predict the Fed’s next moves. How Do These Releases Impact the Forex Market ? The Forex Market , or foreign exchange market, is where currencies are traded. It’s the largest and most liquid market globally. Economic data releases are primary catalysts for volatility in Forex. Here’s a simplified look at the potential impact: Data Release Stronger-than-Expected Data Weaker-than-Expected Data Inflation Data (CPI, PPI) Could lead to expectations of higher Interest Rates , strengthening the US Dollar . Could lead to expectations of lower Interest Rates or cuts, weakening the US Dollar . Retail Sales Indicates strong consumer spending, positive for economy, strengthens US Dollar . Indicates weak consumer spending, negative for economy, weakens US Dollar . Employment Data Suggests a strong labor market, positive for economy and potentially Interest Rates , strengthens US Dollar . Suggests a weak labor market, negative for economy and rate hike prospects, weakens US Dollar . Currency pairs involving the US Dollar (like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY) react sharply to these reports as traders adjust their positions based on the new information. The Link Between Interest Rates and the Dollar Monetary policy, particularly the level of Interest Rates set by the Federal Reserve, is a major determinant of currency value. Higher interest rates generally make a country’s currency more attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns on their bond holdings and deposits. When the Fed signals a potential for higher rates (often driven by strong Economic Data , especially Inflation Data ), demand for the US Dollar tends to increase. Conversely, expectations of rate cuts can put downward pressure on the Dollar. This relationship is crucial because central banks use interest rates to manage inflation and stimulate or cool down the economy. The market’s anticipation of these policy moves is what often drives currency fluctuations even before the policy changes occur. Why is Inflation Data So Critical Right Now? In the current economic climate, controlling inflation remains a top priority for central banks globally, including the Federal Reserve. Therefore, Inflation Data releases, such as the CPI and PPI, are perhaps the most impactful reports for predicting the Fed’s next steps regarding Interest Rates . Persistent high inflation could force the Fed to maintain a restrictive monetary policy or even consider further rate hikes, bolstering the US Dollar . Conversely, a significant drop in inflation could give the Fed room to consider rate cuts, potentially weakening the Dollar. Investors are looking for clear signs that inflation is sustainably moving towards the Fed’s target. Any surprises in this data can lead to significant volatility across all asset classes, including the Forex Market . What Does This Mean for Crypto Investors? (Actionable Insights) You might be wondering, how does the US Dollar ‘s strength and these Economic Data releases affect my crypto portfolio? While crypto markets have their own unique drivers, they are not entirely isolated from macroeconomics. Here’s the typical dynamic: Dollar Strength vs. Risk Assets: The US Dollar is often seen as a safe haven. When the Dollar strengthens (driven by factors like higher Interest Rates or economic uncertainty), investors sometimes move away from riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. This can put downward pressure on crypto prices. Liquidity: Monetary policy affects overall market liquidity. Higher interest rates and a stronger Dollar can sometimes tighten liquidity, making it harder for capital to flow into risk assets. Sentiment: Positive or negative surprises in key Economic Data can shift overall market sentiment, impacting investor appetite for risk. What to watch for: Pay close attention to how the market reacts immediately following the release of major data points like CPI and employment figures. Observe the Dollar Index (DXY) and its correlation (or lack thereof) with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. While the correlation isn’t always perfect, it’s a significant factor to consider in your analysis. Navigating the Uncertainty Predicting market reactions to Economic Data is never guaranteed. Sometimes, ‘priced-in’ expectations mean the market barely moves, even on significant news. Other times, a small surprise can trigger a large reaction. Key challenges include: Interpreting complex data sets. Understanding market expectations vs. actual results. Accounting for other global factors (geopolitics, energy prices, etc.). Staying informed about the macroeconomic calendar and understanding the potential implications of key data releases is crucial for making informed decisions, whether you’re trading Forex, stocks, or cryptocurrencies. In Summary The recent edging higher of the US Dollar is a clear signal that markets are bracing for impactful Economic Data releases. These reports, particularly those related to Inflation Data and the labor market, will heavily influence expectations for Federal Reserve Interest Rates and consequently, the direction of the Forex Market . While crypto markets have unique characteristics, they are part of the broader financial ecosystem and can be affected by these macro trends. Staying informed about these key economic indicators is a smart move for any investor looking to navigate the coming weeks.

While the spotlight often shines on Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP is quietly positioning itself for a headline-worthy move. With its market cap now at $133 billion – just shy of Tether’s $148 billion – XRP could soon reclaim a spot among the top three cryptocurrencies. But unlike USDT, whose growth hinges on increased issuance, XRP’s rise is being fueled by real price appreciation. There’s something different about its current setup, and if you’ve been watching closely, the signs are hard to ignore. Let’s dig deeper. XRP vs Tether: Same Numbers, Very Different Stories Here’s what makes this potential flip so interesting – USDT is a stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar. Its value doesn’t change, and its market cap grows only when more tokens are issued. In short: it expands by minting. XRP’s story? Completely different. It’s gaining ground the hard way – through price appreciation. In the last week alone, XRP jumped 8.82% while Bitcoin and Ethereum moved far less in comparison. Dig a little deeper and the contrast becomes clearer. XRP’s trading volume is strong – over $3 billion – with a balanced buy/sell ratio (58% to 42%). USDT, meanwhile, is seeing more selling than buying, with 88% of its 24-hour trades leaning bearish. That kind of sentiment doesn’t exactly scream strength. Technical Setup: Bulls Are Back in Control For the first time in months, XRP is trading above its 50, 100, and 200-day EMAs; a sign of serious bullish momentum. And it’s happening right after XRP broke out of a long-standing descending channel, which had been capping its growth for ages. Now, XRP is holding strong at $2.28, with key support near $2.22 thanks to the 100-day EMA. If it keeps up this pace, we could see it test the $2.50–$3.00 zone. That would be more than a price milestone but would likely push it past Tether in market cap. XRP/USDT Chart by TradingView Why This Flip Actually Matters So, let’s take a step back. XRP overtaking Tether is not just a numbers game but is actually very symbolic. After years of regulatory hurdles and market uncertainty, XRP is once again being recognized for its real-world utility – fast, cost-effective cross-border payments – and not just its legal drama with the SEC. With 58.44 billion tokens in circulation, it’s climbing through genuine demand, not supply tricks. That alone sets it apart in a market flooded with hype. So while Bitcoin consolidates around $95K and Ethereum plays it safe near $1,835, XRP is moving up. And if the current market mood stays even slightly risk-on, that #3 spot might have a new owner very soon.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-29 13:53:49

Federal prosecutors said Mashinsky was the architect of a years-long fraud and self-dealing scheme that resulted in billions of dollars in consumer losses. Mashinsky ultimately admitted to lying to clients about the safety of their investments and of self-dealing in the CEL token. According to a 97-page government sentencing memorandum filed April 28, Celsius users could not obtain roughly $4.7 billion in crypto assets after June 12, 2022, when the platform closed withdrawals. Prosecutors say a harsh sentence was needed to deter other bad actors in the cryptocurrency space. The sentencing is set for May 8. “The Court should sentence Alexander Mashinsky to twenty years’ imprisonment as just punishment for his years-long campaign of lies and self-dealing that left in its wake billions in losses and thousands of victimized customers,” the DOJ stated. DOJ urges 20-year sentence for Mashinsky over deliberate fraud scheme In the memo filed late Monday, the DOJ urged the court to send him to prison for at least 20 years, calling his crimes a “deliberate, calculated” fraud scheme that ruined the savings of thousands of people and led to nearly $7 billion in losses to customers. Earlier, prosecutors claimed that Mashinsky, who entered a guilty plea in December for manipulating Celsius’s CEL token and falsely representing the security of customer deposits, refused to take accountability for his crimes and blamed his victims, regulators, and market forces. Additionally, based on their argument concerning Mashinsky’s crime, they wrote that his crimes were not the result of a lack of wisdom, negligence, or misfortune. They revealed that they were the outcome of conscious, well-thought-out choices to steal, lie, and deceive to increase one’s wealth. This all began in 2021 when Celsius was managing over $20 billion in customer cryptocurrency assets at its peak—driven largely by Alex Mashinsky’s aggressive promotion of the platform as a low-risk, high-yield alternative to traditional banking. However, prosecutors claimed that those assurances were false, claiming that Celsius had publicly assured customers that their money was secure while engaging in risky trading, taking out uncollateralized loans, and covertly using customer assets to manipulate the price of its CEL token. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan accused Mashinsky and Celsius’s former chief revenue officer, Roni Cohen-Pavon, of manipulating the market for the company’s crypto token. Cohen-Pavon pleaded guilty in September 2023 and agreed to cooperate with the prosecutors’ investigation. While Mashinsky emerged as a key figure in the Celsius fraud, others were also involved in the massive cryptocurrency scam, including Shlomi Daniel Leon, who co-founded Celsius with Mashinsky in 2017. Formerly Celsius’s chief strategy officer (CSO), Leon quit his job in October 2022, months after Celsius’ collapse in June. In July 2023, the Federal Trade Commission charged Leon, along with Mashinsky and another co-founder, Hanoch Goldstein, and issued a $4.7 billion fine against the bankrupt lender. Mashinsky led a $7 billion loss for clients Prosecutors claimed that Mashinsky personally sold more than $48 million worth of CEL at inflated prices while claiming to be “HODLing” with his customers. In July 2022, Celsius filed for bankruptcy, trapping roughly $4.7 billion in customer funds. Following bankruptcy, clients faced a deficit of more than $1 billion. Prosecutors calculate the overall loss to be closer to $7 billion after accounting for the current cryptocurrency prices following the “Trump-trade” rally in 2024. To wrap up the necessary action regarding Mashinsky’s act, anything less than a substantial prison term, according to the prosecution, would not adequately convey the seriousness of Mashinsky’s actions, erode legal respect, and send the wrong message to other cryptocurrency executives who might be tempted to pursue their own financial gain at the expense of their clients.

Monero, which obscures the sender's and recipient's addresses to provide an untraceable currency , has limited liquidity on exchanges, which makes it harder for users to transact without affecting the market and exposes them to slippage, the chance of the price changing for the worse before the deal is finalized. The decision to go through an illiquid cryptocurrency is unusual. Tether's USDT or ether ( ETH ) would have provided an easier, less-slippage-prone way of moving the funds about, and mixers such as Tornado Cash could help obscure the transaction path. Of course, stablecoins like USDT are also easier to intercept and freeze . Trading data, however, suggests there was more going on than a simple case of someone trying to launder stolen funds. The possible hacker very likely did encounter slippage during the transaction. Combined market depth, which measures order book liquidity over a given price range, was relatively low at around $1 million per 2% on both sides of the book. XRM surged by 45% due to the limited liquidity on exchanges, meaning they could have lost as much as 20% — $66 million — by purchasing XMR rather than a more-liquid token. For a more complete picture, take a look at derivative markets. While monero was surging, open interest — the number of outstanding futures and options contracts — in XMR on the main centralized exchanges more than doubled to $35.1 million, according to Coinalyze . A 45% rise in XMR's price should have boosted open interest only to $24.2 million instead of the figure it ended up at. Taking into account the $1 million in liquidations, someone, or some people, were already long on XMR to the tune of $11 million. While the price increase on that holding wouldn't have compensated for the full amount of slippage, it would help soften the blow. Moreover the figure doesn't take into account any positions that might have existed in decentralized exchanges, and let's not forget the funds were probably stolen in the first place, so the (assumed) perpetrators are still a couple of million dollars ahead. This is not the first time bad actors have flooded spot purchases to move the derivative needle. Last month a trader manipulated JELLY prices on decentralized exchange HyperLiquid. They bought JELLY on illiquid exchanges, tricking the pricing oracle to feed an inaccurate price to HyperLiquid and thus generating profit for holders of long positions. Both cases draw similarities to the $114 million exploit on Mango Markets in 2022, which involved a trader named Avi Eisenberg manipulating MNGO prices by borrowing assets using ill-gotten gains as collateral. Eisenberg was found guilty by a jury in 2024 and faces 20 years in prison.",Finance|Hack|Market Manipulation|Monero|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|USDT|XMR,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-29 13:56:00

The initiative , revealed on April 28, is pending approval from the UAE’s central bank and could place the Emirates squarely in the global blockchain spotlight. A Sovereign Push Into Digital Currency The proposed stablecoin will be anchored to the UAE dirham and regulated under the Central Bank of the UAE’s supervision. According to the firms, the token won’t be limited to conventional financial use cases; it’s also designed to integrate into cutting-edge applications like machine-to-machine (M2M) payments and artificial intelligence (AI) systems. If approved, it will be issued on the ADI blockchain—an infrastructure developed by the ADI Foundation to support public-private blockchain collaboration across financial sectors. ADQ, a key architect behind the project, emphasized the move aligns with its vision of positioning the UAE as a leader in blockchain innovation and building a robust digital backbone for the country’s economy. Founded in 2018, ADQ manages some of the Emirates’ most strategic assets. Meanwhile, IHC, one of the region’s largest conglomerates, with a staggering $243 billion market cap, lends both capital and clout. FAB, the UAE’s biggest bank, rounds out the trio, offering credibility and reach across traditional finance. The Race to De-Dollarize the Stablecoin Market While the dollar remains king in the current stablecoin market —with USDT and USDC collectively commanding 90% of the $230 billion market—this new initiative signals a growing appetite for alternatives. Abu Dhabi’s ambitions echo broader global trends, as more nations begin exploring sovereign-backed digital assets as a hedge against dollar dominance. Notably, Russian finance officials have floated their own ruble-backed stablecoin following wallet freezes linked to the sanctioned exchange Garantex. But analysts remain skeptical about a dramatic shift. A recent Citigroup report noted that, despite increasing regional efforts, most stablecoin supply will likely remain dollar-based, with non-US countries more focused on launching central bank digital currencies . Still, the UAE’s effort is different. It’s not just a political statement—it’s a coordinated strategy by institutions with real infrastructure, capital, and vision.

Circle, the issuer behind the popular USDC stablecoin, has taken a significant step in its global expansion strategy by securing crucial in-principle approval from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). This development marks a pivotal moment for Circle’s presence in the region and highlights Abu Dhabi’s growing importance as a hub for financial technology and digital assets. What Does This Approval Mean for Circle in Abu Dhabi? The in-principle approval granted by the ADGM’s FSRA allows Circle to operate as a money services provider within the international financial center. While not yet a full license, it signifies that Circle has met the initial stringent requirements set by the regulator and can now proceed towards obtaining a final license to offer its services, including stablecoin-related activities, in Abu Dhabi. This is a critical milestone following Circle’s establishment of a legal entity within ADGM back in December 2023, demonstrating their long-term commitment to the jurisdiction. For Circle, this approval is more than just a regulatory step; it’s a strategic move to tap into the burgeoning markets of the Middle East and Africa. The region is witnessing rapid adoption of digital payments and exploring the potential of stablecoins for various use cases, from cross-border remittances to facilitating local commerce. Having a regulated presence in a prominent financial center like ADGM provides Circle with a strong foundation to build trust and expand its offerings across this dynamic landscape. Why is ADGM a Key Jurisdiction for Stablecoin Issuers Like Circle? Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) has positioned itself as a leading international financial center with a progressive and robust regulatory framework for financial services, including virtual assets. Its clear rules and commitment to fostering innovation while maintaining stability make it an attractive destination for global fintech and crypto companies. Here are a few reasons why ADGM stands out: Clear Regulatory Framework: ADGM was one of the first jurisdictions globally to introduce comprehensive regulations for virtual assets, providing certainty for businesses operating in the space. International Standards: The regulatory approach aligns with international best practices, appealing to global players like Circle. Strategic Location: Situated in Abu Dhabi, ADGM offers a gateway to the Middle East, Africa, and beyond. Supportive Ecosystem: ADGM actively works to build an ecosystem that supports financial innovation, attracting talent and investment. By obtaining approval in ADGM, Circle is aligning itself with a regulator that understands digital assets and is committed to creating a secure environment for their operation. This can significantly enhance Circle’s credibility and operational capabilities in the region. Exploring the Impact of Circle’s Expansion in the Middle East Crypto Landscape Circle’s move into Abu Dhabi is set to have a ripple effect across the Middle East crypto scene. As a major stablecoin issuer, Circle’s regulated presence can facilitate greater institutional adoption and usage of stablecoins like USDC for various financial activities. This could include: Enhanced Cross-Border Payments: Stablecoins offer a faster and potentially cheaper alternative for international money transfers, a significant use case in the region. Increased Liquidity: A regulated stablecoin provider can improve liquidity and access to digital asset markets for businesses and individuals in the Middle East. Support for Fintech Innovation: Circle’s presence can encourage the development of new financial products and services built on stablecoin technology within the region. Attracting Further Investment: Regulatory clarity attracts investment, and Circle’s approval could signal to other global players that the Middle East, particularly Abu Dhabi, is open for regulated crypto business. While the in-principle approval is a positive step, the journey towards full operational capability involves further processes with the ADGM FSRA. However, this initial nod is a strong indicator of regulatory confidence in Circle’s operations and compliance standards. What Are the Benefits and Potential Challenges Ahead? The benefits of this approval for Circle are clear: access to a new, high-growth market, enhanced global credibility through ADGM regulation, and a strategic base for regional expansion. For the Middle East, particularly Abu Dhabi, the benefit is attracting a leading global fintech firm, fostering innovation, and strengthening its position as a digital asset hub. However, challenges remain. The process of obtaining a full license requires meeting all final regulatory requirements, which can be rigorous. Furthermore, the regulatory landscape for stablecoins globally is still evolving, and Circle will need to navigate potential changes and ensure ongoing compliance not just in ADGM but across all jurisdictions where it operates. Competition in the digital asset space is also intense, and Circle will need to effectively integrate into the local financial ecosystem. Actionable Insight: For businesses and individuals in the Middle East interested in stablecoins, Circle’s progress in ADGM signals increasing regulatory clarity and the potential for more accessible and secure stablecoin services in the future. Keeping an eye on Circle’s full license approval will be important. Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for Circle and ADGM Circle’s in-principle approval from the ADGM FSRA is a significant landmark event. It underscores the growing importance of regulated stablecoins in the global financial system and highlights Abu Dhabi’s ambition to be a leader in the digital asset space. As Circle moves towards securing a full license, its presence is poised to play a key role in shaping the future of finance and digital payments across the Middle East and Africa, offering new opportunities for innovation and financial inclusion in the region.

Eric Semler Urges Viant Technology to Adopt Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Amid Stock Disruption In a piece published in X, Semler cited Viant’s lagging stock performance and large cash reserves as signs that the company is “ripe” for a bold strategic shift. Viant’s stock has fallen 44% since its 2021 IPO, with a 50% drop in February alone raising investors’ concerns about its long-term growth trajectory. Despite the market pessimism, Viant remains financially healthy. The company holds $205 million in net cash, about 25% of its $900 million market cap, generated $34 million in free cash flow in 2024, and projects steady growth through at least 2028. Semler, who led Semler Scientific’s recent move to Bitcoin as a treasury asset, labeled Viant, along with Zoom Communications (ZOOM) and Coursera (COUR), as part of what he calls the “Zombie Zone”: companies with untapped capital and unclear strategic direction. Neither Zoom nor Coursera have heeded his previous calls for Bitcoin adoption. Viant, founded by the Vanderhook brothers, has already shown interest in the crypto space. Co-founder Chris Vanderhook has previously supported decentralized technologies, citing blockchain, NFTs, and crypto as critical to what he calls the “New Open Web.” Viant also faces increasing competitive pressure from industry giants like Google and Amazon, who continue to consolidate their power in the digital advertising ecosystem. Meanwhile, the commoditization of demand-side platforms has further challenged mid-market players like Viant. Semler argues that a move into Bitcoin could help differentiate Viant from its competitors and provide a hedge against inflation and monetary instability. *This is not investment advice.

Qubetics (TICS) — Unlocking a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Future When thinking about the Best cryptos to buy for hold long-term, Qubetics is charging ahead of the pack. Built as the world’s first true non-custodial multi-chain wallet and blockchain aggregator, Qubetics demolishes barriers between fragmented Web3 ecosystems. Instead of forcing users to manage ten different wallets or swap platforms, Qubetics pulls them all together into one ultra-secure, user-friendly interface. Imagine a world where moving from Solana to Bitcoin to Ethereum feels as easy as flipping a light switch. That’s Qubetics' everyday experience. And for businesses, it means massive savings on cross-chain transaction headaches. What truly sets Qubetics apart? Real-life applications are already lined up. A small e-commerce business in Texas can now accept payments from any blockchain with seamless conversion. A Web3 gaming startup in Seoul can integrate Qubetics’ wallet SDK to offer players multi-chain asset swaps without lifting a finger. Even decentralized finance (DeFi) projects are eyeing Qubetics’ open APIs to tap into liquidity pools across different blockchains without going through a maze of swaps. All of this positions Qubetics as the real MVP of Best cryptos to buy for hold long-term narratives—and it’s just warming up. Then there's the presale that's flipping heads across the crypto presale space. With Stage 32 underway, $TICS is available at $0.2093. Over $16.5 million raised, 25,400+ token holders, and 510 million coins sold tell the story of a project that's already winning serious attention. As the ultimate choice among the Best cryptos to buy for hold long-term, Qubetics' multi-chain mission feels less like a gamble and more like a ground-floor ticket to Web3’s future skyscraper. 2. XRP (XRP) — Quiet Power in Cross-Border Payments XRP remains a fierce competitor in the blockchain arena, even as legal headlines fade into the background. Ripple’s core mission—to streamline global payments—is regaining momentum thanks to partnerships spanning banking giants and payment service providers. As regulatory clarity sharpens in major markets, XRP stands poised to reclaim lost ground and push toward greater adoption. Especially after Ripple’s legal wins, some analysts forecast renewed demand that could position XRP as a banking settlement favorite once again. Recent signals from Ripple’s strategic moves reinforce the coin’s staying power. Ripple's growing traction in Asia-Pacific regions, where traditional banking systems face speed and cost challenges, means XRP might become a behind-the-scenes heavyweight for remittance corridors and B2B payment rails. While it may not offer explosive DeFi integration like newer chains, its serious infrastructure use case gives XRP the kind of staying power crypto veterans love. Still, in terms of sheer technology evolution and ecosystem breadth, XRP is solid—but it doesn’t capture the same multi-chain future Qubetics is building. While XRP may help move money faster, Qubetics aims to let users own, trade, and operate across all blockchains from one sovereign, non-custodial platform. Among the Best cryptos to buy for hold long-term, Qubetics' broader interoperability focus offers much bigger upside potential. 3. Cosmos (ATOM) — Building the Blockchain Internet When Cosmos calls itself the “Internet of Blockchains,” it's not playing around. This project’s entire mission is to connect different blockchains into one unified ecosystem where data and tokens can move freely. That goal aligns closely with what the future of crypto actually needs: interoperability, scalability, and sovereignty. Cosmos' Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol (IBC) is already helping chains talk to each other, and more projects are plugging into the network every month. Cosmos’ model appeals especially to developers seeking customizable blockchains. Instead of building on Ethereum and fighting network congestion, projects can spin up their own independent but interconnected chains within Cosmos' structure. As DeFi, NFTs, and AI-linked blockchains continue booming, Cosmos’ modular model becomes even more attractive to creators needing speed and flexibility. However, while Cosmos' network effect is growing, it’s still somewhat siloed compared to Qubetics' vision. Qubetics doesn’t just connect Cosmos-like chains—it aims to aggregate liquidity, assets, and access across every major blockchain, uniting Layer-1s and Layer-2s in a user-controlled vault. If Cosmos is a highway between a few cities, Qubetics is designing the global air traffic control system. That’s why when hunting the Best cryptos to buy for hold long-term, Qubetics keeps looking stronger. 4. Monero (XMR) — Privacy’s Last Stronghold Monero remains the poster child for blockchain privacy. In a world of increasing surveillance and centralization, Monero offers something many chains can't: true anonymity. With stealth addresses and confidential transactions, XMR continues serving those who believe privacy isn’t just a preference—it’s a right. As governments around the world tighten financial oversight, Monero’s underground appeal could only get stronger. That said, Monero’s Achilles' heel is its niche status. Major exchanges are increasingly reluctant to list privacy coins under regulatory pressure, limiting Monero's growth avenues. Plus, Monero’s lack of multi-chain interaction means it can’t easily plug into larger decentralized ecosystems. If crypto evolves into a multi-chain world (spoiler alert: it’s happening), Monero risks being left out. That's where Qubetics’ non-custodial multi-chain wallet focus becomes unbeatable. Privacy remains important, but interoperability—seamless control across chains—is becoming the ultimate prize. For anyone who wants both control and connectivity, Qubetics isn’t just an alternative—it’s the Best altcoin to buy now for a reason. 5. Polygon (MATIC) — Still Defending Ethereum’s Crown Polygon has firmly earned its spot as Ethereum’s most powerful sidekick. With zk-rollups, POS chains, and an explosion of dApps, Polygon helps Ethereum scale without blowing up gas fees. It’s no wonder some of the biggest Web3 games, DeFi apps, and NFT marketplaces now call Polygon home. And with Polygon 2.0 already rolling out, the network is positioning itself for even greater adoption ahead. Still, despite its impressive gains, Polygon remains tethered to Ethereum’s fate. As Ethereum's base chain evolves, so too must Polygon. That introduces risks and opportunities. Will Ethereum’s future dominance guarantee Polygon's success—or will L2 fragmentation create new challengers? Either way, Polygon is a powerful force, but Qubetics' mission is even bolder. Qubetics doesn’t just extend Ethereum or one Layer-1; it seeks to integrate all major chains under one user-controlled umbrella. That's why when chasing the Best cryptos to buy for hold long-term, Polygon is strong, but Qubetics stands as the multi-chain juggernaut every serious buyer should have on the radar. Conclusion: Why Qubetics Could Outshine Every Other Project In a world chasing the Best cryptos to buy for hold long-term, it’s projects like Qubetics that quietly stack wins while the world is distracted. With its non-custodial multi-chain wallet and Web3 aggregator ecosystem, Qubetics solves real problems in user sovereignty, security, and interoperability. Meanwhile, projects like XRP, Cosmos, Monero, and Polygon shine individually but don’t yet match Qubetics' full-system vision. With Stage 32 priced at just $0.2093, the Qubetics presale feels like a golden entry window. Remember: each presale stage lasts 7 days, prices hike 10% afterward, and the mainnet hits in Q2 2025. When $TICS climbs to $1, early adopters could snag 377.76% ROI. At $5? 2288.80% ROI. At $10? A mind-bending 4677.59% ROI. Imagine holding $100 in $TICS and riding it up to $10 or $15—that’s the stuff of generational wealth moves. Don’t just chase hypes. Make moves. Join the crypto presale that’s setting the future of Web3. Qubetics is the Best altcoin to buy now before the whole world catches on. Don’t miss the chance to join this crypto presale and position yourself ahead of the 2025 mega-wave.

Considering the insufficient bullish momentum, the price is expected to face selling pressure, likely leading to a sideways consolidation, before any breakout emerges. XRP Analysis The Daily Chart XRP has recently retraced upward, testing the critical $2.4 resistance level, an area that aligns with the upper boundary of a long-standing wedge pattern. Despite this bullish attempt, the momentum appears weak, with no convincing signs of sustained buying strength. This $2.4 zone also coincides with the 100-day moving average, reinforcing it as a robust supply area and making it a challenging barrier for bulls to overcome. Given the lack of sufficient market demand and momentum, a rejection from this level is likely, setting the stage for a period of sideways consolidation. Broader market structure indicates that Ripple remains confined between the 100-day and 200-day MAs. A decisive breakout from this range is essential for the market to gain clear direction and witness an impulsive move, either to the upside or downside. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower time frame, XRP’s waning bullish momentum becomes more apparent as the price approaches the significant $2.4 mark. Here, the formation of a potential three-drives pattern suggests buyer exhaustion. The $2.4 level has served as both support and resistance multiple times during the recent consolidation phase, emphasizing its psychological importance. Even if Ripple manages to break above $2.4, the next immediate hurdle lies at the wedge’s upper boundary around $2.5. Only after reclaiming both these levels can buyers aim for the crucial $3 psychological threshold. In the short term, however, a minor pullback seems likely before bulls can mount a stronger attempt to push higher.

A significant announcement has come from the Neo project that requires your immediate awareness. The Layer-1 blockchain network , Neo, has officially declared its plan to discontinue the operation of its original infrastructure, known as the Neo Legacy network . This move marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of the Neo blockchain , signaling a full transition to its next-generation platform, Neo N3. Understanding the Neo Legacy Shutdown Timeline According to an announcement shared on Neo’s official Medium blog, the phased Neo Legacy shutdown is already underway. The first step involves decommissioning the Neo Legacy testnet, which is scheduled to go offline on June 1. This will be followed by the main event: the complete shutdown of the Neo Legacy network mainnet, set for October 31. This date is a critical deadline for anyone still interacting with the older network. Here are the key dates to remember: June 1: Neo Legacy Testnet Shutdown October 31: Neo Legacy Mainnet Shutdown This strategic decision allows the Neo team and its community to fully concentrate resources and development efforts on the advanced Neo N3 network. Why is the Neo Legacy Network Shutting Down? The decision to shut down the Neo Legacy network is a logical step in the project’s lifecycle. Like many technologies, blockchain networks evolve. Neo Legacy, while foundational, has limitations compared to its successor, Neo N3. Maintaining two parallel networks is resource-intensive, both in terms of technical support and development focus. By decommissioning the old network, Neo aims to: Consolidate development efforts solely on Neo N3. Reduce the operational costs associated with maintaining the legacy chain. Streamline the ecosystem, encouraging all participants to leverage the superior capabilities of N3. Potentially improve security and efficiency by having a single, focused infrastructure. This move is less about abandoning the past and more about fully embracing the future of the Neo blockchain . Introducing Neo N3: The Future of the Neo Blockchain Neo N3 represents a significant upgrade over its predecessor. Launched in 2021, N3 was designed to be a more robust, efficient, and developer-friendly platform. It introduced several key improvements that were not present or fully realized on Neo Legacy. Some notable features and benefits of Neo N3 include: Improved Governance: A more decentralized and democratic governance model. Enhanced Performance: Higher transaction throughput and better overall network efficiency. Native Contracts: Built-in contracts for functions like Oracle, State Manager, and NeoID, simplifying development. Cross-Chain Interoperability: Designed with interoperability in mind to connect with other blockchains. Developer Experience: Support for multiple programming languages and improved tooling. The success of the Neo N3 migration is paramount for the continued growth and relevance of the Neo ecosystem in the competitive Layer-1 landscape. What Does the Neo Legacy Shutdown Mean for Users? Actionable Insights for Neo N3 Migration This is perhaps the most critical section for anyone holding NEO, GAS, or NEP-5 tokens on the Neo Legacy network , or running dApps on it. The Neo Legacy shutdown on October 31 is a hard deadline. Any assets or applications remaining on the Legacy chain after this date may become inaccessible or lost. The primary action required is the Neo N3 migration . Users need to move their digital assets (NEO, GAS, and any NEP-5 tokens) from their Legacy wallets to N3-compatible wallets. Similarly, decentralized applications (dApps) built on Neo Legacy must migrate to the Neo N3 platform. Here’s a general guide on what you should do: Verify Your Wallet: Ensure you are using a wallet that supports the Neo N3 network. Many popular wallets have added N3 support. Find Migration Instructions: Refer to official Neo channels (website, documentation, Medium blog) for detailed, step-by-step guides on how to perform the Neo N3 migration . The process typically involves sending assets from your Legacy address using a migration tool or feature provided by Neo or supported wallets. Migrate Your Assets: Follow the official instructions carefully to transfer your NEO, GAS, and NEP-5 tokens to your N3 address. Do this well before the October 31 deadline to avoid last-minute issues. dApp Developers: If you are a developer, consult the Neo N3 documentation for migrating your smart contracts and applications. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official Neo announcements for any updates or changes to the migration process or timeline. Ignoring the Neo Legacy shutdown and the need for Neo N3 migration could result in permanent loss of assets. Act now to secure your holdings on the new network. Comparing Neo Legacy and Neo N3 To understand the significance of the transition, let’s look at some key differences: Architecture: N3 features a more modular and scalable architecture. Governance: N3 introduced a more decentralized governance model with NEO holders participating in electing council members. Smart Contracts: N3 supports more languages and has improved smart contract features. Interoperability: N3 has native support for cross-chain interactions. Fees: N3 utilizes a different fee model (system fees and network fees). The move to N3 is not just an upgrade; it’s a fundamental shift aimed at positioning Neo for future growth in the competitive blockchain network space. The Road Ahead for the Neo Blockchain With the focus shifting entirely to N3, the Neo ecosystem is poised for accelerated development. The team is working on expanding the dApp ecosystem, improving tooling for developers, and enhancing the overall user experience on the new chain. This consolidation is expected to make Neo a more attractive platform for developers and users alike, contributing positively to crypto news surrounding the project. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Deadline! The announcement of the Neo Legacy shutdown is a major development for the Neo community. While it signifies the end of an era for the original network, it underscores Neo’s commitment to its advanced Neo N3 platform. The October 31 mainnet shutdown deadline for the Neo Legacy network is crucial. Users must undertake the necessary Neo N3 migration steps to ensure the safety and accessibility of their assets. Stay informed through official channels and complete your migration well in advance to be part of the future of the Neo blockchain .

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, was slightly higher, opening just over 100 points up amid a raft of earnings reports. Meanwhile, the market’s mixed outlook saw the Nasdaq open lower. At the open, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were down 0.22% and 0.42%, respectively. Although stocks opened mixed, investor sentiment was slightly buoyed by earnings reports and fresh tariffs related news . Specifically on the trade war front, market optimism hinged on reports President Donald Trump’s administration had plans to ease up automaker related tariffs. While these developments suggest a potential dialing down of trade tensions, the U.S.-China situation remains a key concern for investors. Analysts note that the market needs clear communication and signals on trade negotiations; otherwise, jitters will persist and continue to weigh on sentiment.

Also reporting were soft drink giant Coca-Cola and pharmaceutical behemoth Pfizer, among several Wall Street giants releasing highly anticipated first-quarter earnings results. Tuesday saw General Motors (GM), Spotify (SPOT), and Coca-Cola (KO) release their Q1 earnings reports. GM’s results before the bell showed a Q1 earnings beat, although the automaker delayed its 2025 guidance to Thursday. Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE) also reported a Q1 profit beat, although its revenue narrowly missed expectations at $13.7 billion, compared to the consensus estimate of $14 billion. In notable stock mover highlights, shares of Amazon (AMZN) dipped after market reaction to comments from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. She stated that if reports suggesting the e-commerce giant plans to list tariff costs on goods are accurate, the move would be considered “ hostile and political .” Elsewhere in the market, gold slipped 0.65% to $3,226, while Bitcoin ( BTC ) traded around $94,800.

Could Altcoins Rally?,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-as-crypto-market-shifts-bullish-could-altcoins-rally/,"After a two-month-long downfall, which saw the total market cap of the top meme coins fall from $116.6B to just $40B, the meme coin market is up and running again. It has gained a staggering 45% in market cap in around three weeks. The larger crypto market is green, too, with the granddaddy of all cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, climbing over $95K. It’s now within touching distance of its all-time high of $109K. Moreover, last week, Bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest inflows ($3B) since December . Plus, according to a recent forecast by financial services company Standard Chartered, we could see $BTC touching $120K by Q2 2025 . Seeing as it’s only the beginning of what could be a long rally, now’s the best time to beef up your crypto portfolio with some trendy altcoins. To help you out, we’ve handpicked the best crypto to buy now . 1. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – Best PolitiFi Meme Coin Pumping Hard Right Now There’s really no denying that Donald Trump has taken crypto to new heights. For instance, the massive rally in November was on the back of the promises he made in his presidential campaign to make the US more crypto-friendly. Trump indeed delivered on his promises, as we’re now seeing an unprecedented increase in government-level Bitcoin reserves worldwide. Large institutions like Strategy and BlackRock are also buying $BTC left, right, and center. So, it’s only fair that Donald Trump’s very own meme coin, $TRUMP, is strongly placed in the list of the top trending cryptos . $TRUMP has jumped over 50% in the last seven days , and more than 32% in the last month or so. It’s worth noting, however, that $TRUMP is still nowhere close to its full potential. Remember, it reached around $72 when it launched in late January. Another reason to be optimistic about $TRUMP’s future is the president’s direct interest in the project’s prosperity. For instance, he recently announced that the top 220 $TRUMP holders will be invited to dinner with him. 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Themed Coin Offering Free $BTC Airdrops It’s worth remembering that an enthusiastic meme coin market is often the result of the king cryptocurrency, i.e., Bitcoin, soaring to new heights. If you want to make the most of Bitcoin’s rise specifically, consider investing in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , the best Bitcoin-themed crypto on the market right now. While other coins offer more of their own tokens for free as part of their airdrops, $BTCBULL stands out by offering free (and real) $BTC in its airdrops. This is also how it has tied itself to Bitcoin’s success story. BTC Bull Token’s airdrops will take place every time $BTC crosses a new milestone, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Keep in mind that you’ll only be eligible for your share of free Bitcoins if you store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet . What’s more, the developers have also planned to follow a steady burn mechanism, which involves reducing the token’s total supply bit by bit at regular intervals. This is done to boost the token’s demand, trading volume, and ultimately its price. You can join the ‘Bull Army’ by joining the $BTCBULL presale for just $0.002485 per token. The project has raised over $5.1M so far. Want in? Here’s a full guide on how to buy $BTCBULL . 3. Jelly-My-Jelly ($JELLYJELLY) – Utility-Based Token Building Debut Solana L2 Jelly-My-Jelly is a meme coin on the Solana network created by Iqram Magdon-Ismail, the co-founder of Venmo, and Sam Lessin, a crypto investor. On paper, $JEELYJELLY has been touted as the crypto that grants holders early-bird access to the upcoming Jelly Jelly video-sharing app. The app will reportedly offer the fastest way to post bite-sized clips, known as ‘Jellies,’ from a video chat. However, the token’s current bull run is driven by community backing rather than anything else. Jelly-My-Jelly’s recent performance has been just as delicious as its name. It has rocketed 200% in the last seven days – from around $0.012 to $0.033. It’s currently flirting with its major resistance level of $0.40, the break of which could see it shoot to new highs and result in even more mind-boggling gains. 4. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Utility-Based Token Building Debut Solana L2 Solaxy ($SOLX) is unlike most other meme coins mentioned on this list. That’s because it’s a token with real utility and real-world application. Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on Solana, which has been plagued with congestion and scalability issues ever since the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA on it. Meme coin developers prefer Solana because of its high speed and low fees. However, because the network is now experiencing an overload of meme coin traders and investors, it’s no longer as smooth a blockchain as it once was. Solaxy will solve this by processing a bunch of Solana’s transactions on a sidechain. By redirecting transaction requests away from the network’s mainnet, Solaxy will reduce the burden on Solana and restore its speed of executing transactions. Additionally, Solaxy will club several transaction requests and process them together, thereby reducing transaction costs and improving Solana’s affordability. Another reason Solaxy could be the next crypto to explode is its otherworldly presale performance. It has raised over $32.2M at the time of writing, and each token is available for just $0.001708.

43949188,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=394291,1745939872,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/43949188.jpeg,CEL Exploded 80% as US DOJ Seeks 20-Year Sentence for Celsius Founder Mashinsky,https://cryptopotato.com/cel-exploded-80-as-us-doj-seeks-20-year-sentence-for-celsius-founder-mashinsky/,"TL;DR The token saw a sharp price increase after the DOJ called for a severe prison sentence for ex-Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky, accusing him of years-long deception and financial misconduct. His court hearing is scheduled for May 8. CEL Reacts to the Request The native token of Celsius Network – CEL – has seen a steep decline in the past months, plunging below $0.06 earlier in April and later rising to around $0.08. Over the past 24 hours, though, it experienced an 80% price rally, climbing to a 12-week high of almost $0.18. It later lost some ground and currently trades at roughly $0.14 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 70% increase on a daily scale. CEL Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the recent surge, it stands far away from the all-time high of over $8 observed in June 2021. Back then, the asset’s market capitalization neared $3.5 billion, while as of this writing it is at a mere $5.1 million. CEL’s latest upswing follows the US Department of Justice’s (DOJ) request for a 20-year prison sentence for former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky. The federal executive department of the American government described this as “just punishment for his years-long campaign of lies and self-dealing that left in its wake billions in losses and thousands of victimized customers.” The DOJ further argued that Mashinsky misrepresented how Celsius Network handled customer deposits, fabricated the entity’s profitability, and risked clients’ funds on uncollateralized loans and secret trades despite promising he wouldn’t. The condemnation continued with allegations that the former CEO manipulated the price of CEL by creating artificial demand, allowing him to profit by selling his personal stash of tokens at inflated values. “Mashinsky’s conduct made him rich at the expense of Celsius’s customers. When Celsius collapsed into bankruptcy, it wiped out the savings of ordinary retail investors who entrusted their cryptocurrency to the company based on Mashinsky’s lies,” the document reads. The sentencing of Celsius’s former boss is scheduled for May 8. He previously pled guilty to two counts of fraud: one count of commodities fraud and one of securities fraud. He admitted to making false claims about Celsius’s “Earn “ program, which misled investors into depositing their Bitcoin on the platform – earning him an estimated $48 million profit in the process. The Celsius Saga Celsius Network was once a prominent crypto lending platform. In the summer of 2022, though, the company halted customer withdrawals, swaps, and transfers due to “extreme market conditions, “ disclosing serious liquidity issues. Shortly after, the entity filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, revealing a $1.2 billion balance sheet hole and debts of $4.7 billion to users. The following investigations showed that former CEO Mashinsky supposedly misused customer funds and manipulated the price of CEL. He was arrested in July 2023 on multiple fraud charges and later released on a $40 million bond secured by his Manhattan residence. In November 2023, the New York Southern Bankruptcy Court approved a reorganization plan, enabling Celsius to exit bankruptcy. A major component of the program was the creation of a new Bitcoin mining entity, called Ionic Digital, which is owned by Celsius’s creditors. At the beginning of last year, the company started distributing more than $3 billion in cryptocurrency and fiat to affected users as part of its restructuring plan. By the end of August 2024, Celsius had handed out approximately 93% of the approved amount to over 250,000 creditors across 165 countries. A few months later, the company announced plans to distribute an additional $127 million to creditors.

On-chain analytics firm Glassnode recently dropped some interesting data that’s got the crypto community talking, particularly regarding the activity of short-term holders. It seems a key metric, the Hot Capital metric , just hit a significant level, potentially signaling a shift in market dynamics. Understanding the Hot Capital Metric Before diving into the implications, let’s break down what the Hot Capital metric actually is. According to Glassnode , this metric tracks the amount of BTC that has moved on-chain within two specific, short timeframes: Past 24 Hours: This captures very recent activity, often associated with rapid transfers, exchange deposits/withdrawals, or quick trades. Past 7 Days: This expands the view slightly to include movements over the last week, still focusing on coins that haven’t been dormant for long. Essentially, the Hot Capital metric gives us a snapshot of the value of Bitcoin that is actively changing hands or being moved across wallets in the very near term. A high value indicates a large amount of BTC is ‘hot’ – meaning it’s frequently on the move rather than being held long-term. Who Are These Short-Term Holders? The activity captured by the Hot Capital metric is primarily attributed to short-term holders (STHs). In on-chain analysis, STHs are typically defined as wallets that have held Bitcoin for less than 155 days. These market participants are often more reactive to price changes and market news compared to their long-term counterparts. They might be: Traders looking to profit from short-term volatility. New investors entering the market. Individuals moving funds for various reasons, but within a relatively short holding period. Their behavior is crucial because increased activity from this cohort can sometimes precede or coincide with periods of higher volatility or shifts in market sentiment. What Did Glassnode Report? On April 28th, Glassnode reported a notable surge in the Hot Capital metric . It reached a value of $39.1 billion. This wasn’t just a minor fluctuation; it was the highest level seen since February 10th. This specific data point is significant because it marks a level of short-term movement not observed in over two months. Here’s a simple comparison: Metric Value on April 28th Previous High (since Feb 10) Hot Capital metric $39.1 billion Level reached on Feb 10th The fact that the metric hasn’t hit this level since February 10th suggests that the level of recent BTC movement by short-term holders on April 28th was exceptionally high relative to the preceding weeks. Why Does This Spike Matter? Speculative Investors in Focus Glassnode ‘s interpretation of this spike is particularly insightful. They stated that the surge indicates “renewed activity from speculative investors.” This is a key takeaway. When the Hot Capital metric rises sharply, it often implies that participants with a shorter time horizon – those looking for quicker gains or reacting swiftly to market conditions – are becoming more active. Increased activity from speculative investors can signal several things: Increased Risk Appetite: Speculators are typically more willing to take on risk for potential short-term rewards. A rise in their activity might suggest growing confidence in the market’s near-term prospects, or perhaps an attempt to capitalize on anticipated price swings. Potential for Volatility: Higher levels of short-term trading activity can contribute to increased market volatility. Rapid buying and selling by speculators can amplify price movements in either direction. Market Sentiment Indicator: While not a direct measure of sentiment, a surge in the Hot Capital metric driven by speculators can reflect prevailing emotions like FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) during upward trends or panic selling during downturns. The context around April 28th (what was Bitcoin ‘s price doing?) is crucial here for a full interpretation. Liquidity: More frequent movement of BTC by STHs can increase market liquidity, making it easier to buy and sell larger amounts without significantly impacting the price. Comparing April 28th and February 10th To fully appreciate the significance of the April 28th spike, it’s helpful to look at the market context around February 10th. What was happening with Bitcoin price and sentiment back then? Comparing the two periods can offer clues about the nature of the activity observed. Was February 10th also a period of significant price movement or market anticipation? Understanding the historical context helps analysts interpret whether the current spike represents a similar market phase or something new. Actionable Insights for Investors and Traders For those navigating the Bitcoin market, data from firms like Glassnode , particularly metrics like the Hot Capital metric , can provide valuable insights. While no single metric tells the whole story, here’s how you might use this information: Monitor for Volatility: A rising Hot Capital metric could be a heads-up that increased volatility might be on the horizon due to heightened speculative activity. Assess Market Strength: Is the price rising alongside the Hot Capital metric ? This could indicate that new capital (or rapidly moving capital) is flowing in, potentially supporting upward momentum, but also potentially making the rally more susceptible to quick reversals if speculators take profits. Consider Your Time Horizon: If you are a long-term investor, increased STH activity might be less relevant to your strategy, but it’s still useful context for understanding potential short-term price swings. Traders, however, might pay closer attention to capitalize on potential volatility. Combine with Other Metrics: Don’t rely solely on the Hot Capital metric . Look at other on-chain indicators (like exchange flows, dormancy flow, or STH supply) and traditional market indicators (like volume, technical patterns, and news) for a more complete picture. Are There Challenges or Limitations? Like any single metric, the Hot Capital metric has limitations. It shows *movement* but doesn’t always reveal the *reason* for the movement. While Glassnode attributes the spike to speculative investors, the movement could also include legitimate transfers, rebalancing by institutions, or other activities that aren’t purely speculative trading. Relying solely on this metric without considering the broader market context and other data points can lead to misinterpretations. The Bigger Picture for BTC and Short-Term Holders The interaction between short-term holders and the overall Bitcoin market structure is fascinating. STHs often buy near market tops and sell near market bottoms, acting as a counter-indicator for long-term cycles. However, during strong trends, their increased activity can also fuel momentum. The recent spike in the Hot Capital metric suggests that this cohort is actively participating, and understanding their behavior, guided by data from firms like Glassnode , is key to grasping the current market pulse for BTC . Conclusion: What Does the Hot Capital Spike Tell Us? The report from Glassnode highlighting the surge in Bitcoin ‘s Hot Capital metric to $39.1 billion on April 28th is a clear signal of heightened activity among short-term holders . Reaching a level not seen since February 10th, this spike is interpreted as renewed engagement from speculative investors. While this could inject liquidity and potentially fuel short-term price movements, it also points to increased market participation from a cohort known for reactivity, potentially increasing volatility. Keeping an eye on this metric, alongside others, provides valuable insight into the current sentiment and potential direction of the BTC market.

Despite Bitcoin (BTC) Promise, We Experienced the Worst in History!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/huge-claim-about-trump-from-former-white-house-administrator-despite-bitcoin-btc-promise-we-experienced-the-worst-in-history/,"US President Donald Trump has been widely talked about for his Bitcoin and cryptocurrency steps since he officially took office in January. Among his most notable moves to date, Trump’s launch of his own memecoin, TRUMP, and signing an executive order for the US Strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve on March 7 have been the most notable. Trump also created an internal working group to focus on making the US the “world capital of crypto” through an executive order. The order also banned the “establishment, issuance, circulation and use” of a US central bank digital currency (CBDC). While Trump has made many decisions like this, the first 100 days of his presidency have brought unprecedented change to the crypto industry. Along with the change, the news that Trump will have dinner with the largest TRUMP memecoin holders has sparked criticism and controversy. Trump announced tariffs on all US trading partners on April 2, which he called “Liberation Day”, and bloodied Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Markets hit rock bottom after Trump's statements. The 100 Worst Days in History! Trump has been providing engagement in both directions, with former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci claiming that Trump’s first 100 days have been the “worst in modern presidency” despite his cryptocurrency promises. Scaramucci said the trade war, which Trump first started with his tariff announcements, was a major political failure. Secondly, he said that the discussions around Trump's own token have negatively affected the industry and could jeopardize the industry's efforts to make changes in Congress. “I would say we've had the worst 95 days in modern presidential history. Markets have recovered a little bit, but $9 trillion is gone from the stock exchanges. You had a booming economy before, and now it's headed for a mid-size recession, probably a deep recession. Trump has inflamed everything so much that he has made it difficult for [stablecoin legislation – GENIUS] to even happen. Trump's tariff moves are not helping the US.” *This is not investment advice.

As this digital token climbs, the question arises whether Pepe , another notable cryptocurrency, can mirror this explosive growth. Dive into the analysis of these coins and discover which ones are set to soar next. Fartcoin Surge: Dynamic Momentum with Clear Trading Ranges Fartcoin experienced a robust surge over the past month with a 157.22% jump, while the six-month change of 4.42% shows a more tempered long-term movement. Price performance was volatile in the short term, reflecting heightened investor activity and acute market reactions that gradually faded over a longer period. The rapid monthly gain indicates a burst of interest amid a more conservative six-month backdrop. Fartcoin now trades between $0.22 and $0.67, with key resistance levels at $0.88 and $1.33 and support near $0. Weekly gains of 15.52% and an RSI close to 63 suggest bullish conditions. The trend appears range-bound, providing trading opportunities by buying near support and targeting a break above resistance. Pepe Price Surge: Strong Short-Term Gains and Key Levels Over the last month, Pepe experienced a significant rise with a 21.83% gain, boosted further by a 13.56% jump in just one week. Over the past six months, performance dipped by 9.02%, reflecting overall volatility. The coin has shown rapid short-term recoveries despite a challenging longer-term backdrop. The current price trades between $0.0000052 and $0.0000092 with key resistance at $0.0000112 and crucial support at $0.0000032. RSI at 61.05 and positive momentum indicators hint at bullish pressure, though a clear trend remains elusive. Traders could consider strategic entries near support and exits at resistance to capitalize on current moves. Conclusion FARTCOIN 's recent surge past key levels shows strong momentum. If PEPE can attract similar interest and buyer enthusiasm, it might also break through its current barriers. Keeping an eye on market trends and investor sentiment will be crucial for both coins.

The dip below the $0.60 support could signal a shakeout before a stronger move, as heavy activity points to renewed positioning by traders. Here’s the upcoming Mainnet migration work based on the network’s priorities. Learn more at https://t.co/fFqpZcgA8M pic.twitter.com/GWaFgRIj1g — Pi Network (@PiCoreTeam) April 22, 2025 This marks a notable shift in sentiment, as trading volume had been steadily declining — hitting a monthly low of $60 million — before suddenly surging. Many traders saw this lull as a sign that Pi may have reached a local bottom. Since the launch of its public mainnet, PI has dropped 80.6% from its all-time high of $2.98 , with much of the pressure linked to the network’s strict KYC requirements — a barrier for investors wanting to withdraw their tokens. Adding to the skepticism, major CEXs like Binance and Coinbase have yet to list PI, citing concerns around KYB procedures and ongoing allegations of fraud tied to the project. Still, with over $100 million in daily volume , the question now is whether this rebound in activity could mark the start of a recovery — and if PI has a shot at reclaiming $1 in the weeks ahead. PI Needs to Recapture the $0.6170 Level to Climb Back to $1 Looking at the hourly chart, the price rejected a move above the $0.6170 level on Monday. This had been a key area of support previously and has now become resistance. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has already entered oversold levels, which means that the sell-off may have gone too far. The price tried to bounce during the Asian session but was met with an equally strong downward pressure right after. The $0.5700 support seems to be the key level to watch as the session progresses. Trading volumes at these lows have been strong, meaning that the odds favor the continuation of the downtrend for PI. For PI to recover to $1 it would have to first break above the $0.6170 level. As momentum indicators have reached extreme levels, this could happen in the near term. However, a strong indication that the token is ready to reverse its downtrend would be a bullish crossover between the 200-hour EMA and the 21-hour EMA. As PI struggles to regain momentum, top crypto presales like MIND of Pepe (MIND) are thriving — with the project now approaching $9 million raised since its launch in January. MIND of Pepe (MIND) Set to Dominate Social Media with AI-Powered Influence MIND of Pepe (MIND) is an AI agent token designed to engage massive online audiences, spark viral discussions, and deliver real-time insights exclusively for its community of holders. As MIND of Pepe interacts with high-profile accounts across social media platforms like X, it will gather vital information that it will then pass on to $MIND holders so they can take advantage of the most attractive opportunities in the market. In addition, the AI agent will have the power to launch and promote its own meme coins — tapping into trending topics and capturing viral attention in real time. Right now, $MIND is available at a discounted presale price of $0.0037465 , giving early buyers a prime opportunity to secure maximum upside before the token lists on exchanges and the AI agent goes live. To buy $MIND, simply head to the MIND of Pepe website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH or use a bank card to make your investment.

SoFi was compelled to discontinue its crypto investing services in late 2023 as a condition for securing its bank charter during a period of intensified federal scrutiny of digital assets. At the time, users could trade over 20 cryptocurrencies but were either redirected to Blockchain.com or required to liquidate their holdings. Thanks to updated guidance from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), SoFi is preparing a more ambitious return to the crypto space, Noto told CNBC in an interview aired late Monday. “We’re going to re-enter the crypto business, which we had to exit,” Noto said. “This time, we’re planning a broader, more integrated approach—embedding crypto or blockchain capabilities across all of our product areas.” SoFi’s crypto comeback tracks growing interest in digital assets SoFi’s move signals renewed interest from traditional financial institutions in crypto, particularly under a Trump-era regulatory environment. In January, the CEOs of Bank of America and Morgan Stanley expressed readiness to explore crypto opportunities, while digital-native firms like Circle and BitGo are pursuing banking licenses, further merging the boundaries between legacy finance and digital assets. According to Noto, SoFi aims to resume crypto investing services by year-end, pending any unforeseen regulatory or operational setbacks. He pointed to a recent OCC letter clarifying that federally regulated banks can engage in crypto activities—a move he described as a “fundamental shift” in the oversight of digital finance. With a more favorable regulatory climate emerging—driven by deregulatory moves from Trump-appointed officials and proposed legislation to formalize stablecoin oversight—Noto believes SoFi can go beyond crypto investing. Over the next six to 24 months, SoFi intends to integrate crypto and blockchain technologies across its core offerings, including lending, saving, spending, investing, and insurance. That timeline could be accelerated with acquisitions, he added. Noto said their aspirations are as broad as those of any other product that they have, and they believe the company can leverage the technology across lending, savings, spending, and investing. Future offerings could include crypto-backed loans and payment features that allow customers to transact directly using their digital assets. SoFi’s record growth and improved credit metrics position it to lead in crypto SoFi Technologies Inc. reportedly brought in 800,000 new customers in the latest quarter, helping to propel the company to better-than-expected overall results. SoFi noted that its credit performance has improved, with a 3.31% annualized charge-off rate for personal loans during the first quarter, compared with 3.37% in the fourth quarter. SoFi noted that those numbers account for asset sales, originations, and delinquency sales. With increasing customer demand for diversified investment options and a shift in regulatory attitudes, SoFi could capitalize on both traditional financial services and the growing appeal of blockchain-based technologies. According to a report by Fidelity, governments worldwide will finally overcome years of reticence about buying Bitcoin and start pouring money into cryptocurrencies in 2025. If the prediction published by the asset manager turns out to be correct, it would significantly change how most countries deal with Bitcoin . Since the cryptocurrency was created 16 years ago, many nations have opposed creating Bitcoin reserves alongside their traditional foreign currency and gold stockpiles because of the perceived risk and lack of regulatory clarity. Any move by countries to establish national Bitcoin reserves, particularly by large, wealthy nations, would help solidify the asset as a legitimate store of value and likely trigger a surge in its price. Fidelity expects some countries to start buying Bitcoin for their treasuries and central banks to hedge against financial instability, much like gold reserves.

Since changing its options strategy, the fund has not been able to produce much more income, and the last two distributions are the lowest ever. Investors are cautioned to consider the reasons they own the fund, and if there are other strategies that could outperform CONY while providing the same exposure to income and risk. There is a specific mindset that investors need to have for these funds, and I cannot give single-stock covered call ETFs like CONY a buy rating. Too much risk remains on the table, and investors should consider how long they're willing to grind down their price and cost basis at the same time. Introduction Regular readers of mine will know that I have a complicated relationship with YieldMax, going back and forth with their funds, typically assigning sell or hold ratings on single-stock covered call funds. In fact, I was the second analyst on Seeking Alpha to cover the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ), and the first to give it a sell rating (although certainly not the last). For the record, the only YieldMax funds that have managed to get a buy rating out of me are its diversified fund-of-funds offering, like the Magnificent Seven fund YMAG , or the "" one of everything "" fund YMAX . I was off by an hour, for the record, from being the first when I published YieldMax Strikes Out Again With CONY , back in December 2023. Since then, the fund has outperformed the S&P 500 on a total return basis, despite a near-70% loss in its share price. Here is the performance against SPX from the publication of my first article. Data by YCharts Here is CONY compared to its reference asset, Coinbase Global, Inc. ( COIN ), which CONY sells calls against for income. Keep in mind that Coinbase doesn't pay regular dividends, so its total return is entirely capital appreciation; that is why its price and total return lines have such a high correlation. This chart goes back to CONY's inception, before I initiated coverage of it. Data by YCharts Unfortunately for the DRIP crowd, reinvesting dividends hasn't saved anyone from underperformance. While total return on YCharts shows dividends paid, but not reinvested, we see CONY underperform COIN even with DRIP. You can play around with timelines and such using the tool yourself, but I just went back to CONY's inception to get the largest data set I could. Dividend Channel Last Year's Upgrade Note that I upgraded CONY to a hold in December 2024, but made it very clear that my upgrade was contingent on investors understanding several things about CONY: The price will continue to grind down endlessly, making total return the best metric to consider for overall returns. The fund will likely underperform buy and hold COIN strategies that sell shares instead of harvest volatility, given that COIN has a bullish future. Dividends will be unpredictable and variable. Position sizing is often more important than security selection, and investors were advised not to exceed a 2% allocation in an aggressive income portfolio. In my December 2024 coverage, I said that I was wrong about my December 2023 coverage, and that CONY could add value for some investors. Was I right to do that? Well, my thoughts on YieldMax funds have shifted over time. Back in 2023, when many of these funds were fresh, I held a far more negative view of them. A year later, several more fund launches, and a more-recent shift in options strategy , and I saw a world in which aggressive income investors loaded up on funds like CONY trying to capitalize on COIN's high volatility. So long as these investors were getting the income they wanted from the fund, they were okay with the price falling, and adapting to the total return model of investing over a more traditional approach of buying, holding, and then selling price-appreciated shares of funds to shore up cash as necessary. I still believe much of what I said before, and will likely never own CONY or any other YieldMax single stock fund. I do not find value in them for my personal investing strategy, but mine is not the only one being employed by investors. To that end, let's take a look at CONY and see if it warrants keeping the hold rating. While I am unwilling to issue a buy rating because of the risk that single-stock covered call funds pose to investors. CONY Holdings & Strategy The primary reason folks invest in CONY is so that YieldMax can execute a complicated options strategy on their behalf. This has resulted in a distribution rate that is very high, at times exceeding 100% and hitting 150% at its peak. Currently, the advertised rate is nearly 70%. YieldMax ETFs Recently, YieldMax made changes to their options strategy, which I started noticing back in February when I reviewed AMZY , the Amazon ( AMZN ) version of CONY. Their strategy has become more consistent with my expectations for the PnL of the strategy, and I encourage folks to check that article out for a detailed breakdown of the options strategy. For those wanting just the basics, here's what you need to understand about the strategy. It operates like this: The fund uses its NAV to buy US Treasuries of various maturities, which generate a cash yield and secure its options trades. The fund then establishes a ""synthetic long"" position using a married call and put to replicate the PnL of long COIN stock, secured by the treasuries. Intraday, the fund trades short call spreads on COIN to generate income. When you put all of those together, you get top holdings that look like this: YieldMax ETFs Because the fund trades intraday, and is constantly changing, any modelling I do now will be out-of-date by the time this article is published. That doesn't mean that we can't take a look at the general PnL of the strategy . CONY Dividends CONY's dividends, as expected, are erratic. This is because they are dependent on two factors: The volatility in COIN The skill of the fund managers Since there is no system (or at least, their system is a black box), we just have to hope that the managers are catching the timing on their options trades to avoid losses (which eats at the NAV of the fund) and produce high income. When looking at CONY's dividend history, we can see that dividends are highly variable. While the managers can control their own trading, they don't decide on the underlying volatility of COIN, which is a determining factor concerning options pricing, i.e., where the income comes from. Data by YCharts Despite recent volatility in COIN, we don't see the corresponding higher income in CONY, indicating that something has gone wrong inside the black box, likely that the short call options were sold at inopportune times and bought back at even worse times, reducing the cash on hand. This last distribution was the lowest since inception. CONY Taxes One thing I have liked about the YieldMax funds in my last few reviews is the tax treatment they are striving for. Because of a rule at the IRS, options income is considered return of capital (""RoC"") when distributed to shareholders of funds. This means that distributions from CONY are largely RoC, which has an interesting tax situation. I recently covered this same topic with another YieldMax fund, and so I am going to share the tax guidance I made in my latest NVDY article , as it applies here as well. NVDY's distributions are almost entirely (nearly 100%, if not 100% in most cases) classified as [RoC]... ...distributions classified as RoC work against your cost-basis, and [do] not count as taxable in the year you received the income. Instead, the taxable event occurs when you sell the shares, which could be deferred until a more advantageous time at the investor's discretion. This is a very useful tool for investors, and makes NVDY more competitive with long-stock, which also benefits from capital gains tax rates vs. income tax rates... It should be of note that if your cost basis hits zero on your position, any future distributions will be taxable in the year you received them, and classified as long-term capital gains. When looking at the YieldMax supplemental tax forms , make sure to select ""Group C"" when looking for CONY. As of 2025, forms are no longer being published under the individual funds, but in their respective groups. This means that forms under CONY on that site are all from 2024, and its 2025 distributions are held in the Group C forms. Looking through them, we see that the last distribution CONY made was considered 95% RoC. What net investment income (""NII"") does come through is largely from the treasuries positions. YieldMax ETFs Coinbase or Bitcoin? Naturally, if one wants to own CONY, they are likely bullish on COIN to some extent. Note that if you are very bullish, it will always be better for investors to own long stock of COIN over CONY. CONY will shine if COIN trades flat for a long period of time, which has not happened over COIN's life. COIN typically trades in very volatile swings, which covered call funds notoriously miss out on because of their short exposure. If investors are bullish on COIN, they are likely bullish on Bitcoin, and may be interested in comparing CONY to the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ), which I covered last month . This is also a worthwhile investment on the income front and could easily compete with CONY for investor dollars trying to gain options-income exposure to these kinds of risky assets (crypto, crypto stocks, etc.). Over the lifespan of YBTC, as it is younger than CONY by a few months, it has gone back and forth with periods of outperformance and periods of underperformance from a total return perspective. Data by YCharts Suitability I am not changing my suitability guidance, especially now that we're seeing CONY's absolute dividends decline. While the yield has remained high, that is mostly due to the erosion of the price. This may eventually cause the fund to reverse split, like TSLY did , which is effectively a way for the fund to raise its price without providing appreciation to shareholders. This raising of the price would allow the fund to erode it back down again, restarting the process. Through that process, the total return could be very high, and so some investors may be interested in CONY. There is a clear argument for those who are willing to manually sell their own options or for those who are willing to buy-and-hold the underlying assets and sell shares when cash is needed, as both may outperform CONY moving forward, just as they have in the past. However, CONY offers investors the ability to have cash hit their account regularly, in relatively high amounts, regardless of its price erosion history. My argument is that so long as investors are on board with that, and that's what they want, why not give it to them? On my recent NVDY article , I had a reader declare: Context is everything. Isn't it really just like investing in a business? You buy equipment (the hi-yield ETF) which just churns out product (the distributions) on a regular and profitable income basis. In a business, over time, you depreciate your equipment (loss of NAV) yet it still churns out oodles of cash. If you're a retired investor with a smaller-sized portfolio, this approach can potentially sustain you with income, whereas taking distributions from the principle of a smaller, low yield portfolio would eventually deplete your funds and leave you in the gutters. Whether you agree with this or not is a different story, and it is definitely not my mindset… But then again, I also have never owned any YieldMax funds personally. I'm not their target audience. To quote my last CONY article's suitability section: To this end, I am now recommending that aggressive income investors consider up to a 2% allocation to CONY. Note that the words aggressive here are always subject to interpretation, but I really mean it that investors worried about losing their investments, even a little, should not consider CONY... I formerly rated this fund as a sell, since I believed at the time that it had no place in any portfolio. However, now I am rating CONY a hold. It may have a place in a very aggressive portfolio and in a very small amount. Remember that position sizing can often be more important than security choice. Conclusion Ultimately, the YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ((CONY)) is keeping its hold rating from me, despite several major caveats that investors need to consider, like the potential for continued underperformance of CONY against buy-and-hold COIN or Bitcoin covered call funds like Roundhill's YBTC. I advise that investors consider the fund very carefully, and go into the endeavor with the right mindset. Just as in my last article, I'm concluding that YieldMax funds are still ""not for me,"" and ""not for most,"" regardless of the positive change in strategy they have been employing over the last few months. Recent lows in distribution show that increased volatility isn't helping CONY as much as previously thought, and the future of distributions is unclear. There is too much active manager risk to forecast future payments accurately.

Binance Alpha, a specific feature integrated within the popular Binance Wallet, is designed precisely for this purpose: shining a light on promising early-stage crypto projects. And the latest project to gain this valuable spotlight? MilkyWay (MILK). According to a report from BWEnews on X, MilkyWay (MILK) has officially been added to the Binance Alpha list. This isn’t just a random selection; Binance Alpha carefully curates projects based on factors like strong community engagement and emerging market trends observed among early projects. However, it’s crucial to understand that being featured on Binance Alpha is a significant step, but it comes with important caveats, particularly regarding future exchange listings. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does it Matter for Early Crypto Projects ? Think of Binance Alpha as a discovery engine for potential gems in the crypto ecosystem. It’s not the main Binance exchange itself, but rather a curated section within the Binance Wallet . Its primary goal is to provide visibility to Early Crypto Projects that show potential, allowing users to explore and engage with them before they potentially gain wider recognition. Here’s a breakdown of what Binance Alpha aims to achieve: Highlighting Innovation: It serves as a platform to showcase novel ideas and technologies emerging in the blockchain space. Community-Driven Selection: Projects are often selected based on organic growth, active community participation, and positive sentiment. Trend Identification: Binance Alpha keeps an eye on market trends to identify project categories or narratives gaining traction. Early Access for Users: It gives users within the Binance ecosystem a heads-up about projects that are still in their nascent stages. For Early Crypto Projects , being featured on Binance Alpha is a considerable achievement. It grants them exposure to a massive user base and lends a degree of credibility simply by being associated with the Binance name, even if it’s not a full exchange listing. Spotlighting MilkyWay MILK Token : What Do We Know? The focus of this recent announcement is the addition of the MilkyWay MILK Token to the Binance Alpha list. While the initial report is brief, it signals that the MilkyWay project has met the criteria Binance Alpha uses for selection – likely demonstrating notable community interest and aligning with current market trends for early-stage ventures. At this stage, details provided by the announcement itself are limited to the fact of its inclusion. For users interested in the MilkyWay MILK Token , this inclusion should serve as a prompt for further investigation. What is the MilkyWay project? What problem does it aim to solve? What is the utility of the MilkyWay MILK Token within its ecosystem? These are all crucial questions to research before considering any engagement with the project. Navigating the World of Early Crypto Projects : Potential and Pitfalls The allure of Early Crypto Projects is the potential for significant growth. Getting involved with a project early, especially one highlighted by a platform like Binance Alpha , can theoretically lead to substantial returns if the project succeeds and its token gains value. However, it’s vital to approach Early Crypto Projects with extreme caution. They are inherently high-risk investments. Here are some key points to consider: Volatility: Prices of early tokens can be highly volatile and subject to rapid swings. Unproven Technology: The project’s technology or business model may still be in development or untested in real-world conditions. Liquidity Issues: Trading volume for early tokens can be low, making it difficult to buy or sell large amounts without impacting the price. Potential for Scams: The early-stage nature can sometimes attract malicious actors running ‘rug pulls’ or fraudulent schemes. Lack of Information: Comprehensive data, audits, and track records might be limited compared to established projects. Being featured on Binance Alpha provides visibility but does not eliminate these risks. It’s a signal for potential interest, not an endorsement of the project’s safety or future success. Binance Listing vs. Binance Alpha: Understanding the Crucial Difference Perhaps the most important point highlighted in the original announcement is the distinction between being listed on Binance Alpha and securing a full Binance Listing on the main exchange. These are two very different things. Being on Binance Alpha means the project is being showcased within the Binance Wallet feature for early discovery. It acknowledges the project’s existence and potential interest from the community or market. A full Binance Listing , on the other hand, means the token is available for trading on one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This involves a rigorous due diligence process by Binance, evaluating the project’s fundamentals, legal standing, security, and market demand. A full listing typically results in significantly increased liquidity, accessibility, and price discovery. The announcement explicitly states that inclusion in Binance Alpha does not guarantee a future Binance Listing on the main exchange. This is a critical piece of information for anyone looking at the MilkyWay MILK Token or any other project featured on Alpha. Users should not invest based solely on the hope of a future listing, as that outcome is uncertain and depends on many factors beyond the Alpha feature. How Binance Wallet Feature Enhances Early Discovery The integration of the Alpha feature directly into the Binance Wallet makes the discovery process more accessible for Binance users. Instead of having to scour various forums, social media, or obscure websites, users can potentially find interesting Early Crypto Projects directly within the environment they already use for managing their crypto assets. This Crypto Wallet Feature acts as a curated entry point, potentially saving users time in identifying projects that have at least met Binance Alpha’s initial criteria. However, it also places the responsibility firmly on the user to conduct their own thorough research (DYOR – Do Your Own Research) before making any investment decisions regarding the MilkyWay MILK Token or any other featured project. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts Given the addition of the MilkyWay MILK Token to Binance Alpha , what steps should interested individuals take? Research MilkyWay: Dive deep into the project’s whitepaper, team, technology, use case, and community. Understand what problems it solves and its roadmap. Explore Binance Alpha: If you are a Binance Wallet user, check out the Alpha feature to see how projects are presented and what information is available. Assess the Risks: Be realistic about the high risks associated with Early Crypto Projects . Only invest what you can afford to lose. Do Not Assume Listing: Reiterate to yourself that the Alpha listing is NOT a guarantee of a future Binance Listing . Follow Trends Cautiously: While Alpha highlights trends, blindly following them without understanding the underlying project is risky. Conclusion: A Spotlight, Not a Guarantee The inclusion of the MilkyWay MILK Token in Binance Alpha is a noteworthy development, signaling that the project has caught the attention of Binance’s early-stage discovery feature. For the project, it means increased visibility; for users, it means a potential new project to research within the familiar environment of the Binance Wallet . However, the critical takeaway remains: this is a spotlight on Early Crypto Projects , not a guaranteed path to a full Binance Listing . The world of early-stage crypto is fraught with both immense potential and significant risk. Users interested in the MilkyWay MILK Token or any other project featured on Binance Alpha must exercise diligence, conduct extensive research, and fully understand the speculative nature of such investments. Use the Alpha feature as a starting point for discovery, but let thorough personal research be your ultimate guide.

33767162,[object Object],1745940655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Key Takeaways From The SEC’s 3rd Crypto Roundtable Focusing On Custody Issues,https://bitcoinist.com/key-takeaways-from-the-secs-3rd-crypto-roundtable/,"In a recent roundtable hosted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Crypto Task Force, industry leaders gathered to discuss the crypto custody for broker-dealers and investment advisers. Ryan Louvar, Chief Legal Officer and Head of Business and Legal Affairs for Digital Assets at WisdomTree, shared his insights following the event, highlighting the SEC’s renewed commitment to engaging with the cryptocurrency industry. SEC’s Crypto Roundtable Highlights Louvar described the roundtable as “extremely productive,” noting that the SEC, under new leadership, is serious about re-engaging with industry stakeholders. He emphasized the importance of practical discussions about how digital assets, blockchain technology, and tokenization fit into the current regulatory framework. The event facilitated a rich dialogue, according to a report by Eleanor Terret, showcasing the hard work of the SEC’s Crypto Task Force in fostering an environment conducive to open exchange. The diversity of perspectives among panelists reportedly contributed to a constructive atmosphere, where the potential of digital assets was acknowledged alongside a commitment to maintaining strong investor protections. One of the most surprising aspects of the roundtable was the participants’ willingness to reconsider traditional regulatory assumptions , especially regarding custody. Several panelists noted that the existing custody frameworks for traditional financial instruments may not be suitable for digital assets maintained on blockchain networks. Open Dialogue On Regulatory Challenges Louvar highlighted that the SEC’s acknowledgment of blockchain’s potential to enhance efficiency, transparency, and risk management is cruciall for developing regulations that not only protect investors but also encourage the growth of digital financial products . Louvar expressed hope that the SEC Crypto Task Force recognized the feasibility of safe and compliant innovation in the realm of digital assets. He stressed that adapting custody structures is not about compromising protections, but rather about applying established principles—such as security, segregation, disclosure, and fiduciary responsibility—to a new technological context. He believes that thoughtful regulation can promote the development of responsible decentralized finance (DeFi) while upholding the high standards that have historically defined US markets. Moving forward, Louvar sees a significant opportunity for the SEC to build on the momentum from the roundtable. He advocates for a phased approach to regulation, beginning with targeted guidance and evolving towards comprehensive rulemaking that addresses the specific characteristics of digital assets and blockchain technology. Key areas for development include clarifying how digital assets fit into existing custody rules and creating structured pathways for responsible self-custody . Louvar also mentioned that WisdomTree’s New York trust company operates under stringent regulations set by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), qualifying as a “bank” under the current custody framework for investment advisers.

This shift highlights not only the token’s enduring appeal in Japan but also signals deeper changes in investor sentiment and institutional alignment within the nation’s maturing crypto ecosystem. XRP Tops Ethereum in Trading Volume New data from SBI VC Trade reveals that XRP/JPY trading pairs registered higher volumes last month than ETH/JPY pairs. This milestone marks a significant change in Japan’s altcoin landscape, as Ethereum has traditionally held the second spot behind Bitcoin. XRP’s rise to the top demonstrates both a surge in investor confidence and a strong preference for utility-driven digital assets. Solana and Dogecoin also made the top five list of most traded altcoins, but XRP’s dominance over Ethereum is by far the most notable trend in Japan’s crypto markets right now. Institutional Integration Boosting XRP’s Presence One of the major forces driving XRP’s dominance in Japan is its deepening integration into the country’s financial sector. Reports indicate that nearly 80% of Japanese banks are preparing to integrate XRP into their systems within the year. This strategic alignment between Ripple and traditional banking institutions has been years in the making and now appears to be paying off. Spearheaded by partnerships with financial powerhouses like SBI Holdings, Ripple has positioned XRP as a practical tool for cross-border transactions. The Japanese banking industry’s gradual move toward embracing XRP reflects growing trust in the coin’s underlying technology and real-world utility. SBI Group and Leadership Support Fuel Adoption SBI Holdings CEO Yoshitaka Kitao has long been one of XRP’s most vocal advocates. His support stems from the token’s ability to streamline international remittances, a feature he frequently contrasts with Bitcoin’s perceived limitations. Kitao has described Bitcoin as lacking “intrinsic value,” while praising XRP for its scalable use cases in the banking and fintech sectors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This consistent endorsement from such a key industry leader has played a critical role in XRP’s widespread acceptance across Japan’s financial landscape. Retail Access Expands Through Mercoin Beyond institutional adoption, XRP is also gaining traction among retail users. Japanese e-commerce app Mercoin, which caters to millions of users, now offers XRP as a supported crypto payment and investment option. This move is introducing XRP to a broader audience, particularly first-time crypto buyers. Former Ripple executive Emi Yoshikawa has noted that a large portion of Mercoin’s user base consists of newcomers to digital assets. This development is pivotal, as it allows XRP to grow organically from the ground up — not just via institutional backing but also through grassroots engagement with everyday consumers. A Redefined Altcoin Landscape in Japan XRP’s new status as the most traded altcoin in Japan is more than a statistical anomaly — it’s a reflection of years of groundwork laid through strategic alliances, regulatory clarity, and public trust. As both banking institutions and individual users continue to adopt XRP at scale, its dominance in the Japanese market may well serve as a model for other countries exploring functional, compliant crypto integration. With investor behavior shifting, financial institutions aligning, and consumer access expanding, XRP’s trajectory in Japan showcases what long-term adoption looks like when vision, infrastructure, and market readiness converge.

Vaulta, previously EOS Network ( EOS ), shared the massiv via a press release sent to crypto.news on April 29. The strategic partnership aims to tap into blockchain technology to drive tokenization, trading, and monetization within the blockchain gaming space. Accordingly, the two platforms are targeting a full-service platform, with Vaulta gaining traction through gaming network. As a one-stop destination for gamers, publishers, and developers, Ultra seeks to develop into the “Netflix of gaming.” With this partnership, Ultra will effectively be Vaulta’s gaming hub, with key integrations bringing access to decentralized marketplaces, metaverse banking, and cross-game integrations to users. “Positioning Ultra as Vaulta’s gaming hub provides a gateway to Gaming and GameFi opportunities to our community,” Yves La Rose, founder and chief executive officer of Vaulta Foundation, said. “At the heart of our collaboration is a shared ambition to elevate digital assets to the standards of traditional finance, empowering users with new financial opportunities powered by Web3.” Gus van Rijckevorsel, the chief executive officer of Ultra, said in a statement that web3 gaming growth will soon outpace both television and movies. With a consumer shift seeing the market reach $615 billion by 2030, now is the time to build infrastructure set to tap into this potential. “To harness this potential, the gaming industry needs better infrastructure designed for publishers, developers, and gamers, and we’re here to deliver that,”Rijckevorsel noted. “We’re laser-focused on creating the content and structural partnerships necessary to make Ultra THE gaming platform recognized by the gaming industry. Vaulta is a major brick on that path, and this partnership is a solid foundation on which we build the future of gaming and finance.” Growth via the Vaulta and Ultra partnership will see the platform’s native token UOS power in-game transactions, rewards, and monetization. The alliance also plans to leverage artificial intelligence to support intelligent ecosystems and real-time gameplay guidance, among other key interactions across the network. As noted, Vaulta recently rebranded from EOS Network amid its strategic realignment to become the web3 Banking network. Meanwhile, Ultra recently closed a $12 million funding round as part of its 2025 roadmap.

According to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday, Beijing is trying to reframe itself as a global rules-based order defender and make other countries see Washington as an unreliable trading partner. President Xi Jinping is unhappy about a 90-day window Trump has granted to nations, excluding China , to negotiate trade agreements without facing immediate tariff hikes. Chinese officials, aware that the move is designed to give the US leverage in future negotiations, are warning other nations that Trump is using a “divide and conquer” strategy to pit countries against Beijing. Diplomats aligned with President Xi Jinping have traveled to several capitals, urging leaders not to fall for Trump’s proposals. According to officials, the United States cannot be trusted and is an economic “bully.” China has more to bargain now, America wants to take that away China’s government appears confident it can absorb the economic shock of tariffs better than smaller economies. Since Trump’s last trade war, Beijing has invested in diversifying its supply chains and strengthening internal markets. President Xi has so far resisted direct engagement with Trump, demanding that the US take the first step toward de-escalation by lifting tariffs. Chinese officials are calling their resistance a defense of the global economic system, not merely national interest. “ This is not just about China-US ,” said Wu Xinbo, director at Fudan University’s Center for American Studies. “ It is really about the international trade and economic system .” Wu, who previously led a Foreign Ministry delegation to Washington, argues China’s defiance has created breathing room for other countries. “ If China hadn’t stood up to the US, how would the US give them a 90-day pause? ” he asked, calling on nations to recognize the benefit Beijing has afforded them. In Brazil, top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi urged the BRICS nations to resist Trump’s economic demands. “ If you choose to remain silent, compromise and retreat, it will only allow the bully to become more aggressive ,” he said. China’s Foreign Ministry later released an English-subtitled video calling the United States “an imperialist force.” The film mentioned historical examples, such as US restrictions on Japanese exports that hurt firms such as Toshiba. Mixed reception from regional outreach Some US allies within the European Union bloc have opposed Trump’s tariffs, but they are not rushing to align with China. They are worried China will dump cheap goods into European markets, with no access to the US economy. At a recent G7 summit, finance ministers asked China to address its domestic imbalances and avoid escalating the dispute. India is supposedly the first nation to make the most progress in securing a US trade deal. It is reportedly negotiating a pact that spans 19 sectors, including agriculture, albeit cautiously. Back home, citizens want Xi and his government to deliver results. Although not constrained by elections, China is facing a rise in youth unemployment and a stubborn property crisis that doesn’t seem to go away, even with dozens of policy changes. Beijing state media is encouraging citizens to “weather storms together.” “The sky will not fall,” reckoned one government official. Chinese Premier Li Qiang recently contacted Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to help Beijing fight US tariffs. To his relief, Japanese officials have been reluctant to join any American-led bloc against China, their largest trading partner. Lower-level Chinese delegations have also been dispatched to scout new export markets. Provincial officials have been tasked with building trade relationships abroad, especially in Latin American countries like Argentina. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This data was reported by the US Census Bureau, and it is the biggest monthly trade gap since the government started tracking these numbers back in the early 1990s. The spike came just before Trump’s new tariffs hit. Businesses across the country rushed to buy goods—especially stuff that doesn’t rot fast, like cars, industrial parts, and consumer goods—so they wouldn’t get slammed by price hikes. That panic-buying binge caused imports to skyrocket while exports stayed mostly flat. And now, the result is a trade gap wider than anyone’s seen in over three decades. Trump’s April tariffs fueled the surge in imports On April 2, President Donald Trump announced what he called “reciprocal tariffs,” aiming to punish countries he claims are taking advantage of the US. Right after the announcement, stocks took a nosedive, and the cost of financing the US government’s debt went up as markets reacted to fears of a coming recession and a hit to global trade. Two days later, on April 4, the administration decided to hold off on most of the new tariffs for 90 days, but that didn’t help much. A 10% base tariff remained, along with a massive 145% tariff on most Chinese goods. Economists now say the effective tariff rate is the highest it’s been in over a hundred years. Oliver Allen, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the spike in imports was clearly a response to Trump’s tariff threats. “The picture for [the first quarter of 2025] overall remains that President Trump’s tariff threats set off a rush to buy goods now rather than face higher prices later, prompting a startling surge in imports,” Allen said. This flood of imports hit just as the first-quarter GDP numbers are about to drop. Analysts at Reuters expect the report—set to be released Wednesday—to show only 0.3% growth, way down from the 2.4% logged in the last quarter of 2024. However, some economists are saying the GDP number might be misleading. Economists warn that GDP data will be distorted Isabelle Mateos y Lago, chief economist at BNP Paribas, said the GDP number won’t tell the full story. “It’s going to be full of noise and reflecting, to a very large extent, the sum of imports,” Isabelle said. “You’re going to need to look really under the hood to see what’s really happening.” Others like James Knightley, chief international economist at ING Bank, are already preparing for bad headlines. “Today’s [trade] numbers do really highlight the risk that it may well be a negative GDP print, and that is obviously setting us up for a very weak 2025,” James said. He explained that businesses were just stacking goods to beat the tariffs, and now that rush is over. “We expect this to unwind pretty soon: ports data is already slowing.” That slowdown is showing up at West Coast ports. Los Angeles is reporting less cargo traffic in recent weeks. Some ships carrying products from China’s east coast are even turning around. On top of that, there are already whispers about shortages in construction and industrial goods from China, all tied to the tariff chaos. While the trade gap and tariffs dominate the headlines, there’s another money story brewing under Trump’s watch that’s pissing off Democrats in Congress. Senator Patty Murray from Washington and Representative Rosa DeLauro from Connecticut said on Tuesday that the Trump administration is freezing money that Congress already signed off on. That number sits at $436.87 billion, money that’s supposed to be used across nearly every major federal agency. Almost $42 billion meant for the State Department is either frozen or canceled. That includes USAID funding, which is now stuck. Over $62 billion in grants for the Transportation Department isn’t going anywhere either. Then there’s $943 million frozen for the Head Start early-education program and more than $10 billion held back from the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Democrats are calling the decision reckless, saying it’s messing with essential services and programs while the economy is already looking shaky.

Zimbabwe is yet again turning to gold to defend its embattled currency, as the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the country’s central bank, has revived sales of physical gold coins just 10 months after scrapping the program, betting that tangible bullion might succeed where digital tokens have struggled, Bloomberg reports . The so-called “Mosi-Oa-Tunya” coins, named after Victoria Falls, are being reintroduced during what officials are calling a “time of attractiveness” for gold. For context, minting had been paused in July 2024, after Reserve Bank Governor John Mushayavanhu suggested the focus would shift toward digital alternatives. Now, however, officials seem to be thinking differently. Persistence Gwanyanya, a member of the central bank’s monetary policy committee, told Bloomberg that the spike in global gold prices made it an opportune moment to act. “Gold is more attractive to the market at the moment and it supports our value preservation efforts. We are taking advantage of firm gold prices and re-injecting the gold coins into the market.” Persistence Gwanyanya Two major banks, the Central Africa Building Society and Nedbank Zimbabwe, have already confirmed they are selling the new coins as an “alternative investment option” that adds a “valuable asset” to portfolios, Bloomberg reports. The coins are available in denominations ranging from one-tenth of an ounce to a full ounce, offering flexibility to buyers who may not want to commit large amounts of cash upfront. Unrealized hopes Officials are no doubt hoping that physical gold’s enduring appeal will succeed where more experimental strategies — the country’s digital currency — have faltered. Zimbabwe introduced a gold-backed digital token, initially named ZiG (Zimbabwe Gold), in April 2023 to stabilize its currency and provide a value-preserving instrument amid ongoing inflation and currency instability. Introduction of the Zimbabwe Gold-Backed Digital Token (Zig) as a Means of Payment pic.twitter.com/o1CL5dsbaQ — Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (@ReserveBankZIM) October 5, 2023 The token was later renamed GBDT (Gold-Backed Digital Token) to avoid confusion with the new official currency, also called ZiG, introduced in Q2 2024. GBDTs can be stored in e-gold wallets or e-gold cards and are tradable for peer-to-peer and business transactions. At first, the move seemed to generate some enthusiasm. The central bank had even reportedly received 135 applications valued at 14 billion Zimbabwe dollars, around $12 million, during the first round of sales. But signs of trouble appeared quickly. Ordinary Zimbabweans, still scarred by memories of hyperinflation and economic collapse in the 2000s, were slow to embrace the unfamiliar tokens. Many remained wary of anything new, preferring to keep their trust, and savings, in the U.S. dollar. By June 2023, only 35 new applications for the digital currency were reported .

It has weakened roughly 65% against the dollar so far this year on the official market ,and even more on the streets, where parallel exchange rates dominate daily life, Bloomberg notes. Some outside observers had warned from the start that digital tokens would not be a silver bullet. The International Monetary Fund, for one, was openly skeptical. It reportedly urged Zimbabwe’s government to liberalize the exchange rate instead of experimenting with gold-backed digital currencies. The IMF also cautioned that using gold reserves to prop up alternative currencies risked depleting precious national assets. Even the high-profile token auctions failed to ease those concerns. While the first two sales were fully subscribed, the long-term viability of the gold-backed token remains uncertain, with officials saying only about one ton of gold reserves had been deployed to support the digital currency. For comparison, Tether revealed that it purchased nearly eight tons of gold in the first quarter of this year to back its gold-pegged token, XAUT. Biggest export In contrast, physical gold coins may feel more reassuring. At least for now. The revival comes as global bullion prices have surged about 25% this year, buoyed by rising economic uncertainty and simmering global trade tensions. Zimbabwe’s economy could use the boost: gold is one of the country’s biggest exports, and revenue from shipments reportedly jumped to nearly $396 million in Q1, up sharply from $303.1 million a year earlier. Still, even officials seem aware that this is no guaranteed fix. Zimbabwe’s history with alternative monetary schemes is long, and often painful . The local dollar itself was scrapped in 2009 after hyperinflation rendered it worthless, then reintroduced a decade later with mixed results. In that sense, gold coins may feel like a safer bet, though they are also something of a throwback. At a time when countries like Nigeria are experimenting with central bank digital currencies like the eNaira, Zimbabwe now appears to be reaching back to older ideas, betting that physical assets will hold their ground better than tech-driven solutions. Crypto.news reached out to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe but didn’t receive a response at the time of publication.

Investors Are Accumulating Ruvi AI (RUVI)  Instead for 8,800% Returns",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/solana-sol-price-prediction-could-it-reach-200-investors-are-accumulating-ruvi-ai-ruvi-instead-for-8800-returns/,"The crypto markets are buzzing and Solana (SOL) is leading the charge. Over the past few weeks it’s been bouncing back from $100 to $140+ and analysts are calling for a move to $150+ in the short term. That’s because of Solana’s low cost, fast transactions and growing DeFi and NFT ecosystem. That’s a good future for SOL holders as the bull run gains momentum. But while Solana is getting all the attention, another opportunity is flying under the radar. That’s where Ruvi AI comes in – a blockchain project that combines AI and cutting edge tech to deliver insane ROI for forward thinking investors. If Solana is bullish resilience, Ruvi AI is innovation driven growth. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success Ruvi AI has already proven itself a winner among savvy investors. Within just a few days of its presale launch, the project sold over 10 million tokens, raising $100,000 in funding at a baseline price of just $0.01 per token. That early success is a testament to the trust Ruvi AI has earned from its community and the confidence in its technology-driven vision. The presale has also caught attention because of its transparent and investor-centric tokenomics. With a confirmed listing price of $0.07 on major exchanges, early buyers can expect a 600% return even before any larger market-driven gains. Unpacking the VIP Tier Bonus Rewards Ruvi AI’s VIP rewards system is a way to reward early investors while maximizing profits. Take VIP Tier 3 for example, one of the best options for mid-level investors. To get into this tier you need to invest early and hold at least 100,000 RUVI tokens. That’s a small investment of $1,000 at the current presale price of $0.01 per token. This will get you a 60% bonus, adding another 60,000 tokens on top. At the confirmed listing price of $0.07, your 160,000 tokens will be worth $11,200. That’s a 1,020% ROI. And if Ruvi AI’s token reaches the forecasted price of $1, those 160,000 tokens would be worth $160,000. That’s a 15,900% ROI. Breaking Down Ruvi AI’s Unique Edge Ruvi AI isn’t a speculative crypto project. It has application in the real world and a forward-thinking way to solve today’s problems via an AI-enabled system. These are the factors that distinguish it from others: 1. Powerful Industries Blend Ruvi AI’s platform uses cutting-edge AI to eliminate inefficiencies in industries like business operations, healthcare automation and creative services. Its blockchain-based structure ensures that its solutions are secure, reliable and scalable. 2. Real-World Utility = Long-Term Value Unlike other tokens that swing wildly based on hype or speculation, RUVI tokens derive value from their ability to power essential, AI-driven infrastructure for businesses worldwide. 3. Transparency and Tokenomics Ruvi AI’s commitment to transparency and structured tokenomics—including VIP tiers and bonus rewards—ensures that its growth in value is both predictable and sustainable. 4. Community-Oriented Leadership Through incentives like leaderboard bonuses and competitive-driven governance, Ruvi AI builds long-lasting loyalty among investors, developers and users. Bonus Leaderboard Rewards To encourage active participation and reward the most committed investors, Ruvi AI offers leaderboard bonuses on top of VIP tier rewards: -Top 10 investors secure an extra 500,000 tokens—valued at $500,000 at a $1 token price. -Top 50 investors receive 250,000 tokens, valued at $250,000 if the $1 price projection materializes. -Top 1,000 contributors earn 20,000 tokens, equating to $20,000 under the same optimistic pricing scenario. These bonuses reflect Ruvi AI’s investor-first philosophy and commitment to amplifying collective success. Solana vs. Ruvi AI Solana’s advancements in blockchain scalability and its bullish market sentiment make it a valuable asset in any portfolio. But it largely relies on incremental growth in established sectors like DeFi and NFT ecosystems. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with AI and blockchain technology. Ruvi AI is where the real action is when it comes to using AI to solve real-world problems on the blockchain. And the numbers, particularly those related to its presale system look even more promising than Solana’s growth potential. That bull run Solana’s been on is certainly exciting for crypto enthusiasts. But for investors who want to break free from traditional narratives, Ruvi AI offers a chance to join the vanguard of the blockchain revolution. That revolution is about more than just growth-it’s about transformation. And Ruvi AI is right at the forefront. You can secure your spot in the Ruvi AI presale today and be part of a future where blockchain and AI come together to create new opportunities. That future is here now. With Ruvi AI.

While Cardano continues to solidify its presence among blockchain leaders, Mutuum Finance is emerging with a setup that analysts believe could achieve 20x growth far more rapidly. Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s price has been steadily climbing, recently reaching around $0.72 after a strong 12% weekly surge. Investor sentiment has strengthened following Cardano’s inclusion in the newly established U.S. digital asset reserve. Technical patterns are encouraging too, as ADA recently broke a four-month downtrend, supported by a favorable RSI, hinting at additional room for growth. Adding to the bullish sentiment, whale movements have reinforced confidence in ADA’s long-term value, with notable withdrawals from exchanges suggesting accumulation. Analysts expect ADA to approach $0.83 by the end of May 2025, and some forecasts stretch as high as $2.88 later in the year. However, despite these positives, ADA’s growth appears to be measured. Its mature market status makes it a safer, steadier asset—but it may not deliver the rapid multiple returns that early-stage investors typically seek. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) In contrast, Mutuum Finance is drawing attention for its high-velocity growth potential. Its ongoing presale has attracted over $7.3 million in funding and a community of more than 9,300 holders. With over 431 million tokens already sold and the fourth presale phase past the halfway mark, the momentum is undeniable. Tokens are still available at $0.025, but a jump to $0.03 is imminent, ahead of a $0.06 official launch price. Mutuum Finance is building a full-fledged DeFi ecosystem from the ground up. Its decentralized lending and borrowing platform is designed for passive income generation through mtTokens, enabling users to earn yields without giving up ownership of their assets. Beyond that, Mutuum is preparing to roll out an overcollateralized stablecoin, enhancing stability and providing users with a reliable, blockchain-native financial tool. Unlike centralized stablecoins, this version will be transparently backed by on-chain assets. Other utilities within the Mutuum platform include multi-asset borrowing options, adaptive interest rates tied to liquidity pool performance, and integration opportunities with broader DeFi protocols. Combined, these features offer multiple pathways for users to maximize returns and manage assets effectively. The projection of a 20x surge for MUTM is backed by more than hype. Its low starting valuation, real-world DeFi applications, growing utility portfolio, and upcoming platform launch provide clear fundamentals for massive appreciation. Passive income structures through its buy-and-redistribute mechanism further solidify long-term value for holders. MUTM’s Edge Over ADA for 2025 Growth While Cardano will likely continue to expand through upgrades and ecosystem developments, its sheer size means its price growth is expected to remain gradual. For investors targeting transformative returns within a shorter timeframe, Mutuum Finance appears better positioned. With its foundation rooted in DeFi innovation, income generation, and decentralized financial tools, MUTM is set to capitalize on the evolving needs of the crypto market. By 2025, Mutuum Finance could very well transition from a promising new entrant into one of the dominant forces in decentralized finance—outpacing older, more established players like Cardano when it comes to explosive growth potential.

In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $21.91 Market cap $9.12B Trading volume $287.83M Circulating supply 416.57M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $22.28 24-hour low $21.33 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 8.72% 50-day SMA 19.77 200-day SMA $28.92 Sentiment Neutral Green days 15/30 (50%) Avalanche price analysis: AVAX recovers from annual low As of April 29, AVAX’s price rose by 0.25% in 24 hours and 13.96% in the last 30 days. Its trading volume dropped by 9.36% in 24 hours, showing waning interest in trading activity. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAX/USD 1-day chart AVAX was in an ascending channel in the last quarter of 2024. The trend reversed in December, after reaching a high of $55.41 on Christmas Eve. The drop continued into 2025 and is yet to reverse. The William Alligator is now sleeping as AVAX volatility drops. The relative strength index is 59.65 in neutral territory, with the MACD histogram showing positive market momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAX/USD 4-hour chart The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s current run, which has broken out sideways following a recovery that started after it registered a new annual low at $14.66. Unlike the daily chart, it registers negative momentum.

The combination of technical indicators and chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is consolidating after recovering from its annual low of $14.66. The general market sentiment is neutral, as evident on the 1-day chart, which shows AVAX is consolidating within a narrow range. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX crossed the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00 for the year. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Image source: CoinStats In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, whistleblower ‘crypto leaks’ published a report accusing Ava labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any dirty deal with Roche Freedmen law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend between January and May, after which bears overwhelmed the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January, and by April, it had fallen below $18.",Crypto Price Predictions|avax,EN,0,0,AVAX|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ICO|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-29 16:00:21

The transition to a “stage 1” rollup comes as other layer-2s have also reached that milestone, making these networks less reliant on centralized entities. The move means that Base will now have a security council, a network of ten “independent entities, which we chose from all around the globe,” said Tom Vieira, the head of product at Base, in an interview with CoinDesk. “These are folks from the Base ecosystem and from the broader Ethereum ecosystem,” who will help approve certain network upgrades if needed, Vieira added. In addition, fault proofs are permissionless now on Base, meaning anyone can verify or check the state of transactions from the network without relying on a central entity. Achieving the so-called stage 1 rollup status stems from a blog post from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, where he categorized platforms according to their degree of decentralization, with stage 1 relying on certain guardrails or ""limited training wheels”, and sacrificing on certain elements of decentralization for security and speed. Buterin originally shared this framework in 2022 when rollups started becoming more popular. A few years later, he expressed his concerns around their security, so he wrote on X that he would only publicly talk about a layer-2 network if it had reached (at least) stage 1. Base was launched by centralized exchange Coinbase in August 2022, and since then has become the largest rollup, according to L2Beat , with $11.72 billion locked in the protocol. Now, the largest layer-2 network will be less reliant on Coinbase itself.

Head of Research at Presto, Peter Chung, made this sweeping prediction in an interview with CNBC on April 28. Related Reading: XRP Headed For $1,000 – CryptoGuard Exec Drops Bold Prediction Institutional Money And Global Liquidity Drive Bullish Outlook The bullish price target is based on increasing large institution buying of Bitcoin and increasing global cash flow. Chung feels that both of these factors will send Bitcoin’s price higher than ever before. Bitcoin experienced some tough times, but corrections were necessary strides toward mainstream acceptance, Chung explained in the interview. He called Bitcoin a two-sided coin: it is a “risk-on” asset during confident markets but becomes “digital gold” under financial stress. Bitcoin’s Response To Economic Stress Tests As noted by Chung, history has revealed how Bitcoin reacts during times of crisis. The Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in 2023, and recent market tension all put Bitcoin’s position as a risky investment or safe haven to the test. Though Bitcoin didn’t rocket like gold amid recent market stress, Chung expects it to “catch up” and outperform by year-end. Such responses to global crises are uncommon but interesting to reveal about the evolving role of Bitcoin in the financial system. MVRV Ratio Points To $210,000 Target The $210,000 prediction isn’t a wild guess. Chung first discussed this target last January, utilizing a particular metric known as the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio. The latter compares the current market value of Bitcoin to the average price of coins that have moved. Presto estimated Bitcoin’s realized value for 2025 and used a historical 3.5x multiple to arrive at their target. Financial analysts tend to use this ratio to identify market extremes and possible turning points. Meanwhile, analysts attribute rising activity by “whales” – large crypto holders – as a indicator of high market confidence. Such large investors keep on purchasing Bitcoin even at the existing prices. They believe that if this pace keeps going, BTC could go even higher than current projection, reaching as high as $300,000 to $500,000. Related Reading: Justin Sun Bets Big On JUST Token – Here’s Why He Sees 100x Potential Other Experts Predict Similar Or Higher Prices Quite obviously, it is not Presto alone who anticipates that Bitcoin can really get up to the six-figure mark. Robert Kiyosaki, the famous author of the book “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” also predicts that the crypto can reach the mark of $180,000 to $200,000 in 2025. Looking ahead a few more years, Kiyosaki has predicted that Bitcoin will reach the magical number of $1 million in 2035.

The situation has not changed yet, and while Ethereum continues to show weakness against Bitcoin, analyst Peter Brandt, who has over 50 years of experience, warned investors about ETH. Responding to a user’s post, Brandt shared a chart of the ETH/BTC pair that highlights a continuing decline. The chart shows that Ethereum has been steadily falling against Bitcoin in recent months as it has failed to keep up with the momentum in Bitcoin. Brandt drew attention to the ongoing downtrend in the ETH/BTC pair and warned that Ethereum could continue to lose value against Bitcoin. According to the data, Bitcoin increased by 53 percent on an annual basis, while Ethereum lost 42 percent of its value. There was also a positive development for ETH in response to Peter Brandt’s warning. Accordingly, US Ethereum ETFs experienced their first positive net inflows after eight weeks of outflows. Although the inflows remained relatively modest, they indicate a potential change in sentiment for ETH. *This is not investment advice.

However, the cycle that many believe started after the US elections seemed to lack those market participants. The latest data from Santiment, though, reveals that they might have finally arrived. Are They Here? One of the latest crypto experts to weigh in on the matter was Bitwise’s CEO, Hunter Horsley, who said earlier this week that the most recent BTC price rally, which drove the asset from $75,000 to $95,000 within a few weeks, was driven by institutions, advisors, corporations, and even nations. He explained that this diversity of investors will ultimately benefit the cryptocurrency, but noted that retail traders are yet to be found, as the Google searches, usually a good indicator of their behavior, were still very low. Santiment, though, published a different perspective. After the aforementioned $20,000 surge, the analytics platform said, “Retail traders continue to show confidence in crypto markets.” The findings are based on an increased number of social media posts, mostly in the form of big BTC price predictions , which typically come from such investors. However, Santiment warned that bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of what the crowd expects, especially if they have turned to speculative assets like meme coins, which exploded in value recently after a months-long hiatus. As Bitcoin has risen as high as $95.5K Monday, retail traders continue to show confidence in crypto markets.

If this influx continues, it will “support the view that the current move is more than a relief rally and could be the opening leg of a broader uptrend.” Bitcoin saw an significant increase in short-term traders’ balances last week, pointing to renewed speculative demand.

The decentralized finance protocol announced that all user deposits have been returned, with the hacker accepting a whitehat bounty in exchange for immunity. The exploit stemmed from a vulnerability in Loopscale’s pricing mechanism for RateX PT tokens, which allowed the attacker to drain 5.7 million USDC and 1,200 SOL from the USDC ( USDC ) and Solana ( SOL ) vaults. Other users, including borrowers and loopers, were not affected. “More details to come, but I, and the entire team, are deeply thankful for the support and help we’ve received from the ecosystem over the past 72 hours,” Mary Gooneratne, co-founder of Loopscale, said . “This resolution would not have been possible without the collaboration and efforts of so many others.” You might also like: ‘We’re going to reenter crypto’: SoFi CEO says blockchain will touch all products 10% bounty Loopscale halted its markets immediately after detecting the exploit and contacted the hacker through an on-chain message, offering to resolve the situation in exchange for the return of 90% of the stolen assets. In return, the platform offered the attacker a 10% bounty—approximately 3,947 SOL—and agreed not to pursue legal action if the funds were returned. The hacker responded positively within the 24-hour deadline. At 3:30 AM EST on April 28, the remaining 19,999 SOL was sent back to a Loopscale wallet, marking the full recovery of stolen funds. Loan repayments and loop closing were re-enabled shortly after the breach, but vault withdrawals remain paused pending further investigation. Loopscale has committed to releasing a full post-mortem in the coming days and praised the Solana and broader crypto community for their support.

The draft legislation targets cryptocurrency dealers, exchanges, and agents, bringing them into a regime designed to better protect customers and encourage innovation. Following the Treasury’s announcement , the step is aimed at addressing the increased number of residents in the UK engaged with cryptocurrency like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). The government officials emphasized concern over exposing people to unregulated and dangerous companies and a surge in scam cases and fraud related to the digital assets. The UK must remain receptive to innovation, but not at the cost of consumer protection,” the statement read. “Today’s announcement sends a clear message: Britain is open for business — but closed to fraud, abuse, and instability.”. Under the new regulations, crypto exchanges will have to implement stricter anti-fraud measures, improved disclosure requirements, and sufficient warnings to investors regarding risks. Regulators will also be granted enhanced powers to crack down on rogue firms in Britain. Working with the United States and Next Steps The UK government statement also referenced ongoing talks with US counterparts for cross-border regulatory cooperation. Specifically, it referenced cooperation with SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce on a planned US-UK cross-border sandbox — an effort aimed at allowing firms to test crypto-related products and services in a regulated manner across both markets. This global coordination aims to harmonize global crypto markets and reduce the tendency towards regulatory arbitrage, when firms relocate activities to places with more lenient regulations. The Treasury has said that it will introduce final legislation “at the earliest opportunity” after additional consultation with industry stakeholders. Firms and regulatory experts are invited to provide comments on the proposed rules to guide the ultimate legal regime. The UK’s approach is one of a larger global trend of governments seeking to reconcile the promise of blockchain technology with the need to address consumer protection risks. With the growth in cryptocurrency use, lawmakers around the world are moving quickly to protect financial stability and market integrity. By tightening the rules now, British authorities hope to create a safe environment for innovation to flourish without allowing criminal forces to chip away at trust in the financial system.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-29 16:08:57

The move would mean that Arizona would become the first US state to adopt a Bitcoin reserve. Arizona could invest in Bitcoin or other types of digital assets, such as NFTs. Lawmakers in the House of Representatives passed two bills, including Senate Bill 1025 and Senate Bill 1373, which would allow Arizona to allocate 10% of its treasury and pension funds into Bitcoin and other digital assets. The Senate Bill 1025 focused on Bitcoin as an investment asset, while Senate Bill 1373 focused on other digital assets. Both bills concentrate on establishing a framework for investing public funds in cryptocurrencies. Arizona has been very busy about crypto legislation, pushing a bill in March to include Bitcoin ETFs in government pension portfolios and another bill to protect Bitcoin miners. Bill 1025 defines how the government allocates their funds, such as from pensions and treasuries. The bill further suggested that the crypto funds could be stored in a separate account under the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve. Bill 1024 amends Arizona law to allow the state to invest up to 10% of its public funds in digital assets. Bill 1373, however, focuses on what the state can do with seized cryptocurrencies that have been confiscated by law enforcement. The bill states that such funds do not expire after one year, which is the usual expiration date for seized assets, but they can still be seized. Instead, Bill 1373 allows the State Treasury to take possession of the funds through a new custody process. Arizona manages a substantial amount of public funds, amounting to around $30 billion, which means that a 10% allocation would allow the state government to allocate roughly $3 billion to cryptocurrencies. The bills state that digital assets must be managed with quality procedures that keep the assets secure. The management of a crypto portfolio would inherit all of the risk management procedures used with other public portfolios. Other states, meanwhile, have been developing crypto legislation. Utah passed Bitcoin legislation in March, but removed key sections that enabled a Bitcoin reserve in the final revisions. Texas also developed crypto legislation in March. Texas has received less resistance to its Bitcoin legislation, increasing the probability that it will pass crypto laws at the state level. However, Arizona remains the leader in the race with its latest developments.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|USA,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-29 16:10:15

Crypto staking may soon be coming to major TradFi banks. On Tuesday, April 29, crypto custody company Taurus and staking service Figment partnered to enable banks to easily stake Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , among others. Notably, banks that hold Ethereum, Solana, or other proof-of-stake tokens on Taurus custody can now earn staking rewards on their assets. What’s more, they can do this within the Taurus PROTECT platform for crypto custody, while also retaining full ownership over their funds.

Staking for banks becomes easier Figment’s staking services tap directly into Taurus PROTECT, enabling banks to stake their assets without performing complex blockchain operations. At the same time, Taurus claims that the staked assets remain within their secure platform. “This collaboration between Taurus and Figment brings together two firms that share a deep institutional DNA. It reflects our commitment to providing regulated financial institutions with secure, compliant, and scalable access to staking services,” said Victor Busson, Chief Marketing Officer at Taurus. For institutions that invest in altcoins like Solana and Ethereum, staking income is essential for making their investment worthwhile. This is especially true for Solana holders, whose high staking rewards make it attractive for staking. For instance, some 64.98% of Solana tokens are currently staked, and its staking market cap has recently overtaken that of Ethereum. What is more, some of the upcoming Solana ETFs are expected to include staking rewards as well.

Despite weak usage data, Standard Chartered has issued a bullish long-term outlook. In a recent report , the bank forecast that $AVAX could climb to $250 by the end of 2029. Geoff Kendrick, Head of Digital Assets Research, credited the network’s modular architecture and scaling solutions as key drivers of future growth.

According to Standard Chartered, $AVAX could rise to $55 by the end of 2025, marking over 60% upside from current prices. The bank further projected milestones of $100 in 2026, $150 in 2027, and $200 in 2028, assuming steady development and broader crypto market participation. Bitget Partnership Targets India’s Web3 Growth Adding to the momentum, Bitget revealed a strategic collaboration with Avalanche on April 28.

Avalanche’s visibility was further boosted when Nasdaq filed Form 19b-4 with the U.S. SEC to list and trade Grayscale’s Avalanche Trust as an exchange-traded fund (ETF).

If the price reclaims resistance at 40.40 with volume and a bullish retest, it could ignite a rally toward 71.00, nearly doubling from its current value. PopCat ( POPCAT ) is currently trading at a make-or-break level, where the potential for a major bullish breakout is counterbalanced by key resistance overhead. The asset is forming a possible higher low at a critical support area, backed by multiple technical confluences. A decisive break above resistance could trigger a significant move, while continued rejection may signal fading momentum. Key technical points Major Resistance: 40.40 remains the primary ceiling and must break with volume to validate bullish continuation. Key Support Zone: 33.33 is the must-hold level to maintain the structure of a higher low. Confluence Levels: 0.618 Fibonacci, volume support, and value area high reinforce the current support zone. PopCat USDT (6H) Chart Source: TradingView PopCat has made two recent attempts to breach the 40.40 resistance but failed to follow through, resulting in shallow pullbacks. This makes the 40.40 level a major technical barrier. A decisive close above this resistance with volume confirmation will shift momentum in favor of the bulls and potentially unlock a rally toward 71.00, marking nearly a 100% gain from current levels. On the flip side, support at 33.33 remains intact and is key to holding the higher low structure. This region is supported by the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and value area high, making it a strong technical floor. If this level holds while resistance is reclaimed, it provides a low-risk swing opportunity targeting the upper range. You might also like: Can XRP price rise to $5 if the SEC approves Ripple ETFs? However, price continues to linger under resistance, and time is of the essence. The longer PopCat trades beneath 40.40 without reclaiming it decisively, the lower the odds of a bullish expansion in the near term. Traders should be cautious of any prolonged hesitation under resistance, as this could reflect underlying market weakness. What to expect in the coming price Action If price holds the higher low support and breaks above 40.40 with strong volume, expect a fast move toward 71.00. However, continued rejection from resistance will likely invalidate short-term bullish setups and delay any meaningful upside. The bullish case is simply a break and close above 40.40 resistance with volume confirmation, targeting the 71.00 level. The bearish case is a failure to reclaim resistance, and a loss of 33.33 support opens the door for a deeper retracement and invalidation of the higher low thesis.

Virtuals Protocol ( VIRTUAL ) token rose for the second consecutive day and hit the key resistance level at $1.5, its highest level since February 5. It has jumped by more than 240% from its lowest level this month. The rally was supported by the ongoing rebound of most tokens in its ecosystem. The VaderAI token surged by 37% on Tuesday, increasing its market capitalization to over $38 million. Similarly, the Ribbita token jumped by 28%, while Ava AI, GAME, Luna, Iona, and aixCB have all soared by over 50% in the past few days. This rebound is likely to help boost its network fees after the recent crash. Data shows that Virtuals Protocol made over $3.65 million in January as its token and those of its ecosystem surged. This changed over the last three months, with the protocol generating $381,000 in February, $156,000 in March, and $146,000 in April. Virtuals Protocol price soared as futures open interest surged to $180 million, its highest level since January 28. This represents a significant increase from the bottom of $31 million seen in March. A jump in open interest is often a sign of rising demand in the futures market. VIRTUAL price technical analysis Virtuals Protocol price chart | Source: crypto.news The eight-hour chart shows that VIRTUAL has been in a strong bullish trend over the past few days, jumping from a low of $0.4135 to $1.5. Virtuals Protocol has crossed above the 50-period moving average and is now nearing the 23.6% retracement level. However, there are signs that the coin has become highly overbought, with the Relative Strength Index soaring to 82. The Average Directional Index has also moved to 64, indicating strong trend strength. The most likely scenario is a retreat to $1 as the bull run takes a breather. An alternative scenario would see the coin jump above the 23.6% retracement point at $1.6125 and reach the psychological level at $2.

The price is currently consolidating around $95,000, flashing a possibility of a breakout, which could lead to further growth, but there is still a risk of a short-term correction. The current trade setup suggests the price has been closely accumulating below a crucial range for more than a week, which has resulted in a huge price action in the recent past. Now that the volatility has dropped significantly, can the BTC price trigger a breakout beyond the pivotal resistance at $96,200? The BTC price is heading towards the end of the consolidation period as the token continues to remain stuck within an ascending triangle in the short term. The token has held the lower support firmly, hinting towards a potential breakout. Meanwhile, the technicals are turning bearish in the long term, which raises concerns over the stability of the rally. After breaking from the wedge, the BTC price has reached an important resistance zone and, despite a decent upward pressure, has remained within the zone. However, the price has failed to test the 0.618 FIB at $96,200, which has now become a threshold to achieve. On the other hand, MACD shows a drop in selling pressure, and the levels are heading towards a bearish crossover. This may raise alarms, as a drop below the POC zone between $94,000 and $94,675 may bring back the levels close to 0.5 FIB at $92,062. As long as Bitcoin is below 0.618 FIB and the POC on the volume profile, Bitcoin continues to remain in a bear market. Moreover, a Fair Value Gap has been formed around $87,000, which could be filled in the coming days. Hence, the market participants need to be vigilant as the Bitcoin (BTC) price volatility is expected to kick off during the monthly close.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-29 17:26:54

These filings include major names such as Bitwise, Grayscale, 21Shares Core, Canary Capital, WisdomTree, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton, as projected decision dates range between May and October. 7 of (19?) pending #XRP ETFs w/ decision dates. *SPOT* ETFs Bitwise – May 18, 2025 Grayscale – May 21, 2025 21Shares Core – May 22, 2025 Canary Capital – May 22, 2025 WisdomTree – October 25, 2025 CoinShares – October 25, 2025 Franklin Templeton – October 25, 2025 — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) April 28, 2025 Eleven spot XRP ETF applications are being reviewed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has over 70 pending cryptocurrency ETFs , and 240 days to approve or reject an ETF application following its formal acknowledgment. Based on this timeline, Crypto Eri believes the decisions will align closely with the listed dates, suggesting that several approvals could arrive before the October deadline. Will the SEC Approve XRP ETFs? Some cryptocurrency community members believe that approvals may happen even sooner than projected. One commenter suggested that the U.S. might act more quickly, influenced by developments in other markets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 He noted that “Brazil already has a head start,” as the country recently launched the first XRP ETF . He predicts that the SEC will not wait till October, but may approve pending applications in May. During his campaign, Donald Trump promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world, and the SEC may move quickly to maintain the U.S.’s leadership in the digital asset space. Pending ETF Applications The list of applicants includes several established asset management firms. Bitwise, which filed for its ETF in 2024 , has an anticipated decision date of May 18, 2025, followed closely by Grayscale on May 21, and both 21Shares Core and Canary Capital on May 22. Later in the year, WisdomTree, CoinShares, and Franklin Templeton are each scheduled for October 25, 2025. Each firm’s involvement shows a growing institutional interest in XRP, and with the asset’s regulatory clarity and the absence of legal uncertainty , ETF approval is more likely than ever. Should the SEC approve these ETFs, it would mark a significant milestone for XRP and broader cryptocurrency adoption within traditional financial markets. The crypto industry awaits the SEC’s official decisions, eyeing May as a potentially transformative month for XRP.

Dogecoin market value has climbed 12.12% over the last week to reach $0.174 and successfully passed through its 50-day moving average line since January. In the fourth presale phase Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gained $7.2 million from 9,100 buyers purchasing and holding 425 million tokens at $0.025 price. Participants want to know if Dogecoin and Mutuum Finance tokens will reach $5 trading value by 2025. Market experts analyze whether Doge’s internet popularity or Mutuum Finance’s technical services will drive its price movement more effectively. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Meme-Fueled Climb The investing community shows strong faith in Dogecoin right now. The price moved past its 50-day average indicator on April 22 which marked the first time in 2025 when this pattern occurred. According to TradingShot the currency will possibly achieve $0.90 due to a 1.5 Fibonacci extension. Yet, volatility looms. Large whales sold 570 million DOGE during a one-week period which shows weak investor confidence in the token. The coin only responds to social interest instead of useful applications making investors doubtful. The market will need exceptional enthusiasm to push DOGE from $0.174 to $5 height. Dogecoin stays popular yet becoming worth $5 seems unattainable right now like an unreachable goal. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates under an alternate business model. The 11-stage presale of MUTM has entered Phase 4 while its tokens are available at $0.025. The company has successfully obtained $7.2 million through 9,100 investors who have purchased 425 million tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will activate Phase 5 as per the presale schedule that elevates the token value to $0.03 while providing a 20% profit to existing purchasers. The team seeks to undergo smart contract verification through CertiK which will provide audit results to social media soon. The latest dashboard system presents information about the top 50 token holders and grants them extra tokens based on their position ranks. Mutuum Finance adopts a methodical climb for token value which differs dramatically from Dogecoin’s unpredictable price fluctuations. Mutuum Finance’s DeFi Edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines loan services with borrowing and a distribution mechanism into one platform. Lenders make profits through liquidity pools and borrowers borrow money by providing assets that exceed loan value for security purposes. The platform features tokenomics that generate a 140% return on investment when the token is launched for $0.06 each. After launch Mutuum Finance targets a price of $2.50 which would produce a 9,900% ROI that exceeds the speculative value gains of Dogecoin. The fast selling rate of Phase 4 brings increased pressure due to a $100,000 fund available for early investors. Mutuum Finance demonstrates real utility through its decentralized finance platform which makes it stand superior to meme coins for enduring promise. Racing to $5 Dogecoin (DOGE) requires a major radical transformation to achieve $5 value through community endorsements alongside random market trends. Its $0.90 prediction seems achievable but analysts find the $5 target hard to believe. During the next 1 year Mutuum Finance (MUTM) expects to reach $2.50 through its DeFi product expansion and initial offering success leading to possible $5 valuation in the future. Deciding investors must choose between Dogecoin’s unpredictable market performance or Mutuum Finance’s systematic growth plan.

He argued China should be liable because it sells five times more to the U.S. than the U.S. sells to them, making their tariffs unsustainable. Bessent’s remarks came amid global tensions over the direction of tariffs following President Donald Trump’s April 2 announcement of broad-based global duties. The President later said he would keep in place 10% across-the-board tariffs, but also issued a 90-day pause for more aggressive levies against individual trading partners. Bessent delegates responsibility for reaching a trade agreement with China Bessent Says ‘It’s Up to China to De-Escalate’ in Trade War – Bloomberg Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said “all aspects” of the US government are in contact with China but that it’s up to Beijing to take the first step in de-escalating the tariff fight with the US due to… pic.twitter.com/4PYuWIUgr8 — Ray Wang (@rwang07) April 28, 2025 U.S. President Donald Trump said last week the levies on China will “come down substantially” in the near future. He also mentioned on April 23 that they’re going to have a fair deal with China, stirring hopes of a de-escalation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that he holds China accountable for reaching a trade agreement with the U.S. He said that the tariffs were unsustainable because China sells five times more to the U.S. than the U.S. sells to them. “I believe that it’s up to China to de-escalate because they sell five times more to us than we sell to them, and so these 120%, 145% tariffs are unsustainable.” -Scott Bessent, Treasury Secretary. The Treasury Secretary acknowledged that the U.S. has made progress in negotiations since then, noting India for a potential deal in the coming days among roughly 18 “important trading relationships” that are subject to negotiations. He also maintained that they have had many countries come forward and present “some very good proposals, and we’re evaluating those.” Trump stated last week that he was in talks with Chinese officials about trade as they visited Washington. Other reports dismissed the President’s negotiation claims and indicated that the officials instead were in town for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings. China’s Ministry of Commerce spokesperson, He Yadong, said any claims about the progress of China-U.S. economic and trade negotiations were “groundless and have no factual basis.” The Treasury Secretary suggested over the weekend there was a potential “path” to a deal with China on tariffs after speaking with his Chinese counterparts on the sidelines of the IMF and World Bank meetings. Bessent also maintained that the White House won’t be conducting negotiations in the press. The American politician argued that European nations are likely “in a panic” over the strength of the euro against the U.S. dollar since the genesis of the trade tensions. He noted that the euro had surged nearly 10% this year against the dollar after currencies had reached near parity in early January. Bessent believes the European Central Bank will start cutting rates to get the euro back down. He also added that Europeans don’t want a strong euro and that the U.S. has a strong dollar policy. Trump tariffs cause a slump in shipments to U.S. ports Trump’s trade war has caused nearly a 50% year-over-year drop at West Coast ports.

The Financial Times from Vizion, a data provider, also indicated that container bookings from China to the U.S. dropped 45% by mid-April compared with a year earlier. The U.S. private equity group Apollo Global Management revealed that new businesses have plummeted since Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcement on 2 April. The U.S. trade deficit edged to a record high in January as companies front-loaded imports before tariffs were imposed. The research director at the trading platform XTB, Kathleen Brooks, noted that port authorities in the U.S. and logistics firms are already expecting Chinese shipments to fall sharply. She also acknowledged that demand for goods from China had dropped since mid-April, suggesting that U.S. businesses have been quick to adjust to the tariffs. The vice head of China’s state planner, Zhai Chenxin, mentioned on Monday that he was “fully confident” that Beijing would attain its economic growth target of about 5% for 2025.

As the market advances, success comes from platforms that do more than track prices. Web3 ai is one such platform gaining attention. If you’re trying to decide the best crypto for 2025, this list compares four strong options. One stands out by offering something built-in: AI-powered decision-making. 1. Web3 ai ($WAI): Smart Features for Smarter Trading Web3 ai ($WAI) is made for traders who want built-in strategy. It offers 12 AI tools, including price forecasting, auto bots, and scam checks. These are not outside signals — it’s all built into the system. The $WAI token is now in presale batch 1 for $0.0003. It is expected to launch at $0.005242, pointing to a 1747% ROI. Web3 ai is supported by big names like Google Cloud, OpenAI, and Solana. It already works with Trust Wallet and BNB Chain. Web3 ai’s AI Trading Assistant is designed to give crypto traders an unbeatable edge. Using advanced machine learning, the tool scans technical indicators, price action, and social sentiment to generate real-time trading signals. Everything is in one place — AI bots, real-time updates, and risk tools powered by machine learning. That’s why many consider Web3 ai the best crypto to buy for 2025, especially before presale prices go up. 2. Mantra (OM): Building DeFi That Plays by the Rules Mantra (OM) is working on a new kind of Layer-1 blockchain that follows regulations. This appeals to large investors and users who want steady growth without risk from unclear rules. Mantra includes features like tokenized assets and ID verification. Its focus on legal structure doesn’t limit its speed. OM also supports staking and governance tools, making it useful for people who want yield and safety. As Mantra grows, it has become a strong candidate for the best crypto to buy for 2025, especially for those watching how rules shape DeFi’s future. 3. Ripple (XRP): Focused on Real Use in International Transfers Ripple’s XRP is building value through what it does, not just how it trades. Known as a bridge for cross-border payments, XRP’s role in the financial system is clear. Even after facing legal issues, it has held investor interest. Now that legal outcomes are starting to favor Ripple, more people are seeing the long-term chance. XRP handles fast and low-cost international transfers, making it attractive for global institutions. Large banks are starting to test XRP-based systems again. While XRP is no longer priced like it once was, it still holds strong value when looking at future potential. For those who care more about use than trends, XRP is a strong choice among the best crypto to buy for 2025. 4. Cardano (ADA): Taking a Careful Path Toward DeFi Growth Cardano (ADA) is often seen as slow and steady, but that is part of its plan. Built on peer-reviewed research, Cardano aims to be scalable, connected, and ready for long-term use. While some projects move faster, Cardano focuses on building a strong and lasting base. New upgrades like Hydra show that Cardano is ready for more advanced apps, including DeFi and smart contracts. These changes answer past concerns about its speed. With more developers joining and a growing staking system, ADA is now seen as more than a trading token. This makes it one of the best crypto to buy for 2025, especially for investors who focus on strong design over hype. Looking Ahead: Choosing Smartly in a Fast Market Many crypto projects are powered by excitement, but Web3 ai is different. It brings AI tools, live data, and helpful features together in one place. With a low presale price and built-in tech advantages, it leads the list of the best crypto to buy for 2025 . At the same time, Mantra, XRP, and Cardano offer smart design and growing trust from bigger investors. Each has a role to play in a well-balanced crypto portfolio. Still, with Web3 ai available at an early stage and focused on AI in trading, it may give investors a chance to act before the rest of the market catches on.

This channel is formed by well-established horizontal support and resistance levels, which have been tested numerous times over the past 4 to 5 years. The range, spanning from $4 on the lower end to around $12 at the top, has effectively boxed in DOT’s price action, shaping a long-term sideways market structure. A clear move beyond this 5-year range, especially on strong volume, could mark the beginning of a new trend, either into price discovery or deeper support levels. Analysing Price Action Within The Channel Cessur emphasized in his recent analysis that the green channel shown on the Polkadot chart represents a downtrend that has been in place for nearly four years. This trend has consistently guided the broader market structure, acting as a long-term resistance. However, he noted that if DOT manages to break above this channel, it could set the stage for a major trend reversal to new highs in the months ahead. Related Reading: Polkadot Rebounds Slowly As Oversold Conditions Ignite Bullish Hopes He also drew attention to DOT’s short-term outlook, where a red falling channel on the weekly timeframe has just been breached to the upside. According to Cessur, this development is a sign of potential bullish continuation, positioning DOT as one of the altcoins to start an increase. The analyst concluded that if the asset continues to follow the multi-year pattern of ranging from $4 to $12, another climb toward the top of this range seems likely. Most importantly, if the weekly candle closes above $4.70, he noted that the chances of seeing a swift move toward $10 could increase significantly, supported by growing bullish momentum and historical price behavior. Bear Case: Losing $4 Might Send Polkadot To All-Time Lows The bear case for Polkadot revolves around the critical $4 support level, which has been pivotal in maintaining the altcoin’s price structure. If DOT loses the $4 mark, it might signal a deeper bearish move. This would invalidate recent bullish hopes and raise the potential for further declines as market sentiment shifts to a more risk-averse stance. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Must Retest Crucial Support To Sustain Uptrend – Details Such a drop would suggest that the upward momentum observed in recent months could be a false rally, with DOT’s price unable to maintain its position above key support levels. Its failure to hold above $4 may prompt heightened selling pressure, especially when broader market conditions worsen or there’s a loss of confidence in Polkadot’s long-term prospects. Additionally, a move below this critical support would raise the probability of a retest of all-time lows, which would be a significant bearish development for the token. In this scenario, patience and strategic re-entry points would become key factors for short and long-term holders.

After a volatile run last year, $VIRTUAL is regaining traction – and it’s not alone. Another hot AI play – MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – has just raised $8.5 million and is soon to launch the first iteration of its AI agent. AI agent narratives are heating up again. The broader crypto agent sector jumped 10.9% over the same 24-hour period, fueled by renewed risk appetite and a shift back toward innovation-led plays. But this time, the market isn’t buying into buzzwords alone. Last year, anything with “AI” in the name could raise capital. Now? Utility is the new alpha. Investors are looking for agents that actually work – not just whitepapers with hype. That’s exactly why MIND of Pepe has attracted millions of dollars in presale funding – and why whales are quietly positioning early. This isn’t just another speculative token. MIND of Pepe is preparing to ship its live AI trading agent – and on May 10 the crypto world will see it in action. Virtuals Protocol’s comeback reflects the broader AI agent trend – but a new contender is brewing Last year, $VIRTUAL started 2025 with a bang – smashing nearly 20,000% in gains from its all-time low to reach a record high of $5.07. That momentum didn’t last. The token eventually surrendered all of its gains, sinking below $0.50. However, April marked a major turning point: $VIRTUAL broke out of its downtrend, fueled by renewed investor confidence after the project resolved lingering token allocation concerns. A surge in trading volume further reignited interest, pushing $VIRTUAL back into the spotlight after months of consolidation. $VIRTUAL Virtuals Protocol has broken its Downtrend last week and also successfully confirmed the breakout Trend continuation is in progress Any dips into purple –> retest Shared in the Altcoin Market Update: https://t.co/eozOlvPREF #BTC #Crypto #VirtualsProtocol https://t.co/ufVGrkg52F pic.twitter.com/UGEdqA707U — Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) April 25, 2025 The entire crypto AI agent sector has been heating up as well, with another heavyweight, Bittensor ($TAO), climbing 66% over the past month. As of Tuesday, the crypto AI agent market cap has surpassed $6.9 billion – a major milestone showing the growing appetite for AI-driven projects. But, as mentioned, the dominant narrative now isn’t just about the hype. Today, investors are far more discerning – they’re backing projects that have already developed real, working technology. As Hyros CEO Alex Becker pointed out this week, $TAO’s breakout shows how the market favors actual crypto AI utility. If you look at TAOs chart the last 5 days (up nearly 50%) 1 thing is clear… AI crypto is going to be the dominant utility narrative. AI coins are going to blow up to completely absurd prices. The hype/pressure will be unreal. pic.twitter.com/nLiuqK6CaZ — Alex Becker (@ZssBecker) April 21, 2025 That’s exactly why MIND of Pepe has surged past $8.5 million in presale funding. MIND isn’t just selling an idea – it’s shipping a live AI agent, ready to go public even before the presale ends. And what it has is a system so intelligently designed it could reshape the way crypto trading is done forever. While many projects are still writing whitepapers, MIND of Pepe is getting ready to ship MIND of Pepe is a crypto-native AI agent built to scan the market, track real activity, and find trading opportunities – whether the market’s up or down. It analyzes: Social sentiment trends to spot early narrative shifts On-chain activity like wallet movements and token launches DEX trading surges and liquidity shifts Market fundamentals from live data feeds All these signals are processed through a system designed to filter out real opportunities from the noise. Presale holders get first access to MIND’s early insights – offering a critical first-mover advantage. And what makes MIND different isn’t just the data it reads – it’s how it thinks: trained to understand crypto-native context, connect trends, and adapt over time. With its live AI agent launching on May 10, MIND of Pepe aims to give traders an edge in a market that moves faster than ever. It’s a rare sight in crypto: while still collecting presale funds, the project is already building and launching real technology – showing exactly where serious investor capital is starting to flow. Whales are positioning for MIND of Pepe’s launch As MIND of Pepe’s launch date draws closer, deep-pocketed crypto players have been quietly moving in. On Sunday, a major buy-in bought roughly 33 million $MIND tokens – totaling about $125,000 in fresh capital. This early accumulation signals smart money at work – investors who spot potential before the broader market catches up. In crypto, following smart money often leads straight to real opportunities – long before the headlines catch up. And in this case, early movers aren’t just betting on MIND of Pepe’s AI capabilities – they’re positioning to benefit from a token that powers an entire AI ecosystem. As demand continues to build during the presale, $ MIND could deliver even bigger gains once the project’s live AI agent launches and visibility expands across the crypto space. Here’s your shot to become a whale in a crypto AI agent project that isn’t just promising tech – it’s launching it To join, simply head to the MIND of Pepe website , connect your wallet – like Best Wallet – and grab $MIND using ETH, USDT, or even a bank card. $MIND is currently priced at $0.0037465 per token – but this price is only available for the next 13 hours, after which a scheduled price increase will kick off the next funding stage. Even from the initial presale purchase, $MIND holders can already earn a 268% annual percentage yield (APY) through the project’s own staking protocol, offering rewards while waiting for full launch. The yield changes dynamically in response to the amount of tokens deposited into the staking smart contract. MIND of Pepe has also been spotlighted in Best Wallet’s ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section – a curated screener that highlights projects primed for upside with impressive accuracy. Best Wallet is available now on Google Play or the Apple App Store .

In a financial stability report published on Tuesday, officials in Rome said the United States’ growing support for crypto assets risks making them so important that a future collapse would hammer banks, bond markets, and the real economy. According to the Bank’s report: “The strong growth of Bitcoin and of other crypto assets with high price volatility means risks not only for investors but also potentially for financial stability, given the growing interconnections between the digital asset ecosystem, the traditional financial sector, and the real economy.” They pointed out that it’s no longer just retail investors throwing money into crypto. The links between crypto and the old-school financial world are getting tight enough to trigger real fallout if things turn bad. Italy raises alarm over stablecoin risks after Trump’s crypto push The Bank of Italy made it clear that Trump’s win in November and his move into office in January opened the floodgates for crypto in Washington. They highlighted how US lawmakers, riding the momentum of the new administration, have been rushing to set up a regulatory framework for stablecoins. A bill in the Senate has enough backing to move forward. The Bank of Italy warned that this political environment could fast-track crypto’s integration into the mainstream. European officials aren’t thrilled either. Francois Villeroy de Galhau of France and Olli Rehn of Finland, both policymakers at the European Central Bank, voiced serious worries about crypto going mainstream in the United States. Rehn said bluntly on Monday, “I’m quite concerned about possible mainstreaming of cryptoassets in the US.” European officials fear that if stablecoins, especially dollar-pegged ones, go big under Trump’s watch, the ripple effects could hammer economies worldwide. The Bank of Italy flagged that besides dollar-backed coins, there are stablecoins tied to the euro and other assets, too. They warned that while dollar-tied stablecoins have mostly held steady, the rest of the crypto market remains dangerously volatile. Italy’s central bank said the wild price swings in these assets show just how badly things could go wrong if these instruments dig deeper into the traditional financial system. Italy’s report also said: “After the new US administration took office and following the announcement of its initiatives to promote the use of crypto assets, there was also a temporary but sharp increase in global market prices for these products, including highly speculative ones.” They stressed that the higher the overlap between crypto and regular finance, the more fragile the entire system becomes. Italy says stablecoin crash could hit bonds and spread chaos The Italian central bank’s nightmare scenario is a stablecoin issuer falling apart. The report spelled out that most major stablecoin issuers depend heavily on short-term US Treasuries to back their tokens. If one of these issuers collapses, it could unleash a mad rush by holders scrambling to cash out. “In the event of a failure of one of the latter, there could be a rush to reimbursements, with a sudden increase in requests for liquidation by the holders and with the forced sale of reserve assets,” the report said. The Bank of Italy warned that if everyone tries to sell their Treasury holdings at once, the US government bond market would get slammed hard. That stress wouldn’t stay contained either — the shock would smash into banks, funds, and other key parts of the world economy. They painted a picture where one crypto crash could start a domino effect that no one is ready for. The financial stability report also pointed out that it’s one of the first since Trump’s tariffs sparked heavy market instability. Even though market tensions have cooled a little since April, the Bank of Italy said risks are still higher across the board compared to before Trump took over. Their report gave a stark reminder that even small policy moves now carry much bigger consequences, thanks to how unstable everything has become. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

While queries are run off-chain, the generated ZK proof is submitted to a smart contract on the blockchain, verifying the data without ever seeing it directly. At the same time, ZK proofs also enable applications to scale more efficiently, because most data transfers don’t happen on-chain.

To read full editions, subscribe . An RTFKT buyer in Australia is suing Nike via a proposed class-action lawsuit, accusing the apparel giant of deceptive practices, unfair competition, unjust enrichment and unlawful trade practices with its numerous NFT collections. The lawsuit, filed last week in the Eastern District of New York, alleges that Nike committed a “brazen rug pull” via its subsidiary RTFKT, pronounced “artifact,” which it acquired in late 2021. “Nike used its iconic brand and marketing prowess to hype, promote, and prop up the unregistered securities that RTFKT sold,” the filing viewed by Blockworks alleges. The 42-page filing argues in detail that what RTFKT sold across a range of different NFT collections were actually securities under US law. But it also makes the overarching argument that even if a court finds those digital assets not to be securities, there are still five counts in the lawsuit to reckon with. It also argues that the rug pull it says occurred is a “deceptive act” in and of itself. Nike is accused of violating the New York Deceptive Acts and Practices Unlawful Act, the California Unfair Competition Law, the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, and the Oregon Unlawful Trade Practices Act. It further alleges “Unjust Enrichment,” accusing Nike of further “enriching” itself with the NFT buyers’ funds. The dispute is over a minimum of $5 million, but the filing does not specifically state a dollar amount of damages desired. Nike made piles of cash from RTFKT. One dashboard found that the CloneX “Mintvials” generated over $80 million in revenue alone. RTFKT trading activity peaked in 2022, but it had substantially subsided by 2023. The CloneX avatars made with artist Takashi Murakami were the most successful collection by far. RTFKT then announced it was shutting down in December 2024, just three years after Nike acquired it. No reason for the shutdown was provided. RTFKT Head of Tech Samuel Cardillo declined to comment. Cardillo has publicly referred to himself as “the last man standing” at the Nike subsidiary. Blockworks reached out to Nike as well as RTFKT cofounders Chris Le and Benoit Pagotto for comment. Le’s Linkedin shows that he left RTFKT and Nike in January 2025, but Pagotto’s profile still shows him as employed at Nike and RTFKT. Last week, a day before the lawsuit was filed, the art for the CloneX RTFKT NFTs disappeared overnight due to an issue with its Cloudflare hosting plan. Cardillo later said the issue was due to an error, not an unpaid bill. The collection’s art was then subsequently restored. Cloudflare did not reply to Blockworks’ previous request for comment. On Monday, Cardillo said the CloneX NFTs had migrated (off Cloudflare) to Arweave for “permanent storage.” If this lawsuit progresses, it won’t be the only class-action suit about an NFT “rug pull.” The class-action lawsuit against Logan Paul’s CryptoZoo NFT game remains ongoing as well.

Analyst predicts that Dogecoin could rally to $0.74 if it closes above $0.20 this month. Shiba Inu’s breakout signals potential for a 124% rise, targeting $0.00003 by May 2025. The market is showing a renewed interest in meme coins, especially for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). The cryptocurrency market has shown a notable increase in performance, with both coins rising in value by more than 9% during the previous week. As market conditions improve and garner investor interest, analysts highlight meme coins as potential investment opportunities for future earnings in the upcoming weeks. According to analyst Ali Martinez, he predicted that if DOGE closes the month above $0.20, it would trigger a breakout towards a potential target of $0.74. The $0.20 price level serves as a base indicator for bullish control, attracting future market participants. The market will likely experience upward traction if there is a solid price rise breaking through $0.20.

This could show that American consumers are affected most by Trump tariffs, not China. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, “Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” According to analysts, more than 70% of the goods sold on Amazon by wholesalers and stores come from China, though it’s hard to say. Therefore, due to higher import costs, Amazon sellers are raising the prices of a wide range of popular items, such as diaper bags, fridge magnets, charm bracelets, and more. SmartScout, an e-commerce software company, looked at 930 Amazon goods whose prices have gone up since April 9. The average price increase was 29%, and the items affected were toys, clothes, jewelry, household items, office supplies, and electronics. White House’s political double standards towards Amazon In the past, Bezos and Trump’s relationship was sour. In December, he was optimistic about the Republican’s second term, saying that he thinks Trump has become calmer and more sure of himself. Amazon even gave $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund in the same month. Bezos told the Washington Post, which he owns that its opinion section could only print pieces that defended “personal liberties and free markets.” However, it doesn’t seem that way anymore. When asked whether Bezos is still a Trump supporter, Leavitt said, “Look, I will not speak to the president’s relationships with Jeff Bezos, but I will tell you that this is certainly a hostile and political action by Amazon.” Her response could signal an emerging rift between Trump and Bezos. Trump has not favored any of his billionaire friends. In fact, most of them have lost billions of money in his tariff war. This includes Elon Musk and other tech giants. Amazon isn’t the first store to draw attention to how new taxes are affecting its prices. Shein and Temu, two huge fast fashion brands based in China, have both recently added huge fees. A new line at checkout on Temu’s website shows an “import charge” that adds about 145% to each item. Amazon’s stock price has dropped 15% so far this year Shares of the online retail giant dropped more than 2% in premarket trading following the remarks. The trade war with China has hurt sellers on Amazon’s third-party platform, where about 60% of the company’s online sales happen. BREAKING: The White House has accused Amazon, $AMZN , of being partnered with “a Chinese propaganda arm.” https://t.co/FvrpVOs6f4 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) April 29, 2025 Many traders are based in China or depend on the world’s second-largest economy to get their goods and put them together. Sellers now have to decide whether to raise prices or pay the extra costs of Trump’s new taxes. Many sellers risk quitting their business because their profit margins are so small. For the past few years, they’ve also had to deal with rising costs on Amazon due to storage, delivery, shipping, and advertising fees and price pressure from more sellers. The tariff problem has just added more pressure. Amazon’s stock price has dropped 15% so far this year, following the rest of the market down. Next week, the company will report its earnings for the first quarter. Depending on whether the report has good or bad news. The stock will either go up or down. Also, Jim Cramer has commented on the issue saying, “Amazon NOT putting tariff prices on goods. False story.. wow , president ran with it.” The market prophet pointed out that Trump panicked at everything that could affect the US markets. It seems like the US is losing.

The move follows 21Shares’ April 10 filing of its initial proposal to launch its Dogecoin ETF , shortly after similar applications from rivals Bitwise and Grayscale. The asset manager has also sought regulators’ permission to list ETFs holding other cryptocurrencies, including Solana ( SOL ), XRP ( XRP ), and Polkadot ( DOT ). Nasdaq must gain approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before it can list and trade the fund.

However, Seyffart highlighted that the commission may not take all the time until the fourth quarter to issue final decisions for the spot XRP ETFs.

This year Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have found their footing again, but the real excitement is with projects like Ruvi AI that offer real innovation and astronomical growth. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu get the attention, Ruvi AI is the project with the clearest 50x to 100x potential in the near future. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Show Strong Momentum Dogecoin, the original meme coin, is gaining traction with accumulation around the $0.18 mark. Investors are bullish and analysts say this consolidation could be a setup for a breakout. Shiba Inu has broken out of a long downtrend. With a 16% weekly gain Shiba Inu’s performance is being driven by broader market sentiment and its strong correlation with Bitcoin which is at all time highs. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are fun for short term trading, their reliance on speculation keeps them in no man’s land. Ruvi AI offers not just huge growth but real utility, making it a better investment for those looking for long term gains. Why Ruvi AI Could Change the Game Ruvi AI is getting attention for a reason. This revolutionary project combines artificial intelligence and blockchain to solve real world problems across multiple industries. From streamlining workflows in enterprises to enabling more efficient diagnostics in healthcare, Ruvi AI is a utility driven project that goes beyond market speculation. Within days of launching its presale Ruvi AI raised over $100,000 by selling 10 million tokens. This wasn’t just hype, it’s a sign of investor confidence in the project’s value and the team’s ability to deliver. One of Ruvi AI’s biggest achievements is releasing a functional beta product within just a week of its presale. This is capability and commitment, not just a token to trade, but an investment in a product that will improve industries. VIP Tiers for All Investors Ruvi AI has designed its presale VIP tiers to reward investors generously no matter where they start. For those new to crypto VIP Tier 2 is a simple yet rewarding entry point. A $500 investment gets 50,000 RUVI tokens at the current presale price of $0.01. Beyond that a 40% bonus adds 20,000 more tokens, for a total of 70,000 tokens. At the confirmed listing price of $0.07 this investment would be worth $4,900, 880% ROI. If Ruvi AI reaches its projected $1 per token milestone that same investment would be worth $70,000, 13,900% ROI. For investors looking to maximize their profits VIP Tier 5 is the way to go. With a $5,000 investment, Tier 5 investors get 500,000 tokens at $0.01 each. Thanks to a 100% bonus their holdings are doubled to 1,000,000 tokens. At the confirmed listing price of $0.07 the investment is worth $70,000. But if the token reaches its long term projection of $1 per token the value jumps to $1,000,000. This tier has a 19,900% ROI potential making it perfect for those looking for life changing returns. Leaderboard Rewards for Active Participants Ruvi AI doesn’t just reward financial investments but also prioritizes building an active community. Its leaderboard system rewards top contributors. Investors who get in the Top 10 on the leaderboard get 500,000 tokens. At a future price of $1 per token that’s $500,000, proof of their commitment to Ruvi AI’s growth. Even at the other end of the spectrum Ruvi AI makes sure smaller players get meaningful rewards. Those in the Top 1000 get 20,000 tokens. At the $0.07 listing price that’s $1,400. If the token reaches $1 that’s $20,000. The leaderboard doesn’t just incentivize participation it fosters a sense of community and shared purpose, making Ruvi AI’s growth a team effort. Why Ruvi AI is a Different Kind of Crypto Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are fun but their reliance on speculation makes them volatile. Ruvi AI offers innovation, utility and solid tokenomics. Its AI and blockchain blend isn’t just theory, it’s a working beta and a detailed roadmap. By offering short term returns and long term potential Ruvi AI is the smart choice for sustainable wealth building. Newbies and experienced crypto enthusiasts can participate with flexible VIP tiers and leaderboard rewards.

Pi (PI) has surged by an impressive 51% over the past 12 days, rebounding from its lowest point of $0.4012 to around $0.75. This recovery followed a sharp decline from $1.83 to $0.51 between March 13 and April 4, creating a downward channel. The recent breakout hints at a possible momentum shift. Technical indicators paint a mixed picture. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) stays positive, suggesting bullish momentum, and the Money Flow Index (MFI) points to increased buyer activity. However, a negative funding rate shows that short positions still dominate, raising the chance of a short squeeze driving prices even higher. Resistance is currently seen near $0.75, with a strong support zone around $0.56. If PI sustains its rise and clears $0.75, it could head toward $1.40, matching the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. But if it struggles to hold, lower support levels might be tested again. Solana’s Bullish Moves: Will SOL Climb Past the $134 Hurdle? Solana (SOL) shows strong bullish signals, trading between $123 and $134 over the last three weeks. This stability is largely driven by growing cash flow into Solana’s DeFi ecosystem, highlighting increasing confidence. Plus, recent updates from major platforms have further strengthened its outlook. Coinbase, for instance, improved its Solana services, offering five times quicker block processing and four times enhanced RPC performance, significantly boosting user experience. Meanwhile, Robinhood introduced zero network fees for selected Solana transactions until June 9, 2025, making it even more user-friendly. These factors have built positive momentum among traders. According to Binance, more than 71% of open positions on SOL are betting on an upward move. If Solana breaks through $134 resistance, it could confirm a bullish reversal and set the stage for larger gains. As a result, many are keeping a close eye on SOL’s next moves.

43953834,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153798,1745949631,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exciting Dogecoin ETF Filing: 21Shares Eyes NASDAQ Spot,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dogecoin-etf-21shares-filing/,"Big news is shaking up the crypto world! 21Shares, a major player in the cryptocurrency exchange-traded product space, has officially filed for a Dogecoin ETF with NASDAQ. This development, initially reported by Solid Intel on X, marks a potentially significant step for the popular meme-inspired cryptocurrency, aiming to bring it into the realm of traditional finance through an accessible investment vehicle. For many crypto enthusiasts and traditional investors alike, the idea of a Dogecoin ETF has been a topic of speculation. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have gained traction and regulatory approval in various regions, a spot ETF for a memecoin like DOGE represents a unique frontier. This filing suggests that firms like 21Shares see growing demand and potential for Dogecoin among a broader investor base, seeking regulated and familiar ways to gain exposure. What Does the Dogecoin ETF Filing Actually Mean? Let’s break down what this filing entails. When an asset management firm like 21Shares files for an Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), they are proposing a new investment product that would trade on a traditional stock exchange, like NASDAQ in this case. An ETF typically holds an underlying asset (or a basket of assets) and issues shares that track the asset’s price. For a Dogecoin ETF, this would mean the fund holds actual DOGE, and investors would buy and sell shares of the fund on NASDAQ, rather than buying and selling DOGE directly on a cryptocurrency exchange. The filing is the first step in a potentially lengthy regulatory process. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reviews such applications. The SEC’s primary focus is on investor protection and market integrity. While the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in the US earlier this year was a landmark event, the path for a Dogecoin ETF could present different challenges, given DOGE’s origins, volatility, and classification as a memecoin rather than a utility or store-of-value asset. The significance of this filing cannot be overstated for the Dogecoin community and the broader altcoin market. It signals increasing institutional interest in assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum and could pave the way for other altcoin or memecoin ETFs in the future, provided regulatory hurdles can be cleared. Exploring the Potential Benefits and Challenges of a 21Shares DOGE ETF The potential launch of a 21Shares DOGE ETF could introduce several benefits for investors and the Dogecoin ecosystem: Increased Accessibility: Traditional investors, who may be hesitant to navigate cryptocurrency exchanges or manage private keys, could easily invest in Dogecoin through their standard brokerage accounts. This opens up DOGE to a much wider pool of capital. Regulatory Clarity (Perceived): An ETF structure operates within existing financial regulations, potentially offering investors a sense of security and familiarity that direct crypto ownership might not. Liquidity and Ease of Trading: Trading on a major exchange like NASDAQ typically offers high liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell ETF shares throughout the trading day. Institutional Adoption: The existence of a DOGE ETF could encourage more institutional investors to consider allocating capital to Dogecoin, potentially increasing demand and stability. However, the journey to approval and the nature of a DOGE ETF also come with significant challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The SEC’s stance on memecoins and their potential classification as securities remains a major question mark. Dogecoin’s lack of a clear development roadmap or central authority could complicate the review process. Market Volatility: Dogecoin is known for its high price volatility, often driven by social media trends and celebrity endorsements. While the ETF tracks the price, this inherent volatility remains a risk for investors in the fund. Fees: ETFs typically charge management fees, which would be an additional cost compared to holding DOGE directly (though direct holding might incur trading fees). Tracking Error: There can sometimes be a slight difference (tracking error) between the performance of the ETF shares and the underlying asset’s price due to fees, operational costs, and market dynamics. Comparing investing via an ETF versus buying DOGE directly involves weighing these factors: Feature Dogecoin ETF Direct DOGE Purchase Accessibility Brokerage accounts Crypto exchanges Regulation Regulated structure (pending approval) Varies by exchange/jurisdiction Custody Managed by fund (21Shares) Self-custody or exchange wallet Fees Management fees Trading fees Complexity Lower for traditional investors Higher (wallets, keys, exchanges) Control Less direct control over asset Full control (with self-custody) Navigating the Path to a DOGE ETF NASDAQ Listing: What’s Next? The filing with NASDAQ is just the beginning of the journey towards a potential DOGE ETF NASDAQ listing. The application now enters a review phase with the SEC. This process can take several months, and involves public comment periods and potential back-and-forth between 21Shares and the regulator. The SEC will scrutinize various aspects, including: The proposed fund structure and how it will hold and value Dogecoin. Custody arrangements for the underlying DOGE. Market surveillance and measures to prevent manipulation, a key concern for volatile assets like DOGE. Whether Dogecoin itself qualifies as a security under US law. Given the SEC’s historical caution regarding crypto products, especially those beyond Bitcoin, the approval is far from guaranteed. The outcome could depend heavily on the SEC’s evolving understanding of cryptocurrencies, particularly memecoins, and whether 21Shares can adequately address potential concerns regarding market manipulation and investor protection in their filing. Successful examples like the recent US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs provide a potential template, but Dogecoin’s unique characteristics mean the SEC’s evaluation will likely involve specific considerations related to its decentralized nature (or perceived lack thereof by some), its inflationary supply schedule, and its price drivers. Understanding Crypto ETF News and Its Potential Market Impact Major Crypto ETF News events, such as this 21Shares filing, often generate significant market interest. The anticipation and eventual launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in various jurisdictions have historically been associated with increased price volatility and sometimes positive price movements for the underlying assets, driven by speculation and the expectation of new capital inflows. While correlation isn’t causation, the filing itself creates buzz around Dogecoin. If approved, a DOGE ETF could potentially: Increase demand for DOGE as the fund buys the underlying asset to back its shares. Boost Dogecoin’s visibility and perceived legitimacy among a broader audience. Influence the sentiment around other memecoins, potentially leading to increased interest or speculation in that sector. However, the actual market impact will depend on various factors, including the size of the ETF, the level of investor adoption, and the prevailing market conditions at the time of launch (if approved). It’s crucial for investors to look beyond the headlines and understand the fundamentals. Actionable Insights for Those Looking to Invest in Dogecoin via ETF (If Approved) For investors considering how to Invest in Dogecoin , the potential availability of an ETF adds a new option. Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This cannot be stressed enough. Understand what a Dogecoin ETF is, how it works, the fees involved, and critically, the nature of Dogecoin itself as an asset. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Dogecoin is a volatile asset. An ETF makes it easier to access, but it doesn’t reduce the inherent price risk. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Understand the Structure: Familiarize yourself with how the 21Shares ETF (if approved) plans to hold DOGE, its custody solutions, and its tracking methodology. Compare Options: Consider whether an ETF aligns better with your investment goals and comfort level than buying DOGE directly on an exchange. Think about convenience, costs, and control over your assets. Stay Informed: Follow the SEC’s review process and any further announcements from 21Shares. The regulatory journey is a key factor in the potential launch timeline and outcome. Remember, a filing is not an approval. The process is ongoing, and the outcome is uncertain. Treat this news as an important development to monitor, but base investment decisions on thorough research and a clear understanding of the risks involved. In Conclusion: A Potential Milestone for Dogecoin 21Shares’ filing for a Dogecoin ETF with NASDAQ is undoubtedly a significant moment for the Dogecoin community and the wider cryptocurrency market. It signals increasing interest from traditional finance in assets beyond the largest cryptocurrencies and represents a potential pathway for Dogecoin to become more accessible to a broader range of investors through a regulated product. While the road to approval is likely to be challenging, involving careful scrutiny from the SEC, this development highlights the evolving landscape of crypto investment and the growing demand for diverse exposure. Whether the Dogecoin ETF ultimately gets the green light remains to be seen, but the filing itself is a testament to Dogecoin’s enduring presence and the innovative efforts by firms like 21Shares to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the dynamic world of digital assets.

Is DOGE a good investment? Dogecoin has strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is highly volatile and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification and research are advised. The coin is expected to touch the $0.466 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price decreased to $0.1781 over the last 24 hours. DOGE is yet to overcome the strong resistance at the $0.1893 mark. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.300041 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by January 2027. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1 by 2030. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 3002.18 DOGE in April; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.468 on December 8, 2024, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.30 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin’s price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March’s bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE’s value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, while at the start of April, DOGE depreciated further to the $0.167 range.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|MINING|SPONSORED|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-29 18:00:39

The firm did not disclose how much prices would rise due to uncertainty about tariff rates, with key suppliers in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The sportswear manufacturer said it was currently unable to produce almost any of its products in the U.S. The firm said it uses factories in countries including Vietnam and Cambodia, which are facing U.S. levies upwards of 40% in the absence of a trade deal. Adidas wants to raise prices on all U.S. products due to tariffs Adidas warns it will raise prices on all U.S. products due to tariffs https://t.co/0Kn5klFNJ2 — Pradheep J. Shanker, M.D. (@neoavatara) April 29, 2025 Due to Trump’s global trade war , the German athletic apparel and footwear corporation Adidas said it would hike prices for all its U.S. products . The firm acknowledged it did not yet know by how much it would raise prices. The sportswear manufacturer also noted that the global trade war prevented it from raising its full-year outlook despite a bumper increase in first-quarter profits. The firm argued that higher tariffs would eventually cause higher costs for all their products in the U.S. market. The Germany-based company highlighted that it was “somewhat exposed” to White House tariffs on Beijing, which are currently at a rate of 145%. The firm also added that it had already reduced exports of its China-made products to the U.S. to a minimum. Adidas believes that the biggest impact was coming from the general increase in U.S. tariffs on all other countries, which are maintained at 10% as trade negotiations take place. “Therefore, we cannot make any final decisions on what to do. Cost increases due to higher tariffs will eventually cause price increases, not only in our sector, but it is currently impossible to quantify these or to conclude what impact this could have on the consumer demand for our products.” -Adidas. Adidas stated it would have raised its full-year outlook for revenues and operating profit due to a strong order book and positive brand sentiment if not for U.S. tariffs. The company instead reaffirmed its existing outlook but added that the “range of possible outcomes has increased.” The firm’s CEO , Bjorn Gulden, said today that since Adidas cannot produce almost any of its products in the U.S., the higher tariffs will eventually cause higher costs for all its products in the U.S. market.

Kanthan (@Kanthan2030) April 27, 2025 Some economists said Trump’s tariffs and the uncertainty with his overall trade policy have led companies to raise prices on the goods they produce. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on April 16 during a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago that the tariffs were larger than forecasters expected and larger than the Fed expected in its upside case. Powell also noted that the Fed’s role is to ensure it will be a one-time price increase and not something that turns into an ongoing inflation process. He also acknowledged that the Fed is monitoring how much prices rise, which is still unclear. Chinese retailers Shein and Temu released notices on April 16, both reading that their operating expenses had increased due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs. Shien said that it will be making price adjustments starting April 25. Automaker Ford also said it plans to raise prices on new gas and electric cars starting in May unless the President gives the industry some relief from levies. Trump mentioned on April 14 that he was contemplating a temporary tariff exemption for autos to give manufacturers more time to move production to the U.S. Volkswagen maintained that it would place an import fee on vehicles made outside the U.S. in response to Trump’s 25% tariff on car imports. The company’s North American CEO, Kjell Gruner, said the company would keep prices steady through the end of May, but they could increase in June. Food company Conagra Brands CEO Sean Connolly highlighted that it may hike prices to offset the cost of tariffs on ingredients like cocoa, olive oil, palm oil, and a type of steel used for its canned products.

According to a new court filing, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York is asking a federal judge to sentence Mashinsky to at least 20 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to crimes that led to billions of dollars in losses for Celsius customers. “In sum, this case is on par with other white-collar crimes that have been met with sentences at and above 15 years. Given the number of aggravating factors here, the Government respectfully recommends a sentence of at least 20 years. Alexander Mashinsky committed a massive fraud: through calculated deception and exploitation, he inflicted catastrophic financial and emotional harm on thousands of victims. He enriched himself while destroying lives, and even today refuses to acknowledge what he did. For these reasons, the Government respectfully submits that the Court should impose a substantial term of imprisonment, in an amount of at least 20 years, to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, and afford effective deterrence.” In December, Mashinsky pleaded guilty to one count of commodities fraud and one count of securities fraud. As part of his plea, Mashinsky also agreed to forfeit the $48 million in proceeds he generated as a result of his scheme by selling the CEL token. Said the DOJ said in a December statement, “Artificially inflating the price of CEL allowed Mashinsky to sell his own CEL holdings for a substantial profit. Mashinsky personally reaped approximately $48 million in proceeds from his sales of CEL. At various times, Mashinsky made false and misleading public statements about his own sales of CEL, claiming that he was not selling CEL, when, in reality, he was taking advantage of the upward price manipulation he had orchestrated by contemporaneously selling huge quantities of his CEL on the market, including, on occasion, to Celsius itself.” Mashinsky’s sentencing is scheduled for May 8th.

Top ADA Price Predictions Revealed,https://cryptopotato.com/where-is-cardano-headed-next-top-ada-price-predictions-revealed/,"TL;DR Market observers are eyeing a breakout for ADA, with short-term targets ranging from $0.88 to $1.30. One industry participant sees a long-term bullish scenario where the asset could reach $10 by 2029 – a level that would require its market cap to exceed $350 billion. Major Rally on the Horizon? The price of Cardano’s ADA climbed by 11% in the past week following the overall revival of the cryptocurrency market. It currently trades at around $0.71 (per CoinGecko’s data), and multiple analysts envision the potential for further gains in the short term. ADA Price, Source: CoinGecko The popular X user Ali Martinez thinks ADA is approaching “a major test” at $0.74. He believes a breakout above this mark could set the stage for an upswing toward $0.88. Other industry participants set even higher targets. Crypto King told his over 120,000 followers on X that ADA has been “consolidating really well” in the past day. They think the asset needs to remain in the $0.60-$0.70 range before rising to $1. The X user Token Talk noted that ADA has been recently trading sideways at approximately $0.70. According to them, analysts see a possible push to $1.20-$1.30, envisioning a “long-term bullish case” for $10 by 2029. It is important to note that ADA’s market cap would skyrocket to roughly $360 billion (based on the current circulating supply of 36 billion tokens) if this prediction comes true. As of the moment , the asset’s capitalization stands at $25 billion, making the forecast quite unlikely, at least in the current environment. Meanwhile, the X user with over 2.2 million followers – Lucky – is also fond of ADA. A few days ago, the analyst envisioned a price uptrend above $1.60, labeling Cardano as “one of the strongest projects in the entire crypto space.” What Can Ignite a Further Uptick? Perhaps the biggest catalyst for a potential price surge for Cardano’s native token is the possible approval of a spot ADA ETF in the United States. Grayscale sought permission to launch such an investment vehicle, and the US SEC acknowledged the application in February. If greenlighted, the product will enable easy access for institutions and retail investors to gain ADA exposure without worrying about storing the underlying asset . According to Polymarket, the approval odds before the end of 2025 currently stand at around 45%. Additionally, the token could experience a price upswing in the event of a major partnership featuring Cardano. Recent discussions and developments involving the entity and Ripple hinted that a collaboration between the two might be incoming; however, nothing is official yet.

43954073,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153797,1745950222,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Critical Forex Analysis: BofA Securities Warns on US Dollar Rallies,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bofa-forex-analysis-usd/,"For those navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding broader macroeconomic signals is paramount. The strength or weakness of the US Dollar Outlook often has a significant ripple effect on risk assets like Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Recently, a notable voice from the traditional finance realm, BofA Securities Forecast , has issued a clear perspective: investors should look to ‘fade’ rallies in the US dollar. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it important for anyone watching the markets, especially crypto? What Does ‘Fade US Dollar Rallies’ Mean? When analysts recommend ‘fading’ a rally in an asset, they are essentially suggesting that periods of strength are temporary and should be used as selling opportunities, rather than buying opportunities. In the context of the Forex Analysis from BofA Securities, this means that recent or upcoming periods where the US dollar gains value against other currencies are not expected to last. Instead of interpreting these rallies as the start of a sustained uptrend for the dollar, BofA suggests viewing them as fleeting movements likely to reverse. This perspective is rooted in a detailed analysis of various economic indicators and market dynamics. It challenges the idea that the dollar is set for a prolonged period of dominance, despite its status as the world’s primary reserve currency. Understanding this nuance is key to interpreting broader Currency Market Trends . Why is BofA Securities Taking This Stance? BofA Securities’ view is based on several factors influencing the global economic landscape and monetary policy expectations. Here are some key reasons often cited in such forecasts: Changing Interest Rate Expectations: The pace and potential end point of interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve are crucial for the dollar. If the market starts anticipating rate cuts sooner, or believes the hiking cycle is near its peak, the interest rate advantage the dollar currently holds could diminish, reducing its appeal. Global Economic Recovery (or Lack Thereof): A stronger global economy outside the U.S. could lead to capital flowing out of dollar-denominated assets and into other regions, weakening the dollar. Conversely, a global slowdown might support the dollar as a safe haven, but BofA’s view suggests they see factors limiting this effect. Inflation Dynamics: While inflation has been a driver of aggressive Fed policy (supportive of the dollar), signs of cooling inflation could reinforce the idea that the Fed might pivot, impacting the dollar negatively. Valuation Concerns: At certain points, the dollar can become overvalued based on purchasing power parity or other metrics. BofA’s analysis might suggest the dollar is currently trading at levels that are unsustainable in the long term based on fundamentals. Fiscal Policy and Debt: While less of a short-term driver than monetary policy, long-term concerns about U.S. fiscal deficits and debt could also play a role in a cautious US Dollar Outlook . These factors combine to paint a picture where the fundamental drivers that supported the dollar’s strength in recent periods may be losing momentum, leading to the forecast to fade rallies. How Do Currency Market Trends Impact Crypto? The relationship between the USD and Crypto is complex but often shows an inverse correlation, especially with Bitcoin. Here’s why this connection is important: Risk-On vs. Risk-Off Sentiment: The US dollar is often considered a safe-haven asset. When global market sentiment is ‘risk-off’ (investors are fearful and seeking safety), capital tends to flow into the dollar, strengthening it. In such environments, risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies often decline. Conversely, when sentiment is ‘risk-on’ (investors are optimistic and seeking growth), capital may flow out of safe havens like the dollar and into riskier assets, potentially boosting crypto prices. Liquidity: The US dollar is the most liquid currency globally. Its movements affect global liquidity, which can spill over into crypto markets. Borrowing Costs: Global borrowing is often done in dollars. Changes in dollar strength and interest rates affect these costs, influencing investment decisions across asset classes, including crypto. Pricing: Most major cryptocurrencies are priced against the US dollar. While this doesn’t directly cause price movements, the relative strength of the dollar can influence trading psychology and capital flows. Therefore, if BofA Securities’ forecast of fading US dollar rallies holds true, it could imply a potential shift towards a more ‘risk-on’ environment, which historically has been supportive of the USD and Crypto relationship being inverse – a weaker dollar potentially coinciding with stronger crypto prices. Considering the BofA Securities Forecast: What Are the Actionable Insights? Given this BofA Securities Forecast , what should investors, particularly those in the crypto space, consider? It’s crucial to remember that this is just one forecast among many, and market conditions can change rapidly. However, it offers a valuable perspective to incorporate into your overall strategy. For Crypto Investors: Monitor USD Strength: Pay attention to the Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar against a basket of major currencies. If DXY rallies appear short-lived and reverse, it aligns with BofA’s view and could be a positive signal for risk assets like crypto. Assess Risk Appetite: A fading dollar rally might indicate increasing global risk appetite. This could support higher valuations for cryptocurrencies. Diversification: While a weaker dollar might be bullish for crypto, macro factors are complex. Ensure your portfolio is diversified according to your risk tolerance. For Forex Traders: Look for Selling Opportunities: Consistent with BofA’s view, consider selling the dollar against other major currencies (like the Euro, Yen, or Pound) during periods of dollar strength. Focus on Relative Strength: Analyze which other currencies have stronger fundamentals or are backed by central banks still perceived as hawkish. Risk Management: As with any trading strategy, use stop-losses and manage your position sizes carefully, as currency markets are highly volatile. This Forex Analysis from BofA provides a potential roadmap, but execution requires careful timing and risk management. Are There Challenges or Counterarguments to This View? While BofA Securities presents a compelling case, no forecast is guaranteed. Several factors could challenge the view that US dollar rallies will fade: Persistent Inflation: If U.S. inflation proves stickier than expected, the Fed might be forced to maintain higher rates for longer, continuing to support the dollar. Global Recession Fears: A significant downturn in the global economy could trigger a flight to safety, paradoxically strengthening the dollar as a safe haven, even if U.S. fundamentals weaken. Geopolitical Risks: Escalating international conflicts or political instability can increase demand for the dollar as a perceived safe asset. Unexpected Policy Shifts: Sudden changes in central bank rhetoric or government policy in the U.S. or other major economies could alter Currency Market Trends rapidly. Therefore, while the BofA Securities Forecast offers valuable insight, investors must remain adaptable and monitor incoming economic data and global events that could shift the balance. Summary: Navigating the US Dollar Outlook BofA Securities’ call to ‘fade’ US dollar rallies is a significant piece of Forex Analysis suggesting that the path of least resistance for the dollar might be downwards from current levels, or that upward moves are temporary. This perspective is based on evolving monetary policy expectations, global economic conditions, and other macro factors influencing Currency Market Trends . For those in the crypto space, understanding this US Dollar Outlook is crucial because of the historical inverse relationship between the USD and Crypto . A potential weakening or lack of sustained strength in the dollar could be interpreted as a positive signal for risk assets like Bitcoin. However, markets are complex, and numerous factors can influence outcomes. Investors should use this forecast as one data point among many, combining it with their own research and risk management strategies to navigate the volatile intersection of traditional finance and digital assets.

The FTX lawsuit claims both firms breached their investment agreements by allegedly failing to deliver the agreed-upon digital assets. FTX’s estate has also warned it may take similar legal steps against other issuers who refuse to cooperate. When Digital Promises Become Legal Liabilities According to a press release published on April 28, FTX advisors reportedly made multiple attempts to resolve the issue without litigation. NFT Stars was contacted 15 times and Kurosemi 13 times between June 2023 and September 2024. Neither company responded meaningfully, forcing FTX to pursue legal remedies. In the case against NFT Stars, FTX claims it paid $325,000 in November 2021 for rights to 1.35 million SENATE tokens and 135 million SIDUS tokens. While some tokens were delivered initially, NFT Stars allegedly stopped transfers after FTX filed for bankruptcy. For Kurosemi, Alameda Ventures (now Maclaurin Investments) paid $1 million in January 2022 for the right to receive 75 million AGI tokens. These tokens launched in April 2023 with a vesting schedule, but Kurosemi allegedly extended the schedule unilaterally and refused to transfer any tokens. At press time, SENATE, SIDUS, and AGI tokens do not have major exchange listings. Their value depends on issuer solvency and market adoption, both of which are uncertain due to ongoing litigation. The latest FTX lawsuit represents an escalation in the bankrupt exchange’s efforts to recover assets for creditor repayments following its collapse in November 2022. The collapse came after revelations that founder Sam Bankman-Fried misused $8 billion in customer funds. Bankman-Fried was convicted of fraud and conspiracy charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison . He has been transferred to the low-security Federal Correctional Institution Terminal Island in Los Angeles. The Importance of Time in Crypto Recovery Efforts Under CEO John Ray III, FTX has recovered between $14.5 billion and $16.3 billion. The first round of repayments, targeting smaller claims under $50,000, began in February 2025. This explicitly includes those in FTX’s Convenience Class, which provides for claims under $50,000. The next phase, starting May 30, will cover large claims. FTX start repaying today, If you have 1 BTC you ll get 18K, price in 2022, If you have 1 SOL, you get $15. Me with Ethereum in FTX and still get full $2500, same price in 2022 : pic.twitter.com/HgPw6WJLCA — naiive (@naiivememe) February 18, 2025 FTX is now preparing for the second phase of repayments, which is based on a reorganization plan approved in late 2024. This phase will kick off on May 30 and will cover larger claims , including customer and general unsecured claims. FTX’s $11.4 billion cash reserve is expected to fund the upcoming creditors’ payouts. The estate plans to ensure that 98% of creditors receive up to 119% of their original claim value. However, some critics believe this figure doesn’t consider the huge rise in cryptocurrency prices since FTX’s collapse. For instance, Bitcoin was trading around $17,000 at the end of November 2022. By January 20, 2025, it surged to an all-time high of over $109,000 before stabilizing at $95,000 as of April 29, 2025. Given the massive price increases in the crypto market, creditors believe they should be compensated more fairly. Can a U.S. Bill End Crypto Fund Mismanagement? FTX’s litigation against NFT Stars and Kurosemi is part of its wide recovery efforts, which have extended to several institutions and prominent figures. A case involves NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal, who reached a class-action settlement over claims he promoted FTX without disclosing key information. The terms of the settlement deal remain private. FTX Class Action has settled with FTX promoter Shaquille O’Neal for an undisclosed sum Shaquille O’Neal heavily promoted FTX alongside other celebrity promoters Gisele, Tom Brady, Kevin O’Leary, Golden State Warriors Shaquille O’Neal was paid $750k to promote FTX pic.twitter.com/bYR7cJIZbN — Sunil (FTX Creditor Champion) (@sunil_trades) April 26, 2025 Other substantial recoveries include a $228 million settlement with crypto exchange Bybit to reclaim FTX-linked assets, and a $700 million lawsuit resolution with investment firm K5 Global . These actions reflect how aggressively the FTX estate is working to recover funds and repay its creditors. Meanwhile, the defunct exchange’s downfall sparked serious concerns about the lack of transparency in the crypto industry. In response, U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill called the PROOF Act (Protecting Retail investors with Oversight of Funds). The PROOF Act is back. It makes Proof of Reserves mandatory to prevent another FTX-style collapse. The infrastructure to verify reserves onchain already exists and it’s being adopted. https://t.co/f5JbLmwCwR — Chris Barrett (@ChrisBarrett) April 11, 2025 This proposed law would require crypto exchanges to keep customer funds separate from their business or investment accounts. Exchanges are also required to undergo monthly third-party audits, known as “Proof of Reserves,” to show they hold the funds they claim. These measures seek to prevent the kind of risky behavior that led to FTX’s failure, especially its practice of mixing customer money with high-risk investments. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How do token lockups and vesting schedules impact liquidity for small investors in projects like SIDUS and AGI? Extended lockups prevent investors from selling during price swings. For instance, if AGI tokens are locked for 48 months, investors can’t exit even if the market crashes, leaving them vulnerable to losses. When tokens finally unlock, low liquidity on exchanges often leads to sharp price drops due to sudden sell-offs. Could AI-driven smart contracts prevent future disputes like FTX’s with NFT Stars and Kurosemi? Yes, AI-driven smart contracts could automate token releases based on predefined milestones, such as game development stages. This would prevent issuers from unilaterally changing terms, ensuring fairness without lawsuits. Are decentralized exchanges (DEXs) a viable alternative for trading illiquid tokens like SENATE and AGI amid FTX-like collapses? DEXs like Uniswap allow trading of illiquid tokens but often suffer from low liquidity, causing high slippage. For example, selling illiquid tokens like SENATE could crash their price. Regulatory risks also loom, as tokens like AGI might face unregistered securities claims if listed. While DEXs offer access, they often fail to provide stable price discovery for stranded assets post-collapse.
