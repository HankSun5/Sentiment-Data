Investors traditionally loyal to Ripple (XRP) are beginning to shift their focus to this rising star, drawn by Ruvi AI‚Äôs groundbreaking technology and explosive growth potential. With its unique combination of blockchain and AI, Ruvi AI presents a fresh alternative for those seeking early-stage opportunities. Ripple‚Äôs Appeal and Challenges Ripple (XRP) has long been a major player in the cryptocurrency space, renowned for its focus on cross-border payments. Designed to facilitate fast, low-cost international transactions, Ripple has formed valuable partnerships with banks and financial institutions worldwide. This utility has given XRP strong appeal among institutional and individual investors alike, making it a staple in many crypto portfolios. However, Ripple isn‚Äôt without its drawbacks. The ongoing regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the United States, has created uncertainty around its future trajectory. While its mature ecosystem ensures steady growth, XRP‚Äôs market position as an established player limits its ability to deliver the explosive returns seen in earlier years. As a result, some investors are exploring options like Ruvi AI, which offers the promise of significant upside. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Industry-Disrupting Potential Ruvi AI (RUVI) combines blockchain technology with advanced artificial intelligence to create a platform that addresses real-world challenges. Its ecosystem includes tools for generating text, images, videos, and audio, making it a powerful asset for industries ranging from content creation to marketing and automation. This focus on real-world utility gives it an edge over Ripple‚Äôs primarily transactional model. The $RUVI token plays a central role in the ecosystem, offering benefits such as staking rewards, governance participation, and premium feature access. By leveraging the power of AI, Ruvi AI is not only carving out a unique niche but also redefining expectations for what crypto projects can achieve. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Presale Success The excitement around Ruvi AI is reflected in its highly successful presale. Phase 1, priced at just $0.010 per token, sold out in two weeks, allowing early investors to realize a 50% return when Phase 2 launched at $0.015. The project has already sold over 135 million tokens, with more than 1,400 holders joining its growing community. One of Ruvi AI‚Äôs standout achievements is securing its first exchange listing before the presale has concluded. This is a rare accomplishment in the cryptocurrency industry and underscores the project‚Äôs credibility and preparation. With more announcements expected soon, Ruvi AI is showing no signs of slowing down. Ripple vs. Ruvi AI Ripple and Ruvi AI represent two exciting yet fundamentally different investment opportunities. Ripple‚Äôs established ecosystem provides stability and gradual growth, appealing to investors seeking a degree of security. However, its mature status means the likelihood of dramatic price increases is diminishing. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is an early-stage project with unparalleled potential for exponential growth. It combines innovation and practical applications to solve real-world problems, making it a standout option for investors willing to take risks for higher rewards. With Ruvi AI still in its early phases, the opportunity for significant gains is much more pronounced. Investment Scenarios for Ruvi AI Ruvi AI‚Äôs tiered presale structure offers attractive incentives for investors. Below are examples of potential returns based on a listing price of $0.07 and a projected $1 token price post-listing: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 $RUVI ($750 investment) Bonus : 40% (+20,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 70,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $4,900 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $70,000 VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 $RUVI ($1,500 investment) Bonus : 60% (+60,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 160,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $11,200 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $160,000 VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 $RUVI ($7,500 investment) Bonus : 100% (+500,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 1,000,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $70,000 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $1,000,000 These clear, tiered opportunities highlight the upside potential for those entering early. Why Investors Are Switching to Ruvi AI The cryptocurrency market rewards innovation and adaptability, and Ruvi AI embodies both. Unlike Ripple, which has reached a stage of steady, predictable growth, Ruvi AI is at the beginning of a remarkable trajectory fueled by technology and utility. Investors looking to capitalize on fresh opportunities with exponential potential are increasingly turning their attention to this fast-growing project. With Phase 2 of the presale ongoing at $0.015 per token, the window to secure an early stake is limited. Ruvi AI is shaping up to be one of the most compelling investment opportunities of 2025. Investors ready to diversify their positions and tap into the power of AI-driven blockchain are following the momentum and making the switch.

Prices slid sharply, and red numbers dominated the market. Traders who had been riding the hype found themselves on the losing end. It was a week many will remember for how politics and memes intersected in unexpected ways. Related Reading: $500M Bet On Solana: Education Platform Aims To Supercharge Its Treasury Musk And Trump Clash According to public posts, Elon Musk officially left the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) on Thursday. That move came after he criticized Trump‚Äôs spending bill. He had been co-leading that department since late 2024. Their back-and-forth heated up after Trump said he was ‚Äúvery disappointed‚Äù in Musk. üö®TRUMP: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very disappointed with Elon. I‚Äôve helped him a lot. He knew the inner workings of the bill better than anybody sitting here. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem & he only developed the problem when he found out we‚Äôre going to cut EV mandate‚Äù pic.twitter.com/aeCcmCAODQ ‚Äî DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) June 5, 2025 In response, Musk claimed Trump would not have won the election without his support. Then Trump called Musk ‚ÄúCRAZY‚Äù and threatened to cancel Tesla and SpaceX contracts. Musk fired back on X with, ‚ÄúGo ahead, make my day.‚Äù He even warned he might decommission SpaceX‚Äôs Dragon spacecraft. Musk Mentions Epstein Documents Based on posts on X, Musk also said that files about Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs case have stayed secret because Trump‚Äôs name appears in them. That claim added another layer to the feud. It wasn‚Äôt just about spending anymore. Now there was an allegation tying the US President to sealed Epstein investigations. Trump replied that he would pull any contracts with Musk‚Äôs companies. Time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT! ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 Dogecoin Price Plunge Based on reports, Dogecoin fell about 11% on Thursday alone. Over the past week, it was down 16% from its recent highs. Traders pointed to Musk‚Äôs political exit as a key factor. Many still see Dogecoin as ‚Äúthe people‚Äôs crypto‚Äù because of Musk‚Äôs early support. But without his backing in that government role, sentiment soured quickly. It‚Äôs a coin that has no real asset behind it, so any shift in hype can send prices tumbling. A drop of this size is rare, yet it felt inevitable once the Musk-Trump feud spilled into public view. Tesla Shares Slide Elon Musk‚Äôs companies did not escape the fallout. Tesla stock closed down 13% on Thursday. That tumble came after Trump signaled he would pull federal contracts from any company owned by Musk. Investors feared lost revenue and stiffer regulatory oversight. Tesla shares had been riding high this year, but angry tweets from Trump were enough to shake confidence. Even a short phrase on X can move markets‚Äîespecially when it involves a figure as polarizing as Trump or Musk.

According to Coinglass data, total liquidations reached $982 million in a single day. Of that, long liquidations‚Äîbets on rising prices‚Äîtotaled $881 million. Short positions, or bets expecting prices to fall, saw losses of $100 million. That level of liquidation is striking, and it showed how quickly nerves can fray when big personalities clash. Bitcoin and many altcoins slid alongside Dogecoin, creating a chain reaction of forced sell-offs.

According to a New York Times report , the Missouri Republican Senator is saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to the upcoming GENIUS Act. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge giveaway to Big Tech. It allows these tech companies to issue stablecoins without any kind of controls. I don‚Äôt see why we would do that.‚Äù According to the Times report, the GENIUS Act could potentially upend the credit card industry and benefit both Trump and Musk, who are currently publicly feuding . Hawley is pushing for amendments to the bill that would curtail Big Tech‚Äôs involvement. GENIUS is an acronym meaning ‚ÄúGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins‚Äù. The bill purports to seek to improve consumer protection, transparency, marketing restrictions and regulatory oversight for the burgeoning stablecoin market, estimated to be worth $250 billion.

According to two sources close to the matter, the platform aims to raise funds through a $1 billion initial coin offering (ICO). It is not yet clear how much of Pump.fun‚Äôs revenues will be channeled into the PUMP token through its ‚Äúbuyback-supported benefit structure.‚Äù It is also unclear whether this model will include revenues from the decentralized exchange PumpSwap, which launched earlier this year. The platform did not respond to requests for comment on the matter. Pump.fun‚Äôs daily revenue peaked at over $7 million on Jan. 23. However, that figure has gradually declined to around $1 million per day. The platform has generated a total revenue of around $677 million since its launch in early 2024, making it one of the most profitable startups in the crypto space. ‚ÄúSome details are still subject to change, but the idea is to tie a portion of the platform‚Äôs revenues to a buyback mechanism,‚Äù a source close to the founding team said in a statement.

The ACH could reach a maximum of $0.0965 and an average of $0.0836 by the end of 2028. Alchemy Pay price prediction for 2031 projects a maximum price of $0.2860. Alchemy Pay (ACH) is a cross-functional payment solution making significant strides in bridging the gap between fiat and cryptocurrency payment ecosystems. The platform‚Äôs robust framework enables global consumers to connect with merchants, developers, and institutions worldwide, facilitating transactions across multiple fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. This functionality enhances Alchemy Pay‚Äôs adaptability and positions it as a pivotal player in the financial technology sector. Alchemy Pay‚Äôs inclusion in the decentralized platforms of popular projects like Augur, Cryptokitties, and OpenSea, along with its support for the infrastructure of Kyber and Radar Relay, adds layers of credibility and utility, enhancing its investment appeal. Can Alchemy Pay (ACH) get to $0.1? Will Alchemy Pay hit $1? Let‚Äôs find out in this ACH price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Alchemy Pay Token ACH Price $0.01976 Market Cap $180.05 Million Trading Volume (24-hour) $28.07M Circulating Supply 10 Billion ACH All-time High $0.1975 Aug 06, 2021 All-time Low $0.001338 Jul 20, 2021 24-h High $0.02128 24-h Low $0.01951 Alchemy Pay price prediction: Technical analysis Price Prediction $‚ÄØ0.147431 (612.46%) Price Volatility 9.59% 50-Day SMA $0.026115 14-Day RSI 36.23 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.024616 Alchemy Pay price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: ACH/USD shows a bearish trend after dropping from $0.0850 Short-term recovery possible to $0.02286-$0.0300 if resistance breaks Sustained uptrend needs momentum indicators and volume improvement ACH/USD 1-day chart ACH/USD 1-day chart The ACH/USD 1-day chart on June 6 shows a volatile pattern with a recent sharp spike around early 2025, peaking near $0.0850, followed by a steep decline to around $0.0200. The price is currently consolidating between $0.0200 and $0.0243, with Bollinger Bands tightening, suggesting reduced volatility and a potential breakout. The RSI at 31.54 indicates oversold conditions, hinting at a possible short-term rebound. However, the overall trend remains bearish unless the price breaks above the 20-day SMA ($0.02686). I expect a cautious recovery towards $0.0300 in the near term, but a sustained uptrend requires breaking key resistance levels around $0.0350. Watch for increased volume and RSI improvement. Alchemy Pay 4-hour price chart ACH/USD 4-hour chart The ACH/USD 4-hour chart shows a sharp decline from a peak near $0.0850 in early 2025, now trading at $0.01976, down 2.18%. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, indicating low volatility and a potential breakout. The MACD is bearish (-0.00045), but the histogram shows slight convergence, hinting at weakening downward momentum. The Balance of Power at -0.58 suggests sellers still dominate, but the price is near a support level around $0.01949. I expect a short-term consolidation between $0.01949 and $0.02153, with a possible bounce to $0.02286 if buying pressure increases. A break below $0.01949 could push it towards $0.01500. Watch MACD for trend shifts.

The 1-day chart shows oversold conditions (RSI 31.54) and consolidation between $0.0200-$0.0243, suggesting a potential rebound to $0.0300 if resistance at $0.02686 breaks. The 4-hour chart confirms low volatility (narrow Bollinger Bands) and a possible bounce to 0.02286, but a bearish MACD (-0.00045) and Balance of Power (-0.58) indicate seller dominance. Overall, ACH may see short-term recovery to $0.02286-$0.0300, but a sustained uptrend requires breaking key resistances and improved momentum indicators. Monitor volume and MACD. Is Alchemy Pay a good investment? Alchemy Pay (ACH) shows mixed signals as an investment. While the current bearish trend and volatility indicate short-term challenges, the solid market capitalization and consistent support levels suggest long-term potential. However, risk-averse investors may prefer to wait for clearer bullish signs or reduced volatility before considering investing in ACH. Will ACH recover? ACH may recover if bulls regain control and maintain support above critical levels. While the current outlook remains bearish, a breakout above short-term resistance levels and consistent buying activity could reverse the negative momentum and lead to a potential recovery in the market. Will ACH reach $0.05? ACH is expected to trade above the $0.05 range throughout 2027, suggesting potential for significant price appreciation compared to earlier years. Will ACH reach $0.1? The price forecasts indicate that ACH could reach a maximum of $0.1404 by 2029. Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend. Will ACH reach $1? The predictions for 2034 show an ACH maximum price of $1. While this indicates significant growth potential, ACH is likely to reach $1 soon. Does ACH have a good long-term future? Alchemy Pay (ACH) shows a generally positive long-term outlook, with projected steady price growth over the years. By 2030, ACH‚Äôs market cap is expected to increase substantially, indicating a good long-term future with moderate to strong growth potential.

45616455,https://cryptonews.com/?p=368974,1749249378,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/45616455.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 6 June ‚Äì Bitcoin, Solana, XRP",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-bitcoin-solana-xrp-6-june/,"Crypto price optimism is hitting record highs following Bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally, which saw it hit a new all-time high (ATH) just two weeks prior. At the same time, several top meme coins ‚ÄîPepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin among them‚Äîhave each reached record highs within the last six months. Investor optimism is clearly on the rise, propelling digital asset values higher. Historically, cryptocurrencies backed by robust fundamentals tend to ignite broad market upswings, supported by dedicated communities, institutional interest, and active development teams. In this context, let‚Äôs explore several prominent cryptos that analysts believe could set new all-time highs (ATHs) during the current bullish trend. Bitcoin ($BTC): The World‚Äôs Biggest Crypto Is Likely to Set Many Price ATHs Before New Year Bitcoin ($BTC) needs no introduction. The world‚Äôs biggest crypto recently hit a new price high at $111,814 on May 2 and many believe it could set several new all-time highs on its way to $150K by the end of the year, but these will be contingent on a favourable political climate. See, Bitcoin is crypto‚Äôs flagship coin. This means that anyone who believes in crypto‚Äôs future is likely to want to add some Bitcoin to their portfolio. The $2 trillion market cap digital gold is virtually single handedly holding up crypto‚Äôs $3.38 trillion market. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin is up 0.3% to trade at $104,292 as it reverses course from a pullback down 6.9% from its ATH. This puts it in spitting distance of setting a new high watermark and even hitting $150,000, but this will need to be helped along by positive macro developments. Recent falling US inflation rates bode well for crypto on the whole, and the possibility of the pro-crypto Trump administration delivering on a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and comprehensive legislation before the year is out could drive Bitcoin to its next big milestone, while simultaneously pulling up the wider industry too. Solana ($SOL): DeFi Titan Riding Institutional Tailwinds Solana ($SOL) continues to distinguish itself within the DeFi ecosystem, lauded for its sophisticated smart contracts, rapid transaction speeds and ultra-low fees. With a current valuation of $81.35 billion, it has cemented itself as a formidable challenger to Ethereum in the DeFi sector. There is mounting chatter that U.S. regulatory authorities may soon approve spot ETFs tied to Solana, following in the footsteps of similar approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Such a development could bolster SOL‚Äôs appeal to institutional investors. President Donald Trump has also floated the idea of including Solana in a proposed U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, although acquisition would be through asset seizures rather than direct purchase. Solana recently rebounded after sliding from highs above $250 in January to just over $100 in February. It has since broken above a descending trend channel and now trades at $152.76‚Äîup 1% in the last 24 hours‚Äîmirroring Bitcoin‚Äôs brief correction and rebound. Analysts now anticipate that if SOL breaches resistance at $200 and $250, it could push toward the $300 mark before the summer concludes. Ripple (XRP): Could Ripple‚Äôs Cross-Border Payment Token Reach New Heights? Ripple‚Äôs XRP token remains a key player in bridging blockchain and traditional finance, particularly for international money transfers. Renowned for facilitating fast and affordable cross-border transactions, XRP has gained attention from major global entities like the United Nations, which sees it as a useful tool for compliant and efficient financial systems. A longstanding legal standoff between Ripple and the SEC reached a key moment in 2023, when a court determined that XRP‚Äôs retail transactions do not constitute securities. This verdict brought much-needed clarity and sparked renewed investor interest. Over the past year, XRP has outpaced Bitcoin in growth, posting a 314% gain compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 46.5% increase. Technical indicators suggest XRP may be approaching a breakout from a bullish flag pattern that has been forming between November and April, a pattern typically indicating upward momentum. If the breakout occurs, XRP could challenge the $3.50 level this summer, potentially surpassing its previous all-time high of $3.40 set on January 7, 2018. SUBBD ($SUBBD): Innovative AI-Creator Crypto in Fixed Price Early-Stage Presale Beyond blue-chip assets, savvy investors are eyeing early-stage projects with high growth potential. Token presales offer a prime opportunity to get in before mainstream adoption. One such promising initiative is SUBBD ($SUBBD) , which seeks to revolutionize the $85 billion creator economy by fusing artificial intelligence with decentralized blockchain infrastructure. The project‚Äôs primary goal is to empower content creators with greater earnings potential, increased control over their work, and reduced reliance on tech giants that typically claim large commission cuts. By facilitating direct interaction between creators and their audiences, SUBBD introduces a more equitable and transparent monetization framework. So far, the project has raised over $615,000 in early funding. The tokens are available in presale at $0.05575 each. Investors gain access to a members-only ecosystem that includes exclusive content, early access features, and various perks. Staking options are also available through the SUBBD platform, offering a fixed annual return of 20%‚Äîa compelling incentive for early backers.

The meme coin is struggling to hold support, with trading volume offering little sign of recovery. Tron (TRX), by contrast, is holding its ground with a strong chart and steady user adoption through dApps. While traders debate technicals and sentiment, Web3 ai is moving forward. It has already raised more than $7.1 million and developed a full suite of AI tools built for crypto users. Each of these tools is powered by $WAI, now priced at just $0.000422 in stage 8, with a confirmed listing price of $0.005242. For investors looking at real returns and working products, $WAI is gathering momentum. DOGE Faces Critical Support as Price Dips Dogecoin (DOGE) is now sitting near a key support area after sliding for 14 straight days. The token is trading close to 0.147, a level it has bounced from several times this year. If DOGE fails to hold this line, analysts say it could quickly fall toward 0.125. There is still a chance for a short-term rebound if the token catches buying interest. The Relative Strength Index is edging toward oversold territory, and a modest uptick in volume suggests some cautious buyers may be stepping in. Dogecoin remains a favorite for traders who enjoy volatility. Its massive online following and regular mention in social media conversations keep it in focus. For those watching closely, this dip could present a speculative entry point. Tron‚Äôs Stability Makes It a Low-Drama Crypto Option TRON (TRX) is getting noticed for being one of the more stable coins during a period of wider market swings. It is trading near the 0.12 level and has shown consistent behavior with relatively minor fluctuations. Analysts point to its high transaction volume and low fees as reasons for continued growth in usage. What sets TRX apart is its actual utility. Unlike projects driven by hype, TRON supports decentralized applications and payment systems that process millions of daily transactions. That gives it a foundation for lasting relevance. Technically, TRX is showing neutral momentum. Still, its steady behavior could attract investors looking for safer positions. If TRX holds its support level and keeps gaining traction, it could challenge resistance around 0.14 in the near future. Web3 ai‚Äôs $WAI May Be the Best Early Entry for Utility-Driven AI Crypto Web3 ai is quietly building one of the most practical AI platforms in crypto. It is not about buzzwords or promises. It is about delivering tools that help crypto traders make faster and better choices. These include real-time portfolio monitoring, predictive tools, scam detection, and arbitrage bots. Every feature in this system depends on one token, $WAI. As more users join the platform, demand for $WAI increases. Currently priced at $0.000422 in stage 8 of its presale, with a listing target of $0.005242, the projected ROI stands at 1303.95 percent. With over $7.1 million already raised, the momentum is clearly there. Web3 ai is building its toolkit to integrate with Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and BNB Chain. It aims to unify scattered data into one platform that delivers clear insights. As crypto matures from hype cycles to real use cases, Web3 ai is positioning itself as a tool for serious users. With pro-level features accessible to regular traders, $WAI may be the token that defines AI utility in 2025. Key Insights Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to show weakness, making short-term traders cautious. Tron (TRX), on the other hand, offers a more stable outlook. But both rely heavily on community sentiment and gradual momentum. Web3 ai is taking a different path. It delivers infrastructure with clear value: tools that help users avoid scams, find trading opportunities, and manage portfolios. Every time someone uses the platform, it drives real demand for $WAI. At a presale price of $0.000422 and a forecast ROI of 1303.95 percent, this is more than just another AI idea. Web3 ai has already built the engine. Now it is just a matter of scale. For investors looking beyond the noise, $WAI might be the most functional AI crypto of the coming year.

However, recent political drama has injected new volatility into the crypto space. The world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency experienced a sharp 5% pullback after a highly publicized clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump unfolded on the social platform X. The dispute, centered around the ‚ÄúBig Beautiful Bill‚Äù criticized by Musk, quickly triggered reactions across financial markets. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure ‚Äì Bearish Target At $142 According to top analyst Darkfost, last night marked the most significant shift in trader behavior on Binance so far in 2025. As the political spat gained attention, traders responded rapidly, viewing the event as a risk-off signal. The fallout was immediate in the derivatives market, where Binance‚Äôs net taker volume plunged from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This dramatic shift marks the largest net taker volume decline of the year, highlighting just how sensitive crypto traders remain to political developments. While Bitcoin holds key levels for now, market participants are watching closely to see if this pullback will deepen or become a launchpad for the next move higher. Bitcoin Rebounds From $100K Support But Faces Resistance Ahead Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal point after rebounding from the $100,000 support level and climbing to the $103,000 range, showing resilience despite recent volatility. The move signals strength among bulls, but the broader market remains cautious as all eyes turn to the $112,000 all-time high. A breakout above that level could ignite a new leg up, but failure to maintain momentum may lead to a deeper correction below current demand levels. Macroeconomic conditions continue to weigh on market sentiment, with rising US bond yields and escalating geopolitical tensions‚Äîparticularly the public clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump‚Äîinjecting uncertainty into global risk assets. The reaction was clearly visible in the crypto derivatives market. Top analyst Darkfost reported that the net taker volume on Binance experienced a record shift, plunging from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This marks the largest decline in directional sentiment seen in 2025. The net taker volume reflects the imbalance between aggressive longs and shorts, and such a steep drop points to traders rapidly flipping bearish. This sharp reversal indicates fear-driven positioning. However, should Bitcoin rebound convincingly, it could trigger a cascade of short liquidations, potentially fueling a strong rally toward new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2020 Breakout Setup ‚Äì Historic Run Incoming? Price Action Details: Testing Key Level The 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows a strong rebound after briefly breaking below the $103,600 support level. BTC dipped as low as $101,159 before buyers stepped in aggressively, driving the price back to $103,826 at the time of writing. This bounce came precisely at the 200-period moving average (red line), signaling that bulls are still defending key demand zones despite recent volatility. The recovery candle printed with rising volume, suggesting renewed interest and a potential short-term trend reversal. However, Bitcoin still faces critical resistance ahead, with the 50, 100, and 200 EMAs (green, blue, purple lines) now acting as dynamic resistance between $104,600 and $107,000. A close above these levels would confirm strength and could open the door for a retest of the $109,300 resistance. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target ‚Äì Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? For now, the price action indicates a high-stakes battle between bulls and bears. If BTC holds above $103,600 and builds momentum, the market could regain confidence and push higher. However, failure to reclaim the moving averages may signal exhaustion and expose the price to another retest of the $100K psychological level.

Qubetics isn‚Äôt just another blockchain project‚Äîit‚Äôs a community-first ecosystem designed for long-term sustainability, offering both governance and rewards to its holders. This strong fundamentals-driven approach is generating buzz among seasoned investors.

The flagship coin teased below $101k in the past 24 hours before rebounding from the support level above $101,500 to trade about $104,543 on Friday, June 7, 2025, during the late North American trading session. Amid the heightened crypto volatility, which caused a significant spike in forced crypto liquidations, the fear of further short-term selloffs remains palpable. Moreover, Bitcoin‚Äôs fear and greed index dropped from over 62 percent, suggesting market greed, to about 45 percent at the time of this writing. What Next for Bitcoin Price? Since recently hitting a new all-time high of around $111,690, BTC price has been trapped in a short term falling trend. The recent rebound in the past 24 hours confirmed that BTC price continues to move in a symmetrical falling channel. From a technical analysis standpoint, the BTC price is at a crucial crossroads, which could either mean further correction or a fresh rally toward a new ATH. From the bullish point of view, BTC price has recorded a golden cross in the daily timeframe between the 50 and 200 Moving Average Simple (SMA). In the four-hour timeframe, the BTC price has been retesting the upper border of the falling channel. With the 4-hour MACD line having crossed the signal line, BTC price may continue with bullish sentiment beyond $106k. From the bearish perspective, the BTC price has not yet formed any solid reversal pattern after being trapped in a falling channel in the past few weeks. As a result, a potential close below the support level around $103,329 will trigger a correction towards the support level around $101,570.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-06 23:28:52

Donald Trump is cashing in on crypto. Over the last nine months, beginning slightly before the election, he has stirred up new ventures, new coins, new noise.

(Photo: Jamel Toppin for Forbes) https://t.co/eJWOWiwM8M pic.twitter.com/XsBFINCpa0 ‚Äî Forbes (@Forbes) June 6, 2025 The media outlet alleges Trump holds $900 million worth of liquid assets, with nearly half of that amount stemming from his crypto pursuits. The article claims Trump profited over $390 million pre-tax from the sale of his affiliated crypto platform World Liberty Financial‚Äôs native tokens. The current sitting president is also reported to have brought in $315 million from his $TRUMP memecoin and $427 million from his memecoin stash. Lastly, Trump is estimated to have up to $60 million worth of World Liberty Financial‚Äôs new stablecoin, USD1. In total, Forbes alleges that Trump has brought in $1.2 billion from his foray into the world of digital assets, with a post-tax estimate of $935 million.

Tron founder Justin Sun was also in attendance as the top holder of $TRUMP, with a wallet listed as Sun having held $18 million worth of $TRUMP coins ahead of the dinner. Sun, who previously invested $75 million in the Trump-affiliated crypto platform World Liberty Financial, has now given $93 million to Trump-oriented crypto ventures. Critics argue that the gala dinner and Trump‚Äôs crypto ventures at large may prove unethical due to foreign influence and bribery concerns. Ethical or not, one thing remains clear: Trump‚Äôs ties to the blockchain sector are extremely profitable.

The deal arrives after Polymarket processed more than US$8 billion in wagers last year, even while blocking U.S. users, and aligns with Elon Musk‚Äôs long-stated belief that crowd forecasts often outshine traditional polls. X-Polymarket alliance brings prediction markets into social media The leading prediction market platform Polymarket has announced a partnership ( https://t.co/JUzBaMx9tL ) with Elon Musk‚Äôs company xAI, which, in addition to AI development, is also behind the social network X.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/DkE09LB388 ‚Äî Traders Union (@TradersUnion_TU) June 6, 2025 Kalshi Misfire Leaves X Searching for a Prediction-Market Partner X‚Äôs first foray into event-wagering data began‚Äîand ended‚Äîwith Kalshi. Late in May, the regulated U.S. exchange issued a press release trumpeting an alliance with Musk‚Äôs platform. Bloomberg reported that within hours, the notice vanished, and Kalshi confirmed the deal had been ‚Äúrolled back.‚Äù The reversal also hinted at friction between Kalshi‚Äôs strictly regulated model and X‚Äôs global ambitions. Key moments that derailed the initial plan: Kalshi‚Äôs announcement caught industry observers off-guard, coming without the usual social-media fanfare from Musk or X‚Äôs corporate accounts. Compliance hurdles loomed large: Kalshi‚Äôs contracts require Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight, a framework that would have limited the breadth of markets visible on X. By day‚Äôs end, both companies had scrubbed references to the arrangement, indicating a clean break rather than a delay. Polymarket Steps In: A Better Fit for Elon Musk‚Äôs X Vision Just weeks later, X shifted toward the crypto sphere, naming Polymarket its official prediction-market partner. The shift aligned with Musk‚Äôs preference for decentralized solutions that can scale internationally without traditional brokerage constraints. Unlike Kalshi, Polymarket already runs on blockchain rails and caters largely to non-U.S. bettors, easing many of the jurisdictional headaches that torpedoed the previous attempt. Shayne Coplan, Polymarket‚Äôs chief executive, marked the announcement with an energetic post. Proud to announce @Polymarket ‚Äôs partnership with @X and @xai as their Official Prediction Market Partner. The two top truth seeking apps on the internet are stronger together. Welcome to News 2.0. Stay tuned https://t.co/P6Xd7yKlmt ‚Äî Shayne Coplan (@shayne_coplan) June 6, 2025 The official X account echoed the sentiment hours later. Curiously, Musk himself stayed silent, letting the companies‚Äô statements speak for him, a contrast to his usual hands-on approach but one that showed confidence in the market-driven product. Polymarket Odds, Front-and-Center on X X plans to weave Polymarket probabilities directly into the social feed, turning fast-moving conversations into a live dashboard of crowd sentiment. Instead of leaving for a separate site, users will see a small odds widget pinned beneath trending posts, updating in real time. When a hot topic (e.g. an election, a sports final, or a Federal Reserve rate decision) surges on the timeline, the overlay will surface the latest numbers from the crypto prediction market and link to the full contract on Polymarket for those outside restricted jurisdictions. What users can expect at launch: Compact probability bar appearing under tweets that match an active Polymarket contract. Hover or tap to reveal a short description, current implied odds, and 24-hour movement. One-click handoff to the Polymarket interface for deeper charts (geofenced for U.S. users). Ability to follow a contract, adding real-time alerts to the X notification pane. Grok Turns Raw Numbers Into Readable Insights X will also lean on X‚Äôs AI Grok to decode swings in the market. Grok will scan fresh posts, on-chain trade flows, and historical data to draft one-line summaries to help readers understand why a contract moved without sifting through thousands of comments: ‚ÄúOdds for a June rate hike slipped three points after Powell‚Äôs press conference,‚Äù for instance. Key layers in the explanatory stack: Context ranking: Grok shows the top three driver tweets influencing a contract‚Äôs change. Sentiment link-out: A quick tap opens an AI-generated timeline of relevant discussions and charts. Market health check: Color-coded indicators warn of thin liquidity or whale-sized trades that might skew probabilities. Future expansion: X engineers hint at letting verified experts pin rebuttals or alternative interpretations, adding editorial balance without dulling the data-first approach. X and Polymarket: Rethinking How to Gauge the Market By threading Polymarket‚Äôs live probabilities into every corner of the timeline, X is betting that data-driven foresight will become as habitual as scrolling a feed. If the experiment succeeds, users may soon weigh a politician‚Äôs promise or a company‚Äôs earnings hint against an instantly updated crowd forecast. Yet the stakes run deeper than a slick new widget. X must manage hard regulatory lines and ethical gray zones, proving it can spotlight prediction data without morphing into an unlicensed betting house or amplifying manipulative whale trades. Whether the platform threads that needle will determine if this partnership becomes a fixture of daily discourse or a cautionary tale.

Such an obvious lie. So sad. https://t.co/sOu9vqMVfX ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 As their barbs ricocheted across X and Truth Social in recent days, fresh regulatory and political worries surfaced, draining risk appetite and pushing the DOGE price more than 10% lower to an intraday trough near $0.17. With a jump in 24-hour turnover to about $1.63 billion, that slide has cut Dogecoin‚Äôs market share to 0.83% of total crypto value, its weakest dominance reading in two months. Musk-Trump Feud Saps Meme-Coin Morale The feud mushroomed over just three days. Tensions flared Tuesday when Musk publicly branded Trump‚Äôs signature ‚Äúbig, beautiful‚Äù tax-and-spending package a ‚Äúdisgusting abomination,‚Äù stunning Republican allies. I‚Äôm sorry, but I just can‚Äôt stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it. ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 3, 2025 By Thursday, the billionaire had dredged up years-old GOP warnings from Trump about ballooning deficits, prompting Trump to threaten Musk with losing his lucrative federal contracts for SpaceX and Tesla. Allies on both sides piled in through Friday, amplifying the spat and highlighting how quickly a long-standing alliance (Musk was an Oval Office regular only weeks ago) can curdle when big-ticket legislation is at stake. DOGE Price On-Chain and Market Data Point to Waning Confidence Blockchain analytics show a sharp uptick in coins moving from long-term wallets to exchanges, echoing the bearish narrative in derivatives desks where funding rates have drifted negative. Four-hour Bollinger Bands confirm heightened volatility: the DOGE price kissed the lower band at $0.17 on heavy volume before clawing back toward the midline. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index sank into oversold territory last week and now hovers at 39.7‚Äîa tentative uptick that hints at bargain hunting but falls short of signaling a decisive reversal. Technical Picture: DOGE Price Support Holds but Resistance Looms Technically, Dogecoin continues to build a fragile base on the $0.1670 to $0.1700 horizontal support level after retracing roughly 35 % from its early-May peak. Today‚Äôs rebound left spot at $0.179, yet the token still trades beneath a formidable confluence zone at $0.1797 to $0.1850, which aligns with the Fib 0.618 retracement and a stack of bearish moving averages: a 20-day EMA at $0.2016, 50-day at $0.2069, and 100-day at $0.2011. Unless the DOGE price can close a daily candle above the 20-day EMA, rallies will likely be dismissed as dead-cat bounces rather than a bona fide trend change. Failure to conquer that ceiling would refocus attention on the springboard support. A sustained break below $0.1670 would expose the Fib 0.786 level at $0.1576, with little chart structure until the early-April swing low around $0.13, an air pocket that could see another 30% shaved off the DOGE price if bearish momentum accelerates. What Could Drive Dogecoin‚Äôs Next Move In the immediate term, sentiment headlines may matter as much as candlesticks. A public reconciliation between Musk and Trump, or even a fresh meme-worthy endorsement tweet, could reignite retail appetite and push the DOGE price through $0.1850, opening the way toward $0.20 and the clustered 20 to 100-day EMAs. Conversely, any escalation in the feud, fresh regulatory chatter, or broader risk-off moves in crypto could see sellers test dip-buyers‚Äô patience yet again. For now, Dogecoin sits on a knife-edge: fundamentals lean bearish while momentum oscillators hint at recovery potential. Traders with a short time frame may scalp long positions toward $0.1850, but given the precarious backdrop, tight stops below $0.1700 are essential. Swing traders might instead await a daily close above $0.20 to confirm trend reversal, or look to accumulate only if the DOGE price washes out toward $0.1576, where risk-reward improves dramatically.

Coinbase‚Äôs customers may soon be able to trade PancakeSwap ( CAKE ), the native asset of PancakeSwap, a DEX originally built on the BNB Chain. PancakeSwap has expanded to multiple blockchains and now leads all decentralized exchanges in trading volume, recording $228.03 billion in the past 30 days compared to Uniswap‚Äôs ( UNI ) $95.706 billion, according to DeFi Llama . PancakeSwap also recently set its monthly record with $173 billion in trading volume in May. The roadmap addition, announced on Wednesday, has not boosted CAKE‚Äôs price: The 116th-ranked crypto asset is trading at $2.25 at time of writing and is down more than 7% in the past 24 hours and nearly 11% in the past seven days. Being added to Coinbase‚Äôs listing roadmap means that the top US crypto exchange is considering rolling trading support for the asset in the near future. The roadmap was established in 2022 to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of investors frontrunning new trading support announcements. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has previously said the exchange aims to list as many crypto assets as possible, as long as they meet the company‚Äôs standards.

The most recent 24 hours were marked by Bitcoin losing its hold on the $105,000 price level, crashing until it rebounded at a lower support range around $101,000. However, technical analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs daily candlestick timeframe chart shows that this price level is increasingly under threat, and a formation is currently in place that could lead to a price crash towards $96,000. Bitcoin Head And Shoulders Pattern Forming Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has highlighted what is a textbook head and shoulders formation on the daily chart. This bearish pattern, if completed, would imply a breakdown toward the $96,000 price zone, according to the analyst. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin Price Drop Alert: Crash To $98,000 To Fuel Altcoin Buying Opportunity The setup is clearly defined by a peak (head) around mid-May that is flanked by two lower highs (shoulders) on either side, all sitting atop a slanted neckline that now acts as the last line of support. As of now, Bitcoin is trading just above this neckline, testing its structural integrity. In technical analysis, a clean break below the neckline accompanied by strong volume often activates the measured move from the head‚Äôs peak to the neckline, projected downward. Based on the chart, that drop points directly to $96,054. This puts Bitcoin at risk of a near 8% drawdown from current levels, with little support in between. Aside from this formation, Bitcoin‚Äôs daily RSI is currently around the 50 reading, which is a zone that often triggers reactions. As such, a drop below this midline will confirm a bearish shift in momentum. Bitcoin Price Action Closing On Bearish Mode If Bitcoin does collapse toward the $96,000 level, it would mark a departure from the bullish strength that dominated its price just two weeks ago when it registered a new all-time high at $111,814. Since then, however, Bitcoin has lost subsequent support levels at $110,000, $107,000, and $105,000, which now places the next zone of importance at $103,000. Should Bitcoin fail to hold above that threshold, the pressure would likely shift toward the $101,000 level, which could act as the final buffer before steeper declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings Interestingly, the neckline level of the inverse head and shoulders pattern highlighted by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto is around the $103,500 price level. Bitcoin broke below this price level in the past 24 hours, but the bulls managed to prevent further losses below $101,700. This has led to the creation of lower lows on the daily timeframe. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,250, which means it is back to testing the neckline resistance from below. Its reaction here would determine if it eventually crashes toward $96,000. If sellers take control at this level, it would not only confirm the head and shoulders breakdown but could also lead to a short-term capitulation across other cryptocurrencies.

The New York Federal Reserve Bank, which handles the Fed‚Äôs bond transactions, just disclosed the losses, linking them to the central bank‚Äôs tight monetary stance.

Sabih Behzad, Deutsche Bank‚Äôs head of digital assets and currencies transformation, explained in an interview that the bank is considering different strategies , including issuing its own token or collaborating on an industry-wide initiative. He added that the bank is also assessing whether to develop its own tokenized deposit solution for payment use. EU-wide standards already exist, US Congress is passing stablecoin legislation, and global banks are examining how these tokens and blockchain technology can improve productivity. Even though some of these projects have had years to gain traction, not many have quite broken through to real-world, mainstream scale. Behzad said they can certainly see the momentum of stablecoins along with a regulatory supportive environment, especially in the US. He noted that banks have a wide variety of options available to engage in the stablecoin industry ‚Äî everything from acting as a reserve manager to issuing their own stablecoin, either alone or in a consortium. Stablecoins‚Äîdigital tokens pegged to currencies like the dollar or euro‚Äîand tokenized deposits both represent money on a blockchain, designed to make payments faster and more cost-effective. Tokenized deposits are usually digital tokens issued by regulated banks, representing claims on bank deposits, essentially reflecting bank account balances on a blockchain. European banks and major players drive stablecoin innovation and adoption According to Bloomberg News, Banco Santander SA is reportedly in the early stages of its plans to launch a stablecoin and offer cryptocurrency access to retail clients via its digital bank. Deutsche Bank‚Äôs asset management arm, DWS Group, has teamed up with Dutch market maker Flow Traders Ltd. and crypto fund manager Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. to create a euro-denominated token. ‚ÄúI see a role for a European stablecoin or collaboration among European banks to develop one, particularly for settlement in a digital economy,‚Äù said ING Groep NV CEO Steven van Rijswijk in a recent interview. However, he noted that the Amsterdam-based lender currently has no public plans to announce. Early client adoption is emerging in payments. JPMorgan Chase & Co. reports that its Kinexys network processes over $2 billion in daily transactions on average, following a tenfold increase in volumes last year. However, this still represents a small fraction of JPMorgan‚Äôs overall daily payment processing of roughly $10 trillion. Last year, Deutsche Bank invested strategically in Partior, a blockchain-based cross-border payments and settlement company. The Frankfurt-based bank is also involved in Project Agor√° , an initiative led by the Bank of International Settlements and various central banks to explore how tokenization can improve wholesale cross-border payments. In 2023, Deutsche Bank partnered with Swiss blockchain firm Taurus to develop digital-asset custody services for institutional clients. Big tech accelerates digital token adoption Growing momentum for United States stablecoin regulation is reportedly pushing major tech firms to explore digital token integration. The ‚ÄúGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act,‚Äù or the GENIUS Act, is a key development encouraging companies to dive deeper into digital assets. The bill seeks to provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins and their issuers in the country but has been met with debate about Big Tech‚Äôs potential participation in the crypto industry. According to The New York Times, Republican Senator Josh Hawley recently said he would vote against the bill in its current form as it would allow tech companies to issue digital currencies that would compete with the dollar. In response, Democrats are reportedly planning to introduce an amendment that would prohibit Big Tech companies from creating their own stablecoins, according to an informed source cited by the NYT. This change would require tech firms operating in the US to rely on existing stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $300 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $18.5 billion, rebounded from a crucial support level of around $2,407 in the past 24 hours to trade about $2,478 on Friday, during the late North American trading session. However, the recent crypto rebound has triggered fears of a potential dead cat bounce. Moreover, the feud between Trump and Musk may continue to divide the crypto market. BlackRock Leads in Ethereum Accumulation According to on-chain data analysis, BlackRock has gradually shifted its focus from Bitcoin to Ether in the past few days. In the past week, BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA recorded a net cash inflow of over $492 million to currently hold about $4.84 billion in cumulative net cash inflow at the time of this writing. The gradual crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum has fueled the narrative of the much-anticipated altseason 2025. Moreover, the ETH/BTC pair has been dropping for the past few years until recently, signaling a major shift by institutional investors to the altcoin market. What Next for ETH Price? Since breaking out of an established falling trendline in the first quarter, the ETh price has been forming a rising trend characterized by higher highs and higher lows in the lower timeframes. The altcoin has, however, been consolidating in a tight range between $2,400 and $2,679 in the past few weeks. From a technical analysis perspective, Ether‚Äôs price is well positioned to rally above $3k if the buyers manage to push the altcoin above $2,679 in the coming weeks. However, a consistent close below $2.4k will signal further short-term bearish sentiment towards $2.2k.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-07 00:20:38

The president‚Äôs son said in a post on X on Friday that the company responsible for the Trump meme coin isn‚Äôt moving forward with a digital wallet offering that has caused a fissure with World Liberty Financial, the crypto company owned in part by the Trump family. The dispute‚Äôs heart was a proposed digital wallet called $TRUMP Wallet. It was being produced by a company called Fight Fight Fight LLC, which Bill Zanker, a longtime Trump friend, owns. This wallet was advertised as the home of the widely popular $TRUMP meme coin launched earlier in the year. However, another Trump-affiliated company, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), opposed the development. WLFI, which members of the Trump family partially own, said the wallet had used Trump‚Äôs name without permission. WLFI sent Fight Fight Fight and its tech partner, Magic Eden, a cease-and-desist letter to prevent the wallet from launching, Bloomberg News reported. The issue was revealed in an X post by Eric Trump. He said the wallet is not being pursued, and his family didn‚Äôt sign off on its development. ‚ÄúI run @Trump, and I know nothing about this project! He posted. This public statement went a long way toward putting such rumors to rest that a division had formed within the Trump crypto business network. World Liberty Financial boosts holdings with $TRUMP meme coin With the wallet flap now behind it, World Liberty Financial is pursuing a serious investment in the $TRUMP meme coin, Eric Trump says. He said on X that WLFI intends to purchase a ‚Äúgood amount‚Äù of the token. That‚Äôs changed from competition to partnership, indicating a closer relationship between WLFI and the token‚Äôs creators. Most of the $TRUMP supply, about 80%, is owned by Fight Fight Fight and another Trump-related entity, CIC Digital LLC . Their holdings are worth around $2 billion as of early June, according to CoinMarketCap, the tracking site. Its supporters say the meme coin provides fans with a means to express support for the president and to play a role in the digital economy. Critics say it is a cash cow for Trump insiders. And the demand for the meme coin, although much debated, has been so high that you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find someone close to the Trump orbit who, like the president or not, might be open to a little high-proof sycophancy, who doesn‚Äôt want one. Trump crypto ventures spark political backlash The Trump family‚Äôs increasing stake in crypto has prompted fresh political concerns. Some Democratic lawmakers have alleged that Donald Trump, who calls the shots for the Republicans in the Senate, is employing the crypto vehicle to peddle influence and line his pockets and those of his cronies. They note the family‚Äôs hefty holdings in $TRUMP and their ties to numerous crypto firms. These worries intensified when Trump held a private dinner in April for prominent $TRUMP stockholders at Mar-a-Lago. Critics say this may have crossed the ethical boundary, particularly since Trump is the president. The Trump family disputes all allegations of wrongdoing. Eric and Donald Trump Jr. have insisted that they are simply backing projects that excite their base and represent genuine value in the world of cryptos. The family is, meanwhile, expanding its digital finance footprint. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $12.59. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $34.29 and $39.7, with an average value of $35.49. Optimism‚Äôs (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform‚Äôs initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let‚Äôs get into the OP price prediction for 2025 ‚Äì 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.595 Market Cap $1.02B Trading Volume $164.14M Circulating Supply 1.71B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.6141 24-hour Low $0.5872 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 9.88% 50-Day SMA $0.7486 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 45 (Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $1.1629 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP/USDT sees small gains but remains bearish. Support at $0.562 is critical. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP remains bearish despite a slight uptick The OP/USDT price analysis for June 7 shows a minimal uptick on the day, although the coin is hovering just above the lower Bollinger Band at $0.562. The MACD remains deeply bearish, with no crossover in sight, reflecting sustained downward momentum and the possibility of a break below the next support. OP remains bearish despite a slight uptick Likewise, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) is flat. If support at $0.562 breaks, further downside is likely. A recovery above the middle Bollinger Band ($0.695) would be needed to suggest a bullish shift. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP is trading in a tight sideways range The 4-hour chart shows the price trading in a tight sideways range between support at $0.585 and resistance near $0.608. The price remains below the Alligator lines, signaling a persistent bearish trend with no breakout yet. OP is trading in a tight sideways range The Balance of Power, however, reflects a modest shift in control toward buyers, but not aggressively. A breakout above $0.608 could open short-term upside potential, while a breakdown below $0.585 may trigger fresh lows. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6390 SELL SMA 5 $0.6765 SELL SMA 10 $0.6979 SELL SMA 21 $0.7346 SELL SMA 50 $0.7486 SELL SMA 100 $0.8025 SELL SMA 200 $1.1629 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7100 SELL EMA 5 $0.7113 SELL EMA 10 $0.7122 SELL EMA 21 $0.7461 SELL EMA 50 $0.8797 SELL EMA 100 $1.1091 SELL EMA 200 $1.3934 SELL What to expect from Optimism? Optimism is in consolidation. If it breaks above $0.608, a short-term move toward $0.626‚Äì0.64 is possible. But if it loses $0.585, the next key support lies around $0.562. For now, a breakout confirmation is needed. Momentum remains weak but slightly improving. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it‚Äôs risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you‚Äôre willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

The crypto market has been further muddled by the entry of meme coins, which sucked in many investors on the promise of growth driven by vibes. However, many investors are realizing that meme coins are simply not a sustainable way to grow wealth in the crypto space. Investors are now focused on projects that offer real prospects for long-term returns. As with any investment, stability has become an important consideration. One project that has caught the attention of investors with this mindset is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . So far, its presale has been a massive success as investors shift their capital into the project based on its focus on long-term utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ‚Äì A True Giant Of Utility Away from the noise and buzz surrounding meme coin, Mutuum Finance has been quietly building a protocol dedicated to maximizing the benefits of DeFi technology. The Mutuum Finance protocol is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol designed to allow lenders to deposit their assets and earn interest. The interest rate for these assets is determined by a pool‚Äôs utilization rate. For instance, when more borrowers take over-collateralized loans from a liquidity pool, the rate of the pool rises. That triggers a wave of new lenders to deposit assets to benefit from the high interest rates. It also causes fewer borrowers to want to join the pool. As a result, the system finds a balance on its own, driven by market forces. The depositors in a pool also receive instant liquidity in the form of mtTokens. These tokens represent the value of the initial deposit in a pool, plus any interest it accrues. For instance, when you deposit DAI in a pool, you receive mtDAI tokens on a 1:1 ratio. Holders of mtTokens are free to sell them on secondary exchanges or use them as collateral on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to benefit from new market opportunities as they arise. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Tokens Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the native token of the protocol. Its success is closely tied to the success of the protocol in the long term. It will also serve as an important gauge of how well the protocol is doing for new entrants. The total supply of MUTM tokens is 4,000,000,000 tokens. The planned listing price for the token is $0.06. However, many analysts expect the price to shoot up massively due to the extensive utility offered on its native protocol. To support the long-term value of MUTM, the team will use part of the protocol profits to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market and redistribute them to stakers in the safety module. This action will prompt more stakers to join the protocol, deepening its liquidity. Additionally, it will apply upward price pressure on the tokens, giving confidence to more users to join the protocol. Besides buying back tokens on the open market, the team plans to use part of the profits to grow the pools and for marketing purposes. With a Certik audit in hand, the team can confidently apply for an exchange listing on top-tier exchanges, which is expected on the same day as the launch. To test the waters, the team applied for a listing on CoinMarketCap. The CoinMarketCap platform is known to have strict standards for listing new tokens, and the MUTM listing is another signal that this project is more than just hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM Presale Shatters Its Own Record The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale recently beat its own record. In the current phase 5 of the presale, over 25% of the tokens have already been sold, which represents a new record for the presale. It is much faster than when the price was $0.01 in phase. The tokens are currently selling for $0.03 in phase 5, a 200% increase. A major reason for these has been recent advancements in the roadmap, such as the listing on CoinMarketCap and the Certik audit report. As it achieves more milestones in its roadmap, the presale pace is expected to be even faster. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035, which makes phase 5 the last opportunity for a 100% Roi based on the $0.06 listing price. By focusing on the fundamentals, such as utility, adopting strategies, and long-term growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has identified an often overlooked niche in the crypto market. Its unique approach to the crypto sector has earned it a massive following of over 20k across its social media channels. With such a massive support base, coupled with the utility it offers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could experience explosive growth like never before in the crypto world. For the lucky ones to come across it in the current presale, they have an opportunity to ride this growth to the top at the low entry point of $0.03.

As of June 6, the company holds 8,888 BTC. Now, it wants to hold 100,000 BTC by the end of 2026. That‚Äôs a big leap from its old aim of 21,000 BTC for that same date. According to the CEO, Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet will issue up to 555 million new shares to back this drive. The plan covers about 18 months and will require buying roughly 91,112 more BTC. Based on reports, Metaplanet‚Äôs earlier target was to own 21,000 BTC by late 2026. Now, Gerovich says they will aim for 100,000 BTC instead. The company already announced buying 1,088 BTC on June 2, bringing holdings to 8,888 BTC. *Metaplanet Issues 555 Million Shares of Moving-Strike Warrants, Expected Proceeds: ~$5.4b to Buy Additional $BTC ; Largest Stock Acquisition Rights Issuance in Japan Capital Markets History & 1st Moving Strike Warrant Ever Issued Above Market* pic.twitter.com/ZgwiRE3GmU ‚Äî Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 6, 2025 Reasons Behind The Aggressive Move Gerovich has pointed to shifts in the global economy. He says capital is leaving assets once called ‚Äúsafe,‚Äù like long-term government bonds. Gold, he notes, has hit record highs against major currencies. *Metaplanet Announces Accelerated 2025-2027 Bitcoin Plan* *Targeting 210,000 $BTC by 2027* pic.twitter.com/xJKu3J8Apb ‚Äî Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 6, 2025 In an environment where sovereign debt is climbing and trade policies are in flux, Bitcoin‚Äôs scarcity and easy transfer are drawing interest. According to him, these factors make Bitcoin a likely place for money to flow when other assets feel shaky. Whether that‚Äôs right or not, Metaplanet is betting hard on Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal. Issuing Shares To Fund Bitcoin Buys To gather cash for these purchases, Metaplanet will push 555 million more shares onto the market. Under the earlier ‚Äú21 million plan,‚Äù the company already had 210 million shares lined up for Bitcoin buys. Adding 555 million more shares represents a massive dilution of stock. Shareholders who backed the initial plan might waver if Bitcoin stumbles. But if Bitcoin‚Äôs value climbs, those new shares could also rise in worth. It‚Äôs a big gamble with risks on both sides‚Äîmarket moves and shareholder sentiment. Aiming For The 1% Club Gerovich also laid out a plan through 2027. By December 31, 2027, Metaplanet hopes to hold over 210,000 BTC. That would place them in the so-called ‚Äú1% Club,‚Äù meaning they‚Äôd hold at least 1% of Bitcoin‚Äôs 21 million supply cap. Based on reports from Standard Chartered Bank, only 61 of 124 public companies that hold Bitcoin own a combined 3.2% of its total supply. Metaplanet‚Äôs bid to grab 1% on its own would stand out among public firms. But collecting that many coins will require careful timing, especially as large purchases can push prices higher.
