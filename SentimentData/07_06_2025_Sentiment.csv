Investors traditionally loyal to Ripple (XRP) are beginning to shift their focus to this rising star, drawn by Ruvi AI‚Äôs groundbreaking technology and explosive growth potential. With its unique combination of blockchain and AI, Ruvi AI presents a fresh alternative for those seeking early-stage opportunities. Ripple‚Äôs Appeal and Challenges Ripple (XRP) has long been a major player in the cryptocurrency space, renowned for its focus on cross-border payments. Designed to facilitate fast, low-cost international transactions, Ripple has formed valuable partnerships with banks and financial institutions worldwide. This utility has given XRP strong appeal among institutional and individual investors alike, making it a staple in many crypto portfolios. However, Ripple isn‚Äôt without its drawbacks. The ongoing regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the United States, has created uncertainty around its future trajectory. While its mature ecosystem ensures steady growth, XRP‚Äôs market position as an established player limits its ability to deliver the explosive returns seen in earlier years. As a result, some investors are exploring options like Ruvi AI, which offers the promise of significant upside. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Industry-Disrupting Potential Ruvi AI (RUVI) combines blockchain technology with advanced artificial intelligence to create a platform that addresses real-world challenges. Its ecosystem includes tools for generating text, images, videos, and audio, making it a powerful asset for industries ranging from content creation to marketing and automation. This focus on real-world utility gives it an edge over Ripple‚Äôs primarily transactional model. The $RUVI token plays a central role in the ecosystem, offering benefits such as staking rewards, governance participation, and premium feature access. By leveraging the power of AI, Ruvi AI is not only carving out a unique niche but also redefining expectations for what crypto projects can achieve. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Presale Success The excitement around Ruvi AI is reflected in its highly successful presale. Phase 1, priced at just $0.010 per token, sold out in two weeks, allowing early investors to realize a 50% return when Phase 2 launched at $0.015. The project has already sold over 135 million tokens, with more than 1,400 holders joining its growing community. One of Ruvi AI‚Äôs standout achievements is securing its first exchange listing before the presale has concluded. This is a rare accomplishment in the cryptocurrency industry and underscores the project‚Äôs credibility and preparation. With more announcements expected soon, Ruvi AI is showing no signs of slowing down. Ripple vs. Ruvi AI Ripple and Ruvi AI represent two exciting yet fundamentally different investment opportunities. Ripple‚Äôs established ecosystem provides stability and gradual growth, appealing to investors seeking a degree of security. However, its mature status means the likelihood of dramatic price increases is diminishing. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is an early-stage project with unparalleled potential for exponential growth. It combines innovation and practical applications to solve real-world problems, making it a standout option for investors willing to take risks for higher rewards. With Ruvi AI still in its early phases, the opportunity for significant gains is much more pronounced. Investment Scenarios for Ruvi AI Ruvi AI‚Äôs tiered presale structure offers attractive incentives for investors. Below are examples of potential returns based on a listing price of $0.07 and a projected $1 token price post-listing: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 $RUVI ($750 investment) Bonus : 40% (+20,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 70,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $4,900 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $70,000 VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 $RUVI ($1,500 investment) Bonus : 60% (+60,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 160,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $11,200 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $160,000 VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 $RUVI ($7,500 investment) Bonus : 100% (+500,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 1,000,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $70,000 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $1,000,000 These clear, tiered opportunities highlight the upside potential for those entering early. Why Investors Are Switching to Ruvi AI The cryptocurrency market rewards innovation and adaptability, and Ruvi AI embodies both. Unlike Ripple, which has reached a stage of steady, predictable growth, Ruvi AI is at the beginning of a remarkable trajectory fueled by technology and utility. Investors looking to capitalize on fresh opportunities with exponential potential are increasingly turning their attention to this fast-growing project. With Phase 2 of the presale ongoing at $0.015 per token, the window to secure an early stake is limited. Ruvi AI is shaping up to be one of the most compelling investment opportunities of 2025. Investors ready to diversify their positions and tap into the power of AI-driven blockchain are following the momentum and making the switch.

Prices slid sharply, and red numbers dominated the market. Traders who had been riding the hype found themselves on the losing end. It was a week many will remember for how politics and memes intersected in unexpected ways. Related Reading: $500M Bet On Solana: Education Platform Aims To Supercharge Its Treasury Musk And Trump Clash According to public posts, Elon Musk officially left the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) on Thursday. That move came after he criticized Trump‚Äôs spending bill. He had been co-leading that department since late 2024. Their back-and-forth heated up after Trump said he was ‚Äúvery disappointed‚Äù in Musk. üö®TRUMP: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very disappointed with Elon. I‚Äôve helped him a lot. He knew the inner workings of the bill better than anybody sitting here. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem & he only developed the problem when he found out we‚Äôre going to cut EV mandate‚Äù pic.twitter.com/aeCcmCAODQ ‚Äî DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) June 5, 2025 In response, Musk claimed Trump would not have won the election without his support. Then Trump called Musk ‚ÄúCRAZY‚Äù and threatened to cancel Tesla and SpaceX contracts. Musk fired back on X with, ‚ÄúGo ahead, make my day.‚Äù He even warned he might decommission SpaceX‚Äôs Dragon spacecraft. Musk Mentions Epstein Documents Based on posts on X, Musk also said that files about Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs case have stayed secret because Trump‚Äôs name appears in them. That claim added another layer to the feud. It wasn‚Äôt just about spending anymore. Now there was an allegation tying the US President to sealed Epstein investigations. Trump replied that he would pull any contracts with Musk‚Äôs companies. Time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT! ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 Dogecoin Price Plunge Based on reports, Dogecoin fell about 11% on Thursday alone. Over the past week, it was down 16% from its recent highs. Traders pointed to Musk‚Äôs political exit as a key factor. Many still see Dogecoin as ‚Äúthe people‚Äôs crypto‚Äù because of Musk‚Äôs early support. But without his backing in that government role, sentiment soured quickly. It‚Äôs a coin that has no real asset behind it, so any shift in hype can send prices tumbling. A drop of this size is rare, yet it felt inevitable once the Musk-Trump feud spilled into public view. Tesla Shares Slide Elon Musk‚Äôs companies did not escape the fallout. Tesla stock closed down 13% on Thursday. That tumble came after Trump signaled he would pull federal contracts from any company owned by Musk. Investors feared lost revenue and stiffer regulatory oversight. Tesla shares had been riding high this year, but angry tweets from Trump were enough to shake confidence. Even a short phrase on X can move markets‚Äîespecially when it involves a figure as polarizing as Trump or Musk.

According to Coinglass data, total liquidations reached $982 million in a single day. Of that, long liquidations‚Äîbets on rising prices‚Äîtotaled $881 million. Short positions, or bets expecting prices to fall, saw losses of $100 million. That level of liquidation is striking, and it showed how quickly nerves can fray when big personalities clash. Bitcoin and many altcoins slid alongside Dogecoin, creating a chain reaction of forced sell-offs.

According to a New York Times report , the Missouri Republican Senator is saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to the upcoming GENIUS Act. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge giveaway to Big Tech. It allows these tech companies to issue stablecoins without any kind of controls. I don‚Äôt see why we would do that.‚Äù According to the Times report, the GENIUS Act could potentially upend the credit card industry and benefit both Trump and Musk, who are currently publicly feuding . Hawley is pushing for amendments to the bill that would curtail Big Tech‚Äôs involvement. GENIUS is an acronym meaning ‚ÄúGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins‚Äù. The bill purports to seek to improve consumer protection, transparency, marketing restrictions and regulatory oversight for the burgeoning stablecoin market, estimated to be worth $250 billion.

According to two sources close to the matter, the platform aims to raise funds through a $1 billion initial coin offering (ICO). It is not yet clear how much of Pump.fun‚Äôs revenues will be channeled into the PUMP token through its ‚Äúbuyback-supported benefit structure.‚Äù It is also unclear whether this model will include revenues from the decentralized exchange PumpSwap, which launched earlier this year. The platform did not respond to requests for comment on the matter. Pump.fun‚Äôs daily revenue peaked at over $7 million on Jan. 23. However, that figure has gradually declined to around $1 million per day. The platform has generated a total revenue of around $677 million since its launch in early 2024, making it one of the most profitable startups in the crypto space. ‚ÄúSome details are still subject to change, but the idea is to tie a portion of the platform‚Äôs revenues to a buyback mechanism,‚Äù a source close to the founding team said in a statement.

The ACH could reach a maximum of $0.0965 and an average of $0.0836 by the end of 2028. Alchemy Pay price prediction for 2031 projects a maximum price of $0.2860. Alchemy Pay (ACH) is a cross-functional payment solution making significant strides in bridging the gap between fiat and cryptocurrency payment ecosystems. The platform‚Äôs robust framework enables global consumers to connect with merchants, developers, and institutions worldwide, facilitating transactions across multiple fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. This functionality enhances Alchemy Pay‚Äôs adaptability and positions it as a pivotal player in the financial technology sector. Alchemy Pay‚Äôs inclusion in the decentralized platforms of popular projects like Augur, Cryptokitties, and OpenSea, along with its support for the infrastructure of Kyber and Radar Relay, adds layers of credibility and utility, enhancing its investment appeal. Can Alchemy Pay (ACH) get to $0.1? Will Alchemy Pay hit $1? Let‚Äôs find out in this ACH price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Alchemy Pay Token ACH Price $0.01976 Market Cap $180.05 Million Trading Volume (24-hour) $28.07M Circulating Supply 10 Billion ACH All-time High $0.1975 Aug 06, 2021 All-time Low $0.001338 Jul 20, 2021 24-h High $0.02128 24-h Low $0.01951 Alchemy Pay price prediction: Technical analysis Price Prediction $‚ÄØ0.147431 (612.46%) Price Volatility 9.59% 50-Day SMA $0.026115 14-Day RSI 36.23 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.024616 Alchemy Pay price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: ACH/USD shows a bearish trend after dropping from $0.0850 Short-term recovery possible to $0.02286-$0.0300 if resistance breaks Sustained uptrend needs momentum indicators and volume improvement ACH/USD 1-day chart ACH/USD 1-day chart The ACH/USD 1-day chart on June 6 shows a volatile pattern with a recent sharp spike around early 2025, peaking near $0.0850, followed by a steep decline to around $0.0200. The price is currently consolidating between $0.0200 and $0.0243, with Bollinger Bands tightening, suggesting reduced volatility and a potential breakout. The RSI at 31.54 indicates oversold conditions, hinting at a possible short-term rebound. However, the overall trend remains bearish unless the price breaks above the 20-day SMA ($0.02686). I expect a cautious recovery towards $0.0300 in the near term, but a sustained uptrend requires breaking key resistance levels around $0.0350. Watch for increased volume and RSI improvement. Alchemy Pay 4-hour price chart ACH/USD 4-hour chart The ACH/USD 4-hour chart shows a sharp decline from a peak near $0.0850 in early 2025, now trading at $0.01976, down 2.18%. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, indicating low volatility and a potential breakout. The MACD is bearish (-0.00045), but the histogram shows slight convergence, hinting at weakening downward momentum. The Balance of Power at -0.58 suggests sellers still dominate, but the price is near a support level around $0.01949. I expect a short-term consolidation between $0.01949 and $0.02153, with a possible bounce to $0.02286 if buying pressure increases. A break below $0.01949 could push it towards $0.01500. Watch MACD for trend shifts.

The 1-day chart shows oversold conditions (RSI 31.54) and consolidation between $0.0200-$0.0243, suggesting a potential rebound to $0.0300 if resistance at $0.02686 breaks. The 4-hour chart confirms low volatility (narrow Bollinger Bands) and a possible bounce to 0.02286, but a bearish MACD (-0.00045) and Balance of Power (-0.58) indicate seller dominance. Overall, ACH may see short-term recovery to $0.02286-$0.0300, but a sustained uptrend requires breaking key resistances and improved momentum indicators. Monitor volume and MACD. Is Alchemy Pay a good investment? Alchemy Pay (ACH) shows mixed signals as an investment. While the current bearish trend and volatility indicate short-term challenges, the solid market capitalization and consistent support levels suggest long-term potential. However, risk-averse investors may prefer to wait for clearer bullish signs or reduced volatility before considering investing in ACH. Will ACH recover? ACH may recover if bulls regain control and maintain support above critical levels. While the current outlook remains bearish, a breakout above short-term resistance levels and consistent buying activity could reverse the negative momentum and lead to a potential recovery in the market. Will ACH reach $0.05? ACH is expected to trade above the $0.05 range throughout 2027, suggesting potential for significant price appreciation compared to earlier years. Will ACH reach $0.1? The price forecasts indicate that ACH could reach a maximum of $0.1404 by 2029. Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend. Will ACH reach $1? The predictions for 2034 show an ACH maximum price of $1. While this indicates significant growth potential, ACH is likely to reach $1 soon. Does ACH have a good long-term future? Alchemy Pay (ACH) shows a generally positive long-term outlook, with projected steady price growth over the years. By 2030, ACH‚Äôs market cap is expected to increase substantially, indicating a good long-term future with moderate to strong growth potential.

45616455,https://cryptonews.com/?p=368974,1749249378,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/45616455.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 6 June ‚Äì Bitcoin, Solana, XRP",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-bitcoin-solana-xrp-6-june/,"Crypto price optimism is hitting record highs following Bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally, which saw it hit a new all-time high (ATH) just two weeks prior. At the same time, several top meme coins ‚ÄîPepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin among them‚Äîhave each reached record highs within the last six months. Investor optimism is clearly on the rise, propelling digital asset values higher. Historically, cryptocurrencies backed by robust fundamentals tend to ignite broad market upswings, supported by dedicated communities, institutional interest, and active development teams. In this context, let‚Äôs explore several prominent cryptos that analysts believe could set new all-time highs (ATHs) during the current bullish trend. Bitcoin ($BTC): The World‚Äôs Biggest Crypto Is Likely to Set Many Price ATHs Before New Year Bitcoin ($BTC) needs no introduction. The world‚Äôs biggest crypto recently hit a new price high at $111,814 on May 2 and many believe it could set several new all-time highs on its way to $150K by the end of the year, but these will be contingent on a favourable political climate. See, Bitcoin is crypto‚Äôs flagship coin. This means that anyone who believes in crypto‚Äôs future is likely to want to add some Bitcoin to their portfolio. The $2 trillion market cap digital gold is virtually single handedly holding up crypto‚Äôs $3.38 trillion market. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin is up 0.3% to trade at $104,292 as it reverses course from a pullback down 6.9% from its ATH. This puts it in spitting distance of setting a new high watermark and even hitting $150,000, but this will need to be helped along by positive macro developments. Recent falling US inflation rates bode well for crypto on the whole, and the possibility of the pro-crypto Trump administration delivering on a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and comprehensive legislation before the year is out could drive Bitcoin to its next big milestone, while simultaneously pulling up the wider industry too. Solana ($SOL): DeFi Titan Riding Institutional Tailwinds Solana ($SOL) continues to distinguish itself within the DeFi ecosystem, lauded for its sophisticated smart contracts, rapid transaction speeds and ultra-low fees. With a current valuation of $81.35 billion, it has cemented itself as a formidable challenger to Ethereum in the DeFi sector. There is mounting chatter that U.S. regulatory authorities may soon approve spot ETFs tied to Solana, following in the footsteps of similar approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Such a development could bolster SOL‚Äôs appeal to institutional investors. President Donald Trump has also floated the idea of including Solana in a proposed U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, although acquisition would be through asset seizures rather than direct purchase. Solana recently rebounded after sliding from highs above $250 in January to just over $100 in February. It has since broken above a descending trend channel and now trades at $152.76‚Äîup 1% in the last 24 hours‚Äîmirroring Bitcoin‚Äôs brief correction and rebound. Analysts now anticipate that if SOL breaches resistance at $200 and $250, it could push toward the $300 mark before the summer concludes. Ripple (XRP): Could Ripple‚Äôs Cross-Border Payment Token Reach New Heights? Ripple‚Äôs XRP token remains a key player in bridging blockchain and traditional finance, particularly for international money transfers. Renowned for facilitating fast and affordable cross-border transactions, XRP has gained attention from major global entities like the United Nations, which sees it as a useful tool for compliant and efficient financial systems. A longstanding legal standoff between Ripple and the SEC reached a key moment in 2023, when a court determined that XRP‚Äôs retail transactions do not constitute securities. This verdict brought much-needed clarity and sparked renewed investor interest. Over the past year, XRP has outpaced Bitcoin in growth, posting a 314% gain compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 46.5% increase. Technical indicators suggest XRP may be approaching a breakout from a bullish flag pattern that has been forming between November and April, a pattern typically indicating upward momentum. If the breakout occurs, XRP could challenge the $3.50 level this summer, potentially surpassing its previous all-time high of $3.40 set on January 7, 2018. SUBBD ($SUBBD): Innovative AI-Creator Crypto in Fixed Price Early-Stage Presale Beyond blue-chip assets, savvy investors are eyeing early-stage projects with high growth potential. Token presales offer a prime opportunity to get in before mainstream adoption. One such promising initiative is SUBBD ($SUBBD) , which seeks to revolutionize the $85 billion creator economy by fusing artificial intelligence with decentralized blockchain infrastructure. The project‚Äôs primary goal is to empower content creators with greater earnings potential, increased control over their work, and reduced reliance on tech giants that typically claim large commission cuts. By facilitating direct interaction between creators and their audiences, SUBBD introduces a more equitable and transparent monetization framework. So far, the project has raised over $615,000 in early funding. The tokens are available in presale at $0.05575 each. Investors gain access to a members-only ecosystem that includes exclusive content, early access features, and various perks. Staking options are also available through the SUBBD platform, offering a fixed annual return of 20%‚Äîa compelling incentive for early backers.

The meme coin is struggling to hold support, with trading volume offering little sign of recovery. Tron (TRX), by contrast, is holding its ground with a strong chart and steady user adoption through dApps. While traders debate technicals and sentiment, Web3 ai is moving forward. It has already raised more than $7.1 million and developed a full suite of AI tools built for crypto users. Each of these tools is powered by $WAI, now priced at just $0.000422 in stage 8, with a confirmed listing price of $0.005242. For investors looking at real returns and working products, $WAI is gathering momentum. DOGE Faces Critical Support as Price Dips Dogecoin (DOGE) is now sitting near a key support area after sliding for 14 straight days. The token is trading close to 0.147, a level it has bounced from several times this year. If DOGE fails to hold this line, analysts say it could quickly fall toward 0.125. There is still a chance for a short-term rebound if the token catches buying interest. The Relative Strength Index is edging toward oversold territory, and a modest uptick in volume suggests some cautious buyers may be stepping in. Dogecoin remains a favorite for traders who enjoy volatility. Its massive online following and regular mention in social media conversations keep it in focus. For those watching closely, this dip could present a speculative entry point. Tron‚Äôs Stability Makes It a Low-Drama Crypto Option TRON (TRX) is getting noticed for being one of the more stable coins during a period of wider market swings. It is trading near the 0.12 level and has shown consistent behavior with relatively minor fluctuations. Analysts point to its high transaction volume and low fees as reasons for continued growth in usage. What sets TRX apart is its actual utility. Unlike projects driven by hype, TRON supports decentralized applications and payment systems that process millions of daily transactions. That gives it a foundation for lasting relevance. Technically, TRX is showing neutral momentum. Still, its steady behavior could attract investors looking for safer positions. If TRX holds its support level and keeps gaining traction, it could challenge resistance around 0.14 in the near future. Web3 ai‚Äôs $WAI May Be the Best Early Entry for Utility-Driven AI Crypto Web3 ai is quietly building one of the most practical AI platforms in crypto. It is not about buzzwords or promises. It is about delivering tools that help crypto traders make faster and better choices. These include real-time portfolio monitoring, predictive tools, scam detection, and arbitrage bots. Every feature in this system depends on one token, $WAI. As more users join the platform, demand for $WAI increases. Currently priced at $0.000422 in stage 8 of its presale, with a listing target of $0.005242, the projected ROI stands at 1303.95 percent. With over $7.1 million already raised, the momentum is clearly there. Web3 ai is building its toolkit to integrate with Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and BNB Chain. It aims to unify scattered data into one platform that delivers clear insights. As crypto matures from hype cycles to real use cases, Web3 ai is positioning itself as a tool for serious users. With pro-level features accessible to regular traders, $WAI may be the token that defines AI utility in 2025. Key Insights Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to show weakness, making short-term traders cautious. Tron (TRX), on the other hand, offers a more stable outlook. But both rely heavily on community sentiment and gradual momentum. Web3 ai is taking a different path. It delivers infrastructure with clear value: tools that help users avoid scams, find trading opportunities, and manage portfolios. Every time someone uses the platform, it drives real demand for $WAI. At a presale price of $0.000422 and a forecast ROI of 1303.95 percent, this is more than just another AI idea. Web3 ai has already built the engine. Now it is just a matter of scale. For investors looking beyond the noise, $WAI might be the most functional AI crypto of the coming year.

However, recent political drama has injected new volatility into the crypto space. The world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency experienced a sharp 5% pullback after a highly publicized clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump unfolded on the social platform X. The dispute, centered around the ‚ÄúBig Beautiful Bill‚Äù criticized by Musk, quickly triggered reactions across financial markets. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure ‚Äì Bearish Target At $142 According to top analyst Darkfost, last night marked the most significant shift in trader behavior on Binance so far in 2025. As the political spat gained attention, traders responded rapidly, viewing the event as a risk-off signal. The fallout was immediate in the derivatives market, where Binance‚Äôs net taker volume plunged from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This dramatic shift marks the largest net taker volume decline of the year, highlighting just how sensitive crypto traders remain to political developments. While Bitcoin holds key levels for now, market participants are watching closely to see if this pullback will deepen or become a launchpad for the next move higher. Bitcoin Rebounds From $100K Support But Faces Resistance Ahead Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal point after rebounding from the $100,000 support level and climbing to the $103,000 range, showing resilience despite recent volatility. The move signals strength among bulls, but the broader market remains cautious as all eyes turn to the $112,000 all-time high. A breakout above that level could ignite a new leg up, but failure to maintain momentum may lead to a deeper correction below current demand levels. Macroeconomic conditions continue to weigh on market sentiment, with rising US bond yields and escalating geopolitical tensions‚Äîparticularly the public clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump‚Äîinjecting uncertainty into global risk assets. The reaction was clearly visible in the crypto derivatives market. Top analyst Darkfost reported that the net taker volume on Binance experienced a record shift, plunging from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This marks the largest decline in directional sentiment seen in 2025. The net taker volume reflects the imbalance between aggressive longs and shorts, and such a steep drop points to traders rapidly flipping bearish. This sharp reversal indicates fear-driven positioning. However, should Bitcoin rebound convincingly, it could trigger a cascade of short liquidations, potentially fueling a strong rally toward new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2020 Breakout Setup ‚Äì Historic Run Incoming? Price Action Details: Testing Key Level The 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows a strong rebound after briefly breaking below the $103,600 support level. BTC dipped as low as $101,159 before buyers stepped in aggressively, driving the price back to $103,826 at the time of writing. This bounce came precisely at the 200-period moving average (red line), signaling that bulls are still defending key demand zones despite recent volatility. The recovery candle printed with rising volume, suggesting renewed interest and a potential short-term trend reversal. However, Bitcoin still faces critical resistance ahead, with the 50, 100, and 200 EMAs (green, blue, purple lines) now acting as dynamic resistance between $104,600 and $107,000. A close above these levels would confirm strength and could open the door for a retest of the $109,300 resistance. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target ‚Äì Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? For now, the price action indicates a high-stakes battle between bulls and bears. If BTC holds above $103,600 and builds momentum, the market could regain confidence and push higher. However, failure to reclaim the moving averages may signal exhaustion and expose the price to another retest of the $100K psychological level.

Qubetics isn‚Äôt just another blockchain project‚Äîit‚Äôs a community-first ecosystem designed for long-term sustainability, offering both governance and rewards to its holders. This strong fundamentals-driven approach is generating buzz among seasoned investors.

The flagship coin teased below $101k in the past 24 hours before rebounding from the support level above $101,500 to trade about $104,543 on Friday, June 7, 2025, during the late North American trading session. Amid the heightened crypto volatility, which caused a significant spike in forced crypto liquidations, the fear of further short-term selloffs remains palpable. Moreover, Bitcoin‚Äôs fear and greed index dropped from over 62 percent, suggesting market greed, to about 45 percent at the time of this writing. What Next for Bitcoin Price? Since recently hitting a new all-time high of around $111,690, BTC price has been trapped in a short term falling trend. The recent rebound in the past 24 hours confirmed that BTC price continues to move in a symmetrical falling channel. From a technical analysis standpoint, the BTC price is at a crucial crossroads, which could either mean further correction or a fresh rally toward a new ATH. From the bullish point of view, BTC price has recorded a golden cross in the daily timeframe between the 50 and 200 Moving Average Simple (SMA). In the four-hour timeframe, the BTC price has been retesting the upper border of the falling channel. With the 4-hour MACD line having crossed the signal line, BTC price may continue with bullish sentiment beyond $106k. From the bearish perspective, the BTC price has not yet formed any solid reversal pattern after being trapped in a falling channel in the past few weeks. As a result, a potential close below the support level around $103,329 will trigger a correction towards the support level around $101,570.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-06 23:28:52

Donald Trump is cashing in on crypto. Over the last nine months, beginning slightly before the election, he has stirred up new ventures, new coins, new noise.

(Photo: Jamel Toppin for Forbes) https://t.co/eJWOWiwM8M pic.twitter.com/XsBFINCpa0 ‚Äî Forbes (@Forbes) June 6, 2025 The media outlet alleges Trump holds $900 million worth of liquid assets, with nearly half of that amount stemming from his crypto pursuits. The article claims Trump profited over $390 million pre-tax from the sale of his affiliated crypto platform World Liberty Financial‚Äôs native tokens. The current sitting president is also reported to have brought in $315 million from his $TRUMP memecoin and $427 million from his memecoin stash. Lastly, Trump is estimated to have up to $60 million worth of World Liberty Financial‚Äôs new stablecoin, USD1. In total, Forbes alleges that Trump has brought in $1.2 billion from his foray into the world of digital assets, with a post-tax estimate of $935 million.

Tron founder Justin Sun was also in attendance as the top holder of $TRUMP, with a wallet listed as Sun having held $18 million worth of $TRUMP coins ahead of the dinner. Sun, who previously invested $75 million in the Trump-affiliated crypto platform World Liberty Financial, has now given $93 million to Trump-oriented crypto ventures. Critics argue that the gala dinner and Trump‚Äôs crypto ventures at large may prove unethical due to foreign influence and bribery concerns. Ethical or not, one thing remains clear: Trump‚Äôs ties to the blockchain sector are extremely profitable.

The deal arrives after Polymarket processed more than US$8 billion in wagers last year, even while blocking U.S. users, and aligns with Elon Musk‚Äôs long-stated belief that crowd forecasts often outshine traditional polls. X-Polymarket alliance brings prediction markets into social media The leading prediction market platform Polymarket has announced a partnership ( https://t.co/JUzBaMx9tL ) with Elon Musk‚Äôs company xAI, which, in addition to AI development, is also behind the social network X.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/DkE09LB388 ‚Äî Traders Union (@TradersUnion_TU) June 6, 2025 Kalshi Misfire Leaves X Searching for a Prediction-Market Partner X‚Äôs first foray into event-wagering data began‚Äîand ended‚Äîwith Kalshi. Late in May, the regulated U.S. exchange issued a press release trumpeting an alliance with Musk‚Äôs platform. Bloomberg reported that within hours, the notice vanished, and Kalshi confirmed the deal had been ‚Äúrolled back.‚Äù The reversal also hinted at friction between Kalshi‚Äôs strictly regulated model and X‚Äôs global ambitions. Key moments that derailed the initial plan: Kalshi‚Äôs announcement caught industry observers off-guard, coming without the usual social-media fanfare from Musk or X‚Äôs corporate accounts. Compliance hurdles loomed large: Kalshi‚Äôs contracts require Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight, a framework that would have limited the breadth of markets visible on X. By day‚Äôs end, both companies had scrubbed references to the arrangement, indicating a clean break rather than a delay. Polymarket Steps In: A Better Fit for Elon Musk‚Äôs X Vision Just weeks later, X shifted toward the crypto sphere, naming Polymarket its official prediction-market partner. The shift aligned with Musk‚Äôs preference for decentralized solutions that can scale internationally without traditional brokerage constraints. Unlike Kalshi, Polymarket already runs on blockchain rails and caters largely to non-U.S. bettors, easing many of the jurisdictional headaches that torpedoed the previous attempt. Shayne Coplan, Polymarket‚Äôs chief executive, marked the announcement with an energetic post. Proud to announce @Polymarket ‚Äôs partnership with @X and @xai as their Official Prediction Market Partner. The two top truth seeking apps on the internet are stronger together. Welcome to News 2.0. Stay tuned https://t.co/P6Xd7yKlmt ‚Äî Shayne Coplan (@shayne_coplan) June 6, 2025 The official X account echoed the sentiment hours later. Curiously, Musk himself stayed silent, letting the companies‚Äô statements speak for him, a contrast to his usual hands-on approach but one that showed confidence in the market-driven product. Polymarket Odds, Front-and-Center on X X plans to weave Polymarket probabilities directly into the social feed, turning fast-moving conversations into a live dashboard of crowd sentiment. Instead of leaving for a separate site, users will see a small odds widget pinned beneath trending posts, updating in real time. When a hot topic (e.g. an election, a sports final, or a Federal Reserve rate decision) surges on the timeline, the overlay will surface the latest numbers from the crypto prediction market and link to the full contract on Polymarket for those outside restricted jurisdictions. What users can expect at launch: Compact probability bar appearing under tweets that match an active Polymarket contract. Hover or tap to reveal a short description, current implied odds, and 24-hour movement. One-click handoff to the Polymarket interface for deeper charts (geofenced for U.S. users). Ability to follow a contract, adding real-time alerts to the X notification pane. Grok Turns Raw Numbers Into Readable Insights X will also lean on X‚Äôs AI Grok to decode swings in the market. Grok will scan fresh posts, on-chain trade flows, and historical data to draft one-line summaries to help readers understand why a contract moved without sifting through thousands of comments: ‚ÄúOdds for a June rate hike slipped three points after Powell‚Äôs press conference,‚Äù for instance. Key layers in the explanatory stack: Context ranking: Grok shows the top three driver tweets influencing a contract‚Äôs change. Sentiment link-out: A quick tap opens an AI-generated timeline of relevant discussions and charts. Market health check: Color-coded indicators warn of thin liquidity or whale-sized trades that might skew probabilities. Future expansion: X engineers hint at letting verified experts pin rebuttals or alternative interpretations, adding editorial balance without dulling the data-first approach. X and Polymarket: Rethinking How to Gauge the Market By threading Polymarket‚Äôs live probabilities into every corner of the timeline, X is betting that data-driven foresight will become as habitual as scrolling a feed. If the experiment succeeds, users may soon weigh a politician‚Äôs promise or a company‚Äôs earnings hint against an instantly updated crowd forecast. Yet the stakes run deeper than a slick new widget. X must manage hard regulatory lines and ethical gray zones, proving it can spotlight prediction data without morphing into an unlicensed betting house or amplifying manipulative whale trades. Whether the platform threads that needle will determine if this partnership becomes a fixture of daily discourse or a cautionary tale.

Such an obvious lie. So sad. https://t.co/sOu9vqMVfX ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 As their barbs ricocheted across X and Truth Social in recent days, fresh regulatory and political worries surfaced, draining risk appetite and pushing the DOGE price more than 10% lower to an intraday trough near $0.17. With a jump in 24-hour turnover to about $1.63 billion, that slide has cut Dogecoin‚Äôs market share to 0.83% of total crypto value, its weakest dominance reading in two months. Musk-Trump Feud Saps Meme-Coin Morale The feud mushroomed over just three days. Tensions flared Tuesday when Musk publicly branded Trump‚Äôs signature ‚Äúbig, beautiful‚Äù tax-and-spending package a ‚Äúdisgusting abomination,‚Äù stunning Republican allies. I‚Äôm sorry, but I just can‚Äôt stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it. ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 3, 2025 By Thursday, the billionaire had dredged up years-old GOP warnings from Trump about ballooning deficits, prompting Trump to threaten Musk with losing his lucrative federal contracts for SpaceX and Tesla. Allies on both sides piled in through Friday, amplifying the spat and highlighting how quickly a long-standing alliance (Musk was an Oval Office regular only weeks ago) can curdle when big-ticket legislation is at stake. DOGE Price On-Chain and Market Data Point to Waning Confidence Blockchain analytics show a sharp uptick in coins moving from long-term wallets to exchanges, echoing the bearish narrative in derivatives desks where funding rates have drifted negative. Four-hour Bollinger Bands confirm heightened volatility: the DOGE price kissed the lower band at $0.17 on heavy volume before clawing back toward the midline. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index sank into oversold territory last week and now hovers at 39.7‚Äîa tentative uptick that hints at bargain hunting but falls short of signaling a decisive reversal. Technical Picture: DOGE Price Support Holds but Resistance Looms Technically, Dogecoin continues to build a fragile base on the $0.1670 to $0.1700 horizontal support level after retracing roughly 35 % from its early-May peak. Today‚Äôs rebound left spot at $0.179, yet the token still trades beneath a formidable confluence zone at $0.1797 to $0.1850, which aligns with the Fib 0.618 retracement and a stack of bearish moving averages: a 20-day EMA at $0.2016, 50-day at $0.2069, and 100-day at $0.2011. Unless the DOGE price can close a daily candle above the 20-day EMA, rallies will likely be dismissed as dead-cat bounces rather than a bona fide trend change. Failure to conquer that ceiling would refocus attention on the springboard support. A sustained break below $0.1670 would expose the Fib 0.786 level at $0.1576, with little chart structure until the early-April swing low around $0.13, an air pocket that could see another 30% shaved off the DOGE price if bearish momentum accelerates. What Could Drive Dogecoin‚Äôs Next Move In the immediate term, sentiment headlines may matter as much as candlesticks. A public reconciliation between Musk and Trump, or even a fresh meme-worthy endorsement tweet, could reignite retail appetite and push the DOGE price through $0.1850, opening the way toward $0.20 and the clustered 20 to 100-day EMAs. Conversely, any escalation in the feud, fresh regulatory chatter, or broader risk-off moves in crypto could see sellers test dip-buyers‚Äô patience yet again. For now, Dogecoin sits on a knife-edge: fundamentals lean bearish while momentum oscillators hint at recovery potential. Traders with a short time frame may scalp long positions toward $0.1850, but given the precarious backdrop, tight stops below $0.1700 are essential. Swing traders might instead await a daily close above $0.20 to confirm trend reversal, or look to accumulate only if the DOGE price washes out toward $0.1576, where risk-reward improves dramatically.

Coinbase‚Äôs customers may soon be able to trade PancakeSwap ( CAKE ), the native asset of PancakeSwap, a DEX originally built on the BNB Chain. PancakeSwap has expanded to multiple blockchains and now leads all decentralized exchanges in trading volume, recording $228.03 billion in the past 30 days compared to Uniswap‚Äôs ( UNI ) $95.706 billion, according to DeFi Llama . PancakeSwap also recently set its monthly record with $173 billion in trading volume in May. The roadmap addition, announced on Wednesday, has not boosted CAKE‚Äôs price: The 116th-ranked crypto asset is trading at $2.25 at time of writing and is down more than 7% in the past 24 hours and nearly 11% in the past seven days. Being added to Coinbase‚Äôs listing roadmap means that the top US crypto exchange is considering rolling trading support for the asset in the near future. The roadmap was established in 2022 to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of investors frontrunning new trading support announcements. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has previously said the exchange aims to list as many crypto assets as possible, as long as they meet the company‚Äôs standards.

The most recent 24 hours were marked by Bitcoin losing its hold on the $105,000 price level, crashing until it rebounded at a lower support range around $101,000. However, technical analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs daily candlestick timeframe chart shows that this price level is increasingly under threat, and a formation is currently in place that could lead to a price crash towards $96,000. Bitcoin Head And Shoulders Pattern Forming Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has highlighted what is a textbook head and shoulders formation on the daily chart. This bearish pattern, if completed, would imply a breakdown toward the $96,000 price zone, according to the analyst. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin Price Drop Alert: Crash To $98,000 To Fuel Altcoin Buying Opportunity The setup is clearly defined by a peak (head) around mid-May that is flanked by two lower highs (shoulders) on either side, all sitting atop a slanted neckline that now acts as the last line of support. As of now, Bitcoin is trading just above this neckline, testing its structural integrity. In technical analysis, a clean break below the neckline accompanied by strong volume often activates the measured move from the head‚Äôs peak to the neckline, projected downward. Based on the chart, that drop points directly to $96,054. This puts Bitcoin at risk of a near 8% drawdown from current levels, with little support in between. Aside from this formation, Bitcoin‚Äôs daily RSI is currently around the 50 reading, which is a zone that often triggers reactions. As such, a drop below this midline will confirm a bearish shift in momentum. Bitcoin Price Action Closing On Bearish Mode If Bitcoin does collapse toward the $96,000 level, it would mark a departure from the bullish strength that dominated its price just two weeks ago when it registered a new all-time high at $111,814. Since then, however, Bitcoin has lost subsequent support levels at $110,000, $107,000, and $105,000, which now places the next zone of importance at $103,000. Should Bitcoin fail to hold above that threshold, the pressure would likely shift toward the $101,000 level, which could act as the final buffer before steeper declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings Interestingly, the neckline level of the inverse head and shoulders pattern highlighted by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto is around the $103,500 price level. Bitcoin broke below this price level in the past 24 hours, but the bulls managed to prevent further losses below $101,700. This has led to the creation of lower lows on the daily timeframe. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,250, which means it is back to testing the neckline resistance from below. Its reaction here would determine if it eventually crashes toward $96,000. If sellers take control at this level, it would not only confirm the head and shoulders breakdown but could also lead to a short-term capitulation across other cryptocurrencies.

Sabih Behzad, Deutsche Bank‚Äôs head of digital assets and currencies transformation, explained in an interview that the bank is considering different strategies , including issuing its own token or collaborating on an industry-wide initiative. He added that the bank is also assessing whether to develop its own tokenized deposit solution for payment use. EU-wide standards already exist, US Congress is passing stablecoin legislation, and global banks are examining how these tokens and blockchain technology can improve productivity. Even though some of these projects have had years to gain traction, not many have quite broken through to real-world, mainstream scale. Behzad said they can certainly see the momentum of stablecoins along with a regulatory supportive environment, especially in the US. He noted that banks have a wide variety of options available to engage in the stablecoin industry ‚Äî everything from acting as a reserve manager to issuing their own stablecoin, either alone or in a consortium. Stablecoins‚Äîdigital tokens pegged to currencies like the dollar or euro‚Äîand tokenized deposits both represent money on a blockchain, designed to make payments faster and more cost-effective. Tokenized deposits are usually digital tokens issued by regulated banks, representing claims on bank deposits, essentially reflecting bank account balances on a blockchain. European banks and major players drive stablecoin innovation and adoption According to Bloomberg News, Banco Santander SA is reportedly in the early stages of its plans to launch a stablecoin and offer cryptocurrency access to retail clients via its digital bank. Deutsche Bank‚Äôs asset management arm, DWS Group, has teamed up with Dutch market maker Flow Traders Ltd. and crypto fund manager Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. to create a euro-denominated token. ‚ÄúI see a role for a European stablecoin or collaboration among European banks to develop one, particularly for settlement in a digital economy,‚Äù said ING Groep NV CEO Steven van Rijswijk in a recent interview. However, he noted that the Amsterdam-based lender currently has no public plans to announce. Early client adoption is emerging in payments. JPMorgan Chase & Co. reports that its Kinexys network processes over $2 billion in daily transactions on average, following a tenfold increase in volumes last year. However, this still represents a small fraction of JPMorgan‚Äôs overall daily payment processing of roughly $10 trillion. Last year, Deutsche Bank invested strategically in Partior, a blockchain-based cross-border payments and settlement company. The Frankfurt-based bank is also involved in Project Agor√° , an initiative led by the Bank of International Settlements and various central banks to explore how tokenization can improve wholesale cross-border payments. In 2023, Deutsche Bank partnered with Swiss blockchain firm Taurus to develop digital-asset custody services for institutional clients. Big tech accelerates digital token adoption Growing momentum for United States stablecoin regulation is reportedly pushing major tech firms to explore digital token integration. The ‚ÄúGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act,‚Äù or the GENIUS Act, is a key development encouraging companies to dive deeper into digital assets. The bill seeks to provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins and their issuers in the country but has been met with debate about Big Tech‚Äôs potential participation in the crypto industry. According to The New York Times, Republican Senator Josh Hawley recently said he would vote against the bill in its current form as it would allow tech companies to issue digital currencies that would compete with the dollar. In response, Democrats are reportedly planning to introduce an amendment that would prohibit Big Tech companies from creating their own stablecoins, according to an informed source cited by the NYT. This change would require tech firms operating in the US to rely on existing stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $300 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $18.5 billion, rebounded from a crucial support level of around $2,407 in the past 24 hours to trade about $2,478 on Friday, during the late North American trading session. However, the recent crypto rebound has triggered fears of a potential dead cat bounce. Moreover, the feud between Trump and Musk may continue to divide the crypto market. BlackRock Leads in Ethereum Accumulation According to on-chain data analysis, BlackRock has gradually shifted its focus from Bitcoin to Ether in the past few days. In the past week, BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA recorded a net cash inflow of over $492 million to currently hold about $4.84 billion in cumulative net cash inflow at the time of this writing. The gradual crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum has fueled the narrative of the much-anticipated altseason 2025. Moreover, the ETH/BTC pair has been dropping for the past few years until recently, signaling a major shift by institutional investors to the altcoin market. What Next for ETH Price? Since breaking out of an established falling trendline in the first quarter, the ETh price has been forming a rising trend characterized by higher highs and higher lows in the lower timeframes. The altcoin has, however, been consolidating in a tight range between $2,400 and $2,679 in the past few weeks. From a technical analysis perspective, Ether‚Äôs price is well positioned to rally above $3k if the buyers manage to push the altcoin above $2,679 in the coming weeks. However, a consistent close below $2.4k will signal further short-term bearish sentiment towards $2.2k.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-07 00:20:38

The president‚Äôs son said in a post on X on Friday that the company responsible for the Trump meme coin isn‚Äôt moving forward with a digital wallet offering that has caused a fissure with World Liberty Financial, the crypto company owned in part by the Trump family. The dispute‚Äôs heart was a proposed digital wallet called $TRUMP Wallet. It was being produced by a company called Fight Fight Fight LLC, which Bill Zanker, a longtime Trump friend, owns. This wallet was advertised as the home of the widely popular $TRUMP meme coin launched earlier in the year. However, another Trump-affiliated company, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), opposed the development. WLFI, which members of the Trump family partially own, said the wallet had used Trump‚Äôs name without permission. WLFI sent Fight Fight Fight and its tech partner, Magic Eden, a cease-and-desist letter to prevent the wallet from launching, Bloomberg News reported. The issue was revealed in an X post by Eric Trump. He said the wallet is not being pursued, and his family didn‚Äôt sign off on its development. ‚ÄúI run @Trump, and I know nothing about this project! He posted. This public statement went a long way toward putting such rumors to rest that a division had formed within the Trump crypto business network. World Liberty Financial boosts holdings with $TRUMP meme coin With the wallet flap now behind it, World Liberty Financial is pursuing a serious investment in the $TRUMP meme coin, Eric Trump says. He said on X that WLFI intends to purchase a ‚Äúgood amount‚Äù of the token. That‚Äôs changed from competition to partnership, indicating a closer relationship between WLFI and the token‚Äôs creators. Most of the $TRUMP supply, about 80%, is owned by Fight Fight Fight and another Trump-related entity, CIC Digital LLC . Their holdings are worth around $2 billion as of early June, according to CoinMarketCap, the tracking site. Its supporters say the meme coin provides fans with a means to express support for the president and to play a role in the digital economy. Critics say it is a cash cow for Trump insiders. And the demand for the meme coin, although much debated, has been so high that you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find someone close to the Trump orbit who, like the president or not, might be open to a little high-proof sycophancy, who doesn‚Äôt want one. Trump crypto ventures spark political backlash The Trump family‚Äôs increasing stake in crypto has prompted fresh political concerns. Some Democratic lawmakers have alleged that Donald Trump, who calls the shots for the Republicans in the Senate, is employing the crypto vehicle to peddle influence and line his pockets and those of his cronies. They note the family‚Äôs hefty holdings in $TRUMP and their ties to numerous crypto firms. These worries intensified when Trump held a private dinner in April for prominent $TRUMP stockholders at Mar-a-Lago. Critics say this may have crossed the ethical boundary, particularly since Trump is the president. The Trump family disputes all allegations of wrongdoing. Eric and Donald Trump Jr. have insisted that they are simply backing projects that excite their base and represent genuine value in the world of cryptos. The family is, meanwhile, expanding its digital finance footprint.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $12.59. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $34.29 and $39.7, with an average value of $35.49. Optimism‚Äôs (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform‚Äôs initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let‚Äôs get into the OP price prediction for 2025 ‚Äì 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.595 Market Cap $1.02B Trading Volume $164.14M Circulating Supply 1.71B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.6141 24-hour Low $0.5872 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 9.88% 50-Day SMA $0.7486 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 45 (Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $1.1629 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP/USDT sees small gains but remains bearish. Support at $0.562 is critical. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP remains bearish despite a slight uptick The OP/USDT price analysis for June 7 shows a minimal uptick on the day, although the coin is hovering just above the lower Bollinger Band at $0.562. The MACD remains deeply bearish, with no crossover in sight, reflecting sustained downward momentum and the possibility of a break below the next support. OP remains bearish despite a slight uptick Likewise, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) is flat. If support at $0.562 breaks, further downside is likely. A recovery above the middle Bollinger Band ($0.695) would be needed to suggest a bullish shift. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP is trading in a tight sideways range The 4-hour chart shows the price trading in a tight sideways range between support at $0.585 and resistance near $0.608. The price remains below the Alligator lines, signaling a persistent bearish trend with no breakout yet. OP is trading in a tight sideways range The Balance of Power, however, reflects a modest shift in control toward buyers, but not aggressively. A breakout above $0.608 could open short-term upside potential, while a breakdown below $0.585 may trigger fresh lows. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6390 SELL SMA 5 $0.6765 SELL SMA 10 $0.6979 SELL SMA 21 $0.7346 SELL SMA 50 $0.7486 SELL SMA 100 $0.8025 SELL SMA 200 $1.1629 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7100 SELL EMA 5 $0.7113 SELL EMA 10 $0.7122 SELL EMA 21 $0.7461 SELL EMA 50 $0.8797 SELL EMA 100 $1.1091 SELL EMA 200 $1.3934 SELL What to expect from Optimism? Optimism is in consolidation. If it breaks above $0.608, a short-term move toward $0.626‚Äì0.64 is possible. But if it loses $0.585, the next key support lies around $0.562. For now, a breakout confirmation is needed. Momentum remains weak but slightly improving. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it‚Äôs risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you‚Äôre willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

The crypto market has been further muddled by the entry of meme coins, which sucked in many investors on the promise of growth driven by vibes. However, many investors are realizing that meme coins are simply not a sustainable way to grow wealth in the crypto space. Investors are now focused on projects that offer real prospects for long-term returns. As with any investment, stability has become an important consideration. One project that has caught the attention of investors with this mindset is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . So far, its presale has been a massive success as investors shift their capital into the project based on its focus on long-term utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ‚Äì A True Giant Of Utility Away from the noise and buzz surrounding meme coin, Mutuum Finance has been quietly building a protocol dedicated to maximizing the benefits of DeFi technology. The Mutuum Finance protocol is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol designed to allow lenders to deposit their assets and earn interest. The interest rate for these assets is determined by a pool‚Äôs utilization rate. For instance, when more borrowers take over-collateralized loans from a liquidity pool, the rate of the pool rises. That triggers a wave of new lenders to deposit assets to benefit from the high interest rates. It also causes fewer borrowers to want to join the pool. As a result, the system finds a balance on its own, driven by market forces. The depositors in a pool also receive instant liquidity in the form of mtTokens. These tokens represent the value of the initial deposit in a pool, plus any interest it accrues. For instance, when you deposit DAI in a pool, you receive mtDAI tokens on a 1:1 ratio. Holders of mtTokens are free to sell them on secondary exchanges or use them as collateral on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to benefit from new market opportunities as they arise. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Tokens Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the native token of the protocol. Its success is closely tied to the success of the protocol in the long term. It will also serve as an important gauge of how well the protocol is doing for new entrants. The total supply of MUTM tokens is 4,000,000,000 tokens. The planned listing price for the token is $0.06. However, many analysts expect the price to shoot up massively due to the extensive utility offered on its native protocol. To support the long-term value of MUTM, the team will use part of the protocol profits to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market and redistribute them to stakers in the safety module. This action will prompt more stakers to join the protocol, deepening its liquidity. Additionally, it will apply upward price pressure on the tokens, giving confidence to more users to join the protocol. Besides buying back tokens on the open market, the team plans to use part of the profits to grow the pools and for marketing purposes. With a Certik audit in hand, the team can confidently apply for an exchange listing on top-tier exchanges, which is expected on the same day as the launch. To test the waters, the team applied for a listing on CoinMarketCap. The CoinMarketCap platform is known to have strict standards for listing new tokens, and the MUTM listing is another signal that this project is more than just hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM Presale Shatters Its Own Record The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale recently beat its own record. In the current phase 5 of the presale, over 25% of the tokens have already been sold, which represents a new record for the presale. It is much faster than when the price was $0.01 in phase. The tokens are currently selling for $0.03 in phase 5, a 200% increase. A major reason for these has been recent advancements in the roadmap, such as the listing on CoinMarketCap and the Certik audit report. As it achieves more milestones in its roadmap, the presale pace is expected to be even faster. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035, which makes phase 5 the last opportunity for a 100% Roi based on the $0.06 listing price. By focusing on the fundamentals, such as utility, adopting strategies, and long-term growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has identified an often overlooked niche in the crypto market. Its unique approach to the crypto sector has earned it a massive following of over 20k across its social media channels. With such a massive support base, coupled with the utility it offers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could experience explosive growth like never before in the crypto world. For the lucky ones to come across it in the current presale, they have an opportunity to ride this growth to the top at the low entry point of $0.03.

The firm offers institutional clients Bitcoin and Ethereum custody and trading services through Fidelity Digital Assets. It has also explored blockchain applications in settlement and tokenized securities‚Äîefforts that underline its long-term commitment to bridging traditional and digital finance. While there is no official confirmation, a representative of Fidelity recently said that the firm‚Äôs digital asset arm was experimenting with a stablecoin. However, it did not have immediate plans to launch one. The arrival of Fidelity into stablecoins will likely bring more trust, attention, and skills to the stablecoin‚ÄÇecosystem. However, it could also invite tougher scrutiny from regulators and raise concerns about fairness or the likelihood that a handful of large‚ÄÇplayers could dominate the market . Some people believe Fidelity‚Äôs new stablecoin will help provide safer, more reliable digital payment options. However, critics say it could create problems with oversight, limit competition, and concentrate too much power in the hands of a few large firms. How does Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin help innovation? Reports indicate that Fidelity has a pilot program for a stablecoin backed by the US dollar to make faster, cheaper, and more efficient payments and settlements than traditional methods. The company wants to build a bridge between old and new finance, and its investment shows that trusted, well-established financial institutions see stablecoins as a serious and credible part of the future financial system. Some crypto experts suggest Fidelity‚Äôs move will push banks, payment providers, and fintech companies to adopt blockchain technology faster and improve their services due to the growing competition. Blockchain experts also pointed out the success of Fidelity‚Äôs early pilot programs, saying the trials show promising results that could fuel optimism among other big players and make digital financial systems more accessible for everyone. What risks come with Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin? Some critics say unclear rules for digital currencies make it hard for investors, companies, and regulators to know what‚Äôs fair or how to keep the market safe. Others, though, fear that large firms like Fidelity will crowd out small start-ups and prevent these new and innovative businesses from getting a fair shot at competition and that the end result will be less fresh ideas and new competition. Some people fear that if just a handful of big companies dominate most stablecoins, it could risk the entire financial system if any one of them encounters trouble. They also worry about whether these companies will be truthful when they claim to manage their reserves responsibly and to keep users safe. Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin initiative is part of a larger trend where many traditional banks and fintech companies actively develop their own stablecoins or explore blockchain technology to improve payment systems and financial services. Those advantages have attracted the attention of political leaders and regulators who agree there is an opportunity for the industry to expand and offer benefits to more people but have also sought to create clear rules to remove the risks associated with these tokens and to shield consumers from potential harm. Some crypto projects are concerned that large finance companies like Fidelity will use their vast amounts of resources to take over a large part of the crypto space and discourage new innovations from startups, which beats the whole purpose of cryptocurrency. As a result, there is a growing push and pull between industry experts who want regulators to create soft laws that will help the crypto industry grow by making it fair for small companies to compete with large firms and those who want strict rules that will protect everyone from the dominance of large financial institutions. What does Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin mean for the future? People and financial firms that have doubts about cryptocurrencies will get a positive perspective about investing in digital currency when they see Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin initiative succeed. Big banks and fintech companies will also be motivated to develop their own stablecoins or develop new blockchain solutions to help make digital finance accessible to a wider audience. We still can‚Äôt ignore the risks involved because it is possible that large firms like Fidelity might try to dominate the crypto market once they see the company succeed. This means they will have more influence on whether they are worthy of joining the crypto space, which would make it difficult for smaller firms to compete. The current laws around cryptocurrency also don‚Äôt fully address the problems big companies bring when they introduce their own coins. This is because these firms must follow heavy compliance requirements and need tight supervision that smaller companies will struggle to keep up with. The success or failure of Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin will likely shape the future of both traditional finance and the crypto world, influencing how open, fair, and innovative this industry can become.

This price movement reflects increased volatility across the crypto market following a public exchange on social media between US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Their clash appears to have triggered a wave of risk-off sentiment among traders. In response, the global crypto market cap slipped 4%, falling from over $3.4 trillion yesterday to $3.33 trillion. Meanwhile, the broader market correction has not gone unnoticed in derivatives data. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 Derivative Metrics Reveal Bearish Sentiment Spike According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the Binance net taker volume, a metric that measures the difference between aggressive longs and shorts, fell dramatically from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This signals a sharp pivot in sentiment, as traders rushed to hedge or speculate on downside risk in response to the unfolding news. Darkfost emphasized that this was the largest intraday net taker volume reversal observed on Binance this year. The abrupt shift reflects how quickly sentiment can change when macro-level narratives or influential figures dominate headlines. In this case, the market responded swiftly to perceived uncertainty, leading to a concentration of short positions and significant selling pressure. The situation also led to a notable change in BTC perpetual futures funding rates. Funding on Binance turned negative after briefly trending toward positive territory, dropping from +0.003 to below -0.004. This indicates that short sellers were willing to pay a premium to maintain bearish positions, underscoring rising fear and potentially overextended downside bets. üîîWhen Funding rates turns negative. üîπ Buying or considering a long position is often wise when funding rates turn highly negative, especially if the price starts to trend upward.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets , such as the US dollar. They provide the advantages of blockchain but without the volatility that has plagued more traditional crypto tokens like Bitcoin. These discussions are occurring as demand increases for faster, cheaper cross-border payments. The positives are also obvious for tech companies like Airbnb, which are globally reachable. Accepting stablecoins could also avert steep fees charged by credit card networks such as Visa and Mastercard. An Airbnb spokesperson said that the company is ‚Äúalways looking at all aspects of payments‚Äù for improving user experience , but it is also looking into digital assets. According to previous reports, X has reportedly expressed an interest in adding stablecoin payments to its upcoming payments product, X Money. According to sources, Elon Musk‚Äôs team has been in touch with crypto companies, and the company is in talks with Stripe about integration. The aim is to realize Musk‚Äôs ideal of an ‚Äú everything app ‚Äù that blends social media, payments, and commerce. Apple is also keen on stablecoin functionality through its Apple Pay infrastructure. Sources hint the tech firm has been in talks with Circle, the minters of the hugely popular USDC stablecoin, since early this year. Google was interested, too, it was reported. Rich Widmann, who leads Web3 strategy at Google Cloud, has called stablecoins ‚Äúone of the biggest upgrades to payments since‚ÄÇthe SWIFT network.‚Äù Stripe bets on stablecoins with bold acquisition Stripe, one of the world‚Äôs largest payment processors, has made a bold bet. It recently purchased Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure startup with funding from vendor capital firm Haun Ventures. Bridge has been working on tools to enable businesses to implement stablecoin payments quickly and securely. Stripe‚Äôs purchase of Bridge was interpreted as a sign that stablecoins have turned the corner in Silicon Valley. The deal also gave Stripe a technical advantage ‚Äî Bridge‚Äôs infrastructure will be used to assist Stripe in making it possible for accounts and payments to be made in a stablecoin, which is important for global freelancers and marketplaces. Visa has followed suit by rolling out pilots for issuing stablecoin-linked cards with Bridge in April 2025. The sources say Airbnb is discussing with one of its existing payment partners the incorporation of one of the popular stablecoins to facilitate easy payment processes. Worldpay recently disclosed that it would facilitate stablecoin payouts by partnering with BNVK, a crypto infrastructure provider. Trump administration eases crypto regulations In the United States, legislators are considering two bills to regulate stablecoins. The most high-profile, known as the GENIUS Act , details consumer protections, reserve requirements, and oversight mechanisms for issuers of digital dollars. Big Tech was hesitant about crypto in part because of scrutiny under the Biden administration. But the political winds are shifting. The second term of Donald Trump has injected vitality into the realm of blockchain. His administration has pursued a more hands-off approach, pushing agencies to roll back rules and embrace crypto innovation. This policy change has reawakened some dormant dreams. Two years after regulatory opposition forced Meta to mothball its Diem stablecoin project, the parent company reconsidered its views on crypto payments. Uber‚Äôs chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said recently that the ride-hailing company is examining the use of stablecoins for its global transfers. Uber‚Äôs interest is further evidence of a broader trend circulating throughout tech circles, not just a niche idea. For now, the tone is most cautious among most firms, including Google and Airbnb. They are not promising instant launches. However, their research, alliances, and internal experiments indicate that they are gaining confidence in the future for stablecoins.

33767162,[object Object],1749261622,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Cardano Unveils 39 Proposals Under New Budget Framework,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-39-proposals-under-new-budget-framework/,"Cardano‚Äôs governance experiment took a decisive step forward on 5 June, when Intersect‚Äîa member-based organisation tasked with stewarding the blockchain‚Äôs transition to on-chain self-rule‚Äîpublished its first Budget Info Action (BIA). The nine-minute overview lays out 39 community-driven proposals that Delegated Representatives (DReps) have already signalled for funding. ‚ÄúThe Budget Info Action brings together 39 proposals that reflect where the community sees opportunities, needs, and momentum,‚Äù Intersect explained, stressing that the roadmap was drafted ‚Äúby a network of builders, researchers, developers, and contributors working together to deliver real value.‚Äù Cardano‚Äôs Next Chapter Begins The package reveals where Cardano‚Äôs stakeholders think resources will matter most over the next 18 months. Nearly half the proposals address performance at the protocol layer. Input Output Global (IOG) seeks continued maintenance budgets for Hydra , its off-chain state-channel suite, and Mithril , the fast-sync protocol designed to make full-node deployment as effortless as setting up a light wallet. IOG also asks for funding to refine stake-pool-operator (SPO) incentives, overhaul fee mechanics, and roll out new developer-testing pipelines. Two experimental designs‚Äî Leios and Peras‚Äîwould push finality toward sub-second territory and multiply throughput without compromising decentralisation. Tweag, best known for its Haskell and formal-verification expertise, proposes multi-year stewardship of the critical libraries on which both the consensus layer and off-chain tooling depend. Governance tooling emerges as the second-largest theme. A refreshed ‚ÄúCatalyst 2.0‚Äù initiative would wire treasury voting directly into CIP-1694 governance flows, ending the separation between project funding rounds and constitutional decision-making. Complement Catalyst‚Äîa proposal from social-impact startup Socious‚Äîintroduces quadratic funding weighted by on-chain reputation scores, a mechanism it says will ‚Äúboost fairness, transparency, and community impact.‚Äù Cardano Builder DAO wants a smart-contract-controlled endowment that can approve application-layer grants autonomously, while the ‚ÄúBeyond Minimum Viable Governance‚Äù report promises the first data-driven audit of how Voltaire-era institutions are actually functioning in practice. Developer experience and open-source infrastructure form the third pillar. MLabs asks to maintain Plutarch, CardanoOps, and Hermes, three projects it argues ‚Äúremove friction for DApp teams by letting them focus on product, not plumbing.‚Äù Pallas would continue curating the Rust libraries that power lightweight indexers and explorers, while Blockfrost seeks to keep its plug-and-play API free at the point of use. NFTCDN proposes a global, cost-free content-delivery network for native assets so marketplaces can serve media files ‚Äúwith Web-2 latency but Web-3 integrity.‚Äù A cluster of proposals focuses on resilience and security. Dolos, a lightweight data-node implementation, promises ‚Äúhigh-integrity ledger queries with minimal resource overhead,‚Äù a feature aimed at mobile developers and IoT deployers. TxPipe wants to maintain its open-source RPC server that already backs dozens of wallets, explorers, and analytics dashboards. In parallel, Eternl requests funds for ongoing hardware-wallet integration, and an independent team proposes a full rewrite of Ledger‚Äôs Cardano application to unlock advanced multi-sig features. Sundae Labs and Xerberus have submitted an auditable smart-contract framework that will govern how treasury withdrawals are disbursed, exposing live dashboards so ADA holders can watch spending as it happens. Education, outreach, and real-world adoption round out the slate. Discover Cardano plans branded pavilions at major tech expos, offering what it calls ‚Äúshared spaces to amplify the voice of Cardano‚Äôs community and lower barriers for builders.‚Äù A linked proposal seeks to centralise global events marketing so that every Summit-style gathering has consistent branding and clear onboarding funnels. On the utility front, Anzens wants funds to expand access to USDA, a USD-backed stable-asset issued natively on Cardano, through exchange listings, institutional custody, and cross-border settlement pilots. Meanwhile, MLabs‚Äô cryptography team outlines a toolkit for privacy-preserving smart contracts that could enable anonymous voting, shielded identity credentials, and confidential DeFi. What‚Äôs Next? Each item in the BIA is advisory for now. Under CIP-1694, ADA holders have a 30-day review window to approve or reject the bundle. If passed, Intersect will translate the document into one or more Treasury Withdrawal actions that carry hard spending authority and require a two-thirds super-majority on-chain. The organisation has floated splitting the withdrawals into tranches so that ‚Äúfunds are released only as milestones are met,‚Äù a safeguard meant to reassure both sceptical stakeholders and external regulators that Cardano can allocate capital with the same rigour expected of a public-sector budget. In publishing the BIA, Intersect framed the moment as a stress-test for decentralised governance. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just a budget,‚Äù the post reads. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a signal that Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem is ready to deliver.‚Äù If the community ratifies the 39-proposal slate, Cardano will move beyond ad-hoc Catalyst rounds toward a predictable, constitutional funding cycle‚Äîtransforming Voltaire‚Äôs aspirational blueprint into the network‚Äôs first working balance sheet.

Gemini is seeking to go public through an IPO. Gemini had submitted a confidential draft registration statement on SEC Form S-1, which would permit the company to apply for an IPO without revealing sensitive information to the public. The filing has been motioned amid renewed investor confidence as trade war fears have receded. The number of shares to be offered and the price range have not yet been determined. No date was given or when the IPO might take place. Winklevoss twins drive Gemini‚Äôs ambitious growth Gemini was founded in 2014 by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. In November 2021, it announced a fundraising of $400 million at a valuation of $7.1 billion. Around November 2022, Gemini‚ÄÇwas said to have approximately 1,000 employees, though it laid off some employees during the crypto winter. In January 2023, Gemini conflicted with the SEC over the exchange‚Äôs ‚ÄúEarn‚Äù program, through which the agency claimed unregistered securities sales . The Winklevoss twins were notable supporters of US President Donald‚ÄÇTrump‚Äôs election campaign and donated $1 million. But the money was returned after they surpassed what people could give. The battle for IPO is already heating up following Circle‚Äôs successful IPO on June 5 and the soaring stock price of Coreweave after the company went public in March. Circle‚Äôs IPO encourages other crypto firms to follow the lead Circle has encouraged other large crypto firms, such as Gemini, to go public as the industry reaps the benefit of President Donald Trump‚Äôs embrace of the sector. Earlier, Circle had priced its shares at $ 31 on Wednesday, June 4. Reflecting strong investor demand, they opened trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, June 5, at $69 and closed at $83.23. That trajectory will likely be an encouraging sign for other crypto companies looking to make stock market debuts. Circle is the first big crypto company to go public since the crypto exchange Coinbase was listed on Nasdaq in 2021. Analysts anticipate that more crypto companies will apply for an IPO Analysts had identified crypto exchanges Kraken and Gemini as potential IPO candidates in the digital asset sector. Interestingly, their prediction came true with Gemini‚Äôs IPO announcement. The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An example of the analysts include Jacob Zuller, an analyst at Third Bridge, who stated that it would not be shocking if more crypto companies did the same as Circle . Based on his argument, the public markets realize that crypto is here to stay. Dan Dolev, a Wall Street analyst at Mizuho Securities, is another pundit who voiced his opinion. According to Dolev, Circle‚Äôs IPO success shows pent-up demand for crypto and other fintech companies in the public markets. Based on his argument, if IPOs are doing well, it is a good indicator. Lynn Martin, the President of NYSE Group, added that Circle‚Äôs IPO is a good sign for crypto listings and IPOs. She explained that she viewed the Circle IPO as a key indicator for this year‚Äôs IPO market beyond just crypto listings. Circle issues USDC, a stablecoin linked to the US dollar, and it aims to keep its value steady. Crypto traders employ stablecoins to shift money among tokens swiftly, and advocates say they could be used to send or receive payments instantly. In an interview, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire highlighted that from the beginning, they strongly believed that they could create a new system for money using the internet, which, according to them, could change how money is used.

At the same time, new projects like Qubetics are rapidly gaining momentum through strategic presale initiatives and ambitious tech goals. In this piece, examine Pi‚Äôs projected performance for 2026, outlining potential monthly movements and critical price triggers. Also, explore how Qubetics , with its promising token economics and presale success, is positioning itself as a high-growth alternative. Month-by-Month Pi Price Expectations for 2026 January: Slow Momentum to Start the Year The year may begin on a measured note, with Pi likely trading between $0.51 and $0.61. The estimated average price for the month stands at $0.54, suggesting modest gains and a period of consolidation following year-end volatility. February: Growth Picks Up February may bring stronger gains, with Pi potentially climbing to $0.89. The average for the month is forecasted at around $0.68, marking a significant improvement as the network stabilises and interest builds. March: The Breakout Month According to projections, March could be a game-changer. Pi might hit a high of $1.78, with a robust average of $1.40. This dramatic uptick may be spurred by major ecosystem announcements, increased institutional engagement, or successful implementation of key features on the network. April and May: Holding the Gains Pi‚Äôs upward momentum is expected to continue through spring. In April, prices could hover between $1.10 and $1.54, averaging around $1.30. May may offer an average close to $1.44, suggesting ongoing investor confidence and steady user growth. June and July: Slight Cooling Off Mid-year projections show potential corrections. June could see a dip to between $1.08 and $1.42, with July averaging near $1.13. This phase may reflect typical investor rebalancing after strong Q1 and Q2 performance. August to October: Choppier Waters Ahead These months may be marked by greater price swings. Forecasts suggest prices may fluctuate from $0.87 to $1.17, with some months averaging below the $1 mark. Volatility could arise from broader market conditions or shifts in community sentiment. November and December: Finding Stability Toward the end of the year, Pi‚Äôs price is projected to stabilize again, likely trading between $1.08 and $1.19 and averaging around $1.14. This return to steadier pricing could indicate improved long-term investor confidence and maturing market fundamentals. Qubetics Presale: A Rising Star Worth Watching While Pi Network advances towards 2026, Qubetics is quickly establishing itself as one of the most talked-about presale projects in the market. Currently in Stage 37 of its crypto presale , Qubetics has already raised over $17.7 million and distributed more than 515 million $TICS tokens to upwards of 27,500 holders. The token is priced at $0.3370 in this phase, making it a potentially lucrative entry point for early backers. The Qubetics ecosystem, built around asset tokenisation and zero-gas transactions, is drawing keen interest from both retail and institutional participants. Token price: $0.3370; only 10M left Listing price set at $0.40 = 20% ROI for current buyers Total supply cut to 1.36B to increase scarcity 38.55% tokens allocated to public‚Äîenhancing decentralization High analyst confidence in strong post-listing performance These figures highlight Qubetics as one of the most promising contenders in the crypto presale arena, especially for those seeking explosive growth potential. Final Thoughts: A Year of Strategic Moves The outlook for Pi Network in 2026 shows strong potential, especially in March, where a significant rally could take shape. Meanwhile, investors should remain aware of the likely ebbs and flows across the rest of the year as the network matures. On the other hand, Qubetics presents a parallel opportunity‚Äîa dynamic presale-driven project with a bold roadmap and substantial ROI projections. Together, these two projects represent different strategies in the evolving blockchain world: one built on accessibility and scale, the other on innovation and early-stage investment potential. For those looking to diversify their crypto exposure in 2026, keeping a close watch on Pi Network‚Äôs developments and securing a stake in Qubetics before its presale concludes could offer a well-balanced approach.

Bitcoin Funding Rates Turn Negative On Binance According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, BTC funding rates on Binance have once again turned negative, even as the top cryptocurrency continues to trade above the $100,000 mark at the time of writing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upward Momentum ‚ÄòHighly Likely‚Äô To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows The analyst attributed the sudden reversal in funding ‚Äì from +0.003 to -0.004 ‚Äì to the public spat between Trump and Musk on social media. This rapid shift reflects growing fear among market participants amid heightened uncertainty. Following the sentiment shift, BTC fell from the mid-$100,000 range to a low of $100,984, according to CoinGecko. Over the past two weeks, the asset has declined by 4.1%. That said, the current dip may offer a prime buying opportunity to investors. If Bitcoin rebounds strongly, it could result in a strong resurgence in buying pressure, leading to a short squeeze that may propel BTC‚Äôs price further up. Darkfost highlighted that there have been three instances during the current market cycle when BTC witnessed such deep negative funding. Notably, each of these instances were followed by a strong upward move in the cryptocurrency. For example, on October 16, 2023, BTC dipped into negative funding territory before rallying from $28,000 to $73,000. A similar pattern played out on September 9, 2024, when the asset surged from $57,000 to $108,000. The most recent case was on May 2, 2025, when BTC jumped from $97,000 to a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,000. If history repeats, then the market may see a new ATH for BTC in the coming weeks. Darkfost noted: Such extreme readings often mark moments of maximum pessimism, precisely the kind of sentiment that can precede a strong bullish reversal when the short term negativity is gone. Large Investors Increase BTC Exposure Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales ‚Äì wallets holding large amounts of BTC ‚Äì continue to accumulate at a rapid pace. Notably, new whales have acquired BTC worth $63 billion, reflecting strong confidence in the asset‚Äôs near-term prospects. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicating Prime Buying Opportunity, Analyst Says Supporting this bullish outlook, recent analysis by QCR Capital indicates that large investors expect BTC to surge to as high as $130,000 by the end of Q3 2025. Additionally, the realized cap held by long-term holders has surpassed $20 billion, reinforcing positive sentiment. That said, some analysts urge caution, expecting BTC to crash below $100,000 before resuming its bullish momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $104,069, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

Unlike traditional organizations where decisions come from a centralized leader or board, DAOs allow members to participate directly in decision-making through voting. This makes the whole process more transparent, democratic and community-driven. However, simply having a voting system is not enough for DAOs to thrive. They need efficient ways to manage their finances and keep their members actively engaged. This is where DeFi (decentralized finance) plays a vital role. DeFi provides automated financial tools that help DAOs manage their funds and incentivize participation, enabling them to operate more effectively and grow sustainably. In this article, we‚Äôll explore how DeFi supports DAOs today, the challenges they face and the exciting innovations that lie ahead. What is a DAO really At its essence, a DAO is an organization that‚Äôs governed by rules encoded as software on a blockchain. Token holders get voting rights and help shape the organization‚Äôs direction, whether that‚Äôs deciding how money is spent, what projects to fund or what upgrades to make. This system replaces trust in individuals with trust in transparent, auditable code, making it ideal for communities that span the globe and want a fair voice in governance. Why managing the treasury well is crucial The treasury is essentially the DAO‚Äôs bank account. It funds everything from development to community rewards, so managing it wisely is critical. Poor treasury management can stall projects or erode trust. Traditionally, organizations rely on manual processes and trust individuals to handle funds, which can be slow and risky. DeFi changes this by automating many financial operations. DAOs can deposit funds into DeFi protocols to earn yield through lending, liquidity provision or staking. Spending decisions can be automatically executed by smart contracts once approved by a vote, speeding up processes and reducing human error. Since transactions are recorded on the blockchain, members can track exactly how funds move, improving transparency. How tokenomics encourages participation One of the biggest challenges DAOs face is low voter turnout. Without enough active voices, decisions risk not reflecting the broader community. DeFi offers creative tokenomics tools to boost engagement. Governance tokens ‚Äì Holders get voting rights and may earn rewards like staking yields or protocol fees. Bonding ‚Äì Some DAOs use bonding, where members lock up assets to buy discounted tokens that vest over time. This encourages long-term involvement and liquidity for the treasury. Gasless and off-chain voting ‚Äì Platforms like Snapshot allow members to vote without paying blockchain fees, lowering barriers. Reputation systems ‚Äì DAOs can reward meaningful participation with reputation points or badges, giving more weight to experienced members. Transparency and security are key Trust is the foundation of any DAO. DeFi enhances trust by making every governance vote and treasury transaction publicly visible on the blockchain. However, DeFi carries risks, including smart contract bugs and hacks. To protect themselves, DAOs adopt several measures. Decentralized insurance platforms like Nexus Mutual provide coverage against smart contract failures. Regular third-party security audits help identify vulnerabilities. Decentralized oracles such as Chainlink supply reliable data feeds, crucial for governance and treasury operations. Expanding horizons with cross-chain DAOs While Ethereum remains the main hub for DAOs and DeFi, other blockchains have grown in popularity. Some DAOs now operate across multiple blockchains using interoperability solutions like Polkadot and Cosmos. This offers advantages such as the following. Diversifying treasury assets to reduce risk. Including members from various blockchain communities. Increasing resilience by not relying on a single network. Layer-two solutions make governance affordable High gas fees on Ethereum once made it expensive for small holders to vote or participate. Layer-two solutions, such as Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism, solve this by offering faster, cheaper transactions. Examples of DeFi-enabled DAOs Uniswap DAO ‚Äì Uses UNI tokens for governance. Their treasury invests in DeFi yield strategies to fund ecosystem growth. MakerDAO ‚Äì Manages the DAI stablecoin with MKR holders voting on risk parameters. Automated liquidations keep the system stable. Aave DAO ‚Äì Governs a lending platform. AAVE token holders vote on upgrades and risk management. The treasury supports grants and incentives. These real-world examples show how DeFi protocols enable decentralized governance at scale. Challenges to overcome Despite progress, DAOs face several challenges. Low participation can lead to less representative decisions. Smart contract bugs carry risks. Legal frameworks around DAOs remain uncertain. Addressing these will be crucial for the ecosystem‚Äôs growth. DAOs and their social impact DAOs are changing how communities come together beyond finance. Pooling funds transparently for charities and public goods. Running media platforms owned and governed by users. Funding scientific research with decentralized grants. These social uses highlight DAOs‚Äô potential far beyond money. What the future holds ‚Äì AI and DeFi Looking ahead, AI could help DAOs do the following. Predict market trends for better treasury management. Suggest governance proposals based on data. Gauge community sentiment to boost engagement. Together with DeFi, AI can make DAOs smarter and more responsive. Conclusion DeFi is more than just financial tools ‚Äì it‚Äôs reshaping how groups organize, govern and collaborate. By automating money management, rewarding participation and increasing transparency, DeFi strengthens DAOs and helps them grow. With advances in cross-chain tech, layer-two scaling and AI on the horizon, DAOs are poised for even greater impact. For anyone curious about the future of organizations, understanding DeFi-powered DAOs is a must.

The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, beating the forecast of 125,000, which suggests the economy remains resilient and gives the Federal Reserve less reason to ease monetary policy. Despite that, former President Donald Trump continued his push for looser policy.

The company‚Äôs stretch goal? Holding 210,000 BTC by 2027, equivalent to 1% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply. Such long-term commitment could significantly tighten supply and increase institutional FOMO, fueling upward pressure on BTC prices. Bitcoin Chart Eyes Breakout; Institutions Show Up Bitcoin‚Äôs recent bounce from $100,519 has formed higher lows and is now approaching a key descending trendline. BTC sits just above the 50-period EMA on the 2-hour chart, with the MACD showing a bullish crossover, a sign that momentum is building. Bitcoin Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview The key resistance range lies between $105,000 and $106,300, where horizontal resistance intersects with the trendline. Bitcoin price prediction may turn bullish upon a breakout above this level; the next upside target is $107,600. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor has also returned to the buying table. His firm is launching a $1 billion stock offering to expand its Bitcoin holdings, following an initial raise of four times its target of $250 million. With BTC near $104K, that capital could translate to nearly 9,600 BTC. Trade Idea: Entry: Above $105,200 Target: $106,750‚Äì$107,600 Stop-Loss: $103,900 Confirmation: Watch for bullish engulfing candles or a break of the trendline If this level gives way, it could mark the start of Bitcoin‚Äôs next leg higher, powered not just by hype, but by institutions and nations placing large bets.

BlockDAG‚Äôs presale is delivering both. Its newest feature, Buyer Battles, is a live leaderboard that showcases top-contributing countries in real time. This dynamic format has brought serious energy to the presale. With more than $289 million collected and over 22 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is proving that interactive features can boost traction. Buyers now get a limited-time price of $0.0018, frozen until June 13, while Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262. That‚Äôs a built-in gain of 2,520% for early participants, and things are only heating up. Buyer Battles Feature Fires Up Global Race Buyer Battles isn‚Äôt just eye-catching, it‚Äôs effective. The leaderboard updates live, showing which buyers and regions are leading the charge. This simple change has transformed passive buying into a contest. Every shift on the board pushes more users into action. The format taps into a sense of urgency and visibility, driving participation through healthy competition. With BlockDAG closing in on a $300 million mark, this feature is proving to be a strong driver of engagement. It isn‚Äôt just another presale, it‚Äôs a presale that feels alive. BlockDAG Blends Strategy, Scale, and Speculation BlockDAG‚Äôs explosive growth to $289 million is backed by more than just interest. Its real-time leaderboard, rolled out recently, has helped push daily contributions higher. The combination of social involvement and timely pricing is attracting attention across the board. Batch 28 sits at $0.0262, but the spotlight is now on the frozen $0.0018 price, which is locked in until June 13. This early-entry rate offers a 2,678% gain against the $0.05 launch price, making it hard to ignore. Buyer Battles has boosted community involvement, driving more traffic to the platform and keeping the presale momentum strong. Community Strength Meets Tech-Driven Utility BlockDAG‚Äôs rise isn‚Äôt just hype-driven, it‚Äôs rooted in active user engagement and functional design. The Buyer Battles format has reshaped buying into a public event where users see their impact in real time. At the same time, BlockDAG stands out technically. It combines DAG scalability with Proof-of-Work security and offers EVM compatibility, allowing Ethereum-based apps to run seamlessly. While this positions the project for strong post-launch performance, the presale has already become a major highlight. With a growing user base and clear progress, BlockDAG is staking its claim as the best crypto for the future. Bottom Line BlockDAG‚Äôs Buyer Battles are turning every leaderboard refresh into a motivator. With more than $289 million raised and over 22 billion coins purchased, the $0.0018 price is grabbing attention before the June 13 update. The presale is working not just because of smart pricing, but because of the intense, community-driven energy around it. It‚Äôs not just another coin, it‚Äôs a full experience.
