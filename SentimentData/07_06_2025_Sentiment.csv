Investors traditionally loyal to Ripple (XRP) are beginning to shift their focus to this rising star, drawn by Ruvi AI‚Äôs groundbreaking technology and explosive growth potential. With its unique combination of blockchain and AI, Ruvi AI presents a fresh alternative for those seeking early-stage opportunities. Ripple‚Äôs Appeal and Challenges Ripple (XRP) has long been a major player in the cryptocurrency space, renowned for its focus on cross-border payments. Designed to facilitate fast, low-cost international transactions, Ripple has formed valuable partnerships with banks and financial institutions worldwide. This utility has given XRP strong appeal among institutional and individual investors alike, making it a staple in many crypto portfolios. However, Ripple isn‚Äôt without its drawbacks. The ongoing regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the United States, has created uncertainty around its future trajectory. While its mature ecosystem ensures steady growth, XRP‚Äôs market position as an established player limits its ability to deliver the explosive returns seen in earlier years. As a result, some investors are exploring options like Ruvi AI, which offers the promise of significant upside. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Industry-Disrupting Potential Ruvi AI (RUVI) combines blockchain technology with advanced artificial intelligence to create a platform that addresses real-world challenges. Its ecosystem includes tools for generating text, images, videos, and audio, making it a powerful asset for industries ranging from content creation to marketing and automation. This focus on real-world utility gives it an edge over Ripple‚Äôs primarily transactional model. The $RUVI token plays a central role in the ecosystem, offering benefits such as staking rewards, governance participation, and premium feature access. By leveraging the power of AI, Ruvi AI is not only carving out a unique niche but also redefining expectations for what crypto projects can achieve. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Presale Success The excitement around Ruvi AI is reflected in its highly successful presale. Phase 1, priced at just $0.010 per token, sold out in two weeks, allowing early investors to realize a 50% return when Phase 2 launched at $0.015. The project has already sold over 135 million tokens, with more than 1,400 holders joining its growing community. One of Ruvi AI‚Äôs standout achievements is securing its first exchange listing before the presale has concluded. This is a rare accomplishment in the cryptocurrency industry and underscores the project‚Äôs credibility and preparation. With more announcements expected soon, Ruvi AI is showing no signs of slowing down. Ripple vs. Ruvi AI Ripple and Ruvi AI represent two exciting yet fundamentally different investment opportunities. Ripple‚Äôs established ecosystem provides stability and gradual growth, appealing to investors seeking a degree of security. However, its mature status means the likelihood of dramatic price increases is diminishing. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is an early-stage project with unparalleled potential for exponential growth. It combines innovation and practical applications to solve real-world problems, making it a standout option for investors willing to take risks for higher rewards. With Ruvi AI still in its early phases, the opportunity for significant gains is much more pronounced. Investment Scenarios for Ruvi AI Ruvi AI‚Äôs tiered presale structure offers attractive incentives for investors. Below are examples of potential returns based on a listing price of $0.07 and a projected $1 token price post-listing: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 $RUVI ($750 investment) Bonus : 40% (+20,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 70,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $4,900 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $70,000 VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 $RUVI ($1,500 investment) Bonus : 60% (+60,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 160,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $11,200 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $160,000 VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 $RUVI ($7,500 investment) Bonus : 100% (+500,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 1,000,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $70,000 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $1,000,000 These clear, tiered opportunities highlight the upside potential for those entering early. Why Investors Are Switching to Ruvi AI The cryptocurrency market rewards innovation and adaptability, and Ruvi AI embodies both. Unlike Ripple, which has reached a stage of steady, predictable growth, Ruvi AI is at the beginning of a remarkable trajectory fueled by technology and utility. Investors looking to capitalize on fresh opportunities with exponential potential are increasingly turning their attention to this fast-growing project. With Phase 2 of the presale ongoing at $0.015 per token, the window to secure an early stake is limited. Ruvi AI is shaping up to be one of the most compelling investment opportunities of 2025. Investors ready to diversify their positions and tap into the power of AI-driven blockchain are following the momentum and making the switch.

Prices slid sharply, and red numbers dominated the market. Traders who had been riding the hype found themselves on the losing end. It was a week many will remember for how politics and memes intersected in unexpected ways. Related Reading: $500M Bet On Solana: Education Platform Aims To Supercharge Its Treasury Musk And Trump Clash According to public posts, Elon Musk officially left the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) on Thursday. That move came after he criticized Trump‚Äôs spending bill. He had been co-leading that department since late 2024. Their back-and-forth heated up after Trump said he was ‚Äúvery disappointed‚Äù in Musk. üö®TRUMP: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very disappointed with Elon. I‚Äôve helped him a lot. He knew the inner workings of the bill better than anybody sitting here. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem & he only developed the problem when he found out we‚Äôre going to cut EV mandate‚Äù pic.twitter.com/aeCcmCAODQ ‚Äî DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) June 5, 2025 In response, Musk claimed Trump would not have won the election without his support. Then Trump called Musk ‚ÄúCRAZY‚Äù and threatened to cancel Tesla and SpaceX contracts. Musk fired back on X with, ‚ÄúGo ahead, make my day.‚Äù He even warned he might decommission SpaceX‚Äôs Dragon spacecraft. Musk Mentions Epstein Documents Based on posts on X, Musk also said that files about Jeffrey Epstein‚Äôs case have stayed secret because Trump‚Äôs name appears in them. That claim added another layer to the feud. It wasn‚Äôt just about spending anymore. Now there was an allegation tying the US President to sealed Epstein investigations. Trump replied that he would pull any contracts with Musk‚Äôs companies. Time to drop the really big bomb:@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT! ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 Dogecoin Price Plunge Based on reports, Dogecoin fell about 11% on Thursday alone. Over the past week, it was down 16% from its recent highs. Traders pointed to Musk‚Äôs political exit as a key factor. Many still see Dogecoin as ‚Äúthe people‚Äôs crypto‚Äù because of Musk‚Äôs early support. But without his backing in that government role, sentiment soured quickly. It‚Äôs a coin that has no real asset behind it, so any shift in hype can send prices tumbling. A drop of this size is rare, yet it felt inevitable once the Musk-Trump feud spilled into public view. Tesla Shares Slide Elon Musk‚Äôs companies did not escape the fallout. Tesla stock closed down 13% on Thursday. That tumble came after Trump signaled he would pull federal contracts from any company owned by Musk. Investors feared lost revenue and stiffer regulatory oversight. Tesla shares had been riding high this year, but angry tweets from Trump were enough to shake confidence. Even a short phrase on X can move markets‚Äîespecially when it involves a figure as polarizing as Trump or Musk.

According to Coinglass data, total liquidations reached $982 million in a single day. Of that, long liquidations‚Äîbets on rising prices‚Äîtotaled $881 million. Short positions, or bets expecting prices to fall, saw losses of $100 million. That level of liquidation is striking, and it showed how quickly nerves can fray when big personalities clash. Bitcoin and many altcoins slid alongside Dogecoin, creating a chain reaction of forced sell-offs.

According to a New York Times report , the Missouri Republican Senator is saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to the upcoming GENIUS Act. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a huge giveaway to Big Tech. It allows these tech companies to issue stablecoins without any kind of controls. I don‚Äôt see why we would do that.‚Äù According to the Times report, the GENIUS Act could potentially upend the credit card industry and benefit both Trump and Musk, who are currently publicly feuding . Hawley is pushing for amendments to the bill that would curtail Big Tech‚Äôs involvement. GENIUS is an acronym meaning ‚ÄúGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins‚Äù. The bill purports to seek to improve consumer protection, transparency, marketing restrictions and regulatory oversight for the burgeoning stablecoin market, estimated to be worth $250 billion.

According to two sources close to the matter, the platform aims to raise funds through a $1 billion initial coin offering (ICO). It is not yet clear how much of Pump.fun‚Äôs revenues will be channeled into the PUMP token through its ‚Äúbuyback-supported benefit structure.‚Äù It is also unclear whether this model will include revenues from the decentralized exchange PumpSwap, which launched earlier this year. The platform did not respond to requests for comment on the matter. Pump.fun‚Äôs daily revenue peaked at over $7 million on Jan. 23. However, that figure has gradually declined to around $1 million per day. The platform has generated a total revenue of around $677 million since its launch in early 2024, making it one of the most profitable startups in the crypto space. ‚ÄúSome details are still subject to change, but the idea is to tie a portion of the platform‚Äôs revenues to a buyback mechanism,‚Äù a source close to the founding team said in a statement.

The ACH could reach a maximum of $0.0965 and an average of $0.0836 by the end of 2028. Alchemy Pay price prediction for 2031 projects a maximum price of $0.2860. Alchemy Pay (ACH) is a cross-functional payment solution making significant strides in bridging the gap between fiat and cryptocurrency payment ecosystems. The platform‚Äôs robust framework enables global consumers to connect with merchants, developers, and institutions worldwide, facilitating transactions across multiple fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. This functionality enhances Alchemy Pay‚Äôs adaptability and positions it as a pivotal player in the financial technology sector. Alchemy Pay‚Äôs inclusion in the decentralized platforms of popular projects like Augur, Cryptokitties, and OpenSea, along with its support for the infrastructure of Kyber and Radar Relay, adds layers of credibility and utility, enhancing its investment appeal. Can Alchemy Pay (ACH) get to $0.1? Will Alchemy Pay hit $1? Let‚Äôs find out in this ACH price prediction for 2025-2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Alchemy Pay Token ACH Price $0.01976 Market Cap $180.05 Million Trading Volume (24-hour) $28.07M Circulating Supply 10 Billion ACH All-time High $0.1975 Aug 06, 2021 All-time Low $0.001338 Jul 20, 2021 24-h High $0.02128 24-h Low $0.01951 Alchemy Pay price prediction: Technical analysis Price Prediction $‚ÄØ0.147431 (612.46%) Price Volatility 9.59% 50-Day SMA $0.026115 14-Day RSI 36.23 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 57 (Greed) Green Days 13/30 (43%) 200-Day SMA $0.024616 Alchemy Pay price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: ACH/USD shows a bearish trend after dropping from $0.0850 Short-term recovery possible to $0.02286-$0.0300 if resistance breaks Sustained uptrend needs momentum indicators and volume improvement ACH/USD 1-day chart ACH/USD 1-day chart The ACH/USD 1-day chart on June 6 shows a volatile pattern with a recent sharp spike around early 2025, peaking near $0.0850, followed by a steep decline to around $0.0200. The price is currently consolidating between $0.0200 and $0.0243, with Bollinger Bands tightening, suggesting reduced volatility and a potential breakout. The RSI at 31.54 indicates oversold conditions, hinting at a possible short-term rebound. However, the overall trend remains bearish unless the price breaks above the 20-day SMA ($0.02686). I expect a cautious recovery towards $0.0300 in the near term, but a sustained uptrend requires breaking key resistance levels around $0.0350. Watch for increased volume and RSI improvement. Alchemy Pay 4-hour price chart ACH/USD 4-hour chart The ACH/USD 4-hour chart shows a sharp decline from a peak near $0.0850 in early 2025, now trading at $0.01976, down 2.18%. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, indicating low volatility and a potential breakout. The MACD is bearish (-0.00045), but the histogram shows slight convergence, hinting at weakening downward momentum. The Balance of Power at -0.58 suggests sellers still dominate, but the price is near a support level around $0.01949. I expect a short-term consolidation between $0.01949 and $0.02153, with a possible bounce to $0.02286 if buying pressure increases. A break below $0.01949 could push it towards $0.01500. Watch MACD for trend shifts.

The 1-day chart shows oversold conditions (RSI 31.54) and consolidation between $0.0200-$0.0243, suggesting a potential rebound to $0.0300 if resistance at $0.02686 breaks. The 4-hour chart confirms low volatility (narrow Bollinger Bands) and a possible bounce to 0.02286, but a bearish MACD (-0.00045) and Balance of Power (-0.58) indicate seller dominance. Overall, ACH may see short-term recovery to $0.02286-$0.0300, but a sustained uptrend requires breaking key resistances and improved momentum indicators. Monitor volume and MACD. Is Alchemy Pay a good investment? Alchemy Pay (ACH) shows mixed signals as an investment. While the current bearish trend and volatility indicate short-term challenges, the solid market capitalization and consistent support levels suggest long-term potential. However, risk-averse investors may prefer to wait for clearer bullish signs or reduced volatility before considering investing in ACH. Will ACH recover? ACH may recover if bulls regain control and maintain support above critical levels. While the current outlook remains bearish, a breakout above short-term resistance levels and consistent buying activity could reverse the negative momentum and lead to a potential recovery in the market. Will ACH reach $0.05? ACH is expected to trade above the $0.05 range throughout 2027, suggesting potential for significant price appreciation compared to earlier years. Will ACH reach $0.1? The price forecasts indicate that ACH could reach a maximum of $0.1404 by 2029. Given the bullish scenario and the projected positive market sentiment and growth trend. Will ACH reach $1? The predictions for 2034 show an ACH maximum price of $1. While this indicates significant growth potential, ACH is likely to reach $1 soon. Does ACH have a good long-term future? Alchemy Pay (ACH) shows a generally positive long-term outlook, with projected steady price growth over the years. By 2030, ACH‚Äôs market cap is expected to increase substantially, indicating a good long-term future with moderate to strong growth potential.

45616455,https://cryptonews.com/?p=368974,1749249378,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/45616455.jpeg,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 6 June ‚Äì Bitcoin, Solana, XRP",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-price-prediction-today-bitcoin-solana-xrp-6-june/,"Crypto price optimism is hitting record highs following Bitcoin‚Äôs recent rally, which saw it hit a new all-time high (ATH) just two weeks prior. At the same time, several top meme coins ‚ÄîPepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin among them‚Äîhave each reached record highs within the last six months. Investor optimism is clearly on the rise, propelling digital asset values higher. Historically, cryptocurrencies backed by robust fundamentals tend to ignite broad market upswings, supported by dedicated communities, institutional interest, and active development teams. In this context, let‚Äôs explore several prominent cryptos that analysts believe could set new all-time highs (ATHs) during the current bullish trend. Bitcoin ($BTC): The World‚Äôs Biggest Crypto Is Likely to Set Many Price ATHs Before New Year Bitcoin ($BTC) needs no introduction. The world‚Äôs biggest crypto recently hit a new price high at $111,814 on May 2 and many believe it could set several new all-time highs on its way to $150K by the end of the year, but these will be contingent on a favourable political climate. See, Bitcoin is crypto‚Äôs flagship coin. This means that anyone who believes in crypto‚Äôs future is likely to want to add some Bitcoin to their portfolio. The $2 trillion market cap digital gold is virtually single handedly holding up crypto‚Äôs $3.38 trillion market. In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin is up 0.3% to trade at $104,292 as it reverses course from a pullback down 6.9% from its ATH. This puts it in spitting distance of setting a new high watermark and even hitting $150,000, but this will need to be helped along by positive macro developments. Recent falling US inflation rates bode well for crypto on the whole, and the possibility of the pro-crypto Trump administration delivering on a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and comprehensive legislation before the year is out could drive Bitcoin to its next big milestone, while simultaneously pulling up the wider industry too. Solana ($SOL): DeFi Titan Riding Institutional Tailwinds Solana ($SOL) continues to distinguish itself within the DeFi ecosystem, lauded for its sophisticated smart contracts, rapid transaction speeds and ultra-low fees. With a current valuation of $81.35 billion, it has cemented itself as a formidable challenger to Ethereum in the DeFi sector. There is mounting chatter that U.S. regulatory authorities may soon approve spot ETFs tied to Solana, following in the footsteps of similar approvals for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Such a development could bolster SOL‚Äôs appeal to institutional investors. President Donald Trump has also floated the idea of including Solana in a proposed U.S. Strategic Crypto Reserve, although acquisition would be through asset seizures rather than direct purchase. Solana recently rebounded after sliding from highs above $250 in January to just over $100 in February. It has since broken above a descending trend channel and now trades at $152.76‚Äîup 1% in the last 24 hours‚Äîmirroring Bitcoin‚Äôs brief correction and rebound. Analysts now anticipate that if SOL breaches resistance at $200 and $250, it could push toward the $300 mark before the summer concludes. Ripple (XRP): Could Ripple‚Äôs Cross-Border Payment Token Reach New Heights? Ripple‚Äôs XRP token remains a key player in bridging blockchain and traditional finance, particularly for international money transfers. Renowned for facilitating fast and affordable cross-border transactions, XRP has gained attention from major global entities like the United Nations, which sees it as a useful tool for compliant and efficient financial systems. A longstanding legal standoff between Ripple and the SEC reached a key moment in 2023, when a court determined that XRP‚Äôs retail transactions do not constitute securities. This verdict brought much-needed clarity and sparked renewed investor interest. Over the past year, XRP has outpaced Bitcoin in growth, posting a 314% gain compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs 46.5% increase. Technical indicators suggest XRP may be approaching a breakout from a bullish flag pattern that has been forming between November and April, a pattern typically indicating upward momentum. If the breakout occurs, XRP could challenge the $3.50 level this summer, potentially surpassing its previous all-time high of $3.40 set on January 7, 2018. SUBBD ($SUBBD): Innovative AI-Creator Crypto in Fixed Price Early-Stage Presale Beyond blue-chip assets, savvy investors are eyeing early-stage projects with high growth potential. Token presales offer a prime opportunity to get in before mainstream adoption. One such promising initiative is SUBBD ($SUBBD) , which seeks to revolutionize the $85 billion creator economy by fusing artificial intelligence with decentralized blockchain infrastructure. The project‚Äôs primary goal is to empower content creators with greater earnings potential, increased control over their work, and reduced reliance on tech giants that typically claim large commission cuts. By facilitating direct interaction between creators and their audiences, SUBBD introduces a more equitable and transparent monetization framework. So far, the project has raised over $615,000 in early funding. The tokens are available in presale at $0.05575 each. Investors gain access to a members-only ecosystem that includes exclusive content, early access features, and various perks. Staking options are also available through the SUBBD platform, offering a fixed annual return of 20%‚Äîa compelling incentive for early backers.

The meme coin is struggling to hold support, with trading volume offering little sign of recovery. Tron (TRX), by contrast, is holding its ground with a strong chart and steady user adoption through dApps. While traders debate technicals and sentiment, Web3 ai is moving forward. It has already raised more than $7.1 million and developed a full suite of AI tools built for crypto users. Each of these tools is powered by $WAI, now priced at just $0.000422 in stage 8, with a confirmed listing price of $0.005242. For investors looking at real returns and working products, $WAI is gathering momentum. DOGE Faces Critical Support as Price Dips Dogecoin (DOGE) is now sitting near a key support area after sliding for 14 straight days. The token is trading close to 0.147, a level it has bounced from several times this year. If DOGE fails to hold this line, analysts say it could quickly fall toward 0.125. There is still a chance for a short-term rebound if the token catches buying interest. The Relative Strength Index is edging toward oversold territory, and a modest uptick in volume suggests some cautious buyers may be stepping in. Dogecoin remains a favorite for traders who enjoy volatility. Its massive online following and regular mention in social media conversations keep it in focus. For those watching closely, this dip could present a speculative entry point. Tron‚Äôs Stability Makes It a Low-Drama Crypto Option TRON (TRX) is getting noticed for being one of the more stable coins during a period of wider market swings. It is trading near the 0.12 level and has shown consistent behavior with relatively minor fluctuations. Analysts point to its high transaction volume and low fees as reasons for continued growth in usage. What sets TRX apart is its actual utility. Unlike projects driven by hype, TRON supports decentralized applications and payment systems that process millions of daily transactions. That gives it a foundation for lasting relevance. Technically, TRX is showing neutral momentum. Still, its steady behavior could attract investors looking for safer positions. If TRX holds its support level and keeps gaining traction, it could challenge resistance around 0.14 in the near future. Web3 ai‚Äôs $WAI May Be the Best Early Entry for Utility-Driven AI Crypto Web3 ai is quietly building one of the most practical AI platforms in crypto. It is not about buzzwords or promises. It is about delivering tools that help crypto traders make faster and better choices. These include real-time portfolio monitoring, predictive tools, scam detection, and arbitrage bots. Every feature in this system depends on one token, $WAI. As more users join the platform, demand for $WAI increases. Currently priced at $0.000422 in stage 8 of its presale, with a listing target of $0.005242, the projected ROI stands at 1303.95 percent. With over $7.1 million already raised, the momentum is clearly there. Web3 ai is building its toolkit to integrate with Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and BNB Chain. It aims to unify scattered data into one platform that delivers clear insights. As crypto matures from hype cycles to real use cases, Web3 ai is positioning itself as a tool for serious users. With pro-level features accessible to regular traders, $WAI may be the token that defines AI utility in 2025. Key Insights Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to show weakness, making short-term traders cautious. Tron (TRX), on the other hand, offers a more stable outlook. But both rely heavily on community sentiment and gradual momentum. Web3 ai is taking a different path. It delivers infrastructure with clear value: tools that help users avoid scams, find trading opportunities, and manage portfolios. Every time someone uses the platform, it drives real demand for $WAI. At a presale price of $0.000422 and a forecast ROI of 1303.95 percent, this is more than just another AI idea. Web3 ai has already built the engine. Now it is just a matter of scale. For investors looking beyond the noise, $WAI might be the most functional AI crypto of the coming year.

However, recent political drama has injected new volatility into the crypto space. The world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency experienced a sharp 5% pullback after a highly publicized clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump unfolded on the social platform X. The dispute, centered around the ‚ÄúBig Beautiful Bill‚Äù criticized by Musk, quickly triggered reactions across financial markets. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure ‚Äì Bearish Target At $142 According to top analyst Darkfost, last night marked the most significant shift in trader behavior on Binance so far in 2025. As the political spat gained attention, traders responded rapidly, viewing the event as a risk-off signal. The fallout was immediate in the derivatives market, where Binance‚Äôs net taker volume plunged from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This dramatic shift marks the largest net taker volume decline of the year, highlighting just how sensitive crypto traders remain to political developments. While Bitcoin holds key levels for now, market participants are watching closely to see if this pullback will deepen or become a launchpad for the next move higher. Bitcoin Rebounds From $100K Support But Faces Resistance Ahead Bitcoin is once again at a pivotal point after rebounding from the $100,000 support level and climbing to the $103,000 range, showing resilience despite recent volatility. The move signals strength among bulls, but the broader market remains cautious as all eyes turn to the $112,000 all-time high. A breakout above that level could ignite a new leg up, but failure to maintain momentum may lead to a deeper correction below current demand levels. Macroeconomic conditions continue to weigh on market sentiment, with rising US bond yields and escalating geopolitical tensions‚Äîparticularly the public clash between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump‚Äîinjecting uncertainty into global risk assets. The reaction was clearly visible in the crypto derivatives market. Top analyst Darkfost reported that the net taker volume on Binance experienced a record shift, plunging from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This marks the largest decline in directional sentiment seen in 2025. The net taker volume reflects the imbalance between aggressive longs and shorts, and such a steep drop points to traders rapidly flipping bearish. This sharp reversal indicates fear-driven positioning. However, should Bitcoin rebound convincingly, it could trigger a cascade of short liquidations, potentially fueling a strong rally toward new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Mirrors Bitcoin 2020 Breakout Setup ‚Äì Historic Run Incoming? Price Action Details: Testing Key Level The 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows a strong rebound after briefly breaking below the $103,600 support level. BTC dipped as low as $101,159 before buyers stepped in aggressively, driving the price back to $103,826 at the time of writing. This bounce came precisely at the 200-period moving average (red line), signaling that bulls are still defending key demand zones despite recent volatility. The recovery candle printed with rising volume, suggesting renewed interest and a potential short-term trend reversal. However, Bitcoin still faces critical resistance ahead, with the 50, 100, and 200 EMAs (green, blue, purple lines) now acting as dynamic resistance between $104,600 and $107,000. A close above these levels would confirm strength and could open the door for a retest of the $109,300 resistance. Related Reading: Solana Analyst Sets $300 Target ‚Äì Can Bulls Sustain A Rally? For now, the price action indicates a high-stakes battle between bulls and bears. If BTC holds above $103,600 and builds momentum, the market could regain confidence and push higher. However, failure to reclaim the moving averages may signal exhaustion and expose the price to another retest of the $100K psychological level.

Qubetics isn‚Äôt just another blockchain project‚Äîit‚Äôs a community-first ecosystem designed for long-term sustainability, offering both governance and rewards to its holders. This strong fundamentals-driven approach is generating buzz among seasoned investors.

The flagship coin teased below $101k in the past 24 hours before rebounding from the support level above $101,500 to trade about $104,543 on Friday, June 7, 2025, during the late North American trading session. Amid the heightened crypto volatility, which caused a significant spike in forced crypto liquidations, the fear of further short-term selloffs remains palpable. Moreover, Bitcoin‚Äôs fear and greed index dropped from over 62 percent, suggesting market greed, to about 45 percent at the time of this writing. What Next for Bitcoin Price? Since recently hitting a new all-time high of around $111,690, BTC price has been trapped in a short term falling trend. The recent rebound in the past 24 hours confirmed that BTC price continues to move in a symmetrical falling channel. From a technical analysis standpoint, the BTC price is at a crucial crossroads, which could either mean further correction or a fresh rally toward a new ATH. From the bullish point of view, BTC price has recorded a golden cross in the daily timeframe between the 50 and 200 Moving Average Simple (SMA). In the four-hour timeframe, the BTC price has been retesting the upper border of the falling channel. With the 4-hour MACD line having crossed the signal line, BTC price may continue with bullish sentiment beyond $106k. From the bearish perspective, the BTC price has not yet formed any solid reversal pattern after being trapped in a falling channel in the past few weeks. As a result, a potential close below the support level around $103,329 will trigger a correction towards the support level around $101,570.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-06 23:28:52

Donald Trump is cashing in on crypto. Over the last nine months, beginning slightly before the election, he has stirred up new ventures, new coins, new noise.

(Photo: Jamel Toppin for Forbes) https://t.co/eJWOWiwM8M pic.twitter.com/XsBFINCpa0 ‚Äî Forbes (@Forbes) June 6, 2025 The media outlet alleges Trump holds $900 million worth of liquid assets, with nearly half of that amount stemming from his crypto pursuits. The article claims Trump profited over $390 million pre-tax from the sale of his affiliated crypto platform World Liberty Financial‚Äôs native tokens. The current sitting president is also reported to have brought in $315 million from his $TRUMP memecoin and $427 million from his memecoin stash. Lastly, Trump is estimated to have up to $60 million worth of World Liberty Financial‚Äôs new stablecoin, USD1. In total, Forbes alleges that Trump has brought in $1.2 billion from his foray into the world of digital assets, with a post-tax estimate of $935 million.

Tron founder Justin Sun was also in attendance as the top holder of $TRUMP, with a wallet listed as Sun having held $18 million worth of $TRUMP coins ahead of the dinner. Sun, who previously invested $75 million in the Trump-affiliated crypto platform World Liberty Financial, has now given $93 million to Trump-oriented crypto ventures. Critics argue that the gala dinner and Trump‚Äôs crypto ventures at large may prove unethical due to foreign influence and bribery concerns. Ethical or not, one thing remains clear: Trump‚Äôs ties to the blockchain sector are extremely profitable.

The deal arrives after Polymarket processed more than US$8 billion in wagers last year, even while blocking U.S. users, and aligns with Elon Musk‚Äôs long-stated belief that crowd forecasts often outshine traditional polls. X-Polymarket alliance brings prediction markets into social media The leading prediction market platform Polymarket has announced a partnership ( https://t.co/JUzBaMx9tL ) with Elon Musk‚Äôs company xAI, which, in addition to AI development, is also behind the social network X.‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/DkE09LB388 ‚Äî Traders Union (@TradersUnion_TU) June 6, 2025 Kalshi Misfire Leaves X Searching for a Prediction-Market Partner X‚Äôs first foray into event-wagering data began‚Äîand ended‚Äîwith Kalshi. Late in May, the regulated U.S. exchange issued a press release trumpeting an alliance with Musk‚Äôs platform. Bloomberg reported that within hours, the notice vanished, and Kalshi confirmed the deal had been ‚Äúrolled back.‚Äù The reversal also hinted at friction between Kalshi‚Äôs strictly regulated model and X‚Äôs global ambitions. Key moments that derailed the initial plan: Kalshi‚Äôs announcement caught industry observers off-guard, coming without the usual social-media fanfare from Musk or X‚Äôs corporate accounts. Compliance hurdles loomed large: Kalshi‚Äôs contracts require Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversight, a framework that would have limited the breadth of markets visible on X. By day‚Äôs end, both companies had scrubbed references to the arrangement, indicating a clean break rather than a delay. Polymarket Steps In: A Better Fit for Elon Musk‚Äôs X Vision Just weeks later, X shifted toward the crypto sphere, naming Polymarket its official prediction-market partner. The shift aligned with Musk‚Äôs preference for decentralized solutions that can scale internationally without traditional brokerage constraints. Unlike Kalshi, Polymarket already runs on blockchain rails and caters largely to non-U.S. bettors, easing many of the jurisdictional headaches that torpedoed the previous attempt. Shayne Coplan, Polymarket‚Äôs chief executive, marked the announcement with an energetic post. Proud to announce @Polymarket ‚Äôs partnership with @X and @xai as their Official Prediction Market Partner. The two top truth seeking apps on the internet are stronger together. Welcome to News 2.0. Stay tuned https://t.co/P6Xd7yKlmt ‚Äî Shayne Coplan (@shayne_coplan) June 6, 2025 The official X account echoed the sentiment hours later. Curiously, Musk himself stayed silent, letting the companies‚Äô statements speak for him, a contrast to his usual hands-on approach but one that showed confidence in the market-driven product. Polymarket Odds, Front-and-Center on X X plans to weave Polymarket probabilities directly into the social feed, turning fast-moving conversations into a live dashboard of crowd sentiment. Instead of leaving for a separate site, users will see a small odds widget pinned beneath trending posts, updating in real time. When a hot topic (e.g. an election, a sports final, or a Federal Reserve rate decision) surges on the timeline, the overlay will surface the latest numbers from the crypto prediction market and link to the full contract on Polymarket for those outside restricted jurisdictions. What users can expect at launch: Compact probability bar appearing under tweets that match an active Polymarket contract. Hover or tap to reveal a short description, current implied odds, and 24-hour movement. One-click handoff to the Polymarket interface for deeper charts (geofenced for U.S. users). Ability to follow a contract, adding real-time alerts to the X notification pane. Grok Turns Raw Numbers Into Readable Insights X will also lean on X‚Äôs AI Grok to decode swings in the market. Grok will scan fresh posts, on-chain trade flows, and historical data to draft one-line summaries to help readers understand why a contract moved without sifting through thousands of comments: ‚ÄúOdds for a June rate hike slipped three points after Powell‚Äôs press conference,‚Äù for instance. Key layers in the explanatory stack: Context ranking: Grok shows the top three driver tweets influencing a contract‚Äôs change. Sentiment link-out: A quick tap opens an AI-generated timeline of relevant discussions and charts. Market health check: Color-coded indicators warn of thin liquidity or whale-sized trades that might skew probabilities. Future expansion: X engineers hint at letting verified experts pin rebuttals or alternative interpretations, adding editorial balance without dulling the data-first approach. X and Polymarket: Rethinking How to Gauge the Market By threading Polymarket‚Äôs live probabilities into every corner of the timeline, X is betting that data-driven foresight will become as habitual as scrolling a feed. If the experiment succeeds, users may soon weigh a politician‚Äôs promise or a company‚Äôs earnings hint against an instantly updated crowd forecast. Yet the stakes run deeper than a slick new widget. X must manage hard regulatory lines and ethical gray zones, proving it can spotlight prediction data without morphing into an unlicensed betting house or amplifying manipulative whale trades. Whether the platform threads that needle will determine if this partnership becomes a fixture of daily discourse or a cautionary tale.

Such an obvious lie. So sad. https://t.co/sOu9vqMVfX ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 As their barbs ricocheted across X and Truth Social in recent days, fresh regulatory and political worries surfaced, draining risk appetite and pushing the DOGE price more than 10% lower to an intraday trough near $0.17. With a jump in 24-hour turnover to about $1.63 billion, that slide has cut Dogecoin‚Äôs market share to 0.83% of total crypto value, its weakest dominance reading in two months. Musk-Trump Feud Saps Meme-Coin Morale The feud mushroomed over just three days. Tensions flared Tuesday when Musk publicly branded Trump‚Äôs signature ‚Äúbig, beautiful‚Äù tax-and-spending package a ‚Äúdisgusting abomination,‚Äù stunning Republican allies. I‚Äôm sorry, but I just can‚Äôt stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it. ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 3, 2025 By Thursday, the billionaire had dredged up years-old GOP warnings from Trump about ballooning deficits, prompting Trump to threaten Musk with losing his lucrative federal contracts for SpaceX and Tesla. Allies on both sides piled in through Friday, amplifying the spat and highlighting how quickly a long-standing alliance (Musk was an Oval Office regular only weeks ago) can curdle when big-ticket legislation is at stake. DOGE Price On-Chain and Market Data Point to Waning Confidence Blockchain analytics show a sharp uptick in coins moving from long-term wallets to exchanges, echoing the bearish narrative in derivatives desks where funding rates have drifted negative. Four-hour Bollinger Bands confirm heightened volatility: the DOGE price kissed the lower band at $0.17 on heavy volume before clawing back toward the midline. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index sank into oversold territory last week and now hovers at 39.7‚Äîa tentative uptick that hints at bargain hunting but falls short of signaling a decisive reversal. Technical Picture: DOGE Price Support Holds but Resistance Looms Technically, Dogecoin continues to build a fragile base on the $0.1670 to $0.1700 horizontal support level after retracing roughly 35 % from its early-May peak. Today‚Äôs rebound left spot at $0.179, yet the token still trades beneath a formidable confluence zone at $0.1797 to $0.1850, which aligns with the Fib 0.618 retracement and a stack of bearish moving averages: a 20-day EMA at $0.2016, 50-day at $0.2069, and 100-day at $0.2011. Unless the DOGE price can close a daily candle above the 20-day EMA, rallies will likely be dismissed as dead-cat bounces rather than a bona fide trend change. Failure to conquer that ceiling would refocus attention on the springboard support. A sustained break below $0.1670 would expose the Fib 0.786 level at $0.1576, with little chart structure until the early-April swing low around $0.13, an air pocket that could see another 30% shaved off the DOGE price if bearish momentum accelerates. What Could Drive Dogecoin‚Äôs Next Move In the immediate term, sentiment headlines may matter as much as candlesticks. A public reconciliation between Musk and Trump, or even a fresh meme-worthy endorsement tweet, could reignite retail appetite and push the DOGE price through $0.1850, opening the way toward $0.20 and the clustered 20 to 100-day EMAs. Conversely, any escalation in the feud, fresh regulatory chatter, or broader risk-off moves in crypto could see sellers test dip-buyers‚Äô patience yet again. For now, Dogecoin sits on a knife-edge: fundamentals lean bearish while momentum oscillators hint at recovery potential. Traders with a short time frame may scalp long positions toward $0.1850, but given the precarious backdrop, tight stops below $0.1700 are essential. Swing traders might instead await a daily close above $0.20 to confirm trend reversal, or look to accumulate only if the DOGE price washes out toward $0.1576, where risk-reward improves dramatically.

Coinbase‚Äôs customers may soon be able to trade PancakeSwap ( CAKE ), the native asset of PancakeSwap, a DEX originally built on the BNB Chain. PancakeSwap has expanded to multiple blockchains and now leads all decentralized exchanges in trading volume, recording $228.03 billion in the past 30 days compared to Uniswap‚Äôs ( UNI ) $95.706 billion, according to DeFi Llama . PancakeSwap also recently set its monthly record with $173 billion in trading volume in May. The roadmap addition, announced on Wednesday, has not boosted CAKE‚Äôs price: The 116th-ranked crypto asset is trading at $2.25 at time of writing and is down more than 7% in the past 24 hours and nearly 11% in the past seven days. Being added to Coinbase‚Äôs listing roadmap means that the top US crypto exchange is considering rolling trading support for the asset in the near future. The roadmap was established in 2022 to increase transparency and reduce the possibility of investors frontrunning new trading support announcements. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has previously said the exchange aims to list as many crypto assets as possible, as long as they meet the company‚Äôs standards.

The most recent 24 hours were marked by Bitcoin losing its hold on the $105,000 price level, crashing until it rebounded at a lower support range around $101,000. However, technical analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs daily candlestick timeframe chart shows that this price level is increasingly under threat, and a formation is currently in place that could lead to a price crash towards $96,000. Bitcoin Head And Shoulders Pattern Forming Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has highlighted what is a textbook head and shoulders formation on the daily chart. This bearish pattern, if completed, would imply a breakdown toward the $96,000 price zone, according to the analyst. Related Reading: Major Bitcoin Price Drop Alert: Crash To $98,000 To Fuel Altcoin Buying Opportunity The setup is clearly defined by a peak (head) around mid-May that is flanked by two lower highs (shoulders) on either side, all sitting atop a slanted neckline that now acts as the last line of support. As of now, Bitcoin is trading just above this neckline, testing its structural integrity. In technical analysis, a clean break below the neckline accompanied by strong volume often activates the measured move from the head‚Äôs peak to the neckline, projected downward. Based on the chart, that drop points directly to $96,054. This puts Bitcoin at risk of a near 8% drawdown from current levels, with little support in between. Aside from this formation, Bitcoin‚Äôs daily RSI is currently around the 50 reading, which is a zone that often triggers reactions. As such, a drop below this midline will confirm a bearish shift in momentum. Bitcoin Price Action Closing On Bearish Mode If Bitcoin does collapse toward the $96,000 level, it would mark a departure from the bullish strength that dominated its price just two weeks ago when it registered a new all-time high at $111,814. Since then, however, Bitcoin has lost subsequent support levels at $110,000, $107,000, and $105,000, which now places the next zone of importance at $103,000. Should Bitcoin fail to hold above that threshold, the pressure would likely shift toward the $101,000 level, which could act as the final buffer before steeper declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Below $100,000 Still Possible: Analysts Issue Downtrend Warnings Interestingly, the neckline level of the inverse head and shoulders pattern highlighted by crypto analyst Titan of Crypto is around the $103,500 price level. Bitcoin broke below this price level in the past 24 hours, but the bulls managed to prevent further losses below $101,700. This has led to the creation of lower lows on the daily timeframe. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $103,250, which means it is back to testing the neckline resistance from below. Its reaction here would determine if it eventually crashes toward $96,000. If sellers take control at this level, it would not only confirm the head and shoulders breakdown but could also lead to a short-term capitulation across other cryptocurrencies.

Sabih Behzad, Deutsche Bank‚Äôs head of digital assets and currencies transformation, explained in an interview that the bank is considering different strategies , including issuing its own token or collaborating on an industry-wide initiative. He added that the bank is also assessing whether to develop its own tokenized deposit solution for payment use. EU-wide standards already exist, US Congress is passing stablecoin legislation, and global banks are examining how these tokens and blockchain technology can improve productivity. Even though some of these projects have had years to gain traction, not many have quite broken through to real-world, mainstream scale. Behzad said they can certainly see the momentum of stablecoins along with a regulatory supportive environment, especially in the US. He noted that banks have a wide variety of options available to engage in the stablecoin industry ‚Äî everything from acting as a reserve manager to issuing their own stablecoin, either alone or in a consortium. Stablecoins‚Äîdigital tokens pegged to currencies like the dollar or euro‚Äîand tokenized deposits both represent money on a blockchain, designed to make payments faster and more cost-effective. Tokenized deposits are usually digital tokens issued by regulated banks, representing claims on bank deposits, essentially reflecting bank account balances on a blockchain. European banks and major players drive stablecoin innovation and adoption According to Bloomberg News, Banco Santander SA is reportedly in the early stages of its plans to launch a stablecoin and offer cryptocurrency access to retail clients via its digital bank. Deutsche Bank‚Äôs asset management arm, DWS Group, has teamed up with Dutch market maker Flow Traders Ltd. and crypto fund manager Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. to create a euro-denominated token. ‚ÄúI see a role for a European stablecoin or collaboration among European banks to develop one, particularly for settlement in a digital economy,‚Äù said ING Groep NV CEO Steven van Rijswijk in a recent interview. However, he noted that the Amsterdam-based lender currently has no public plans to announce. Early client adoption is emerging in payments. JPMorgan Chase & Co. reports that its Kinexys network processes over $2 billion in daily transactions on average, following a tenfold increase in volumes last year. However, this still represents a small fraction of JPMorgan‚Äôs overall daily payment processing of roughly $10 trillion. Last year, Deutsche Bank invested strategically in Partior, a blockchain-based cross-border payments and settlement company. The Frankfurt-based bank is also involved in Project Agor√° , an initiative led by the Bank of International Settlements and various central banks to explore how tokenization can improve wholesale cross-border payments. In 2023, Deutsche Bank partnered with Swiss blockchain firm Taurus to develop digital-asset custody services for institutional clients. Big tech accelerates digital token adoption Growing momentum for United States stablecoin regulation is reportedly pushing major tech firms to explore digital token integration. The ‚ÄúGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act,‚Äù or the GENIUS Act, is a key development encouraging companies to dive deeper into digital assets. The bill seeks to provide a regulatory framework for stablecoins and their issuers in the country but has been met with debate about Big Tech‚Äôs potential participation in the crypto industry. According to The New York Times, Republican Senator Josh Hawley recently said he would vote against the bill in its current form as it would allow tech companies to issue digital currencies that would compete with the dollar. In response, Democrats are reportedly planning to introduce an amendment that would prohibit Big Tech companies from creating their own stablecoins, according to an informed source cited by the NYT. This change would require tech firms operating in the US to rely on existing stablecoin issuers like Tether and Circle.

The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $300 billion and a 24-hour average trading volume of about $18.5 billion, rebounded from a crucial support level of around $2,407 in the past 24 hours to trade about $2,478 on Friday, during the late North American trading session. However, the recent crypto rebound has triggered fears of a potential dead cat bounce. Moreover, the feud between Trump and Musk may continue to divide the crypto market. BlackRock Leads in Ethereum Accumulation According to on-chain data analysis, BlackRock has gradually shifted its focus from Bitcoin to Ether in the past few days. In the past week, BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA recorded a net cash inflow of over $492 million to currently hold about $4.84 billion in cumulative net cash inflow at the time of this writing. The gradual crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum has fueled the narrative of the much-anticipated altseason 2025. Moreover, the ETH/BTC pair has been dropping for the past few years until recently, signaling a major shift by institutional investors to the altcoin market. What Next for ETH Price? Since breaking out of an established falling trendline in the first quarter, the ETh price has been forming a rising trend characterized by higher highs and higher lows in the lower timeframes. The altcoin has, however, been consolidating in a tight range between $2,400 and $2,679 in the past few weeks. From a technical analysis perspective, Ether‚Äôs price is well positioned to rally above $3k if the buyers manage to push the altcoin above $2,679 in the coming weeks. However, a consistent close below $2.4k will signal further short-term bearish sentiment towards $2.2k.",Price Analysis|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-07 00:20:38

The president‚Äôs son said in a post on X on Friday that the company responsible for the Trump meme coin isn‚Äôt moving forward with a digital wallet offering that has caused a fissure with World Liberty Financial, the crypto company owned in part by the Trump family. The dispute‚Äôs heart was a proposed digital wallet called $TRUMP Wallet. It was being produced by a company called Fight Fight Fight LLC, which Bill Zanker, a longtime Trump friend, owns. This wallet was advertised as the home of the widely popular $TRUMP meme coin launched earlier in the year. However, another Trump-affiliated company, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), opposed the development. WLFI, which members of the Trump family partially own, said the wallet had used Trump‚Äôs name without permission. WLFI sent Fight Fight Fight and its tech partner, Magic Eden, a cease-and-desist letter to prevent the wallet from launching, Bloomberg News reported. The issue was revealed in an X post by Eric Trump. He said the wallet is not being pursued, and his family didn‚Äôt sign off on its development. ‚ÄúI run @Trump, and I know nothing about this project! He posted. This public statement went a long way toward putting such rumors to rest that a division had formed within the Trump crypto business network. World Liberty Financial boosts holdings with $TRUMP meme coin With the wallet flap now behind it, World Liberty Financial is pursuing a serious investment in the $TRUMP meme coin, Eric Trump says. He said on X that WLFI intends to purchase a ‚Äúgood amount‚Äù of the token. That‚Äôs changed from competition to partnership, indicating a closer relationship between WLFI and the token‚Äôs creators. Most of the $TRUMP supply, about 80%, is owned by Fight Fight Fight and another Trump-related entity, CIC Digital LLC . Their holdings are worth around $2 billion as of early June, according to CoinMarketCap, the tracking site. Its supporters say the meme coin provides fans with a means to express support for the president and to play a role in the digital economy. Critics say it is a cash cow for Trump insiders. And the demand for the meme coin, although much debated, has been so high that you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find someone close to the Trump orbit who, like the president or not, might be open to a little high-proof sycophancy, who doesn‚Äôt want one. Trump crypto ventures spark political backlash The Trump family‚Äôs increasing stake in crypto has prompted fresh political concerns. Some Democratic lawmakers have alleged that Donald Trump, who calls the shots for the Republicans in the Senate, is employing the crypto vehicle to peddle influence and line his pockets and those of his cronies. They note the family‚Äôs hefty holdings in $TRUMP and their ties to numerous crypto firms. These worries intensified when Trump held a private dinner in April for prominent $TRUMP stockholders at Mar-a-Lago. Critics say this may have crossed the ethical boundary, particularly since Trump is the president. The Trump family disputes all allegations of wrongdoing. Eric and Donald Trump Jr. have insisted that they are simply backing projects that excite their base and represent genuine value in the world of cryptos. The family is, meanwhile, expanding its digital finance footprint.

Optimism price prediction for 2028 suggests the token could reach a maximum value of $12.59. In 2031, OP tokens will range between $34.29 and $39.7, with an average value of $35.49. Optimism‚Äôs (OP) commitment to innovation is highlighted by its support for Layer-3 solutions. These solutions enable the development of decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Layer-2 chains, contributing to the expansive Optimism Superchain. The platform‚Äôs initiatives, including introducing custom gas tokens and Plasma mode aimed at reducing onboarding and operational costs, make it more accessible for new users and developers. As the market closely watches the price movements and growth trajectory of the token, can Optimism reach $10 soon? Let‚Äôs get into the OP price prediction for 2025 ‚Äì 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Optimism Token OP Price $0.595 Market Cap $1.02B Trading Volume $164.14M Circulating Supply 1.71B OP All-time High $4.85 (Mar 06, 2024) All-time Low $0.4005 (Jun 18, 2022) 24-hour High $0.6141 24-hour Low $0.5872 Optimism price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 9.88% 50-Day SMA $0.7486 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 45 (Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $1.1629 Optimism price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: OP/USDT sees small gains but remains bearish. Support at $0.562 is critical. Optimism 1-day price chart: OP remains bearish despite a slight uptick The OP/USDT price analysis for June 7 shows a minimal uptick on the day, although the coin is hovering just above the lower Bollinger Band at $0.562. The MACD remains deeply bearish, with no crossover in sight, reflecting sustained downward momentum and the possibility of a break below the next support. OP remains bearish despite a slight uptick Likewise, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) is flat. If support at $0.562 breaks, further downside is likely. A recovery above the middle Bollinger Band ($0.695) would be needed to suggest a bullish shift. Optimism 4-hour price chart: OP is trading in a tight sideways range The 4-hour chart shows the price trading in a tight sideways range between support at $0.585 and resistance near $0.608. The price remains below the Alligator lines, signaling a persistent bearish trend with no breakout yet. OP is trading in a tight sideways range The Balance of Power, however, reflects a modest shift in control toward buyers, but not aggressively. A breakout above $0.608 could open short-term upside potential, while a breakdown below $0.585 may trigger fresh lows. Optimism technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6390 SELL SMA 5 $0.6765 SELL SMA 10 $0.6979 SELL SMA 21 $0.7346 SELL SMA 50 $0.7486 SELL SMA 100 $0.8025 SELL SMA 200 $1.1629 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7100 SELL EMA 5 $0.7113 SELL EMA 10 $0.7122 SELL EMA 21 $0.7461 SELL EMA 50 $0.8797 SELL EMA 100 $1.1091 SELL EMA 200 $1.3934 SELL What to expect from Optimism? Optimism is in consolidation. If it breaks above $0.608, a short-term move toward $0.626‚Äì0.64 is possible. But if it loses $0.585, the next key support lies around $0.562. For now, a breakout confirmation is needed. Momentum remains weak but slightly improving. Is Optimism a good crypto investment? Optimism (OP) could be a good investment if you believe in Ethereum scaling and the growth of Layer 2 solutions. However, like all crypto, it‚Äôs risky, and its value depends on adoption and market trends. Only invest what you‚Äôre willing to lose! Will OP recover? A recovery is possible, but we fear the overall bearish sentiment makes a short-term rebound unlikely. However, as the market consolidates, we expect reduced volatility, which may lead to a breakout in either direction, depending on market dynamics. Will Optimism reach $10? Yes, Optimism is projected to close up to $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

The crypto market has been further muddled by the entry of meme coins, which sucked in many investors on the promise of growth driven by vibes. However, many investors are realizing that meme coins are simply not a sustainable way to grow wealth in the crypto space. Investors are now focused on projects that offer real prospects for long-term returns. As with any investment, stability has become an important consideration. One project that has caught the attention of investors with this mindset is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . So far, its presale has been a massive success as investors shift their capital into the project based on its focus on long-term utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ‚Äì A True Giant Of Utility Away from the noise and buzz surrounding meme coin, Mutuum Finance has been quietly building a protocol dedicated to maximizing the benefits of DeFi technology. The Mutuum Finance protocol is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol designed to allow lenders to deposit their assets and earn interest. The interest rate for these assets is determined by a pool‚Äôs utilization rate. For instance, when more borrowers take over-collateralized loans from a liquidity pool, the rate of the pool rises. That triggers a wave of new lenders to deposit assets to benefit from the high interest rates. It also causes fewer borrowers to want to join the pool. As a result, the system finds a balance on its own, driven by market forces. The depositors in a pool also receive instant liquidity in the form of mtTokens. These tokens represent the value of the initial deposit in a pool, plus any interest it accrues. For instance, when you deposit DAI in a pool, you receive mtDAI tokens on a 1:1 ratio. Holders of mtTokens are free to sell them on secondary exchanges or use them as collateral on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to benefit from new market opportunities as they arise. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Tokens Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the native token of the protocol. Its success is closely tied to the success of the protocol in the long term. It will also serve as an important gauge of how well the protocol is doing for new entrants. The total supply of MUTM tokens is 4,000,000,000 tokens. The planned listing price for the token is $0.06. However, many analysts expect the price to shoot up massively due to the extensive utility offered on its native protocol. To support the long-term value of MUTM, the team will use part of the protocol profits to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market and redistribute them to stakers in the safety module. This action will prompt more stakers to join the protocol, deepening its liquidity. Additionally, it will apply upward price pressure on the tokens, giving confidence to more users to join the protocol. Besides buying back tokens on the open market, the team plans to use part of the profits to grow the pools and for marketing purposes. With a Certik audit in hand, the team can confidently apply for an exchange listing on top-tier exchanges, which is expected on the same day as the launch. To test the waters, the team applied for a listing on CoinMarketCap. The CoinMarketCap platform is known to have strict standards for listing new tokens, and the MUTM listing is another signal that this project is more than just hype. Mutuum Finance (MUTM Presale Shatters Its Own Record The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale recently beat its own record. In the current phase 5 of the presale, over 25% of the tokens have already been sold, which represents a new record for the presale. It is much faster than when the price was $0.01 in phase. The tokens are currently selling for $0.03 in phase 5, a 200% increase. A major reason for these has been recent advancements in the roadmap, such as the listing on CoinMarketCap and the Certik audit report. As it achieves more milestones in its roadmap, the presale pace is expected to be even faster. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67% to $0.035, which makes phase 5 the last opportunity for a 100% Roi based on the $0.06 listing price. By focusing on the fundamentals, such as utility, adopting strategies, and long-term growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has identified an often overlooked niche in the crypto market. Its unique approach to the crypto sector has earned it a massive following of over 20k across its social media channels. With such a massive support base, coupled with the utility it offers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could experience explosive growth like never before in the crypto world. For the lucky ones to come across it in the current presale, they have an opportunity to ride this growth to the top at the low entry point of $0.03.

The firm offers institutional clients Bitcoin and Ethereum custody and trading services through Fidelity Digital Assets. It has also explored blockchain applications in settlement and tokenized securities‚Äîefforts that underline its long-term commitment to bridging traditional and digital finance. While there is no official confirmation, a representative of Fidelity recently said that the firm‚Äôs digital asset arm was experimenting with a stablecoin. However, it did not have immediate plans to launch one. The arrival of Fidelity into stablecoins will likely bring more trust, attention, and skills to the stablecoin‚ÄÇecosystem. However, it could also invite tougher scrutiny from regulators and raise concerns about fairness or the likelihood that a handful of large‚ÄÇplayers could dominate the market . Some people believe Fidelity‚Äôs new stablecoin will help provide safer, more reliable digital payment options. However, critics say it could create problems with oversight, limit competition, and concentrate too much power in the hands of a few large firms. How does Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin help innovation? Reports indicate that Fidelity has a pilot program for a stablecoin backed by the US dollar to make faster, cheaper, and more efficient payments and settlements than traditional methods. The company wants to build a bridge between old and new finance, and its investment shows that trusted, well-established financial institutions see stablecoins as a serious and credible part of the future financial system. Some crypto experts suggest Fidelity‚Äôs move will push banks, payment providers, and fintech companies to adopt blockchain technology faster and improve their services due to the growing competition. Blockchain experts also pointed out the success of Fidelity‚Äôs early pilot programs, saying the trials show promising results that could fuel optimism among other big players and make digital financial systems more accessible for everyone. What risks come with Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin? Some critics say unclear rules for digital currencies make it hard for investors, companies, and regulators to know what‚Äôs fair or how to keep the market safe. Others, though, fear that large firms like Fidelity will crowd out small start-ups and prevent these new and innovative businesses from getting a fair shot at competition and that the end result will be less fresh ideas and new competition. Some people fear that if just a handful of big companies dominate most stablecoins, it could risk the entire financial system if any one of them encounters trouble. They also worry about whether these companies will be truthful when they claim to manage their reserves responsibly and to keep users safe. Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin initiative is part of a larger trend where many traditional banks and fintech companies actively develop their own stablecoins or explore blockchain technology to improve payment systems and financial services. Those advantages have attracted the attention of political leaders and regulators who agree there is an opportunity for the industry to expand and offer benefits to more people but have also sought to create clear rules to remove the risks associated with these tokens and to shield consumers from potential harm. Some crypto projects are concerned that large finance companies like Fidelity will use their vast amounts of resources to take over a large part of the crypto space and discourage new innovations from startups, which beats the whole purpose of cryptocurrency. As a result, there is a growing push and pull between industry experts who want regulators to create soft laws that will help the crypto industry grow by making it fair for small companies to compete with large firms and those who want strict rules that will protect everyone from the dominance of large financial institutions. What does Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin mean for the future? People and financial firms that have doubts about cryptocurrencies will get a positive perspective about investing in digital currency when they see Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin initiative succeed. Big banks and fintech companies will also be motivated to develop their own stablecoins or develop new blockchain solutions to help make digital finance accessible to a wider audience. We still can‚Äôt ignore the risks involved because it is possible that large firms like Fidelity might try to dominate the crypto market once they see the company succeed. This means they will have more influence on whether they are worthy of joining the crypto space, which would make it difficult for smaller firms to compete. The current laws around cryptocurrency also don‚Äôt fully address the problems big companies bring when they introduce their own coins. This is because these firms must follow heavy compliance requirements and need tight supervision that smaller companies will struggle to keep up with. The success or failure of Fidelity‚Äôs stablecoin will likely shape the future of both traditional finance and the crypto world, influencing how open, fair, and innovative this industry can become.

This price movement reflects increased volatility across the crypto market following a public exchange on social media between US President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Their clash appears to have triggered a wave of risk-off sentiment among traders. In response, the global crypto market cap slipped 4%, falling from over $3.4 trillion yesterday to $3.33 trillion. Meanwhile, the broader market correction has not gone unnoticed in derivatives data. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns: This Bitcoin Bull Cycle Looks Nothing Like 2017 or 2021 Derivative Metrics Reveal Bearish Sentiment Spike According to CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost, the Binance net taker volume, a metric that measures the difference between aggressive longs and shorts, fell dramatically from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours. This signals a sharp pivot in sentiment, as traders rushed to hedge or speculate on downside risk in response to the unfolding news. Darkfost emphasized that this was the largest intraday net taker volume reversal observed on Binance this year. The abrupt shift reflects how quickly sentiment can change when macro-level narratives or influential figures dominate headlines. In this case, the market responded swiftly to perceived uncertainty, leading to a concentration of short positions and significant selling pressure. The situation also led to a notable change in BTC perpetual futures funding rates. Funding on Binance turned negative after briefly trending toward positive territory, dropping from +0.003 to below -0.004. This indicates that short sellers were willing to pay a premium to maintain bearish positions, underscoring rising fear and potentially overextended downside bets. üîîWhen Funding rates turns negative. üîπ Buying or considering a long position is often wise when funding rates turn highly negative, especially if the price starts to trend upward.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets , such as the US dollar. They provide the advantages of blockchain but without the volatility that has plagued more traditional crypto tokens like Bitcoin. These discussions are occurring as demand increases for faster, cheaper cross-border payments. The positives are also obvious for tech companies like Airbnb, which are globally reachable. Accepting stablecoins could also avert steep fees charged by credit card networks such as Visa and Mastercard. An Airbnb spokesperson said that the company is ‚Äúalways looking at all aspects of payments‚Äù for improving user experience , but it is also looking into digital assets. According to previous reports, X has reportedly expressed an interest in adding stablecoin payments to its upcoming payments product, X Money. According to sources, Elon Musk‚Äôs team has been in touch with crypto companies, and the company is in talks with Stripe about integration. The aim is to realize Musk‚Äôs ideal of an ‚Äú everything app ‚Äù that blends social media, payments, and commerce. Apple is also keen on stablecoin functionality through its Apple Pay infrastructure. Sources hint the tech firm has been in talks with Circle, the minters of the hugely popular USDC stablecoin, since early this year. Google was interested, too, it was reported. Rich Widmann, who leads Web3 strategy at Google Cloud, has called stablecoins ‚Äúone of the biggest upgrades to payments since‚ÄÇthe SWIFT network.‚Äù Stripe bets on stablecoins with bold acquisition Stripe, one of the world‚Äôs largest payment processors, has made a bold bet. It recently purchased Bridge, a stablecoin infrastructure startup with funding from vendor capital firm Haun Ventures. Bridge has been working on tools to enable businesses to implement stablecoin payments quickly and securely. Stripe‚Äôs purchase of Bridge was interpreted as a sign that stablecoins have turned the corner in Silicon Valley. The deal also gave Stripe a technical advantage ‚Äî Bridge‚Äôs infrastructure will be used to assist Stripe in making it possible for accounts and payments to be made in a stablecoin, which is important for global freelancers and marketplaces. Visa has followed suit by rolling out pilots for issuing stablecoin-linked cards with Bridge in April 2025. The sources say Airbnb is discussing with one of its existing payment partners the incorporation of one of the popular stablecoins to facilitate easy payment processes. Worldpay recently disclosed that it would facilitate stablecoin payouts by partnering with BNVK, a crypto infrastructure provider. Trump administration eases crypto regulations In the United States, legislators are considering two bills to regulate stablecoins. The most high-profile, known as the GENIUS Act , details consumer protections, reserve requirements, and oversight mechanisms for issuers of digital dollars. Big Tech was hesitant about crypto in part because of scrutiny under the Biden administration. But the political winds are shifting. The second term of Donald Trump has injected vitality into the realm of blockchain. His administration has pursued a more hands-off approach, pushing agencies to roll back rules and embrace crypto innovation. This policy change has reawakened some dormant dreams. Two years after regulatory opposition forced Meta to mothball its Diem stablecoin project, the parent company reconsidered its views on crypto payments. Uber‚Äôs chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, said recently that the ride-hailing company is examining the use of stablecoins for its global transfers. Uber‚Äôs interest is further evidence of a broader trend circulating throughout tech circles, not just a niche idea. For now, the tone is most cautious among most firms, including Google and Airbnb. They are not promising instant launches. However, their research, alliances, and internal experiments indicate that they are gaining confidence in the future for stablecoins.

Gemini is seeking to go public through an IPO. Gemini had submitted a confidential draft registration statement on SEC Form S-1, which would permit the company to apply for an IPO without revealing sensitive information to the public. The filing has been motioned amid renewed investor confidence as trade war fears have receded. The number of shares to be offered and the price range have not yet been determined. No date was given or when the IPO might take place. Winklevoss twins drive Gemini‚Äôs ambitious growth Gemini was founded in 2014 by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. In November 2021, it announced a fundraising of $400 million at a valuation of $7.1 billion. Around November 2022, Gemini‚ÄÇwas said to have approximately 1,000 employees, though it laid off some employees during the crypto winter. In January 2023, Gemini conflicted with the SEC over the exchange‚Äôs ‚ÄúEarn‚Äù program, through which the agency claimed unregistered securities sales . The Winklevoss twins were notable supporters of US President Donald‚ÄÇTrump‚Äôs election campaign and donated $1 million. But the money was returned after they surpassed what people could give. The battle for IPO is already heating up following Circle‚Äôs successful IPO on June 5 and the soaring stock price of Coreweave after the company went public in March. Circle‚Äôs IPO encourages other crypto firms to follow the lead Circle has encouraged other large crypto firms, such as Gemini, to go public as the industry reaps the benefit of President Donald Trump‚Äôs embrace of the sector. Earlier, Circle had priced its shares at $ 31 on Wednesday, June 4. Reflecting strong investor demand, they opened trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, June 5, at $69 and closed at $83.23. That trajectory will likely be an encouraging sign for other crypto companies looking to make stock market debuts. Circle is the first big crypto company to go public since the crypto exchange Coinbase was listed on Nasdaq in 2021. Analysts anticipate that more crypto companies will apply for an IPO Analysts had identified crypto exchanges Kraken and Gemini as potential IPO candidates in the digital asset sector. Interestingly, their prediction came true with Gemini‚Äôs IPO announcement. The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An example of the analysts include Jacob Zuller, an analyst at Third Bridge, who stated that it would not be shocking if more crypto companies did the same as Circle . Based on his argument, the public markets realize that crypto is here to stay. Dan Dolev, a Wall Street analyst at Mizuho Securities, is another pundit who voiced his opinion. According to Dolev, Circle‚Äôs IPO success shows pent-up demand for crypto and other fintech companies in the public markets. Based on his argument, if IPOs are doing well, it is a good indicator. Lynn Martin, the President of NYSE Group, added that Circle‚Äôs IPO is a good sign for crypto listings and IPOs. She explained that she viewed the Circle IPO as a key indicator for this year‚Äôs IPO market beyond just crypto listings. Circle issues USDC, a stablecoin linked to the US dollar, and it aims to keep its value steady. Crypto traders employ stablecoins to shift money among tokens swiftly, and advocates say they could be used to send or receive payments instantly. In an interview, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire highlighted that from the beginning, they strongly believed that they could create a new system for money using the internet, which, according to them, could change how money is used.

At the same time, new projects like Qubetics are rapidly gaining momentum through strategic presale initiatives and ambitious tech goals. In this piece, examine Pi‚Äôs projected performance for 2026, outlining potential monthly movements and critical price triggers. Also, explore how Qubetics , with its promising token economics and presale success, is positioning itself as a high-growth alternative. Month-by-Month Pi Price Expectations for 2026 January: Slow Momentum to Start the Year The year may begin on a measured note, with Pi likely trading between $0.51 and $0.61. The estimated average price for the month stands at $0.54, suggesting modest gains and a period of consolidation following year-end volatility. February: Growth Picks Up February may bring stronger gains, with Pi potentially climbing to $0.89. The average for the month is forecasted at around $0.68, marking a significant improvement as the network stabilises and interest builds. March: The Breakout Month According to projections, March could be a game-changer. Pi might hit a high of $1.78, with a robust average of $1.40. This dramatic uptick may be spurred by major ecosystem announcements, increased institutional engagement, or successful implementation of key features on the network. April and May: Holding the Gains Pi‚Äôs upward momentum is expected to continue through spring. In April, prices could hover between $1.10 and $1.54, averaging around $1.30. May may offer an average close to $1.44, suggesting ongoing investor confidence and steady user growth. June and July: Slight Cooling Off Mid-year projections show potential corrections. June could see a dip to between $1.08 and $1.42, with July averaging near $1.13. This phase may reflect typical investor rebalancing after strong Q1 and Q2 performance. August to October: Choppier Waters Ahead These months may be marked by greater price swings. Forecasts suggest prices may fluctuate from $0.87 to $1.17, with some months averaging below the $1 mark. Volatility could arise from broader market conditions or shifts in community sentiment. November and December: Finding Stability Toward the end of the year, Pi‚Äôs price is projected to stabilize again, likely trading between $1.08 and $1.19 and averaging around $1.14. This return to steadier pricing could indicate improved long-term investor confidence and maturing market fundamentals. Qubetics Presale: A Rising Star Worth Watching While Pi Network advances towards 2026, Qubetics is quickly establishing itself as one of the most talked-about presale projects in the market. Currently in Stage 37 of its crypto presale , Qubetics has already raised over $17.7 million and distributed more than 515 million $TICS tokens to upwards of 27,500 holders. The token is priced at $0.3370 in this phase, making it a potentially lucrative entry point for early backers. The Qubetics ecosystem, built around asset tokenisation and zero-gas transactions, is drawing keen interest from both retail and institutional participants. Token price: $0.3370; only 10M left Listing price set at $0.40 = 20% ROI for current buyers Total supply cut to 1.36B to increase scarcity 38.55% tokens allocated to public‚Äîenhancing decentralization High analyst confidence in strong post-listing performance These figures highlight Qubetics as one of the most promising contenders in the crypto presale arena, especially for those seeking explosive growth potential. Final Thoughts: A Year of Strategic Moves The outlook for Pi Network in 2026 shows strong potential, especially in March, where a significant rally could take shape. Meanwhile, investors should remain aware of the likely ebbs and flows across the rest of the year as the network matures. On the other hand, Qubetics presents a parallel opportunity‚Äîa dynamic presale-driven project with a bold roadmap and substantial ROI projections. Together, these two projects represent different strategies in the evolving blockchain world: one built on accessibility and scale, the other on innovation and early-stage investment potential. For those looking to diversify their crypto exposure in 2026, keeping a close watch on Pi Network‚Äôs developments and securing a stake in Qubetics before its presale concludes could offer a well-balanced approach.

Bitcoin Funding Rates Turn Negative On Binance According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, BTC funding rates on Binance have once again turned negative, even as the top cryptocurrency continues to trade above the $100,000 mark at the time of writing. Related Reading: Bitcoin Upward Momentum ‚ÄòHighly Likely‚Äô To Continue, On-Chain Data Shows The analyst attributed the sudden reversal in funding ‚Äì from +0.003 to -0.004 ‚Äì to the public spat between Trump and Musk on social media. This rapid shift reflects growing fear among market participants amid heightened uncertainty. Following the sentiment shift, BTC fell from the mid-$100,000 range to a low of $100,984, according to CoinGecko. Over the past two weeks, the asset has declined by 4.1%. That said, the current dip may offer a prime buying opportunity to investors. If Bitcoin rebounds strongly, it could result in a strong resurgence in buying pressure, leading to a short squeeze that may propel BTC‚Äôs price further up. Darkfost highlighted that there have been three instances during the current market cycle when BTC witnessed such deep negative funding. Notably, each of these instances were followed by a strong upward move in the cryptocurrency. For example, on October 16, 2023, BTC dipped into negative funding territory before rallying from $28,000 to $73,000. A similar pattern played out on September 9, 2024, when the asset surged from $57,000 to $108,000. The most recent case was on May 2, 2025, when BTC jumped from $97,000 to a new all-time high (ATH) of $111,000. If history repeats, then the market may see a new ATH for BTC in the coming weeks. Darkfost noted: Such extreme readings often mark moments of maximum pessimism, precisely the kind of sentiment that can precede a strong bullish reversal when the short term negativity is gone. Large Investors Increase BTC Exposure Meanwhile, Bitcoin whales ‚Äì wallets holding large amounts of BTC ‚Äì continue to accumulate at a rapid pace. Notably, new whales have acquired BTC worth $63 billion, reflecting strong confidence in the asset‚Äôs near-term prospects. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Indicating Prime Buying Opportunity, Analyst Says Supporting this bullish outlook, recent analysis by QCR Capital indicates that large investors expect BTC to surge to as high as $130,000 by the end of Q3 2025. Additionally, the realized cap held by long-term holders has surpassed $20 billion, reinforcing positive sentiment. That said, some analysts urge caution, expecting BTC to crash below $100,000 before resuming its bullish momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $104,069, down 0.5% in the past 24 hours.

Unlike traditional organizations where decisions come from a centralized leader or board, DAOs allow members to participate directly in decision-making through voting. This makes the whole process more transparent, democratic and community-driven. However, simply having a voting system is not enough for DAOs to thrive. They need efficient ways to manage their finances and keep their members actively engaged. This is where DeFi (decentralized finance) plays a vital role. DeFi provides automated financial tools that help DAOs manage their funds and incentivize participation, enabling them to operate more effectively and grow sustainably. In this article, we‚Äôll explore how DeFi supports DAOs today, the challenges they face and the exciting innovations that lie ahead. What is a DAO really At its essence, a DAO is an organization that‚Äôs governed by rules encoded as software on a blockchain. Token holders get voting rights and help shape the organization‚Äôs direction, whether that‚Äôs deciding how money is spent, what projects to fund or what upgrades to make. This system replaces trust in individuals with trust in transparent, auditable code, making it ideal for communities that span the globe and want a fair voice in governance. Why managing the treasury well is crucial The treasury is essentially the DAO‚Äôs bank account. It funds everything from development to community rewards, so managing it wisely is critical. Poor treasury management can stall projects or erode trust. Traditionally, organizations rely on manual processes and trust individuals to handle funds, which can be slow and risky. DeFi changes this by automating many financial operations. DAOs can deposit funds into DeFi protocols to earn yield through lending, liquidity provision or staking. Spending decisions can be automatically executed by smart contracts once approved by a vote, speeding up processes and reducing human error. Since transactions are recorded on the blockchain, members can track exactly how funds move, improving transparency. How tokenomics encourages participation One of the biggest challenges DAOs face is low voter turnout. Without enough active voices, decisions risk not reflecting the broader community. DeFi offers creative tokenomics tools to boost engagement. Governance tokens ‚Äì Holders get voting rights and may earn rewards like staking yields or protocol fees. Bonding ‚Äì Some DAOs use bonding, where members lock up assets to buy discounted tokens that vest over time. This encourages long-term involvement and liquidity for the treasury. Gasless and off-chain voting ‚Äì Platforms like Snapshot allow members to vote without paying blockchain fees, lowering barriers. Reputation systems ‚Äì DAOs can reward meaningful participation with reputation points or badges, giving more weight to experienced members. Transparency and security are key Trust is the foundation of any DAO. DeFi enhances trust by making every governance vote and treasury transaction publicly visible on the blockchain. However, DeFi carries risks, including smart contract bugs and hacks. To protect themselves, DAOs adopt several measures. Decentralized insurance platforms like Nexus Mutual provide coverage against smart contract failures. Regular third-party security audits help identify vulnerabilities. Decentralized oracles such as Chainlink supply reliable data feeds, crucial for governance and treasury operations. Expanding horizons with cross-chain DAOs While Ethereum remains the main hub for DAOs and DeFi, other blockchains have grown in popularity. Some DAOs now operate across multiple blockchains using interoperability solutions like Polkadot and Cosmos. This offers advantages such as the following. Diversifying treasury assets to reduce risk. Including members from various blockchain communities. Increasing resilience by not relying on a single network. Layer-two solutions make governance affordable High gas fees on Ethereum once made it expensive for small holders to vote or participate. Layer-two solutions, such as Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism, solve this by offering faster, cheaper transactions. Examples of DeFi-enabled DAOs Uniswap DAO ‚Äì Uses UNI tokens for governance. Their treasury invests in DeFi yield strategies to fund ecosystem growth. MakerDAO ‚Äì Manages the DAI stablecoin with MKR holders voting on risk parameters. Automated liquidations keep the system stable. Aave DAO ‚Äì Governs a lending platform. AAVE token holders vote on upgrades and risk management. The treasury supports grants and incentives. These real-world examples show how DeFi protocols enable decentralized governance at scale. Challenges to overcome Despite progress, DAOs face several challenges. Low participation can lead to less representative decisions. Smart contract bugs carry risks. Legal frameworks around DAOs remain uncertain. Addressing these will be crucial for the ecosystem‚Äôs growth. DAOs and their social impact DAOs are changing how communities come together beyond finance. Pooling funds transparently for charities and public goods. Running media platforms owned and governed by users. Funding scientific research with decentralized grants. These social uses highlight DAOs‚Äô potential far beyond money. What the future holds ‚Äì AI and DeFi Looking ahead, AI could help DAOs do the following. Predict market trends for better treasury management. Suggest governance proposals based on data. Gauge community sentiment to boost engagement. Together with DeFi, AI can make DAOs smarter and more responsive. Conclusion DeFi is more than just financial tools ‚Äì it‚Äôs reshaping how groups organize, govern and collaborate. By automating money management, rewarding participation and increasing transparency, DeFi strengthens DAOs and helps them grow. With advances in cross-chain tech, layer-two scaling and AI on the horizon, DAOs are poised for even greater impact. For anyone curious about the future of organizations, understanding DeFi-powered DAOs is a must.

The analyst argues that Bitcoin is displaying unprecedented structural patterns on its macro chart that suggest a powerful breakout, leading some market watchers to reconsider long-term forecasts that were once dismissed. Market watchers who once dismissed predictions of a $90,000 Bitcoin are now reconsidering long-term forecasts that include the possibility of reaching $1 million. These projections are grounded in historical trends, market sentiment, and current macroeconomic conditions.

The U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, beating the forecast of 125,000, which suggests the economy remains resilient and gives the Federal Reserve less reason to ease monetary policy. Despite that, former President Donald Trump continued his push for looser policy. Shifting focus from Elon Musk to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump called for a full 1% rate cut , which he claimed would act as ‚Äúrocket fuel‚Äù for the economy.

That‚Äôs a dramatic leap from its original 21,000 BTC target. To fund the expansion, the firm will issue up to 555 million new shares, raising $5.4 billion , according to CEO Simon Gerovich.

The company‚Äôs stretch goal? Holding 210,000 BTC by 2027, equivalent to 1% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply. Such long-term commitment could significantly tighten supply and increase institutional FOMO, fueling upward pressure on BTC prices. Bitcoin Chart Eyes Breakout; Institutions Show Up Bitcoin‚Äôs recent bounce from $100,519 has formed higher lows and is now approaching a key descending trendline. BTC sits just above the 50-period EMA on the 2-hour chart, with the MACD showing a bullish crossover, a sign that momentum is building. Bitcoin Price Chart ‚Äì Source: Tradingview The key resistance range lies between $105,000 and $106,300, where horizontal resistance intersects with the trendline. Bitcoin price prediction may turn bullish upon a breakout above this level; the next upside target is $107,600. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor has also returned to the buying table. His firm is launching a $1 billion stock offering to expand its Bitcoin holdings, following an initial raise of four times its target of $250 million. With BTC near $104K, that capital could translate to nearly 9,600 BTC. Trade Idea: Entry: Above $105,200 Target: $106,750‚Äì$107,600 Stop-Loss: $103,900 Confirmation: Watch for bullish engulfing candles or a break of the trendline If this level gives way, it could mark the start of Bitcoin‚Äôs next leg higher, powered not just by hype, but by institutions and nations placing large bets.

BlockDAG‚Äôs presale is delivering both. Its newest feature, Buyer Battles, is a live leaderboard that showcases top-contributing countries in real time. This dynamic format has brought serious energy to the presale. With more than $289 million collected and over 22 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is proving that interactive features can boost traction. Buyers now get a limited-time price of $0.0018, frozen until June 13, while Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262. That‚Äôs a built-in gain of 2,520% for early participants, and things are only heating up. Buyer Battles Feature Fires Up Global Race Buyer Battles isn‚Äôt just eye-catching, it‚Äôs effective. The leaderboard updates live, showing which buyers and regions are leading the charge. This simple change has transformed passive buying into a contest. Every shift on the board pushes more users into action. The format taps into a sense of urgency and visibility, driving participation through healthy competition. With BlockDAG closing in on a $300 million mark, this feature is proving to be a strong driver of engagement. It isn‚Äôt just another presale, it‚Äôs a presale that feels alive. BlockDAG Blends Strategy, Scale, and Speculation BlockDAG‚Äôs explosive growth to $289 million is backed by more than just interest. Its real-time leaderboard, rolled out recently, has helped push daily contributions higher. The combination of social involvement and timely pricing is attracting attention across the board. Batch 28 sits at $0.0262, but the spotlight is now on the frozen $0.0018 price, which is locked in until June 13. This early-entry rate offers a 2,678% gain against the $0.05 launch price, making it hard to ignore. Buyer Battles has boosted community involvement, driving more traffic to the platform and keeping the presale momentum strong. Community Strength Meets Tech-Driven Utility BlockDAG‚Äôs rise isn‚Äôt just hype-driven, it‚Äôs rooted in active user engagement and functional design. The Buyer Battles format has reshaped buying into a public event where users see their impact in real time. At the same time, BlockDAG stands out technically. It combines DAG scalability with Proof-of-Work security and offers EVM compatibility, allowing Ethereum-based apps to run seamlessly. While this positions the project for strong post-launch performance, the presale has already become a major highlight. With a growing user base and clear progress, BlockDAG is staking its claim as the best crypto for the future. Bottom Line BlockDAG‚Äôs Buyer Battles are turning every leaderboard refresh into a motivator. With more than $289 million raised and over 22 billion coins purchased, the $0.0018 price is grabbing attention before the June 13 update. The presale is working not just because of smart pricing, but because of the intense, community-driven energy around it. It‚Äôs not just another coin, it‚Äôs a full experience. That‚Äôs what puts BlockDAG at the forefront of the best crypto for the future discussion, and why it may soon set the bar for how presales work.

In his latest video, the British analyst warned that ‚Äúthe most dense liquidity I‚Äôve seen in a long time for XRP‚Äù still sits uncollected beneath current spot prices. Until that pool is swept, he argues, the market will not unlock the upside move he ultimately expects to carry the token into double-digit territory. XRP Needs One Last Flush ‚ÄúXRP didn‚Äôt come down as low as we wanted,‚Äù he told viewers. ‚ÄúIt did hit the first key area of liquidity, but it didn‚Äôt take it all.

Only after that ‚Äúfinal flush,‚Äù he contends, can a rally toward $10 begin in earnest. The call comes amid broader cross-asset strength that has so far failed to translate into a sustained altcoin breakout. Silver is challenging decade-old highs near $36 an ounce, uranium contracts are pressing their recent peaks, and the Nasdaq Composite remains within sight of its all-time high. Yet despite what he calls ‚Äúa broad-based commodities rally,‚Äù the analyst maintains that crypto still needs one more washout to clear residual excess.

Just A Giga Rally To $19, Says Analyst Bitcoin, for its part, has already waded into the analyst‚Äôs preferred liquidity zone just above $100,000. Whether the flagship asset needs another dip, he said, is less important than what happens to its dominance. A brief surge in bitcoin market share toward 65.5% would, in his model, coincide with an XRP capitulation and set the stage for ‚Äúcrazy season,‚Äù his shorthand for a full-blown altcoin cycle. The hinge is XRP liquidity. Viewers were shown heat-map snapshots highlighting concentrated stop-loss orders beneath the May swing low. ‚ÄúPeople came long here after they thought, ‚ÄòOh, the bottom‚Äôs in.‚Äô That‚Äôs added to this liquidity below us,‚Äù he said.

Once the liquidity has been harvested, he foresees a textbook bullish divergence on the daily relative-strength index‚Äî‚Äúlower low on price, higher low on RSI‚Äù‚Äîthat would ignite what he calls the ‚Äúnext big push.‚Äù In that scenario, XRP would not merely revisit its 2021 peak near $3.80; it would overshoot to the analyst‚Äôs long-standing $10 target. ‚ÄúLet it send,‚Äù he concluded.

Although the firm has not clarified its reason for the fundraising, the company‚Äôs actions in the last few weeks raise speculation as to whether a part of the fund will be geared toward more bitcoin (BTC) acquisitions. According to the filing , TMTG intends to raise up to $12 billion by offering its common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights, or units to investors. TMTG to Raise $12B The terms of the offering will be provided in prospectus supplements filed with time. For now, TMTG has clarified that it intends to sell 84.6 million shares of its common stock at a value of $0.0001 each. TMTG will sell 55.8 million shares to institutional investors in a private placement at $25.72 per share for an aggregate amount of approximately $1.44 billion. The company will also offer 28.8 million shares issuable upon conversion of its 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2028 for an aggregate amount of $1 billion. The company noted that it has the flexibility to sell the shares at varying prices through different channels, including underwriters, dealers, and agents. ‚ÄúWe provide more information about how we and the Selling Securityholders may sell the securities in the section entitled ‚ÄòPlan of Distribution.‚Äô We will receive proceeds from the issuance and sale of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights, or units. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Shares by the Selling Securityholders pursuant to this prospectus,‚Äù the firm stated in the prospectus. The $2.5B BTC Purchase Earlier last week, TMTG reportedly disclosed that it was raising $3 billion to buy BTC. About 24 hours later, news emerged that the company had raised approximately $2.5 billion to implement its BTC acquisition plan. The firm raised the funds by selling $1.5 billion in stock and $1 billion in convertible notes priced at a 35% premium. TMTG holds the BTC on its balance sheet, while digital asset platforms Crypto.com and Anchorage Digital provide custody for the assets. TMTG‚Äôs latest BTC purchase and the intensifying wave of Bitcoin adoption in the corporate sector are fueling speculation that the $12 billion raised will be targeted at more BTC acquisitions. It remains to be seen whether this plays out as speculated.

BTC Recovered $5K The business week started on the right foot for BTC, which jumped to $106,500 on a couple of occasions on Monday and Tuesday. However, it saw little success there, and the subsequent rejections pushed it south by about two grand. It jumped once again on Thursday after the ECB cut the interest rates to 2%, but was halted at $106,000. The online spat saga that transpired between the former allies, Elon Musk and Donald Trump, further intensified the sell-off and BTC dumped hard to $100,400 (on Bitstamp). The bulls finally stepped up at this point and prevented another decline. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to recover and jumped to $105,500 in midday trading on Friday. It couldn‚Äôt continue upward and now sits below $105,000, but it‚Äôs still 2% up on the day.

It now trades above $3.25. In contrast, HYPE has marked a slight decline of around 2% and is below $34 as of press time.

The token had entered a phase of tightening price action, hinting at a potential breakout or breakdown. In the times when the broader market sentiments remained uncertain, the current reversal presents a compelling case for the bulls. However, a continued upswing above the key ranges could validate a rise to $3.75 or levels above. Now, the question arises whether the bulls will continue to hold a tight grip over the rally. The token is demonstrating huge strength as it reversed the bearish pattern of H&S, which was speculated to drag the levels below $2.5. With this, the token continues to demonstrate a potential of a 90% upswing that could elevate the levels towards new highs. Meanwhile, in the short term, the bulls appear poised to push the price above $5 as the token is poised to validate a ‚ÄòGolden Cross.‚Äô The rebound from the local support hinted towards the growing dominance of the bulls; moreover, the bullish crossover of the 50/200 MAs validated the bullish claim. The previous Golden cross resulted in a 350% rise, which helped the SUI price to form a new ATH around $5.3 and hence a similar price action is expected. Meanwhile, the MACD shows a drop in selling pressure, being within the bullish range, while the other indicators raise some concerns. The RSI is hovering around 44.83 and is about to rise above the RSI-based MA. If it rises above the range, it could validate a bullish continuation, while the drop in CMF levels points towards bearish continuation, as it hints towards a decrease in the money flow onto the platform. Only if the levels rise back above 0 can a bullish continuation occur. For this, the SUI price is expected to secure the levels above $3.5, which may push the price to $4. Therefore, the SUI price prediction in the long term is bullish, but the short-term forecast remains shady.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|SUI,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-07 05:18:40

Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Gets Military Nod, Senator Predicts Explosive 10-Year Surge Bitcoin found its footing and climbed back to $104,400 by the time this report was filed. According to a recent analysis by crypto researcher Klarch, this pullback was expected and might just be a pit stop before another run to fresh highs. Recurring Cycle Patterns Based on examination by Klarch, Bitcoin tends to follow a familiar path after each halving. One year after the 2016 halving, it rose about 280%. After the 2020 halving, it jumped roughly 550% in 367 days. Right now, Bitcoin has only moved up around 70% in the 416 days since the last halving. Klarch points out that in past cycles, these numbers picked up speed after a slow start. So, he says, there‚Äôs still room for more growth. Bitcoin cycles are identical‚Ä¶ ‚Äì In 2016, $BTC grew by 280%, 365 days after Halving ‚Äì In 2020, $BTC grew by 550%, 367 days after Halving ‚Äì Now, 416 days post-Halving, $BTC +70% ‚Äî growth ahead‚Ä¶ History repeats, here‚Äôs $BTC‚Äôs near futureüßµüëá pic.twitter.com/wshX4egwbC ‚Äî Klarck (@0xklarck) June 5, 2025 These percentages matter because they hint at what might come next. If Bitcoin‚Äôs history repeats, the best gains could be just around the corner. Information from blockchain data supports this too. For example, trading volume and on-chain addresses hit new highs in recent weeks. That fits the pattern Klarch described‚Äîafter the initial rise, there‚Äôs often a bigger rally. Signs Of The Next Surge Bitcoin set a record of $112,100 on January 20, then edged up to $111,980 on May 22. Rather than signaling an end, Klarch believes these milestones mark the start of a higher peak. He sees those moves as part of the cycle‚Äôs build-up, not its climax. Based on his chart work, each cycle has multiple tops before it finally tops out. Klarch didn‚Äôt offer an exact date for a new peak, but he did suggest that Bitcoin has not yet hit its ceiling. He notes that a series of all-time highs usually happens when sentiment is still turning positive. Once more traders feel FOMO, the price often accelerates rapidly. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market‚ÄîData Demand And Liquidity Driving Price Liquidity pouring into the crypto market has been a key talking point. Klarch says that steady buys from institutions and US Bitcoin spot ETFs have made Bitcoin scarcer on exchanges. Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy and other big money players keep buying, which pushes supply lower. Based on figures presented by Klarch, this trend could lift Bitcoin to around $180,000‚Äîa rise of about 75% from current levels. VanEck, an asset manager, has shared a similar target. That makes Klarch‚Äôs outlook feel less like a lone voice. If big funds keep moving in and retail interest stays high, Bitcoin‚Äôs price might stay on the upswing. However, any pause in ETF inflows or a sudden shift in global markets could change that story.

The report claims he made $390 million, before taxes, through the sale of tokens from World Liberty Financial, a crypto platform connected to his brand. He also earned $315 million from the TRUMP memecoin and an additional $427 million from other memecoin assets. On top of that, Trump is believed to hold up to $60 million in World Liberty Financial‚Äôs new stablecoin, USD1. Altogether, his total crypto income is estimated at $1.2 billion, with post-tax profits around $935 million. Private Dinner Raises Eyebrows Trump‚Äôs growing involvement in crypto drew more attention following a private dinner at his golf club near Washington, D.C., on May 22. The event was attended by the top 220 holders of the TRUMP token. Among them was Tron founder Justin Sun, reportedly the largest holder, with $18 million worth of tokens at the time. Sun has also invested $93 million into Trump-linked crypto projects, including $75 million into World Liberty Financial. His presence has sparked concerns about possible foreign influence, especially given Trump‚Äôs ongoing 2024 presidential campaign. Critics Question Ethics, But Profits Speak Loudly The scale of Trump‚Äôs crypto earnings has raised questions around transparency and ethics. Critics warn that large foreign investments in ventures tied to a presidential candidate could present serious risks. Investor and former White House official Anthony Scaramucci highlighted the growing inequality within Trump‚Äôs crypto venture. Citing data from Chainalysis, he noted that 58 wallets have made over $10 million each from the TRUMP memecoin, totaling $1.1 billion in profits, while around 764,000 wallets, mostly held by small investors, are in the red. Scaramucci also pointed to the exclusive nature of Trump‚Äôs May 22 event, which included a private reception and White House tour for the top 25 wallet holders, raising fresh concerns over insider access and favoritism.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-07 05:31:25

The fallout from their broken alliance pushed the price of Tesla down by 14.3%, which was its 11th worst single-day loss since the company went public back in 2010. And while the market was still processing the drama, small-time investors wasted no time grabbing what they saw as a discount. The fight started when Trump, now back in the White House, threatened to cancel all federal contracts tied to Elon‚Äôs companies. That threat came right after the two exchanged attacks on their competing social platforms. The tension blew up after Elon publicly criticized Trump‚Äôs tax-cut bill, which triggered the President‚Äôs warning shot. The once-friendly relationship between the richest man in the world and the most powerful politician on Earth collapsed in full view, and Tesla took the hit. Retail traders poured over $200 million into Tesla on Thursday According to data from Reuters, individual investors dumped $201.3 million into Tesla shares after the price collapsed. They were also responsible for $2.6 billion in trading volume for the stock that day, making it the second-most purchased stock by retail traders. Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research at Vanda Research, said, ‚ÄúTesla has been a favorite holding for this group for a while, so when they see a drop of 14% or more, they jump in and buy.‚Äù Retail buyers didn‚Äôt stop with just the shares. They also pumped money into leveraged ETFs tied to the stock. The Direxion Daily 2x Bull ETF (TSLL.O), which lets traders bet on Tesla going up for bigger returns, took in $41.5 million in net buying that day alone. Even as the stock was tanking, traders were still going long. Over in the options market, things didn‚Äôt look chaotic either. Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group, said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not seeing a huge move in volatility.‚Äù Instead of panic, traders were selling put options, a move that usually shows confidence that the stock won‚Äôt fall much further. A put lets the buyer sell shares at a specific price before a deadline. Selling puts means someone is either fine buying the stock at that price or expects it to hold steady. The options data backed that up. Tesla‚Äôs 30-day implied volatility jumped to 77 on Thursday, the highest in six weeks. But that was still way below the 106.1 level from early April, when the broader market was crashing. By Friday morning, Tesla recovered to $299.14, up 5% from the day before, and the volatility cooled back down to 68. Traders keep buying as Tesla bounces back 5.6% By Friday afternoon, Tesla had gained back some ground, climbing 5.6% and settling around $299. While it‚Äôs unclear exactly how much retail traders fueled the bounce, their presence in the action was obvious. Instead of pulling back, they leaned in. Even as Trump threatened to hit Elon‚Äôs empire financially, and even as the market dipped, traders still treated Tesla like it was on sale. That belief was plastered all over Reddit and X, where Iachini said his models picked up on a massive wave of support. He said users of both sites were still positive on the stock. ‚ÄúBuy the dip is the overwhelming sentiment,‚Äù he explained. And that‚Äôs not new for Tesla. The stock has been a favorite among individual traders for years. It exploded 90% in just six weeks after Trump won the November 5 election. But since hitting a high on December 17, it has fallen 37%. Even with that drop, retail traders are still buying. That loyalty was loud and clear after Thursday‚Äôs drop. No hesitation. Just action.

The transaction was flagged by Whale Alert , with many speculating it could be a strategic transfer by Ripple or a massive whale move. While the destination wallet remains unidentified, the sheer size of the transaction has raised eyebrows, especially as it demonstrates the speed and efficiency of the XRP Ledger. Why This Matters for XRP and Crypto This major transaction isn‚Äôt just about the amount, it highlights XRP‚Äôs core strength. Unlike Bitcoin, which is more about holding value, XRP is built for fast and cheap global transfers. That‚Äôs why banks and financial institutions often lean toward Ripple‚Äôs tech. A transfer of nearly half a billion dollars with minimal fees and near-instant finality proves the XRP Ledger‚Äôs potential as a financial settlement layer. Moreover, Ripple‚Äôs massive XRP transfer likely hints at internal fund management or prepping for a bigger institutional move. While the wallet remains unknown, it‚Äôs probably part of Ripple‚Äôs strategy to boost liquidity or adjust reserves ahead of regulatory or business developments. Binance Sees XRP Inflows Surge Meanwhile, the XRP Ledger is recording increased activity on Binance. On June 6, XRP inflow spiked to 47.8 million, compared to just 5 million the day before, based on CryptoQuant data . This inflow suggests growing trader interest, even as XRP‚Äôs price remains steady around $2.19. Generally, such spikes hint at increased trading activity, but the stable price shows no major sell-off, yet. Institutional Momentum Builds Across Crypto Beyond Ripple, crypto institutions continue to make moves. Gemini has filed for a U.S. IPO via an S-1, following in the footsteps of Circle‚Äôs NYSE filing. Ethereum ETFs are also seeing a strong streak of inflows in 2025, suggesting a broader bullish trend for digital assets. Together, these signals point to growing confidence in blockchain-backed finance, and XRP may be right at the center of it.",Uncategorized|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|TRADING|WALLET|XRP|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-07 05:36:25

The president said he‚Äôs no longer willing to keep Jerome Powell in the job and confirmed that Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor, is now being strongly considered to take over. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs very highly thought of,‚Äù Trump said when asked directly about Kevin. Trump made it clear he‚Äôs done waiting for Powell to move on interest rates. He said a good Fed chair would have already acted to cut borrowing costs. He‚Äôs calling for a full percentage point cut and believes Powell is making things worse by stalling. ‚ÄúVery Simple!!! He is costing our Country a fortune,‚Äù Trump posted on Truth Social. He said borrowing costs ‚Äúshould be MUCH LOWER!!!‚Äù The two met face-to-face last week for the first time in months. During that conversation, Trump said he told Powell straight up that he was making a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù by not moving faster on cuts. Trump is now pushing harder than ever to bring in someone who‚Äôll follow his direction‚Äîand Kevin is the frontrunner. Trump pushes for 1-point rate cut despite strong jobs numbers The same day Trump floated firing Powell, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US added 139,000 jobs in May, higher than the 125,000 Dow Jones had expected. But the stronger report didn‚Äôt change Trump‚Äôs tone. ‚ÄúGo for a full point, Rocket Fuel!‚Äù he wrote online. He said the Fed needs to move fast, no matter what the employment numbers show. Trump argues that interest rates need to drop across the board. He says it would lower both short-term and long-term debt costs. ‚ÄúOn debt that is coming due,‚Äù he wrote, America is paying too much. He also pointed out that other countries are cutting their rates, while the Fed under Powell has stood still. The European Central Bank had just lowered its key rate by a quarter point‚Äîthe eighth cut since last June. They said it would probably be their last one this year, citing weaker growth and slowing inflation. Trump brought this up and said the US should be doing the same. He says Powell‚Äôs refusal to act is hurting the country. Despite Trump‚Äôs demands, markets see almost no chance of a cut at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting this month. The last time the Fed made a 1-point cut all at once was in March 2020, when COVID-19 hit the economy. During Joe Biden‚Äôs final year in office, the Fed reduced rates by a full point‚Äîbut in smaller steps. Trump says he‚Äôs not impressed. He insists that the Fed needs to act now, and he‚Äôs ready to remove Powell if that doesn‚Äôt happen soon. He‚Äôs publicly berated him more than once, but this is the first time he‚Äôs openly said who might replace him. Warsh stays quiet, Powell takes the heat Kevin hasn‚Äôt said anything publicly about the possibility of returning to the Fed. But Trump‚Äôs praise puts him in the spotlight. Kevin served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011 and has stayed active in policy circles since then. He‚Äôs viewed as someone who would be more responsive to Trump‚Äôs direction than Powell has been. Inside the White House, Trump has continued to criticize Powell for acting too slowly. ‚ÄúToo Late at the Fed is a disaster!‚Äù he posted. He also said the economy is doing well ‚Äúdespite him.‚Äù That‚Äôs been a constant message‚ÄîTrump believes the Fed is dragging things down instead of helping. Powell has said he‚Äôs trying to balance the risk of inflation, especially as Trump‚Äôs tariff policies raise costs on imports. But Trump doesn‚Äôt care. He says what matters is making credit cheaper across the board. He‚Äôs not just asking anymore‚Äîhe‚Äôs threatening to act. Kevin now looks like the guy who could replace Powell if Trump doesn‚Äôt get the cuts he wants. Trump hasn‚Äôt said exactly when he‚Äôll announce the decision, but he said it‚Äôs ‚Äúvery soon.‚Äù If Powell doesn‚Äôt move, Kevin might be stepping into his office.

Referring to a prior estimate of $1,200 per XRP , he wrote: ‚ÄúI Owe Everyone an Apology ‚Ä¶ Just wanted to say sorry to all my soldiers for that $1200 XRP Price Prediction‚Ä¶WTF was I thinking.‚Äù He went on to mock his earlier position, stating that even Grok, an artificial intelligence model, had ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù him by predicting $1,700. Despite the sarcasm, the message pointed to a deeper claim: that predictions made months ago about Ripple and XRP are now being supported by technical documentation and broader adoption signals. The tweet references content shared in December 2024 and early 2025, now positioned as evidence that XRP is on the verge of widespread institutional use and major price movement. I Owe Everyone an Apology ‚Ä¶ Just wanted to say sorry to all my soldiers for that $1200 XRP Price Prediction‚Ä¶WTF was I thinking Then to have @grok correct me and up my prediction to $1700‚Ä¶how embarrassing I should have known better when I said $1200‚Ä¶it will be‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/ifiHByY38l ‚Äî The Real Remi Relief (@RemiReliefX) June 4, 2025 Early Claims About XRP‚Äôs Role in the Financial System In a tweet dated December 4, 2024, RemiReliefX stated that XRP and XLM were selected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to operate within a new global financial framework. He claimed, ‚ÄúAll the banks will use XRP,‚Äù and speculated that even capturing 10% of SWIFT‚Äôs network could lead to a valuation of $1,000 per token . He urged followers to consider not only SWIFT but also integration with Visa, Mastercard, hedge funds, and even U.S. Treasury markets. This forecast was closely tied to XRP‚Äôs utility and potential for institutional adoption. Remi‚Äôs argument hinged on the idea that XRP‚Äôs functionality would align with regulatory bodies and global payment systems, increasing its valuation through actual use rather than speculative trading. XRPL and ISO 20022 Integration References Supporting this line of thought, user @SMQKEDQG posted screenshots that appeared to show Ripple‚Äôs Interledger Protocol being acknowledged on the ISO 20022 official documentation site. ISO 20022 is the global standard for financial messaging infrastructure, and the documentation appeared to confirm Ripple‚Äôs involvement via an approved request, possibly linked to integration with SWIFT. Another image shared by @SMQKEDQG showed excerpts from academic writing hosted on a UK university site. The highlighted section described Ripple and the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as modeling an entire financial ecosystem, extending beyond cryptocurrency into the structure of financial value exchange. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple‚Äôs Potential as a Future Bank A follow-up tweet by RemiReliefX on May 4, 2025, built on these assertions. He responded to user Stellar Rippler, who had claimed that Ripple is ‚Äúgoing to become a bank.‚Äù In agreement, Remi wrote, ‚ÄúLike I said in January‚Ä¶Ripple will be the biggest and best bank‚Ä¶The Fed/Treasury.‚Äù Remi‚Äôs comments suggest a belief that Ripple is not just a tech firm but could transform into a central player in financial infrastructure, potentially applying for a formal banking license. According to the original post by Stellar Rippler, Ripple‚Äôs transition into a licensed financial institution would significantly change its public and regulatory role. The post described Ripple as ‚Äúthe future Fed wrapped in blockchain,‚Äù positioning the company as a bridge between traditional finance and emerging digital networks. Reaffirming His Position with ‚ÄúRemi Receipts‚Äù RemiReliefX closed his June 4 post by reasserting that his previous statements were accurate, referring to his evidence as ‚ÄúRemi Receipts.‚Äù He paired this with a nod to @SMQKEDQG‚Äôs shared material, collectively portraying the two as having predicted Ripple‚Äôs trajectory well in advance. Despite the tweet‚Äôs humorous tone, it continued to emphasize serious points about institutional involvement, ISO 20022 validation, and the possible transformation of Ripple from a software company to a banking institution.

The cryptocurrency community is buzzing with reports that Gemini, the well-known platform founded by the Winklevoss twins , has taken a significant step towards potentially becoming a publicly traded company. This development, if confirmed, marks a pivotal moment for the platform and the broader cryptocurrency exchange industry. The initial report surfaced via the pseudonymous X account ‚ÄòWalter Bloomberg,‚Äô suggesting that Gemini has confidentially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. While confidential filings are common and allow companies to keep details private during the initial stages, the news alone is enough to ignite discussions about the future trajectory of major crypto players and the increasing convergence of traditional finance with the crypto world. Understanding the Buzz: What is a Gemini IPO ? An IPO, or Initial Public Offering, is the process by which a private company offers shares of stock to the public for the first time. This allows the company to raise capital from public investors. For a company like Gemini, pursuing a Gemini IPO would mean transforming from a privately held entity into a publicly traded one, with its shares potentially listed on a major stock exchange like the Nasdaq or NYSE. Why would a successful cryptocurrency exchange like Gemini consider this move now? Several factors could be at play: Capital Infusion: An IPO is a powerful way to raise substantial funds. This capital could be used for expansion, acquisitions, technology development, marketing, or strengthening balance sheets. Enhanced Legitimacy and Transparency: Becoming a public company often comes with increased regulatory scrutiny and reporting requirements. While challenging, this can also lend greater legitimacy and transparency in the eyes of traditional investors and institutions, potentially attracting a wider user base. Liquidity for Early Investors and Employees: An IPO provides an exit strategy for early investors and a way for employees with stock options to cash out their holdings. Brand Visibility: A public listing significantly increases a company‚Äôs profile and brand recognition among mainstream investors and the general public. For the Winklevoss twins , who have been prominent figures in both traditional finance and the crypto space, taking Gemini public would be a landmark achievement, solidifying their position as major players in the evolution of digital assets . The Source: Reliability of the Crypto IPO Report The report originated from ‚ÄòWalter Bloomberg,‚Äô a pseudonymous account on X known for sharing rapid-fire financial news snippets. While often relaying information accurately, the nature of the source means the information should be treated with cautious optimism until officially confirmed by Gemini or regulatory filings become public. Confidential filings are, by definition, not publicly announced by the company until later in the process, adding to the speculative nature of the initial report. However, the timing aligns with a period where the crypto market has shown signs of recovery and increased institutional interest, potentially creating a more favorable environment for a crypto IPO compared to the depths of the bear market. Challenges and Opportunities for a Cryptocurrency Exchange Going Public While the potential benefits of a Gemini IPO are significant, the path to becoming a public company, especially for a cryptocurrency exchange , is fraught with challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. is still evolving and complex. A public crypto company would face intense scrutiny from bodies like the SEC. Past regulatory issues or enforcement actions against crypto firms could impact investor sentiment and the IPO process. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its price swings. The valuation of a cryptocurrency exchange is heavily tied to trading volumes and asset prices, which can fluctuate dramatically, making valuation difficult for traditional investors. Competition: The exchange space is highly competitive, with global and regional players constantly vying for market share. Past Issues: Gemini faced significant challenges related to its Earn program and its connection to Genesis/DCG, leading to regulatory action from the SEC. While they have worked to move past this, it could still be a point of scrutiny during the IPO process. Despite these hurdles, a successful Gemini IPO could set a precedent and pave the way for other major private crypto companies to explore public listings, further integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. Comparing the Potential Gemini IPO to Coinbase Coinbase, another major U.S. cryptocurrency exchange , went public in April 2021 via a direct listing, not a traditional IPO. This means the company didn‚Äôt issue new shares to raise capital but allowed existing shareholders to sell their shares directly on the market. Coinbase‚Äôs public debut was initially met with excitement but its stock price has experienced significant volatility, reflecting the ups and downs of the crypto market and regulatory concerns. Should Gemini pursue a traditional IPO, the process would differ from Coinbase‚Äôs direct listing. It would involve underwriters, roadshows, and setting an initial offering price. Investors will likely compare Gemini‚Äôs financials, business model, and regulatory posture to Coinbase when evaluating the potential offering. What Does a Potential Gemini IPO Mean for Users and Investors? For current Gemini users, an IPO might not immediately change the day-to-day experience of trading digital assets . However, in the long term, increased capital could lead to platform improvements, new features, and potentially greater stability and trustworthiness due to public reporting requirements. For investors interested in gaining exposure to the crypto market through traditional stocks, a Gemini IPO would offer another avenue alongside companies like Coinbase, MicroStrategy, or publicly traded crypto miners. Investors would need to evaluate Gemini‚Äôs business fundamentals, growth prospects, and the specific risks associated with a crypto-native company. Actionable Insights for Potential Investors: Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from Gemini and regulatory filings (when they become public) rather than relying solely on unconfirmed reports. Understand the Risks: Investing in a crypto-related company‚Äôs stock carries both traditional stock market risks and the inherent volatility and regulatory risks of the crypto market. Evaluate the Business: Look beyond the hype. Analyze Gemini‚Äôs financials, revenue streams (trading fees, custody, etc.), market share, regulatory compliance efforts, and management team (including the Winklevoss twins ). Compare to Peers: How does Gemini stack up against Coinbase and other publicly traded or private competitors? The Road Ahead for Gemini and Digital Assets A confidential filing is just the first step in a potentially long process that could take many months. Market conditions, regulatory feedback, and the company‚Äôs own strategic decisions will all play a role in whether the Gemini IPO ultimately comes to fruition. The success or challenges of this potential listing will be closely watched as a barometer for the appetite of public markets for crypto-native businesses. The pursuit of a public listing by a major cryptocurrency exchange like Gemini underscores the growing maturity and ambition within the digital assets space. It signifies a desire for greater integration with traditional finance and access to larger pools of capital, even as the industry continues to navigate significant regulatory and market volatility. In conclusion, while the report of Gemini‚Äôs confidential crypto IPO filing remains unconfirmed by official sources, it highlights a significant potential development. Should Gemini proceed, it would be a landmark event, offering both exciting opportunities and considerable challenges, and providing valuable insights into the evolving relationship between Wall Street and the world of digital assets , championed by figures like the Winklevoss twins .

The ambitious plans for comprehensive California crypto regulation are now reportedly under threat due to a substantial state budget shortfall. This situation raises concerns about the future of crypto-related initiatives within the Golden State. What‚Äôs Behind the Threat to California Crypto Regulation? The core issue revolves around funding for the state‚Äôs financial watchdog, the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI). This agency is tasked with overseeing various financial sectors, including the burgeoning world of cryptocurrencies. The California DFPI is the key body responsible for implementing and enforcing the state‚Äôs digital asset laws. According to recent reports, the DFPI has indicated that an additional $193 million is required to fully implement the necessary infrastructure and measures for regulating cryptocurrencies effectively. This funding is crucial for establishing the systems needed to monitor the industry, protect consumers, and ensure compliance with new regulations. Without this essential capital, the agency‚Äôs capacity to manage its expanding mandate, particularly concerning digital assets, is severely limited. Understanding the Digital Financial Assets Act A major piece of the puzzle is the Digital Financial Assets Act (DFAA), which was signed into law in 2023 and is set to take effect in 2025. This landmark legislation aims to create a clear and comprehensive licensing framework for companies operating with digital assets in California. Before the DFAA, the regulatory landscape for crypto businesses in the state was less defined, leading to uncertainty for both companies and consumers. The DFAA is designed to bring structure and oversight to the digital asset market, similar to how traditional financial services are regulated. Key aspects of the Act include: Licensing Requirements: Mandating that businesses offering digital asset services obtain a license from the DFPI. Consumer Protection: Implementing measures to safeguard consumers from fraud and mismanagement. Operational Standards: Setting requirements for cybersecurity, compliance programs, and risk management for licensed entities. Enforcement Powers: Granting the DFPI authority to investigate and take action against unlicensed or non-compliant companies. The implementation of the Digital Financial Assets Act is seen as vital for fostering a safe and trustworthy environment for crypto adoption and innovation within California. However, realizing the goals of the DFAA is directly tied to the funding required by the California DFPI . The Impact on California Crypto Licensing and State Crypto Systems The reported budget shortfall poses a direct threat to the operationalization of the DFAA and the establishment of effective California crypto licensing . Without the needed $193 million, the DFPI may struggle to build the necessary technical infrastructure, hire and train staff, and develop the processes required to handle license applications, conduct examinations, and enforce the law. The potential consequences for State crypto systems and the broader digital asset ecosystem in California are significant: Delayed Implementation: The effective date of the DFAA (July 1, 2025) could be pushed back, or its initial implementation might be less robust than intended. Regulatory Uncertainty: Continued ambiguity for crypto businesses operating in California, potentially hindering growth and investment. Reduced Consumer Protection: Without adequate oversight, consumers may be more vulnerable to scams and failures within the digital asset market. Competitive Disadvantage: California could fall behind other states or jurisdictions that successfully implement clear crypto regulatory frameworks. The vision of having sophisticated State crypto systems that provide a clear, safe environment for digital asset activities is jeopardized if the funding gap isn‚Äôt addressed. Both businesses seeking California crypto licensing and residents engaging with digital assets rely on the state‚Äôs ability to provide effective oversight. Challenges Ahead for the California DFPI The task facing the California DFPI is unenviable. They are mandated to regulate a rapidly evolving and complex industry under the framework of the Digital Financial Assets Act , but they lack the necessary resources. Securing an additional $193 million in the current state budget climate is a significant challenge. The agency must navigate the political and economic landscape to advocate for this essential funding. The outcome will determine whether California can effectively build out its State crypto systems and fulfill the promise of comprehensive California crypto regulation . For businesses in the digital asset space, this situation creates uncertainty. Companies preparing for California crypto licensing under the DFAA will be closely watching how this funding issue is resolved. Clear communication from the California DFPI regarding timelines and expectations is crucial during this period of financial constraint. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for California‚Äôs Crypto Ambitions California‚Äôs aspiration to be a leader in digital asset regulation, spearheaded by the Digital Financial Assets Act and the efforts of the California DFPI , faces a critical test. The significant budget shortfall threatening the funding required to build essential State crypto systems puts the future of comprehensive California crypto regulation and California crypto licensing in jeopardy. Addressing this financial gap is paramount if the state is to provide the clear regulatory environment needed for both industry growth and consumer protection in the digital asset space.

The quote, shared by Crypto Researcher SMQKE, is taken from a document discussing Ripple‚Äôs collaboration with banks and its roadmap for transforming international payments infrastructure. The most notable statement comes from Ripple executive Vias, who clearly outlines the company‚Äôs intended direction. He is quoted as saying, ‚ÄúIn the most elegant end-state of our solution, Ripple, ILP, and XRP work seamlessly together.‚Äù This confirms that the ideal structure for Ripple‚Äôs payment system involves the simultaneous use of its proprietary software, the Interledger Protocol for interoperability, and XRP for liquidity and settlement. RIPPLE‚ÄôS IDEAL BANKING SOLUTION: INTERLEDGER PROTOCOL + XRP WORKING TOGETHER Read closely. ‚ÄúIn the most elegant end-state of our solution, Ripple, ILP, and XRP work seamlessly together.‚Äù This is the ideal combination for banks adopting Ripple‚Äôs infrastructure. ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/shLyD5rR2L pic.twitter.com/cX0dwBPihr ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 5, 2025 Ripple‚Äôs Vision: Seamless Integration of ILP and XRP Ripple‚Äôs strategy centers on the coexistence of ILP and XRP within its infrastructure to enable banks to benefit from instant settlement and broad interoperability across networks. The statement made by Vias underscores that this is not just a short-term project, but a long-term architectural objective. Rather than presenting ILP or XRP as standalone solutions, Ripple promotes them as complementary components within a larger system that can address inefficiencies in cross-border banking . We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bank Engagement and XRP Trials The document includes references to Ripple‚Äôs collaboration with R3 and a group of 12 banks that used XRP in a controlled test environment. These tests allowed banks to simulate real-time settlement using digital assets. ‚ÄúWe got 12 banks to hold a digital asset for the first time ever,‚Äù Vias stated, emphasizing the significance of the event. The experiment marked a breakthrough in digital asset adoption among banks and paved the way for further development and potential live deployments. According to another Ripple executive, Thomas, the company is now seeing growing interest from banks specifically regarding XRP. While the company has not yet confirmed a live pilot program using XRP for settlements, the internal sentiment reflects optimism about wider adoption. Compliance, Regulation, and the Road Ahead Despite progress on the technical side, Ripple continues to navigate regulatory complexities. Ramamurthi, cited in the document, notes the importance of handling compliance issues, particularly as they relate to digital currency. He emphasized the difficulty of answering regulatory concerns when leading innovation in the space. These challenges are relevant for Ripple as it works to replace correspondent banking models with blockchain-based alternatives. Ripple‚Äôs approach reflects a strategic balance‚Äîproviding banks with software while simultaneously working to elevate XRP and ILP into core elements of the transaction process. By advancing through phased releases and securing regulatory clarity , Ripple aims to expand its infrastructure without disrupting the traditional banking environment too abruptly. This document offers a rare yet clear insight into Ripple‚Äôs ultimate goal for financial infrastructure: a system where its software, ILP, and XRP work in harmony to deliver efficient, scalable, and regulatory-compliant cross-border payments.

This inherent 24/7 nature presents unique challenges and opportunities, especially when it comes to regulatory oversight. Recently, Acting CFTC Chairwoman Caroline Pham shed light on a fascinating development: all public feedback received regarding the potential for 24/7 derivatives trading was exclusively focused on crypto products. This isn‚Äôt just a technical detail; it‚Äôs a crucial signal about the future direction of digital asset regulation and financial market oversight. Why is 24/7 Crypto Trading Different? Unlike traditional financial markets, which operate on fixed schedules (think stock exchanges closing for the day), the cryptocurrency market is truly global and non-stop. This fundamental difference is at the heart of the conversation around 24/7 trading for derivatives. When the CFTC, the U.S. regulator for derivatives markets, solicited public comments on potentially moving towards a 24/7 trading model, the response highlighted where the real demand and practical considerations lie: in the crypto space. Here‚Äôs a quick comparison: Feature Traditional Finance (TradFi) Crypto Markets Trading Hours Fixed, limited (e.g., 9:30 AM ‚Äì 4:00 PM EST for NYSE) 24/7, non-stop globally Underlying Assets Stocks, bonds, commodities, fiat currencies Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) Market Access Often restricted to exchange hours Global, accessible anytime (internet permitting) Regulatory Model Established frameworks built around fixed hours Evolving frameworks adapting to 24/7 nature This constant activity in crypto markets means that events happening overnight or on weekends can have immediate and significant impacts on prices and market conditions. This brings us to the critical point raised by Chairwoman Pham. CFTC and the Push for Real-Time Risk Management According to Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto In America, Chairwoman Pham specifically noted that 24/7 trading offers clear advantages, particularly from a risk management perspective. In a market that can react instantly to global news, technological developments, or regulatory announcements, having the ability to trade derivatives around the clock allows participants to manage their exposure in real time. Think about it: if a major news event breaks at 2 AM on a Sunday, a market participant holding a crypto derivatives position might face significant risk exposure if they have to wait until Monday morning to adjust their hedge or close their position. 24/7 trading capability would allow for immediate action, potentially mitigating losses and improving overall market stability by allowing for continuous price discovery and risk transfer. The CFTC‚Äôs interest in this topic isn‚Äôt new. They announced they were soliciting public comments on 24/7 derivatives trading back in April. This proactive step shows the regulator is grappling with how to oversee markets that don‚Äôt fit the traditional mold of scheduled trading hours. The fact that the feedback focused solely on crypto derivatives underscores that the industry sees this as a necessity driven by the very nature of digital assets. Why Only Crypto Derivatives? Exploring the Feedback The revelation that feedback on 24/7 trading proposals was limited to crypto-based products and didn‚Äôt involve TradFi products is telling. It suggests that while the CFTC cast a wide net, the industry response highlighted that the practical need and infrastructure readiness for 24/7 derivatives trading currently reside almost exclusively within the crypto ecosystem. Why might this be the case? Native 24/7 Infrastructure: Crypto exchanges and trading platforms were built from the ground up to operate non-stop. Their underlying technology, staffing models, and operational procedures are designed for continuous activity. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of crypto markets makes the ability to react instantly to events more critical than in many traditional asset classes. Global Nature: Crypto markets are truly global, with significant trading activity occurring across all time zones. A 24/7 model aligns with this global participant base. TradFi Legacy Systems: Traditional financial infrastructure, while robust, is often built upon legacy systems and operational models that are deeply tied to fixed trading hours and clearing cycles. Shifting these systems to 24/7 operation would be a monumental and costly undertaking, potentially lacking the immediate market demand seen in crypto. This feedback provides the CFTC with clear direction: the immediate regulatory and infrastructure questions surrounding 24/7 derivatives trading are primarily relevant to the rapidly evolving 24/7 crypto trading landscape. Implications for Digital Asset Regulation and Financial Market Oversight What does this mean for the future? The fact that public input is steering the conversation towards crypto indicates that regulators like the CFTC are increasingly focusing their attention and resources on understanding and overseeing digital assets. This isn‚Äôt just about trading hours; it‚Äôs about developing comprehensive digital asset regulation that accounts for the unique characteristics of this market. Key areas the CFTC and other regulators will likely need to address include: Surveillance and Market Integrity: How to effectively monitor a market for manipulation or misconduct when it never closes. Clearing and Settlement: Adapting clearing and settlement processes, traditionally tied to daily cycles, for continuous operation. Cybersecurity: Ensuring the security of platforms operating 24/7 against constant threats. Coordination: Harmonizing regulatory approaches across different jurisdictions, given the global nature of 24/7 markets. Investor Protection: Ensuring adequate safeguards for participants trading around the clock. The feedback on 24/7 trading is a microcosm of the larger challenge facing regulators: how to apply existing frameworks or create new ones for markets that operate fundamentally differently from those they have overseen for decades. The focus on crypto in the feedback suggests that this is where the most pressing needs and potential innovations lie for evolving financial market oversight . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Ecosystem For participants in the crypto market, this development offers several insights: Regulation is Coming, and it‚Äôs Tailored: Regulators are actively seeking input on how to best oversee crypto‚Äôs unique features. Engaging with these comment periods is vital for the industry to help shape effective regulation. Infrastructure Matters: The ability of crypto platforms to support 24/7 operations is a key differentiator and will likely be a focus for regulatory requirements. Risk Management is Paramount: The emphasis on risk management in the context of 24/7 trading highlights its importance. Platforms and participants should prioritize robust risk frameworks. Derivatives are a Key Focus: The CFTC‚Äôs jurisdiction over derivatives means that this area of the crypto market will continue to be under scrutiny and development. The conversation around 24/7 trading for crypto derivatives is a clear indicator that the integration of digital assets into the broader financial system is progressing, bringing with it the need for sophisticated regulatory approaches. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Digital Finance Acting CFTC Chairwoman Caroline Pham‚Äôs comments reveal that the regulatory dialogue around the practicalities of modern trading is being driven by the unique characteristics of the crypto market. The fact that feedback on 24/7 derivatives trading was exclusively focused on crypto products underscores the inherent differences between digital asset markets and traditional finance, as well as where the immediate challenges and opportunities for regulatory evolution lie. This isn‚Äôt just about keeping the lights on; it‚Äôs about developing effective risk management, market integrity, and financial market oversight models for a global, always-on financial future. The CFTC‚Äôs engagement and the industry‚Äôs focused feedback are crucial steps in building the necessary regulatory infrastructure for the growing world of crypto derivatives and the broader landscape of digital asset regulation .

According to anonymous individuals familiar with the matter who spoke with Fortune , the companies see stablecoins as a way to reduce transaction costs and streamline international payments. X owner Elon Musk has disclosed that the social media platform is developing X Money in partnership with Visa, seeking to link debit cards with digital wallets for effortless peer-to-peer payments. Sources told Fortune that X is considering incorporating stablecoins into its X Money and is in discussions with Stripe to potentially enable stablecoin-based transactions. Sources revealed to the news publication that Apple has been considering integrating stablecoins into Apple Pay and its wider payments infrastructure since January this year, including conversations with Circle‚Äôs senior director Matt Cavin. For Airbnb, stablecoin payments have been considered since early 2025 as a way to reduce the cut it pays to card networks like Visa and Mastercard. Talks entailed payment processor Worldpay, which recently announced stablecoin payout capabilities through its partner BNVK. Apple, X, Airbnb, and Google join other tech giants such as Meta and Uber in considering integrating dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies for cheaper transactions as the United States pivots toward a more friendly crypto regulatory environment under President Trump. Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs Meta was reported in May to be evaluating stablecoins‚Äô potential to reduce international transaction costs for its users, such as Instagram creators, amid the evolving US regulations. More recently, the CEO of the ride-sharing firm Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, stated during the Bloomberg Tech Summit in San Francisco that it was researching the use of stablecoins as a potential payment option. Stablecoins hit their highest-ever market capitalization of $250 billion this month. Standard Chartered envisions the stablecoin market hitting $2 trillion by the end of 2028. One key catalyst: the expected passage of the GENIUS Act, a key legislative effort that could define a clear regulatory path for stablecoins and possibly spur more mass adoption in the US.",Cryptocurrency|News|Airbnb|Apple|Cryptocurrency News|stablecoin|Twitter|USDC|USDT,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|USDT|USDC,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-07 06:57:34

The price of BTC had dropped to nearly $100,000 during the height of the reaction, but has since rebounded. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,891, marking a steady recovery from the 24-hour low. While the broader crypto market continues to digest the fallout, new data suggests that another force, miner activity, is beginning to shape the near-term outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pullback or Setup? On-Chain Metrics Hint at What‚Äôs Coming Next Bitcoin Surge in Miner Inflows Could Pressure Price Action According to on-chain analytics published by CryptoQuant contributor CryptoOnchain, Bitcoin miners have dramatically increased the volume of BTC transferred to exchanges. Between May 19 and May 28, miner-to-exchange inflows exceeded $1 billion per day, levels not seen in previous market cycles. These inflows are often viewed as a proxy for miners‚Äô intent to sell, which could influence short-term supply dynamics and introduce added volatility to BTC‚Äôs spot market performance. The rise in realized inflows from miners to exchanges is interpreted as a sign of growing sell-side pressure. Since miners are key liquidity providers in the Bitcoin ecosystem, large-scale transfers to exchanges are typically seen as preparations to offload BTC. Historically, spikes in miner outflows have preceded periods of downward price pressure, particularly when they occur alongside fragile market conditions. CryptoOnchain emphasizes that while miner selling isn‚Äôt inherently negative, it can impact short-term price stability. As a result, traders and investors often monitor these flows to better assess potential risks. When miner inflows surge, it reflects the sector‚Äôs sentiment regarding profitability, operational stress, or anticipated price changes. CryptoOnchain noted: Paying close attention to these inflows‚Äîespecially during historical peaks like the current phase‚Äîcan help with risk management and more informed trading decisions. Hash Ribbon Signal Suggests Longer-Term Opportunity Amid rising sell pressure, another indicator is flashing a potential opportunity. CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs Hash Ribbons indicator, a metric derived from comparing 30-day and 60-day moving averages of network hashrate, has recently produced a new buy signal. This metric is used to evaluate miner stress and recovery phases, and is generally interpreted as a signal that miners have gone through a period of capitulation and are now stabilizing or recovering. This signal has historically aligned with favorable long-term entry points, except in unique events like China‚Äôs 2021 mining ban. While the short-term effects of mining stress may contribute to price weakness, analysts suggest that these periods often set the stage for longer-term rallies. When miner capitulation resolves, it can clear excess supply from the market and establish stronger support levels.

In a new interview at the 2025 Forbes Iconoclast Summit, Chanos says companies that are likely to fade away due to artificial intelligence (AI) advancements top his short list, including US computer giant International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). ‚ÄúWe think there‚Äôs a number of companies that kind of pop up that are going to be roadkill on the AI highway. And right now, similar to the early part and mid part of the Dot-com boom, all the stocks are getting inflated. But there are a lot of companies who have business models that, if you think it through, are going to see them dramatically deflate because of the capabilities of AI as AI gets better and better. We call them either body shops or AI products that will basically be competed away‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not going to give you a bunch of names, but one of our old names that is in that group that we‚Äôve been short on and off since 2020 has been the IBM, which has been a good stock in the last year and a half. It‚Äôs basically doubled, and after going down for 10 years. But it‚Äôs trading back at all-time high valuations. It‚Äôs not growing. It‚Äôs a body shop‚Ä¶ We think it‚Äôs a business that‚Äôs going to continue to melt away, not right away, but AI will continue to hurt IT consultants and IT body shops.‚Äù IBM is trading for $268 at time of writing, up about 60% in the last 12 months. Another company on Chanos‚Äô short list is used car retailer Carvana (CVNA), which is up 7,961% in the last 30 months after trading at $4.23 in January 2023. ‚ÄúWe think that [Carvana is] still a misunderstood story‚Ä¶ What really caught our eye and made it timely is a couple of positioning aspects, which these days, on the short side, are really important. Number one, the short interest is back down to multi-year lows, from being one of the most heavily shorted stocks in the market in 2023, it‚Äôs now back below and back toward its pre-Covid levels of short interest as percentage shares outstanding, below 10%.

Several names are gaining traction, but four in particular show promising performance, clear development plans, and usable features. BlockDAG is gaining momentum fast with its growing ecosystem. On the other hand, MIND of Pepe, Solaxy, and Best Wallet Token each offer a unique angle. Whether you prefer scalability, DeFi features, meme culture, or rewards access, these options deserve attention. If you‚Äôre checking out the top presale cryptos to buy today, this list breaks down why each one stands out and which could offer the highest gains. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Gem Delivered 2520% Gains to Early Birds BlockDAG continues to lead among top presale cryptos to buy today, having secured $289 million in presale funds and selling 22 billion BDAG coins. Currently in batch 28 of 45, the coin trades at $0.0018, reflecting a 2520% increase since the first batch. Its hybrid tech uses DAG and Proof-of-Work together, allowing multiple confirmations at once, improving speed and reducing network congestion while staying secure and decentralized. The platform also offers low fees, high processing capacity, and protection from MEV issues. Its viral X1 Miner app has gained over 1.5 million users. Beyond that, BlockDAG‚Äôs beta testnet includes tools like a no-code token builder, a new explorer, and regular token drops. Upcoming features include DeFi integration, governance tools, cross-chain bridges, and listings across 20 centralized exchanges. BlockDAG (BDAG) also introduced Buyer Battles and Double Up deals, allowing users to increase their holdings or save 50%. With strong tech, useful tools, and massive presale traction, BlockDAG is setting a high bar for top presale cryptos to buy today. If updates about its GO LIVE reveal continue, the project could soon unlock even greater visibility. 2. MIND of Pepe: Meme Energy with Live AI Tools MIND of Pepe merges internet meme appeal with working AI utilities. Before its June 3 TGE, the project raised more than $12 million and launched its AI bot, which is already active on major platforms. The tool offers real-time insights, turning MIND into more than just a meme. This blend of humor and function has attracted users quickly. The AI aspect makes it different from most meme coins, with actual use cases available before launch. That unique combo is what places it among the top presale cryptos to buy today. It‚Äôs drawing attention from both AI fans and meme lovers who want more than empty hype. 3. Solaxy: Solana‚Äôs First Layer 2 Build Solaxy (SOLX) is taking a unique approach by becoming Solana‚Äôs first Layer 2 network. While Solana already manages high throughput, Solaxy adds improved smart contract tools and better multi-chain compatibility. Over 12.3 billion SOLX have been staked, with rewards currently at 93%, making it appealing to long-term supporters. With the testnet active, users are already moving assets and launching contracts. Solaxy‚Äôs presale has brought in over $43.5 million, showing high interest in its utility and multi-chain features. For those seeking top presale cryptos to buy today with active networks and staking returns, SOLX stands out. 4. Best Wallet Token: Full Access to DeFi Features Best Wallet Token (BEST) focuses on expanding what users can do with crypto. It has already raised close to $13 million and offers holders benefits like early access to presales, fee reductions, governance roles, and better staking rewards. Instead of just being a wallet, it acts as a central hub for DeFi users. Its user base values the practicality BEST brings, aiming for more benefits with less effort. Holders gain more out of their assets, especially during presale. Because of its focus on tools and consistent value delivery, Best Wallet Token remains firmly on the list of top presale cryptos to buy today. Summing Up! These four presales are all pushing unique features. Solaxy enhances scalability on Solana with added compatibility. Best Wallet offers expanded control and better returns on crypto activities. MIND of Pepe connects meme energy to live AI functions. BlockDAG, however, is checking all boxes: fast growth, mining features, practical tools, and broad presale support. Among the top presale cryptos to buy today , BlockDAG clearly takes the lead. With its $289 million presale raise, 22 billion BDAG coins sold, ongoing beta, and strong tech base, it is more than just a temporary project. Priced at $0.0018 with sellouts accelerating, the time to act is narrowing fast.

He added that he aimed to end tariffs that hurt his country‚Äôs economy. Akazawa claimed that tariffs imposed on autos, auto parts, steel, and aluminum, including some that had doubled to 50% along with the 10% general tariff, were causing daily losses to Japan‚Äôs economy. He, however, declined to disclose what progress they had made. Akazawa previously said that Japan and the U.S. were arranging a meeting between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada, which will start on June 15. The latest round of talks was the last in-person meeting between top Japanese and U.S. officials before the G7 leaders‚Äô summit, where Trump is expected to meet Ishiba. Akazawa says talks must balance urgency with national interests Japan faces a 24% tariff rate in July unless it negotiates a deal with Washington. However, Akazawa disclosed last month that U.S. defense equipment purchases, ship-building technology collaboration, a revision of automobile import standards, and increased agricultural imports could be bargaining chips in tariff talks. The Minister in charge of Japan‚Äôs economic revitalization now says the trade negotiations must consider balancing urgency with the need to guard national interests. Japan also hinted it was weighing whether to accept a cut in the rates as the United States continued resisting a complete removal of the duties. It proposed a mechanism to reduce the auto tariff rate based on how much countries contributed to the U.S. auto industry. Under Japan‚Äôs latest proposal, Washington would also lower auto tariffs based on the number of vehicles Japanese automakers produced in the U.S. and the volume of cars exported from the U.S. plants to other markets. ‚ÄúWe want an agreement as soon as possible. The G-7 summit is on our radar, and if our leaders meet, we want to show what progress has been made.‚Äù -Ryosei Akazawa, Chief trade negotiator for Japan Akazawa strongly reiterated Japan‚Äôs request to review the tariff measures imposed. However, he stressed that Japan‚Äôs position had not changed and that the tariffs were still unacceptable, describing them as regrettable. Terazawa says relying too much on U.S. trade is too risky The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year https://t.co/rbBC11iynE ‚Äî Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2025 Former Vice Minister for International Affairs at Japan‚Äôs Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry Tatsuya Terazawa said relying too much on the trade between his country and the U.S. was risky. He pointed out that significant harm had already been done even if Tokyo could negotiate with Trump to secure tariff exemptions. Many countries, including Japan, have lost confidence in the long-term openness of the U.S. market. Terazawa believes the potential economic harms were far too great for the countries affected by U.S. tariffs to hope that an American court would make the problem disappear or that the president would change his mind. He said Japan, in particular, was dangerously exposed to the U.S. market. Still, it also had the resources and opportunity to develop a multilateral strategy for coping with Washington‚Äôs ‚Äúobstructionist‚Äù approach to trade. According to the former Vice Minister, Japan , whose economy depended on exports, faced a 25% tariff on automobiles and auto parts, a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, and a 24% tariff on all other goods it exported to the United States if all of Trump‚Äôs proposed measures enter force. He believes steep tariffs would make many Japanese goods too expensive for American consumers. The U.S. is Japan‚Äôs second-largest market after China (including Hong Kong), accounting for roughly 20% of all its exports. Terazawa emphasized that Japan and other countries in a similar position needed to take action that did not depend on working with the United States. He added that Japan would have to expand its trade relationships and collaborate with other countries to strengthen the global trade system with or without the U.S. to offset the damage of Trump‚Äôs tariffs‚Äîat least for now.

Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Bonk (BONK) Source: TradingView Bonk (BONK) has experienced a mixed market trend lately. The price fell by 18.01% over the past week but gained 3.35% in the last month. Over six months, however, it has dropped by 60.21%. Currently, BONK trades between $0.00001427 and $0.00002061. Technical indicators show potential for movement. The RSI stands at 46.91, indicating neutral momentum. The Stochastic is at 31.50, nearing oversold territory. The MACD is slightly negative at -0.0000001055, suggesting mild bearish sentiment. The price is close to both the 10-day SMA at $0.00001687 and the 100-day SMA at $0.00001677. If BONK breaks above the nearest resistance at $0.00002435, it could target the second resistance at $0.00003069, gaining about 18% and 49% from the current price, respectively. If it dips below the nearest support at $0.00001167, it may test the second support at $0.00000533, potentially decreasing by 18% and 63%. Investors are watching these levels to determine BONK‚Äôs next direction. Pepe (PEPE) Source: TradingView Pepe (PEPE) has seen notable movements recently. In the past month, its price surged by 54.41%, bringing excitement to investors. However, the past week showed a decline of 10.11%. Over six months, the price decreased by 41.17%. Currently, PEPE trades between $0.00001013 and $0.00001429. Technical indicators provide some clues. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 52.95, indicating neutrality. The Stochastic indicator reads 45.51, also neutral. The MACD level is 7.4190e-9. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $0.00001238, just above the 100-day SMA of $0.00001194, suggesting a possible short-term upward trend. Looking forward, the nearest resistance level is $0.00001678. Surpassing this could lead to the next resistance at $0.00002093. On the other hand, if the price dips, the nearest support is at $0.00000847, with a second support at $0.00000431.

45633482,https://timestabloid.com/?p=70158,1749280848,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Google Gemini Sets Bitcoin Price for June 30, 2025",https://timestabloid.com/google-gemini-sets-bitcoin-price-for-june-30-2025/,"In a notable move that underscores the growing intersection of AI and financial forecasting, Google Gemini has weighed in on Bitcoin‚Äôs near-term trajectory. The forecast comes at a time when Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $101,469, having declined 3.17% over the past 24 hours and 4.1% in the past week. Despite short-term volatility, analysts view this pullback as a healthy correction within a broader bullish trend. Bitcoin Scarcity Drives Institutional Accumulation The ongoing scarcity of Bitcoin remains one of its most powerful market drivers. With a fixed supply of only 21 million coins, Bitcoin has increasingly been seen as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. This scarcity has fueled growing institutional interest. Among the major players, MicroStrategy recently acquired an additional 4,000 BTC , bringing its total holdings to 580,250 Bitcoins, or roughly 2.7% of the entire capped supply. Such aggressive accumulation by public companies highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs evolving role as a corporate treasury asset. Google Gemini Forecasts $103,000 Bitcoin by Month-End ‚ÄúBased on macroeconomic indicators, institutional momentum, and supply dynamics, Bitcoin is expected to increase by approximately 1.5% by the end of June 2025, reaching a price of $103,000,‚Äù Google Gemini stated in its latest market outlook. This AI-powered projection is cautiously optimistic, taking into account both the recent market correction and the broader strength of Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamentals. The forecast suggests a stable upward trend rather than speculative volatility, reinforcing Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a long-term asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 ETFs Open the Floodgates for Institutional Investment Supporting this forecast is the meteoric rise of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have lowered the barrier for institutional investors to gain exposure to the digital asset. These ETFs have become increasingly popular as traditional financial institutions recognize Bitcoin‚Äôs investment potential. Leading the charge is BlackRock, the $11.5 trillion asset management giant. Its Bitcoin ETF has now surpassed $70 billion in assets under management (AUM), marking a new era of institutional buy-in. Market Outlook: Can Bitcoin Hit the Mark? The ease of access provided by ETFs, paired with Bitcoin‚Äôs deflationary design and increasing corporate adoption, continues to fuel upward pressure on the asset‚Äôs price. Analysts note that the influx of capital from both retail and institutional investors is contributing to market resilience, even during short-term downturns. While Bitcoin remains a volatile asset, its underlying fundamentals have grown stronger. With the convergence of limited supply, rising ETF adoption, and corporate accumulation, the market appears poised for continued growth.

Hold Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) and Get Ahead of the Market with Early Signals Bitcoin's Rise: Could It Reach New Heights? Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency that changed how we think about money. Created in 2009 by an unknown person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a way to send money directly between people without a bank or middleman. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin is a digital system where everyone shares the same record of transactions. This shared system ensures everyone agrees on who owns what, making it secure and trustworthy. Over the years, Bitcoin's value has seen big ups and downs. By 2025, it has reached new milestones, surpassing previous all-time highs. Many early investors have seen significant returns. Some experts believe Bitcoin will continue to rise. Predictions suggest it could reach prices as high as $1.5 million by 2030, according to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest. Others are less optimistic, like Warren Buffett, who doubts its long-term value. Whether Bitcoin will keep climbing depends on many factors, like demand and adoption by big institutions. While some are hopeful about its future, it's important to consider the risks. Bitcoin's journey is ongoing, and only time will tell if it will reach new heights. Solana: The Lightning-Fast Blockchain Transforming Digital Transactions Solana is a blockchain platform launched in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former engineer at Qualcomm and Dropbox. It's designed to solve the speed and scalability problems of older networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana claims to process over 50,000 transactions per second with minimal fees, making it the fastest blockchain in the world. The secret behind Solana‚Äôs speed is its unique technology. It uses a system called Proof of History, which orders transactions efficiently. Combined with Proof of Stake, parallel processing, and data compression, Solana achieves high performance without sacrificing security. This makes it ideal for decentralized apps and services that need quick transactions. Since its launch, Solana has attracted many developers and investors. Its native token, SOL, has seen significant growth. In 2021, SOL's price soared, reflecting confidence in its technology and potential. This rapid rise caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors. In the current market, Solana looks promising. Its fast and scalable platform is appealing for many applications. While competition is fierce, Solana's innovative approach sets it apart. However, it's important to consider the challenges it faces, such as network outages and competition from other blockchains. Looking ahead, Solana's future will depend on continued adoption and technological advancements. While past performance is impressive, the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable. Investors should keep an eye on Solana's development and its ability to overcome challenges. Its potential to shape the future of blockchain technology makes it a project worth watching. Is XRP Set for a Breakthrough? Exploring Ripple's 2025 Prospects XRP, Ripple's cryptocurrency, aims to revolutionize global money transfers with speed and low costs. Its technology enables quick transactions between currencies, gaining support from banks. XRP's price has fluctuated. From under a cent in 2013 to $3.84 in 2018. Though it hasn't regained that peak by 2025, its technology and adoption suggest potential. Legal challenges with the SEC, resolved in 2024 with a penalty, caused uncertainty. But the settlement led to a price boost, showing renewed optimism for XRP. Experts have mixed long-term views. Some predict XRP reaching up to $45 by 2030; others expect modest growth. Market sentiment and partnerships will influence its future. With strong technology improving transactions, XRP is intriguing. Despite uncertainties, its potential rise makes it worth considering for future-minded investors in this market cycle. Cardano's Climb: ADA's Potential in the Current Market Cycle Cardano, launched in 2017, is a blockchain that uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. Unlike Bitcoin's energy-heavy proof-of-work method, Cardano focuses on sustainability and scalability. This eco-friendly approach makes it a standout in the crypto world. Built on peer-reviewed research, Cardano aims to host decentralized apps. Its token, ADA, is used for transactions and staking, allowing users to earn rewards by helping secure the network. In 2021, ADA reached a high of $3.10. Experts predict that with Bitcoin's halving leading to a bull market, ADA could rise significantly. Forecasts for 2030 range from $4.15 to as high as $28, suggesting strong growth potential. Opinions differ on ADA's future price. Some are bullish, predicting $8 in 2025, while others are more cautious, estimating under $1. This highlights the uncertainty in crypto predictions. In today's market, ADA seems attractive due to its strong fundamentals and growing developer interest. As Cardano continues to improve its technology, it could become more valuable. While the future is uncertain, many see great potential in Cardano. Conclusion While established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) have shown strong performance, their short-term potential appears limited. These well-known coins may not offer the rapid gains that some investors seek in the current bull market. In contrast, Codename:Pepe crypto emerges as a promising alternative. This new entrant aims to leverage artificial intelligence to navigate the volatile meme coin market. By providing AI-powered trading signals and automated trading, it seeks to help investors capitalize on opportunities ahead of the crowd. Holding Codename:Pepe crypto grants access to a private community with exclusive strategies and analytics.

Solana: Revolutionizing Transaction Speed Solana's introduction into the blockchain space brought a new level of efficiency with its claim of handling over 50,000 transactions per second. This capability is a significant advancement over older blockchain technologies, positioning Solana as a strong contender in the market. Its ability to combine speed with reliability makes it an attractive platform for developers and investors alike, suggesting a promising future in the rapidly evolving digital transaction sphere. Investment Potential in XRP and Cardano XRP, with its low-cost and fast transaction capabilities, targets a transformation in the banking sector. Post its legal battles, XRP now shows signs of a strong recovery, hinting at a robust future as it continues to foster partnerships across financial institutions. Cardano differentiates itself through an eco-friendly approach to blockchain technology, aiming to provide a sustainable platform that does not compromise on scalability or security. This makes it not only an investment in technology but also in an environmentally conscious future. Conclusion While traditional tech stocks continue to hold significant value, the innovative strides in cryptocurrencies highlight a shift towards digital assets as viable investment choices.

However, despite this, the broader price structure remains bearish, and the ADA price continues to struggle beneath key resistance levels. Here‚Äôs a closer look at what the charts are saying. The ADA price has repeatedly bounced off the $0.6 to $0.63 zone over the past several sessions, highlighting this as a critical support range. Bullish participants appear to be accumulating at these ranges, preventing the price from breaking lower. The demand zone is reinforced by previous price action and the recent buying volume, marking it as a key level to watch going forward. Despite the support zone holding, the overall trend remains bearish as the ADA price is unable to close above $0.74. Meanwhile, a rise above the range has quickly triggered a massive pullback, which makes these levels mandatory to rise and secure. Meanwhile, the supertrend has turned bearish, which suggests the descending trend could prevail for a while. On the other hand, the RSI has rebounded from the lower threshold, signaling a rise in the strength of the rally. As a result, the ADA price seems to be poised to surpass $0.69 in a short while, but the question remains whether the token could make it above $0.73. Cardano‚Äôs price is currently in a technical tug-of-war where bulls are defending a structurally important floor at $0.61 but are unable to break the resistance. Until this structure finds some resolution, the current trading condition may prevail, which could likely dictate ADA‚Äôs next significant move.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-07 07:23:28

This move comes on the heels of a highly publicized and challenging period involving his detention in Nigeria, highlighting the significant regulatory challenges faced by major crypto platforms like Binance. Who is Tigran Gambaryan and What Was His Role? For four years, Tigran Gambaryan served at the forefront of Binance‚Äôs fight against illicit finance. A former U.S. federal agent with a background in investigating financial crimes, his expertise was crucial for Binance as it sought to bolster its anti-money laundering (AML) and compliance frameworks globally. His role as Head of Financial Crime Compliance placed him in a position directly responsible for ensuring the exchange adhered to international standards and local regulations across various jurisdictions. In an industry often criticized for its perceived lack of oversight, individuals like Tigran Gambaryan are vital. Their work involves implementing stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML policies, collaborating with law enforcement, and building robust systems to detect and prevent financial crimes on the platform. His tenure reflects Binance‚Äôs stated commitment to improving its Binance compliance posture. The Binance Nigeria Incident: An Unprecedented Challenge The backdrop to Gambaryan‚Äôs departure is the unprecedented situation that unfolded in Nigeria in early 2024. As part of broader regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrency activities within the country, Nigerian authorities invited Binance representatives, including Gambaryan and his colleague Nadeem Anjarwalla, for discussions. However, these discussions quickly escalated into detention. The allegations against Binance in Nigeria included accusations related to currency manipulation and tax evasion, claims the exchange has disputed. The detention of the executives became a major international incident, drawing attention from governments and human rights organizations worldwide. While Anjarwalla later reportedly escaped custody, Tigran Gambaryan remained detained for eight months, facing legal proceedings alongside Binance itself. This incident underscored the significant risks individuals face when working for global crypto companies operating in jurisdictions with evolving or stringent regulatory environments. The lengthy detention period for Tigran Gambaryan became a focal point of discussions around corporate responsibility and the protection of employees navigating complex international legal landscapes. The pressure for his release eventually mounted, involving bipartisan efforts from U.S. lawmakers. Navigating Global Regulatory Challenges The situation in Nigeria is just one example of the regulatory challenges that major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance confront daily. Operating in nearly every country means dealing with a patchwork of different laws, interpretations, and enforcement approaches. What is permissible in one jurisdiction might be illegal in another. Key regulatory challenges include: Varying Legal Status: Cryptocurrencies and exchanges are treated differently worldwide, from outright bans to full integration into financial systems. AML/KYC Requirements: Implementing consistent and effective anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures across diverse legal frameworks. Taxation: Navigating complex rules around taxing crypto transactions for users and the exchange itself. Licensing and Registration: Obtaining necessary licenses to operate legally in each target market, a process that can be lengthy and complex. Enforcement Actions: Facing potential investigations, fines, or legal action from regulators and law enforcement agencies globally. These challenges require substantial investment in legal teams, compliance officers, and technology, making roles like the one held by Tigran Gambaryan indispensable. The Critical Importance of Binance Compliance For a platform with millions of users and vast transaction volumes, robust Binance compliance is not merely a legal obligation but a strategic imperative. Effective compliance helps to: Build Trust: Demonstrating commitment to legal standards can enhance user and institutional confidence. Ensure Sustainability: Avoiding costly fines, legal battles, and operational disruptions caused by non-compliance. Enable Growth: Meeting regulatory requirements is often a prerequisite for entering new markets and offering new services. Combat Illicit Activity: Protecting the platform and its users from being exploited by criminals. Binance has publicly stated its focus on compliance in recent years, restructuring its leadership and investing heavily in its compliance teams and technology. The detention of Tigran Gambaryan, however, highlighted the intense pressure and personal risks involved in these roles, especially in challenging jurisdictions like Binance Nigeria. Broader Implications for Crypto Compliance The experiences of Binance and Tigran Gambaryan have broader implications for the entire crypto industry‚Äôs approach to crypto compliance. It underscores the need for: Clearer Regulations: The industry continues to call for clear, consistent, and predictable regulatory frameworks globally. Risk Assessment: Companies must conduct thorough risk assessments before operating in new regions, considering the potential legal and personal risks to employees. International Cooperation: Better cooperation between international law enforcement and regulatory bodies is needed to handle cross-border crypto issues effectively. Protection for Compliance Professionals: Ensuring that compliance officers can perform their duties without undue personal risk or pressure. Gambaryan‚Äôs departure, announced via a LinkedIn post, marks the end of his chapter at Binance during a period of intense scrutiny and operational challenges for the exchange worldwide. What Does This Departure Mean for Binance? Tigran Gambaryan‚Äôs exit raises questions about the future of Binance‚Äôs financial crime compliance leadership and strategy. While Binance has a large compliance team, the departure of a figure with his specific background and experience, especially after such a traumatic event, is significant. It could necessitate a search for a new leader to steer the company‚Äôs global efforts in combating illicit finance and navigating ongoing regulatory challenges. The incident in Nigeria and the subsequent departure serve as a stark reminder of the volatile environment in which global crypto exchanges operate and the personal toll that regulatory pressures can take on individuals within these organizations. Conclusion Tigran Gambaryan‚Äôs departure from Binance following his arduous detention in Nigeria closes a challenging chapter for both the executive and the exchange. It brings into sharp focus the complexities and risks inherent in global crypto compliance and the immense pressure faced by individuals working to bridge the gap between innovative technology and traditional financial regulation. As the industry continues to evolve, the lessons learned from the Binance Nigeria incident and the experience of Tigran Gambaryan will undoubtedly influence how crypto companies approach their operations and compliance strategies in high-risk jurisdictions, emphasizing the ongoing need for robust Binance compliance and careful navigation of global regulatory challenges.

The large transaction was flagged by on-chain monitoring service Whale Alert, just days ahead of a critical deadline in Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This high-value transfer comes at a pivotal time as Ripple and the SEC face a June 16 deadline to submit a revised settlement agreement to Judge Analisa Torres, following the rejection of their initial proposal due to procedural deficiencies. The abrupt XRP movement, paired with heightened legal stakes, has reignited debate around whether this transfer may be connected to a possible monetary settlement with the regulator. 230,000,000 #XRP (498,041,270 USD) transferred from #Ripple to unknown wallet https://t.co/x6M9rOHv6D ‚Äî Whale Alert (@whale_alert) June 6, 2025 Legal Pressure Mounts Ahead of June 16 As previously reported , there is growing anticipation that the SEC vs. Ripple case may be nearing its conclusion. The presiding judge had recently rejected the initial settlement filing , citing procedural missteps and requesting a refiling that aligns with court standards. The court‚Äôs demand for a revised agreement has effectively reset the timeline, giving Ripple and the SEC until June 16, 2025, to produce a mutually acceptable proposal. Legal analysts and members of the XRP community have speculated that the pending settlement may include a financial penalty or restitution, which could potentially explain the strategic movement of such a large volume of XRP. While no official statement has been made by Ripple regarding the purpose of the transaction, the timing has raised eyebrows. Ripple‚Äôs Escrow Activity Adds to the Mystery Adding further intrigue to the situation is Ripple‚Äôs recent escrow activity. Earlier in June, Ripple locked up 670 million XRP in escrow , a mechanism designed to reduce the circulating supply and maintain price stability. However, the new 230 million XRP transfer did not appear to be tied to an additional escrow lock, leading some XRP enthusiasts to argue that ‚Äúit‚Äôs too late for another lock‚Äù this month. If not for escrow, then what exactly is the purpose of the 230 million XRP? The destination of the funds remains unknown, fueling theories that the wallet could be linked to a third-party facilitator, legal fund, or a regulatory settlement reserve. This isn‚Äôt the first time Ripple has transferred large amounts of XRP, but the context of this particular transaction, against the backdrop of a high-stakes legal settlement, makes it particularly significant. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Settlement on the Horizon? For years, the SEC‚Äôs lawsuit against Ripple has cast a long shadow over XRP. Initially filed in December 2020, the lawsuit alleged that Ripple sold XRP as an unregistered security. However, Judge Torres‚Äô landmark ruling in July 2023 dealt a serious blow to the SEC‚Äôs case, declaring that XRP is not a security when sold on secondary markets. This partially favorable ruling for Ripple opened the door for potential settlement talks and ultimately led to the current back-and-forth over legal procedures and penalties. Now, as June 16 looms, all eyes are on whether the two parties can finalize an agreement that not only satisfies the court but also closes a chapter that has significantly impacted the regulatory trajectory of crypto in the United States. If the 230 million XRP transfer is connected to a settlement-related financial requirement, it may signal that Ripple is preparing to meet some form of restitution or penalty using XRP itself, rather than liquid assets. Such a move could be strategically beneficial, especially if Ripple aims to preserve fiat reserves or avoid market disruption by slowly disbursing funds from a designated wallet. With Ripple now under the microscope and the legal clock ticking, the coming days could bring long-awaited clarity. Whether the mysterious 230 million XRP transfer was part of a planned legal maneuver or just another routine transaction, it has undoubtedly intensified the countdown to what could be a definitive moment in Ripple‚Äôs regulatory saga.

June 2025 represents a dynamic crypto market, where established coins still dominate. However, emerging tokens show signs of the biggest returns for investors. One of the best cryptos right now is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which many experts state is the best DeFi project of 2025. Let us examine what Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has to offer. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Will Transform DeFi The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project aims to revolutionize how the world interacts with DeFi. It aims to make it a mainstream industry through technical innovation, which will turn it into a fierce competitor against the legacy financial system. On the Mutuum Finance protocol, users can participate as borrowers, lenders, or liquidators. As a lender, users deposit their assets into a pool, and they start to receive interest immediately. The interest rate they earn on their assets is set dynamically based on the pool‚Äôs utilization rate. When enough lenders deposit their funds in a pool, the interest rate remains low, which encourages more borrowers to take loans, putting idle assets to work. If capital is scarce, the interest rate rises to encourage borrowers to pay back their debt, while attracting new deposits from lenders seeking higher yields. The utilization rate is determined by measuring the capital that is actively borrowed on the platform and comparing it to the total supply in the pool. The system is designed to ensure protocol solvency and maximum capital efficiency. Massive Capital Raised via Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised a massive amount of capital via the ongoing presale. So far, over $10.1 million has been raised in the presale. There are over 11,700 participants in the presale, with the number rising daily. The presale is currently in phase 5, where tokens are going for $0.03, a 20% increase from Phase 4 prices, where tokens were going for $0.025. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will increase 16.67% to $0.035. Stable Interest Rates For Borrowers Under certain conditions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) can allow borrowers to access stable rates to ensure predictable repayments. In this setup, there is an initial rate lock, which is calculated at the time of borrowing, starting as a weighted average of the variable rate, along with other indicators. The stable rate starts higher than the variable rate since borrowers have the benefits of predictability. This is done to compensate for the lack of future interest rate increases. However, a stable rate is still open to rebalancing. A rebalancing is triggered when the market conditions experience massive shifts. It occurs when the current supply rate gets to or below 90% of the variable rate that would otherwise apply. As such, if the variable rate rises significantly compared to the stable rate, the protocol will increase a borrower‚Äôs stable rate to reduce the gap. Not all tokens can access the stable rate. Assets with high volatility, and or low liquidity that could impact solvency on the platform are not suitable. That is in line with the design philosophy of the Mutuum Finance protocol, which is meant to encourage high-quality assets that have large market caps and low volatility. Managing Liquidity And Volatility On Mutuum Finance On-chain liquidity and trading volume have to be carefully managed on Mutuum Finance to ensure the long-term survival of the protocol. Providing sufficient liquidity ensures that positions in distress can be quickly closed without massive price slippage. To promote a safe environment, the protocol will come with caps on liquidation parameters to control exposure. For instance, if liquidity is limited, the incentives may be increased for liquidators to ensure there is sufficient coverage. Price volatility also impacts the collateral underpinning a loan. If the volatility causes collateral to dip below what is owed, the protocol‚Äôs solvency is impacted. To avoid this issue, the protocol will implement a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. The ratio is used to set a liquidation threshold that will provide enough headroom for liquidators to make a profit when buying debt. Low volatility assets like ETH will be given a higher LTV, which can be as high as 75%, while the liquidation threshold is set at around 80%. Meanwhile, volatile assets like meme coins will have a low LTV in the range of around 40%, while the liquidation threshold is set at 65%. These parameters ensure that a sudden drop in price does not cause under-collateralization. The platform also applies a reserve factor to each asset. The reserve factor collects a fraction of the borrower‚Äôs interest. The aggregate pool is used to offset potential defaults during wild market swings. On Mutuum Finance (MUTM), low volatility assets can have a share of 10%, while more volatile ones can have a reserve factor of up to 35%. This is meant to find a balance between the protocol‚Äôs health and the need to widen the market by allowing a diverse range of tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a technical marvel in the Defi space that has found the right balance between user participation and long-term productivity. Its clever design means that the MUTM token will continue to rise in value long after the presale. The current low price of $0.03 per token presents an enticing entry point.

Traders Bet On New Top Gainer,https://thecoinrise.com/polygon-price-prediction-can-layer-2s-survive-eth-crash-traders-bet-on-new-top-gainer/,"Can the Polygon price prediction flip its current outlook? The POL token has been battling the bears over the past few months, as Ethereum struggled to maintain a consistent price climb. As a result, technical trends are pointing to weak movement for 2025. But Unilabs Finance is driving up the market atmosphere, backed by strong fundamentals and passive income offerings. Crypto fans are already swarming the presale as Unilabs gears up for a potentially massive climb in this cycle. Polygon Price Prediction: Bearish Pressure as POL Struggles to Break Resistance The Polygon price prediction is currently bearish as most layer-2 coins continue to feel the weight of Ethereum‚Äôs crash. At the press time, Polygon is trading around the $0.21 mark with the $0.20 level acting as support. Buyers have often stepped at this level, anticipating the Polygon price prediction. Source: CoinCodex Experts‚Äô Polygon price prediction suggests that a fall below the $0.30 support could see Polygon crash to $0.17‚Äì$0.15. In a more bearish scenario, there may be further downside risk toward $0.12. This outlook aligns with other prediction models like CoinCodex, which places POL‚Äôs maximum price level for the year at $0.176 by December 2025. POL Struggles to Recover from ETH Crash Polygon has been falling since December last year, dropping from $0.7 to around $0.5 in January 2025. From that time, POL has lost over half of its value, with the Polygon price prediction sentiment mirroring ETH‚Äôs fall. By April, Polygon showed signs of a slight bullish reversal, increasing from around $0.20 to approximately $0.25. However, this upward momentum was limited and failed to push the value beyond key resistance levels. With Ethereum surging 38% in the past month, investors are hopeful that this renewed momentum could follow into Polygon. However, technical indicators are painting a rather bearish picture. But Unilabs Finance is already carving a bullish narrative with its passive income model and remarkable ICO round which is already offering market gains. Unilabs Takes the Lead with $30M AUM and Smart Tools While POL suffers from the ETH crash, Unilabs Finance appears to be gaining attention as a stronger investment option. The emerging project is quietly dominating the DeFi space with its innovative tools and presale performance. Impressively, Unilabs Finance holds over $30 million in Asset Under Management (AUM), demonstrating strong investor confidence. It also offers attractive passive income options that are drawing in many investors. The platform offers yield optimization pools, where users can automatically grow their crypto through staking, lending, and liquidity provision. This tool scans the market for DeFi platforms to generate the best returns while also managing risks. Users benefit from automated, transparent strategies, flexible access, and the ability to earn passive income without constant oversight. With the bearish Polygon price prediction, traders can utilize Unilabs‚Äô launchpad tool to search for other promising assets in the crypto space. It also allows users to collectively invest in carefully selected projects, giving everyone a fair chance to access early-stage opportunities. Unilabs Tipped as Next Market Gainer Amid Bearish Polygon Price Prediction As POL continues its downtrend, investors are steadily accumulating the UNIL token as its presale has raised over $2.4 million. At the moment, UNIL is available for $0.0062 per token, but this will go up to $0.0074 with the next price increase. Traders can take advantage of a limited-time offer by using the coupon code ‚ÄòUNIL25‚Äô to receive a 25% bonus on all deposits. Also, early holders can stake their UNIL tokens to earn rewards with an estimated APY of up to 122%. Conclusion The Polygon price prediction has left many market participants disappointed with its possible maximum value for the remainder of 2025. Both expert analysis and prediction models suggest that POL will not return to its previous levels. As such, traders are pitching their tents with Unilabs Finance due to its user-focused market tools. With low market entry and real-world utility, it‚Äôs easy to see why the project has become the new darling of DeFi fans. Investors could be ahead of the curve by acting now.

Recently, the attention turned to OpenAI‚Äôs head of marketing, Kate Rouch, a familiar name to many from her impactful tenure as Coinbase CMO . Rouch has made a significant personal announcement, stepping away from her demanding role temporarily to focus on her health. OpenAI Marketing Head Takes Leave for Health In a candid and personal post shared on LinkedIn, Kate Rouch announced she is taking a three-month leave of absence from her position as OpenAI‚Äôs Marketing Head . The reason for this temporary departure is to undergo necessary treatment for invasive breast cancer . This news, while personal, highlights the human element within the high-stakes world of artificial intelligence development. Rouch revealed that her diagnosis came earlier this year, mere weeks after she had started her ‚Äúdream job‚Äù at OpenAI. For the past five months, she has been undergoing chemotherapy treatment at UCSF, all while continuing to lead the marketing team. She described this period as the ‚Äúhardest season of life‚Äù for herself, her husband, and their two young children, underscoring the immense challenge of balancing a serious health battle with professional responsibilities and family life. Interim Leadership: A Familiar Face Steps In During Rouch‚Äôs leave, the role of interim head of marketing at OpenAI will be filled by Gary Briggs. Briggs is a highly respected figure in the marketing world, known for his previous role as the Chief Marketing Officer at Meta. Rouch noted in her post that she had previously worked with Briggs during her time at Meta, suggesting a smooth transition and continuity in leadership during her absence. A Message of Awareness and Hope Despite the challenges, Kate Rouch shared positive news regarding her health outlook. Her prognosis is described as ‚Äúexcellent,‚Äù and she is expected to make a full recovery following her treatment. Beyond simply announcing her leave, Rouch used her platform to share a vital public health message, particularly aimed at women. She highlighted sobering statistics about breast cancer , noting that 1 in 8 American women will be diagnosed with the invasive form of the disease, and tragically, 42,000 die every year. Rouch also pointed out the concerning trend of rising rates among young women. Her decision to share her personal story publicly is intended to capture attention and encourage others, especially young women balancing career and family demands, to prioritize their health. ‚ÄúA routine exam saved my life. It could save yours too,‚Äù she wrote, emphasizing the critical importance of regular check-ups and early detection. Kate Rouch‚Äôs Journey: From Coinbase CMO to OpenAI Kate Rouch joined OpenAI in December, bringing a wealth of experience from prominent roles across the tech industry. Before stepping into the OpenAI Marketing Head position, she served as the Coinbase CMO , playing a key role in marketing for one of the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency exchanges. Her career before Coinbase included significant leadership positions at Meta, where she oversaw brand and product marketing for major platforms such as Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook. This diverse background in marketing high-profile, rapidly evolving technologies makes her a valuable leader for a company like OpenAI. Her trajectory from the dynamic world of cryptocurrency at Coinbase to the forefront of AI at OpenAI reflects the increasing convergence and talent flow between these innovative sectors. Her temporary departure, while for a serious personal reason, is a reminder that even leaders at the helm of groundbreaking companies face personal challenges. Why This Matters The temporary leave of a key executive like the OpenAI Marketing Head , especially one with Rouch‚Äôs extensive background including her time as Coinbase CMO , is noteworthy for several reasons. It highlights the importance of strong leadership succession planning, even for temporary absences. More importantly, Rouch‚Äôs bravery in sharing her battle with breast cancer brings crucial awareness to a widespread health issue, using her visibility within the tech community to encourage potentially life-saving actions among her peers and the broader public. Her story is a powerful reminder that professional achievements must be balanced with personal well-being. Conclusion: Looking Forward Kate Rouch ‚Äòs announcement is a testament to her strength and commitment, both professionally and personally. Navigating intense cancer treatment while holding a demanding executive role is an immense feat. Her willingness to share her journey and use it as a platform for health advocacy is truly commendable. The tech community, including those who followed her work as Coinbase CMO and now at OpenAI , will undoubtedly wish her a smooth treatment period and a swift, full recovery. Her temporary leave is a necessary pause, and the hope is to see her back at the helm of OpenAI ‚Äòs marketing efforts in full health soon, continuing her impactful career and her important message about prioritizing health.

Ark Invest Purchases $373 Million in Circle Shares The acquisitions were made through Ark's Innovation (ARKK), Next Generation Internet (ARKW) and Fintech Innovation (ARKF) funds. The purchase came the same day Circle began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol ‚ÄúCRCL.‚Äù The company‚Äôs shares rose 168.5% on its first day of trading, closing at $83.23. The intraday high was $96. The shares were priced well above the company‚Äôs upwardly revised IPO price of $31 due to strong demand. Circle‚Äôs IPO Process and Its Impact on the Crypto Industry Circle has attempted to go public twice before, first in 2021 through a SPAC merger and then in 2024 through a confidential S-1 filing. The company filed its latest filing with the SEC in April of this year, citing concerns that the IPO could be hindered by market uncertainty stemming from President Trump‚Äôs tariffs. However, the IPO was a success. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire commented on the IPO: ‚ÄúOur becoming a public company is a powerful and important milestone in the transition to an internet-based financial system.‚Äù Circle's USDC is the world's second-largest dollar-backed stablecoin after Tether's USDT, with a supply of $60.6 billion. Ark Invest has reduced some of its existing positions to fund its new investment. On Thursday, Ark sold $17.1 million worth of its own Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), which remains the fund‚Äôs largest holding, the company said. In addition, the company; 161,304 Coinbase shares ($39.4 million), 255,327 shares of Robinhood stock ($18.5 million), Jack Dorsey's Block sold 163,304 shares ($10.4 million) of its company. Ark Invest‚Äôs investment philosophy calls for no individual asset to weigh more than 10% of the fund‚Äôs portfolio. This strategy aims to maintain diversification within the fund and allows for rebalancing if Circle shares increase in value. As of now, Circle stocks are included in Ark funds as follows: With a 4.4% weight in the ARKK fund ($251.8 million), 4.4% ($77.2 million) in ARKW fund, 4.3% ($44.5 million) in ARKF funds. For comparison, the highest weighted holdings in the same funds include Tesla (10.3%), Ark Bitcoin ETF (8.2%), and Shopify (9%). *This is not investment advice.

The talks will include US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. While past discussions, such as those in Geneva, have led to a temporary easing of tariffs, deeper concerns persist. China remains frustrated by US policies limiting student visas and advising chipmakers to restrict business with Chinese firms. Beijing also accuses Washington of stalling efforts to export essential materials used in advanced technology. Crypto Market Rises Amid Economic Uncertainty Amid these tensions, the cryptocurrency market is showing notable strength. Bitcoin recently surged past $104,000, with Ethereum also holding strong gains. Data from analytics firm Santiment shows a growing number of crypto holders, now at 55 million for Bitcoin and 148 million for Ethereum, suggesting increased investor interest in digital assets during uncertain economic times. This optimism is being driven by a mix of global uncertainty and growing belief in crypto as a hedge against traditional market instability. Interest Rates and the Crypto Boom Moreover, Trump‚Äôs aggressive push for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates is also affecting crypto. Historically, when interest rates go down, people often look for new places to invest their money, and crypto becomes one of those options. With inflation still hanging around and global tensions rising, more investors see digital assets as a safe backup plan. Even though prices jump up and down, the mood in the crypto world is getting more optimistic.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-07 07:31:05

Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $1.42 in 2025. In 2031, Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $4.84. Pi Network has entered a period of instability since the final KYC verification deadline on March 14, 2025. Users who failed to verify and transfer their tokens to the mainnet lost access to their Pi holdings. The transition was completed on Pi Day, blockchain upgrades were introduced, and PiFest was launched to help more people use Pi. While some transfers went smoothly for users, others experienced problems and unexpected losses. These complications contributed to sharp price fluctuations. Adding to the pressure, more than 102 million Pi tokens were moved from OKX recently, signalling strong selling activity. Despite this, Pi Network continues to push ecosystem growth. Additionally, the recent launch of a $100 million venture fund aims to support dApp development on the Pi blockchain. While these developments could support long-term value, short-term sentiment remains cautious.

According to the price on June 7, it shows the token recovering to $0.6291, following a sharp dip below $0.61.While the bounce is not strong, it follows heavy selling that pushed prices below $0.65, which could set the stage for the formation of a short-term floor.

Is Pi A Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly‚Äîneither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi Price Down Today? Pi Coin is down today due to growing investor exits, as shown by large exchange inflows and insufficient demand to support price stability. Will Pi Price Reach $5? If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $5 mark. Will Pi Reach $10? Depending on the current market sentiment, the PI price might take several years to reach the $10 milestone. We expect the Pi price to achieve $10 by 2033.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History: Coinmarketcap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn‚Äôt be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction it was still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 in over-the-counter or sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. April 2025 Pi network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. May 2025 , the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi shows sideways-to-bullish movement, with potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72 if support at $0.60 holds.",Crypto Price Predictions|Pi Network,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-07 07:36:00

Despite its impressive performance, the spotlight is shifting to AI-powered altcoins that promise even greater potential. Coins like FET, RENDER, NEAR, and TAO are capturing investor interest as they harness artificial intelligence to drive innovation.

Buy Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Early for a Bigger Discount FET Token Rallies 25% This Month Despite Weekly Dip The FET token has seen a significant increase of 25.53% over the past month, indicating renewed interest from investors. This surge suggests that the coin is gaining momentum after a challenging period. However, the past week has shown a slight decline of 7.19%. This may be a short-term correction following the recent gains. The token's current price ranges between $0.67 and $0.90, showing some volatility in the market. The nearest resistance level is at $1.03. If the price breaks through this point, it could signal a strong upward trend. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.58, which could act as a safety net against further declines. With an RSI of 58.37, the token is nearing overbought territory but still has room for growth. Considering the monthly gain and potential to break resistance, FET's price may rise in the near future. Investors may watch for a move above $1.03 to confirm a bullish trend. Is Render (RENDER) Set for a Rebound or Further Decline? Render (RENDER) has seen a significant drop in its price recently. Over the past week, the coin's value decreased by 14.02%. In the last month, it fell by 8.84%. Looking at the six-month trend, RENDER experienced a massive decline of 61.11%. These figures suggest a bearish trend in the market. The current price of RENDER fluctuates between $3.39 and $4.72. The coin is approaching its nearest support level at $2.84. If the price falls below this support, it could lead to further declines. Traders are watching this level closely to see if it holds or breaks. On the upside, the nearest resistance level for RENDER is at $5.52. If the coin gains momentum and breaks through this resistance, it could signal a potential rise. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 44.76, which indicates that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. This neutral RSI suggests that RENDER could move in either direction. Considering the recent price changes, if RENDER manages to surpass the $5.52 resistance, it could aim for a percentage increase of around 17% from its current upper price of $4.72. Conversely, if it falls below the support level of $2.84, it could face a further decline of approximately 16%. Investors should watch these key levels to gauge the coin's next move. NEAR Protocol's Price Swings Signal Uncertain Outlook NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has experienced notable price swings recently. Its current price lies between $2.20 and $2.86. Over the past week, the price dropped by about 10%. In contrast, the past month saw a price increase of nearly 9%. The nearest resistance level for NEAR is at $3.25. If the price moves above this, it could indicate upward momentum. The nearest support level is at $1.94. A decline below this point might suggest further downward movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of NEAR stands around 51. This suggests a neutral market sentiment. An RSI near 50 indicates that the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. Therefore, the price could move in either direction. Over the last six months, NEAR's price has decreased by approximately 67%. Despite this significant decline, the recent monthly gain shows some potential for recovery. Observing the resistance and support levels may provide insights into NEAR's future price trends. Bittensor (TAO) Price Nears $500 Mark Bittensor (TAO) is currently trading between $353.27 and $487.17. This puts it closer to the higher end of its recent price range. The coin is showing strength in the market. The nearest resistance level is at $560.53. If Bittensor rises above its current price, it could reach this level. This would be an increase of about 15% from $487.17. The nearest support level is at $292.73. If the price falls, it could drop to this level. This would be a decrease of around 17% from $353.27. Based on this data, there is potential for the price to rise. The coin is near its upper range, suggesting upward momentum. Traders may see this as a sign that Bittensor will reach the resistance level. Conclusion In conclusion, while Bitcoin continues to outperform major tech stocks, analysts are shifting their attention to AI-driven altcoins. Coins like FET, RENDER, NEAR, and TAO have attracted interest but may offer less short-term potential compared to innovative newcomers. One such newcomer is Codename:Pepe crypto, which introduces genuine intelligence to cryptocurrency investments.

For the tech-savvy audience navigating this change, particularly those interested in cryptocurrencies and the broader digital frontier, understanding how AI integrates with human effort is key. Sarah Franklin, the CEO of Lattice, a prominent employee performance software company, offers a compelling perspective on finding the right AI human balance, emphasizing that human oversight isn‚Äôt just beneficial ‚Äì it‚Äôs essential. Finding the Crucial AI Human Balance Speaking at SXSW London and in an interview with Bitcoin World, Franklin highlighted the importance of the word ‚Äòbalance‚Äô when it comes to companies adopting AI technologies. While the allure of AI for cost savings and efficiency is undeniable, Franklin stresses that simply replacing large numbers of human workers might not be the winning strategy in the long run. Lattice, her company valued at $3 billion, is itself integrating more AI and automation features, but with a clear philosophy: putting people first. The conversation around AI human balance often pits automation against employment. However, Franklin argues that the most successful companies will be those that view AI as a tool to augment human capabilities, rather than replace them entirely. This involves retaining human employees and equipping them with AI assistants or ‚Äòagents‚Äô that enhance their productivity and insights. Building a Human-Centric AI Approach Franklin poses a fundamental question for leaders considering AI adoption: ‚ÄòAre you building for the success of the AI first [or are] you building for the success of the people and your customers first?‚Äô This question cuts to the heart of a human-centric AI strategy. She argues that while efficiency is valuable, it should never come at the expense of trust. Trust, according to Franklin, is the most important currency a company possesses, and it is built by prioritizing the needs and experiences of customers and employees. Trading out human interaction for pure automation might offer short-term cost benefits, but it risks eroding the trust that customers place in a company. A human-centric AI approach ensures that technology serves people, not the other way around, fostering stronger relationships and sustainable growth. Ensuring Responsible AI Human Oversight Beyond just balance, Franklin also laid out key principles for responsible AI implementation, focusing on the necessity of AI human oversight. These principles include: Transparency: Companies must be open with employees about what AI systems are doing and how they are being used. Accountability: AI should be applied narrowly to specific goals, making its function understandable. Ultimately, humans must remain accountable for the outcomes and impacts of the AI. Responsibility: Leaders and companies have a responsibility to ensure AI is developed and used in ways that benefit society and its people. Without this clear AI human oversight, Franklin warns, companies risk becoming subservient to the technology rather than having the technology serve human goals. AI and Jobs: Augmenting the Workforce The discussion around AI and jobs is often framed negatively, focusing on potential job losses. However, Franklin‚Äôs perspective, reflected in Lattice‚Äôs own practices, is about augmentation. She shared that Lattice has developed an AI HR agent designed to provide proactive insights and assist employees with tasks like preparing for one-on-one meetings. Lattice also offers a platform allowing clients to create custom AI agents tailored to their specific business needs. This approach demonstrates how AI and jobs can coexist and thrive, with AI handling routine tasks and providing data-driven support, freeing up human employees to focus on higher-level strategic thinking, complex problem-solving, and crucial human interaction. The Future of Work is Grounded in Human Connection Ultimately, Franklin believes that the victors in this era of rapid AI advancement will be those who understand and prioritize the human element. The future of work, she argues, is not about replacing people, but about leveraging technology to enhance human capabilities and preserve the irreplaceable value of human connection. Retaining human oversight and ensuring that AI serves people are, in her view, among the most important guardrails companies can put in place. This vision for the future of work is one where technology empowers, rather than displaces, the human workforce, recognizing that empathy, creativity, and complex judgment remain uniquely human strengths. In conclusion, Sarah Franklin‚Äôs insights from SXSW London and her conversation with Bitcoin World offer a vital reminder for businesses navigating the AI revolution. Achieving AI human balance through transparency, accountability, and a steadfast commitment to putting people and customers first is not just an ethical choice; it‚Äôs a strategic imperative for building trust and ensuring success in the future of work. The companies that master AI human oversight and adopt a truly human-centric AI approach, understanding that AI and jobs can be complementary, will be the ones that truly win.

As AI becomes more integrated into technology, including areas relevant to cryptocurrency and blockchain, the legality and transparency of this AI training data have become critical issues. This is where EleutherAI steps in, aiming to set a new standard. EleutherAI‚Äôs Answer to Data Challenges EleutherAI , a respected AI research organization, has recently unveiled what it describes as one of the largest collections of licensed and open-domain text specifically curated for training AI models. This significant release, known as The Common Pile v0.1, arrives at a time when the AI industry is grappling with legal battles over data sourcing. Here‚Äôs a quick look at the key aspects of this release: Dataset Name: The Common Pile v0.1 Size: A substantial 8 terabytes of text data. Development Time: Approximately two years in the making. Collaborators: Included AI startups like Poolside, Hugging Face, and several academic institutions. Core Principle: Focus on licensed and open-domain sources to navigate copyright concerns. The release is a direct response to the ongoing controversies surrounding how AI companies, including major players, acquire their training data. Many current AI datasets are built by scraping vast amounts of web content, often including copyrighted material without explicit permission or licensing. Addressing the Copyrighted Data Debate The practice of training AI models on potentially copyrighted data has led to numerous lawsuits against prominent AI firms. While some companies have started pursuing licensing deals, many still rely on the ‚Äòfair use‚Äô doctrine under U.S. law as a defense for using copyrighted works without permission. EleutherAI argues that these legal challenges have had an unintended negative consequence: a significant decrease in transparency within the AI industry. This lack of openness, they suggest, hinders broader research efforts by making it harder to understand how models function and where their limitations or biases might lie. Stella Biderman, EleutherAI‚Äôs executive director, highlighted this in a blog post: ‚Äú[Copyright] lawsuits have not meaningfully changed data sourcing practices in [model] training, but they have drastically decreased the transparency companies engage in.‚Äù She also noted that researchers at some companies feel constrained by these lawsuits, preventing them from releasing research in data-intensive areas. Training Powerful Large Language Models Legally To demonstrate the viability of their approach, EleutherAI trained two new Large Language Models (LLMs), Comma v0.1-1T and Comma v0.1-2T, using The Common Pile v0.1. Both models are 7 billion parameters in size (parameters being the internal components guiding a model‚Äôs behavior). EleutherAI claims these models perform comparably to those trained on unlicensed, copyrighted data. They reportedly rival models like Meta‚Äôs initial Llama AI model on benchmarks covering coding, image understanding, and math, despite being trained on only a fraction of the Common Pile v0.1 dataset. This performance is intended to serve as evidence that a carefully curated dataset focusing on licensed and open sources can indeed support the development of competitive AI models. Stella Biderman further commented: ‚ÄúIn general, we think that the common idea that unlicensed text drives performance is unjustified‚Ä¶ As the amount of accessible openly licensed and public domain data grows, we can expect the quality of models trained on openly licensed content to improve.‚Äù Building The Common Pile v0.1 The creation of The Common Pile v0.1 involved careful consideration and collaboration. EleutherAI consulted with legal experts throughout the process. The dataset draws on diverse sources, including: 300,000 public domain books digitized by the Library of Congress. Content from the Internet Archive. Transcriptions of audio content using OpenAI‚Äôs open-source Whisper model. This meticulous approach aims to provide developers with a legally sound foundation for building future AI applications. Learning from the Past, Looking to the Future The Common Pile v0.1 also represents a step forward for EleutherAI itself. The organization had previously released ‚ÄòThe Pile,‚Äô an open dataset that included copyrighted material, which subsequently faced scrutiny and legal pressure from those whose work was included. With this new release, EleutherAI is signaling a commitment to releasing open datasets more frequently, focusing on licensed and open-domain content, and collaborating closely with research and infrastructure partners. Conclusion: A Step Towards Transparent AI The release of The Common Pile v0.1 is a significant development in the AI landscape. By providing a large, legally curated dataset, EleutherAI is directly addressing the critical issues of copyrighted data usage and the need for greater transparency in AI development. This initiative not only offers a potential pathway for training powerful Large Language Models ethically but also encourages a more open research environment, benefiting the entire field, including its intersections with rapidly evolving sectors like cryptocurrency and decentralized technologies.

According to the RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra, there is no new development even despite the court‚Äôs pronouncement. The RBI governor touched on this subject and many others at a post-policy press briefing. He added that the Indian premier institution has always maintained its stance concerning the assets, which has remained consistent over the years. Malhotra mentioned that while the issue is currently being looked into by a government committee, the bank is still concerned about the potential risks. ‚ÄúRBI has maintained a consistent stance on this issue. A govt committee is currently examining the matter. We remain concerned about the potential risks crypto poses to financial instability and monetary policy,‚Äù Malhotra said at the press briefing. Supreme Court calls out crypto regulation delay The recent update is coming after a recent statement by the Supreme Court of India, calling out the lack of regulation in the country. The court expressed frustrations over the continued delays in establishing a crypto regulatory framework in the country, describing Bitcoin trading as a complex form of hawala, which refers to an informal method of transferring money. Coincidentally, the remarks were made by Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh in a bail hearing for Shailesh Babulal Bhatt, who was arrested for trading Bitcoin illegally. The judges mentioned at the bail hearing that the court had requested clarification concerning its virtual asset policy from the government, citing a case two years before. It added that there had been no follow-up on the case since then. During the verdict, Justice Kant noted that maintaining a set of rules and regulations in the crypto industry would have helped people avoid legal issues caused by the use of the assets. He added that he did not have any knowledge of Bitcoin or other digital assets‚Äìcomparing Bitcoin trading to a complex version of the Hawala system. Reserve Bank of India plans to roll out crypto regulations India has been an interesting location when it comes to digital assets and its regulation. While there has been no clear-cut regulation to this effect, the country has deployed a very high tax on crypto transactions as a means to deal with its spread. Presently, India charges traders up to 30% in taxes on profit from trading digital assets including another 1% TDS on transactions exceeding defined limits. The lack of clarity has also hindered much of the crypto industry in India from growing as people are still skeptical due to the activities of bad actors in the sector. For instance, over the last few months, there has been an increase in the amount of theft related to the crypto industry in India. In some other cases, there have been kidnappings and other vices, showing the need to deploy crypto regulations in the country. While crypto trading has been deemed legal since the Supreme Court halted the 2018 directive of the RBI restricting banking services for crypto firms, individuals are still criminally prosecuted for trading Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the bank has also rolled out a new framework for regulation in the country. According to the RBI, the regulatory framework will rely on three pillars, including public consultations with stakeholders, impact analysis, which will include qualitative assessments, and regular review of regulations to keep pace with evolving conditions in the sector.

Be Part of the Codename:Pepe DAO and Shape the Future of AI-powered Trading Solana (SOL) Price Analysis: Will It Rise or Fall? Solana's price has seen mixed movements recently. Over the past week, its value has dropped by 11.12%. However, looking at the past month, it has gained 8.98%. In the last six months, the price has decreased by 33.47%. The current price ranges between $145.84 and $174.58. This indicates volatility but also potential for upward movement. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 47.00, suggesting the market is neither overbought nor oversold. The nearest resistance level is at $191.40. If Solana's price breaks through this point, it could signal further gains. On the downside, the nearest support is at $133.92. A drop below this level might lead to additional declines. Considering the RSI of 47.00, Solana is in a neutral position. The monthly gain suggests potential for growth, but the recent weekly decline indicates caution. If the price can break above the resistance at $191.40, it may continue to rise. Conversely, if it falls below the support at $133.92, further declines are possible. Conclusion In conclusion, while Solana (SOL) and other established cryptocurrencies may offer steady growth, their potential for significant short-term gains appears limited in the current market. The ongoing bull run indicates positive trends, but these assets might not match the rapid ascent expected from emerging contenders.

Pseudonymous X account Walter Bloomberg initially reported that U.S. President Donald Trump is slated to meet with a delegation from China on this date. While details remain scarce and the report originates from a pseudonymous source, any interaction between these two global powers carries weight, and for those navigating the world of digital assets, understanding the potential ripple effects is crucial. How might a meeting of this magnitude influence the dynamic and often volatile Crypto Market ? What is the Reported Trump China Meeting About? According to the report, the meeting involves U.S. President Donald Trump and a Chinese delegation. The location is specified as London, and the date is June 9. At this stage, specific agenda items have not been publicly disclosed. However, given the historical context of relations between the United States and China, discussions would likely touch upon a range of complex issues, including: Trade relations and tariffs Geopolitical hotspots and international security Technological competition and intellectual property Currency valuations and economic policies It is important to note the source of this information is a pseudonymous account, and official confirmation would be needed to solidify the details. Nevertheless, the prospect of high-level talks between the U.S. and China is inherently significant for global markets. Understanding the Landscape: US China Relations and Crypto The relationship between the United States and China is one of the most impactful bilateral relationships globally. It influences trade flows, technological advancements, political alliances, and financial markets. Historically, periods of tension or cooperation between these nations have directly correlated with shifts in global economic sentiment. For the cryptocurrency space, US China Relations have played a complex role: Regulatory Approaches: Both countries have distinct and sometimes conflicting approaches to cryptocurrency regulation, which can create uncertainty or opportunity for the industry globally. Mining and Technology: China was historically a major hub for Bitcoin mining, and shifts in its regulatory stance significantly impacted the network‚Äôs hash rate distribution. The U.S. is increasingly becoming a key player in mining and blockchain technology development. Market Sentiment: Escalations or de-escalations in trade disputes or political tensions can trigger ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô or ‚Äòrisk-off‚Äô sentiment across global markets, including crypto. A meeting between leaders could potentially signal a shift, positive or negative, in this crucial relationship, with potential flow-on effects for assets perceived as either safe havens or risk assets, depending on the market narrative at the time. How Could This Impact Bitcoin Price ? Bitcoin, as the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is often the primary indicator of market sentiment. Its price can be influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic news, regulatory developments, and significant geopolitical events. A meeting between the U.S. and China falls squarely into the latter category. The potential impact on Bitcoin Price is multifaceted and depends heavily on the outcome and tone of the meeting: Potential Scenarios and Bitcoin Price Reaction: Meeting Outcome Potential Tone Likely Market Sentiment Potential Bitcoin Price Impact Positive Dialogue / De-escalation Constructive, seeking common ground Risk-On, Increased Confidence Potentially Positive (as part of broader market rally), or Neutral Neutral / Status Quo Maintained Formal, no major breakthroughs or conflicts Mixed, Continued Uncertainty Likely Neutral, Continuation of Existing Trend Negative Dialogue / Escalation Contentious, highlighting disagreements Risk-Off, Heightened Anxiety Potentially Negative (as part of broader market sell-off), or Positive (if seen as safe haven) Historically, during periods of significant global uncertainty or currency concerns, some investors have turned to Bitcoin as a potential hedge or store of value, leading to upward price pressure. Conversely, in a broad ‚Äòrisk-off‚Äô environment where all assets are sold off for liquidity, Bitcoin can also see price declines. The reaction of Bitcoin Price to this specific meeting will depend on how the market interprets the signals from London. Analyzing the Broader Crypto Market Implications Beyond Bitcoin, the reported meeting could have significant implications for the entire Crypto Market . Altcoins often react more strongly to market sentiment shifts than Bitcoin, exhibiting higher volatility. If the meeting leads to a clear positive or negative shift in global economic outlook, this could amplify movements across the altcoin landscape. Key areas within the Crypto Market that might be affected include: Market Capitalization: Overall market cap tends to move in tandem with Bitcoin, but a strong sentiment shift could see it expand or contract rapidly. Specific Sectors: Projects focused on supply chain, international trade finance, or even digital identity could see increased or decreased interest depending on the nature of discussions around technology and trade. Regulatory Narratives: While unlikely to be a primary topic, any subtle hints or discussions around digital currencies, cross-border payments, or financial technology could fuel speculation or impact regulatory expectations for crypto projects operating internationally. Monitoring the news flow from the meeting will be essential for crypto investors to gauge potential impacts on their portfolios across different digital assets. Assessing the Geopolitical Impact on Digital Assets The concept of Geopolitical Impact on financial markets, including digital assets, is becoming increasingly recognized. As cryptocurrencies mature and become more integrated into the global financial system, they are less isolated from traditional political and economic forces. A meeting between the U.S. and China is a prime example of a geopolitical event with potential financial ramifications. The outcomes could influence: Investor Confidence: Improved relations could boost confidence in global stability, potentially encouraging investment in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Deteriorating relations could have the opposite effect. Capital Flows: Shifts in trade policy or economic outlook could influence where international capital flows, potentially impacting investment into crypto ventures or markets. Narrative: Geopolitical tensions often fuel narratives around Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, currency devaluation, or political instability. A meeting could either strengthen or weaken these narratives depending on the context. Understanding the broader Geopolitical Impact helps investors contextualize market movements and make more informed decisions, recognizing that external political events are increasingly relevant to the crypto landscape. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the potential for this reported meeting to influence market dynamics, what steps can crypto investors consider? Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources for updates on the meeting, its participants, and any official readouts or statements. Pay attention to the tone and key discussion points. Monitor Market Reactions: Observe how Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies react in real-time as news from the meeting emerges. Look for correlations with traditional market movements (e.g., stock indices, currency pairs). Review Your Portfolio: Consider your portfolio‚Äôs exposure to potential market volatility. This might involve reviewing your risk tolerance or considering diversification strategies. Avoid Impulsive Decisions: Markets can be volatile around major news events. Avoid making hasty investment decisions based solely on initial reports. Wait for clearer trends or confirmed information. Understand the ‚ÄòWhy‚Äô: Try to understand *why* the market is reacting in a certain way. Is it due to risk-on sentiment, safe-haven demand, or something else? This context is vital. While the specific impact is uncertain until the meeting occurs (and is confirmed), being prepared and informed is always beneficial in the fast-paced crypto market. Conclusion: Navigating Geopolitical Crosscurrents in Crypto The reported meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and a Chinese delegation in London on June 9, while originating from a pseudonymous source, highlights the increasing intersection of geopolitics and the cryptocurrency market. Any significant interaction between these two global powers has the potential to influence global economic sentiment, trade relations, and regulatory landscapes, all of which can directly or indirectly impact the Bitcoin Price and the broader Crypto Market . From the potential shifts in US China Relations to the direct Geopolitical Impact on investor confidence and capital flows, the outcomes of such high-level discussions are relevant considerations for anyone involved in digital assets. While predicting the exact market reaction is impossible, staying informed about major geopolitical events and understanding their potential implications allows crypto participants to navigate the market with greater awareness and potentially make more strategic decisions.

As tech stocks show solid performance, certain cryptocurrencies promise even stronger growth. With the arrival of a bull run, digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) display potential. These coins seem poised for impressive gains, catching the eye of savvy investors. A new player, Codename:Pepe, adds intrigue to the mix. This cryptocurrency aims to disrupt the market with its unique use of AI. By leveraging advanced technology, it promises to help investors navigate the ever-changing landscape of meme coins. This fresh approach could yield significant returns, making it a vital asset to watch in the coming years. Codename:Pepe Merges AI Functionality with Viral Meme Coin Appeal Codename:Pepe is a new cryptocurrency project that combines AI-driven functionality with the viral appeal of meme coins, two of the most prominent trends today. Interest in AI-driven crypto projects has skyrocketed, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining more attention from investors. But not all AI tokens are created equal‚Äîmany simply use ""AI"" as a marketing buzzword without offering real value. Where Codename:Pepe Fits in the Crypto-AI Boom In contrast, Codename:Pepe aims to blend AI innovation with blockchain utility, while also calling out projects that fail to live up to their AI claims. This approach helps Codename:Pepe stand out in an increasingly crowded space. Codename:Pepe is designed to be an intelligent and adaptive platform. According to its developers, the project‚Äôs AI framework will be able to: Identify Emerging Meme Coins: By constantly monitoring social media and on-chain activity, Codename:Pepe spots early trends and high-potential tokens before they gain mainstream attention.

It goes through 28 stages, and its price increases incrementally. Those who buy $AGNT earlier get a bigger discount. Secure Your Codename:Pepe ($AGNT) Token Before the Next Price Increase What Makes $AGNT a Compelling Investment Choice Codename:Pepe combines two of the most attractive elements in today‚Äôs crypto market: AI-driven innovation and meme coin virality. The project‚Äôs focus on real AI capabilities and community-driven growth positions it as a standout among new crypto launches. With a limited presale supply and increasing price tiers, $AGNT offers early investors the potential for significant returns as adoption grows. The Codename:Pepe Community is Growing ‚Äì Join the Mission Now! Bitcoin's Rise: Could It Reach New Heights? Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency that changed how we think about money. Created in 2009 by an unknown person or group named Satoshi Nakamoto, it offers a way to send money directly between people without a bank or middleman. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin is a digital system where everyone shares the same record of transactions. This shared system ensures everyone agrees on who owns what, making it secure and trustworthy. Over the years, Bitcoin's value has seen big ups and downs. By 2025, it has reached new milestones, surpassing previous all-time highs. Many early investors have seen significant returns. Some experts believe Bitcoin will continue to rise. Predictions suggest it could reach prices as high as $1.5 million by 2030, according to Cathie Wood of Ark Invest. Others are less optimistic, like Warren Buffett, who doubts its long-term value. Whether Bitcoin will keep climbing depends on many factors, like demand and adoption by big institutions. While some are hopeful about its future, it's important to consider the risks. Bitcoin's journey is ongoing, and only time will tell if it will reach new heights. Solana: The Lightning-Fast Blockchain Transforming Digital Transactions Solana is a blockchain platform launched in 2020 by Anatoly Yakovenko, a former engineer at Qualcomm and Dropbox. It's designed to solve the speed and scalability problems of older networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana claims to process over 50,000 transactions per second with minimal fees, making it the fastest blockchain in the world. The secret behind Solana‚Äôs speed is its unique technology. It uses a system called Proof of History, which orders transactions efficiently. Combined with Proof of Stake, parallel processing, and data compression, Solana achieves high performance without sacrificing security. This makes it ideal for decentralized apps and services that need quick transactions. Since its launch, Solana has attracted many developers and investors. Its native token, SOL, has seen significant growth. In 2021, SOL's price soared, reflecting confidence in its technology and potential. This rapid rise caught the attention of both retail and institutional investors. In the current market, Solana looks promising. Its fast and scalable platform is appealing for many applications. While competition is fierce, Solana's innovative approach sets it apart. However, it's important to consider the challenges it faces, such as network outages and competition from other blockchains. Looking ahead, Solana's future will depend on continued adoption and technological advancements. While past performance is impressive, the cryptocurrency market is unpredictable. Investors should keep an eye on Solana's development and its ability to overcome challenges. Its potential to shape the future of blockchain technology makes it a project worth watching. Is XRP Set for a Breakthrough? Exploring Ripple's 2025 Prospects XRP, Ripple's cryptocurrency, aims to revolutionize global money transfers with speed and low costs. Its technology enables quick transactions between currencies, gaining support from banks. XRP's price has fluctuated. From under a cent in 2013 to $3.84 in 2018. Though it hasn't regained that peak by 2025, its technology and adoption suggest potential. Legal challenges with the SEC, resolved in 2024 with a penalty, caused uncertainty. But the settlement led to a price boost, showing renewed optimism for XRP. Experts have mixed long-term views. Some predict XRP reaching up to $45 by 2030; others expect modest growth. Market sentiment and partnerships will influence its future. With strong technology improving transactions, XRP is intriguing. Despite uncertainties, its potential rise makes it worth considering for future-minded investors in this market cycle. Cardano's Climb: ADA's Potential in the Current Market Cycle Cardano, launched in 2017, is a blockchain that uses a proof-of-stake system called Ouroboros. Unlike Bitcoin's energy-heavy proof-of-work method, Cardano focuses on sustainability and scalability. This eco-friendly approach makes it a standout in the crypto world. Built on peer-reviewed research, Cardano aims to host decentralized apps. Its token, ADA, is used for transactions and staking, allowing users to earn rewards by helping secure the network. In 2021, ADA reached a high of $3.10. Experts predict that with Bitcoin's halving leading to a bull market, ADA could rise significantly. Forecasts for 2030 range from $4.15 to as high as $28, suggesting strong growth potential. Opinions differ on ADA's future price. Some are bullish, predicting $8 in 2025, while others are more cautious, estimating under $1. This highlights the uncertainty in crypto predictions. In today's market, ADA seems attractive due to its strong fundamentals and growing developer interest. As Cardano continues to improve its technology, it could become more valuable. While the future is uncertain, many see great potential in Cardano. Conclusion In the current bullish market, traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), XRP, and Cardano (ADA) may see limited short-term growth. While they hold strong positions in the market, their immediate potential might not match the rapid advances some investors are seeking. Emerging as a noteworthy contender, Codename:Pepe crypto leverages true artificial intelligence to maximize profits. By using advanced AI for market analysis, automated trading, and offering exclusive signals through a community-driven approach, it presents a unique opportunity. This innovative strategy positions Codename:Pepe crypto as a potential alternative for those looking for higher growth prospects in the near term.

Anthropic‚Äôs broader goals centered around openness, AI Safety , and sustainability in AI development. The Shift Towards Agentic AI One of the most compelling points from the discussion with Jared Kaplan was Anthropic‚Äôs strategic pivot away from simply developing chatbots. While models like Claude are powerful conversational tools, the company is increasingly focused on building Agentic AI systems. These are AI systems designed not just to converse, but to perform real-world tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. This shift represents a significant evolution in AI capabilities, moving towards systems that can understand goals, plan actions, and execute them across various environments, potentially revolutionizing how businesses and individuals interact with technology. Building Enterprise Trust and AI Safety A core challenge for widespread AI adoption, especially within large organizations, is trust. How can enterprises rely on AI systems to handle sensitive data or critical operations? The interview touched upon what it means to build Anthropic AI that enterprises can actually trust. This involves not only technical reliability and performance but also transparency, interpretability, and robust AI Safety measures. Kaplan discussed how building trustworthy AI impacts the fundamental ways humans interact with software, their work processes, and even each other, emphasizing the profound societal implications of deploying powerful AI systems responsibly. Internal Tools Shaping the Future The conversation also shed light on Anthropic‚Äôs internal development practices. Tools like ‚ÄòClaude Code‚Äô were mentioned as examples of how AI is being used within the company itself to accelerate and improve the process of building AI. Using advanced models like Claude AI for internal development tasks, such as code generation or analysis, demonstrates a practical application of their technology and provides valuable feedback loops for model improvement. This internal innovation loop is likely shaping the capabilities of future Agentic AI systems and other Anthropic products. Summary: A Glimpse into Anthropic‚Äôs Vision The conversation with Jared Kaplan provides a valuable look into Anthropic‚Äôs strategic direction. From significant funding rounds and model advancements like Claude AI , to a deliberate pivot towards sophisticated Agentic AI systems capable of performing complex tasks, Anthropic is positioning itself as a leader in the next generation of AI. Their strong emphasis on AI Safety , openness, and building enterprise trust underscores a commitment to responsible development as they pursue ambitious goals under the guidance of leaders like Jared Kaplan . As AI continues to integrate with various sectors, including the cryptocurrency world, understanding the vision of key players like Anthropic is essential for navigating the future landscape.

The rules governing the process will enter into force this year, with the automatic exchange of crypto data with interested partners scheduled to begin in 2027. Switzerland to exchange crypto data with EU but not US The Federal Council of Switzerland, the highest authority in the Confederacy, has approved a list of ‚Äúpartner states‚Äù that will receive crypto-related information from the Alpine nation. ‚ÄúEntry into force is planned for 2026, with the first exchange of data taking place in 2027,‚Äù the Council highlighted in a press release on Friday, following its meeting in Bern. The executive body said: ‚ÄúIn the bill adopted today, the Federal Council is proposing 74 countries relevant to the crypto market with which Switzerland should automatically exchange information concerning crypto assets.‚Äù The group includes all 27 member states of the European Union, the United Kingdom as well as most G20 countries with some notable exceptions ‚Äì the United States and Saudi Arabia, the announcement detailed. An exchange should only take place if the partners are interested in sharing information with Switzerland, the Federal Council emphasized. They are also expected to fulfil the requirements of the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework ( CARF ) introduced by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ). The OECD developed CARF as a set of rules guiding the reporting of cryptocurrency transactions and compliance with global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regulations. The Swiss list of nations approved for international automatic exchange of information (AEOI) comes out on February 19 this year, the Council adopted a dispatch on the international and national legal bases for crypto data sharing. The legislation is still under consideration in the Federal Assembly, the Swiss parliament, and the AEOI for crypto assets is due to enter into force on January 1, 2026, the press release noted. Bern to check compliance with Swiss standards before sending info The Swiss Federal Council pointed out that it will assess whether the approved partner states continue to fulfil the AEOI requirements prior to any exchange of crypto data. It elaborated: ‚ÄúTo this end, the existing review mechanism for the AEOI on financial account information should in future also cover the AEOI concerning crypto assets, which requires the corresponding federal decree to be amended accordingly.‚Äù Switzerland was known for its bank secrecy enshrined in national law to ensure the confidentiality of client information, including account details and transactions. But over the years, the country has been dealing with increased pressure from partners to share more financial information. The authorities in Bern now believe that the transfer of crypto-related data will help Switzerland to fulfill its international obligations on tax transparency and improve the reputation of its financial sector. Creating a level playing field for Swiss crypto firms has been set as an objective as well. A few years ago, Switzerland established a ‚Äúcrypto valley‚Äù in Zug to welcome companies working with digital assets from around the world. While it has been described as a Bitcoin-friendly destination, the country is currently not among the leaders in terms of crypto adoption . Switzerland‚Äôs financial authorities have maintained a cautious approach regarding cryptocurrencies lately. In April, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) rejected calls to add Bitcoin (BTC) to its reserves, citing concerns over the liquidity and volatility of the crypto with the largest market cap. The Federal Council is Switzerland‚Äôs top executive body acting as the nation‚Äôs federal cabinet. It has seven members, each heading a department, who are elected by the Swiss parliament and serve as a collective head of state with a rotating presidency.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Solana dips and Tron gains, Unilabs Finance surges 22%, drawing investor interest amid market volatility. Many investors and traders have shown concerns after the Solana price plunged $142. Meanwhile, the Tron price has increased on the weekly timeframe amid market volatility. But as uncertainty looms, a new DeFi cryptocurrency called Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is defying the odds. With a recent 22% price surge and growing investor attention, this AI-powered platform is gaining traction. You might also like: Tron and Unilabs battle set to soar above the $1 mark, Binance Coin suffers volatility Solana forming cup-and-handle pattern According to Ted Pillows, one of the most famous crypto analysts on X, the Solana price may be set for a reversal. He told his followers the Solana price is forming a potential cup-and-handle after a recent downtrend hit the market on Thursday. Meanwhile, Ted believes the correction would not last due to increased network activity. Data from CryptoDep reveals the Solana network had the highest number of monthly active users, topping the likes of Near Protocol and BNBChain. Therefore, Ted believes that the Solana price will retest the $140‚Äì$145 zone before a rebound takes place. In the meantime, the Solana price witnessed a sharp decline on Thursday. According to CoinMarketCap data, the price of Solana has dropped by about 9.5% in the weekly timeframe. Although the Solana price dropped as low as $142, bulls are currently forcing an uptrend. However, if market sentiment improves, the Solana price could recover the $150 level in the next few days. Tron price rises; Analyst predict massive upside The price of Tron is going against market sentiment, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The value of the DeFi token has increased by 2.1% and 12.7% on the weekly and monthly charts. On a wider scale, the Tron price has been on an upward movement in the past three years. Nevertheless, the Tron price faces strong resistance around the $0.28 region. If the Tron price fails to cross this level, it could drop to the $0.26 support. However, analysts like Ahmad Mustafa think that the Tron price could break out of the current consolidation in the coming weeks. The analyst noted the Tron price is ready for an explosive move. Ahmad forecasts the Tron coin price could rally to two targets: $0.41 and $0.44. Another expert, Zola Christian, notes the overall sentiment surrounding the Tron price is bullish. The crypto enthusiast believes a major rally would begin once the TRX price breaks past the $0.30 resistance. Unilabs Finance: Leading the next movement in AI-driven crypto investment Unilabs Finance is a cutting-edge crypto project designed to simplify and enhance decentralized investing using artificial intelligence. Unilabs Finance is an AI-based investment fund management platform that allows users to invest in crypto assets that are handpicked and invested in algorithmically optimized portfolios.

Compared to top crypto coins like Solana, Unilabs Finance focuses more on intelligent capital allocation than just network performance. While Solana offers speed, Unilabs Finance provides value-focused returns through adaptive AI strategies. Also, the native token, UNIL, unlocks several key benefits. Holders can stake their tokens for passive income, participate in governance decisions, and even enjoy a share of platform-generated revenue, making it one of the few projects aligning user incentives with ecosystem growth. Unilabs Finance also features a unique 12-tiered rewards system, rewarding early adopters and long-term holders with exclusive bonuses and higher staking yields. Backed by strong community engagement and innovative tech, the value of UNIL could rise from its current level of $0.0062 to $0.1 by 2025, especially as AI continues to reshape finance. Those seeking reward-rich opportunities in crypto can consider joining the ongoing Unilabs Finance presale. Why UNIL is the best crypto to buy today While the Solana price struggles to maintain momentum, Tron could see explosive growth if it breaks the $0.30 barrier. Meanwhile, Unilabs Finance is blazing a different trail. Its AI-driven investment model and user-focused rewards system are turning heads, especially among seasoned investors seeking value. This newcomer could be the best crypto to buy for investors who want to grow their portfolios and join the next band of crypto millionaires.

A 5% decline in overall market value brought crypto capitalisation down to $3.38 trillion by late Asian trading hours on Friday. Sentiment weakened in tandem, with the Fear and Greed Index retreating to 45 for the first time since April. Altcoins posted a sluggish performance, with most major tokens ending the week in the red, while a few managed to notch modest gains. Why is Bitcoin going down? Bitcoin started the week on shaky ground, weighed down by global risk aversion sparked by stalled trade talks between the U.S. and China and renewed Russia-Ukraine tensions. Analysts warned that markets had begun pricing out hopes of a resolution amid a lack of progress on peace negotiations. Sentiment worsened as reports emerged that, though President Donald Trump had been involved in backchannel talks, no formal statements followed. By midweek, profit-taking added to the pressure. Glassnode data showed entity-adjusted realised profit surpassing $500 million per hour multiple times, the most aggressive selling since early February. This came as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell held a cautious line on interest rates, saying further data was needed before considering cuts. Tensions escalated further on June 5 following a public spat between Trump and Elon Musk, who had previously been political allies. Musk criticised Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúBig Beautiful Bill‚Äù and supported calls for impeachment. Trump responded by threatening to end Musk‚Äôs government contracts, triggering a sharp decline in market sentiment. Bitcoin dropped 5.2% to $100,400 on Bitstamp, sparking panic selling and a wave of liquidations totalling $979.9 million. Long positions accounted for $874 million, the largest single-day wipeout since February 25. By June 6, stronger-than-expected U.S. labour market data helped Bitcoin recover past $104,000. However, uncertainty lingered as Trump again urged a full percentage point rate cut, calling Powell ‚Äútoo late‚Äù and comparing the Fed unfavourably to European central banks that have already cut rates. Will Bitcoin crash? Most analysts remained cautious, with several pointing to growing downside risks amid weakening market structure and shifting liquidity zones. According to CryptoQuant‚Äôs Axel Adler Junior, the next key support level lies near the short-term holder (STH) realised price at around $97,500, a zone that may act as a cushion if current levels fail. Bitcoin Long Liquidations. Source: Axel Adler Jr This aligns with broader on-chain metrics suggesting a heightened probability of further downside, especially as long-term holders remain relatively inactive. Meanwhile, popular trader TheKingfisher observed a concentration of long liquidation levels between $99,000 and $102,000, describing the zone as a ‚Äúhuge magnetic area‚Äù that could attract price action lower. In contrast, short liquidation zones above $104,500 were sparse, creating what he called a ‚Äústrong imbalance‚Äù that increases the risk of a downward liquidity cascade. He warned that while retail traders may interpret the range as support, it could instead be a classic liquidation trap, a setup that draws in longs before a sharp breakdown. Trader Roman echoed that sentiment, noting that Bitcoin‚Äôs high-timeframe charts are ‚Äúbearish all over‚Äù and suggesting that a breakdown is already underway.

Even among those with a bullish outlook, there‚Äôs growing recognition that Bitcoin may face more short-term pressure before any meaningful rebound.

While the indicator continues to point lower, he suggested a reversal signal could emerge within the next week if momentum stabilises.

While markets widely expect the Federal Reserve to hold rates steady at its June 18 meeting, with CME‚Äôs FedWatch Tool showing a 97.5% probability of no change, Pruscino believes a surprise shift in timing could catch investors off guard. If the Fed cuts rates ‚Äúa lot sooner than expected,‚Äù it could act as a major upside catalyst for crypto, with Bitcoin potentially targeting the psychological level of $112,000, he told the media in recent comments. However, ‚Äúthere needs to be a continuation of improved risk sentiment‚Äù and clearer signals on trade policy before the rally can resume, he added. Pruscino also pointed to the lingering uncertainty caused by President Trump‚Äôs tariff threats, which he said may complicate the Fed‚Äôs decision-making. While the central bank has ‚Äúenough data‚Äù to consider cuts, shifting trade dynamics could keep policymakers in wait-and-watch mode. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was hovering near $105,000, down 0.4% on the week after giving up most of its early gains. Altcoin market tanks Over the past week, the altcoin market cap initially rose 9% to $1.34 trillion on June 4, but later saw a sharp correction to $1.2 trillion, resulting in a weekly loss of approximately 2.4% as of the time of writing. The Altcoin Season Index stands at 25, a strong indication that Bitcoin remains the dominant factor influencing the broader cryptocurrency market sentiment. Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin by market cap, fell 3.5% over the past 7 days, priced at $2,500 as of press time with a market cap of over $300 billion, while other large-cap altcoins like BNB (BNB), Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) experiencing losses ranging between 3-10%. Sky (SKY) led the highest gains this week, up 11.6%, which raised its market cap to over $1.57 billion, while Hyperliquid (HYPE) and SPX6900 (SPX) followed with gains of little over 10% each. Source: CoinMarketCap SKY rallied following the launch of USDS staking rewards for SKY holders, prompting many investors to swap their MKR tokens for SKY to earn 50% of the platform‚Äôs surplus USDS revenue. HYPE locked in some profits after securing a Binance.US listing, while SPX rallied on community-driven hype around its satirical bid to ‚Äúflip‚Äù the traditional stock market and draw in more investors.

As Cardano struggles, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a bold contender in the crypto market, eyeing a $1 milestone in 2025. Cardano‚Äôs bearish streak persists Cardano price falters, unable to breach $0.700, signaling weak momentum.

With AI investments hitting a staggering $110 billion in 2024, the landscape for AI investment is more competitive and complex than ever. For anyone navigating the crypto space or the broader tech market, discerning real opportunities from fleeting trends is key. Fortunately, a recent panel at Bitcoin World Sessions: AI brought together leading venture capital experts to shed light on what truly matters in securing funding for AI ventures heading into 2025. Why is the AI Funding Landscape So Competitive? Understanding AI Funding Trends The sheer volume of capital poured into artificial intelligence in 2024 signals a significant shift. $110 billion isn‚Äôt just a number; it represents intense competition for both investors seeking the next big thing and startups vying for attention. This surge is driven by several factors: Transformative Potential: AI isn‚Äôt just a feature; it‚Äôs becoming foundational to many industries, promising efficiency gains, new products, and disruptive business models. Increased Accessibility: Advancements in open-source tools and cloud computing have lowered the barrier to entry for developing AI applications, leading to a proliferation of startups. Market Hype: While the panel discussed cutting through it, the undeniable hype surrounding AI, particularly generative AI, attracts significant speculative capital. Understanding these AI funding trends is the first step. It highlights why simply having an ‚ÄòAI‚Äô label isn‚Äôt enough anymore. Investors are looking for substance, differentiation, and a clear path to value creation in a crowded market. What Do Venture Capital AI Firms *Really* Look For? The panel featured insights from seasoned investors: Jill Chase, a partner at CapitalG; Kanu Gulati, a partner at Khosla; and Sara Ittelson, a partner at Accell. A key point they emphasized is that founders often overthink the ‚Äòperfect pitch‚Äô. While a clear presentation is necessary, the pitch is merely a gateway to evaluating the core elements venture capital AI firms prioritize. What truly captures their attention and unlocks funding? It goes beyond slick slides: The Team: Who are the founders? Do they have the domain expertise, technical chops, and resilience to navigate challenges? Is the team coachable and aligned? This is often cited as the single most important factor. Market Opportunity: Is there a large, addressable market? Does the AI solution solve a real, painful problem for customers? Investors look for clear market validation. Execution Capability: Can the team build and ship the product? Can they acquire customers and generate revenue? Past execution success is a strong indicator of future potential. Defensibility: Why will this company succeed where others might fail? Is there proprietary technology, data advantage, network effects, or unique market positioning? Traction: Early signs of customer adoption, revenue, or user growth are powerful signals that the concept is resonating. The panelists suggested that while the AI technology itself is important, it must be viewed through the lens of these fundamental business drivers. A brilliant algorithm with no clear market or a weak team is less compelling than a solid team tackling a real problem with a practical AI application. Where Will AI Investment Flow in 2025? Predicting the future is challenging, but based on current dynamics and investor focus, certain areas are likely to see significant AI investment in 2025. While specific niches were discussed, broader themes emerged: Applied AI in Enterprise: Solutions that deliver clear ROI for businesses (e.g., improving workflows, enhancing customer service, automating tasks) across various sectors like healthcare, finance, logistics, and manufacturing. AI Infrastructure: Companies building the picks and shovels for the AI revolution, including specialized hardware (beyond just GPUs), data management tools, AI development platforms, and deployment/monitoring solutions. Vertical AI Solutions: Deeply specialized AI applications tailored for specific industries where general AI models fall short. AI Safety and Security: As AI becomes more powerful, solutions addressing ethical AI, bias detection, security vulnerabilities, and responsible deployment will become increasingly critical and attract investment. Edge AI: Bringing AI processing closer to the data source on devices, reducing latency and increasing privacy, relevant for IoT, robotics, and autonomous systems. Investors are moving past generalized AI promises and seeking concrete applications that solve real-world problems or build essential infrastructure for the future of AI. Navigating Tech Funding 2025: Challenges and Opportunities The high level of AI investment also presents challenges. Valuations can be inflated, the market is noisy, and differentiating your startup requires significant effort. For startups seeking tech funding 2025, key challenges include: High Competition: Standing out among numerous AI startups. Talent Wars: Attracting and retaining skilled AI engineers and researchers. Proving ROI: Clearly demonstrating the business value of your AI solution beyond technical novelty. Navigating Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape around AI is still developing. However, opportunities abound for those who can effectively navigate these challenges. The market for effective AI solutions is vast and growing.

One such transformation is happening in the automotive sector, specifically concerning how companies like Toyota are embracing artificial intelligence. While many brands talk about AI concepts, bringing these ideas into practical, large-scale production to solve significant business problems remains a challenge. This is where the collaboration between NLX and Toyota offers valuable lessons, providing actionable insights on moving AI from prototype to powerful enterprise tool. The Challenge of AI Implementation in Large Enterprises Implementing AI within a vast organization like Toyota is far more complex than building a simple demo. It involves navigating layers of bureaucracy, integrating with legacy systems, and ensuring widespread adoption by employees. NLX co-founder and CEO Andrei Papancea and Kordel France, principal AI engineer at Toyota, shared their experiences on this journey. They highlighted that technical prowess is only one piece of the puzzle. The human and organizational elements are equally critical. Key hurdles in the AI implementation process often include: Securing executive buy-in and maintaining support throughout the project lifecycle. Integrating new AI technologies with existing, often complex, IT infrastructure. Managing change within the workforce, ensuring employees are trained and comfortable using new AI tools. Defining clear, measurable objectives for AI projects to demonstrate tangible value. Solving Business Problems with AI : A Practical Approach Toyota and NLX focused on using AI not for futuristic concepts, but for addressing immediate, pressing business needs within their car repair and service operations. This practical approach is key to demonstrating return on investment and gaining organizational momentum. Instead of broadly applying AI, they targeted specific pain points where AI could provide clear efficiency gains or improve customer experience. Examples of solving business problems with AI in this context could include: Predictive maintenance: Using AI to analyze vehicle data and predict potential failures before they occur, optimizing service schedules. Automated diagnostics: Developing AI systems to assist technicians in quickly identifying complex issues based on vehicle symptoms and historical data. Optimizing parts inventory: Using AI to forecast demand for specific parts, reducing waste and ensuring availability. Enhancing customer communication: Implementing AI-powered chatbots or virtual assistants to handle routine inquiries about service appointments or repair status. By focusing on these concrete applications, Toyota and NLX could clearly articulate the value proposition to stakeholders. Insights from Toyota AI Initiatives Toyota‚Äôs exploration of AI is not new, but their collaboration with NLX highlights a shift towards operationalizing these technologies. The insights shared emphasize the importance of starting small, demonstrating success, and then scaling proven solutions. Kordel France from Toyota likely elaborated on how their engineering teams worked closely with NLX to tailor AI models to the specific nuances of vehicle diagnostics and repair workflows. Lessons learned from Toyota AI projects often involve: Cross-functional collaboration between AI experts, engineers, and frontline service staff. Iterative development, starting with pilot programs in limited locations before wider rollout. Focusing on data quality and accessibility, which are foundational for effective AI. Measuring impact rigorously to quantify benefits like reduced repair times or increased accuracy. These initiatives underscore that successful Toyota AI deployments are as much about process and people as they are about technology. Navigating the Path to Enterprise AI Success The journey from an AI idea to a fully integrated Enterprise AI solution is fraught with challenges. NLX, as a technology partner, likely brought expertise in building scalable AI platforms, while Toyota provided the domain knowledge and the real-world testing ground. Their shared experience underscores that successful Enterprise AI requires a partnership approach. Key elements for navigating the path to Enterprise AI success: Phase Key Considerations Concept & Planning Identify specific business problems; secure executive sponsorship; define success metrics. Development & Piloting Build minimum viable product; ensure data readiness; test in controlled environment; gather user feedback. Integration & Scaling Integrate with existing systems; develop training programs; plan for infrastructure needs; monitor performance. Change Management & Adoption Communicate value to users; provide ongoing support; address resistance; celebrate successes. This structured approach helps large organizations manage the complexity inherent in deploying AI at scale. The Future of AI in Automotive Service The work done by companies like Toyota and NLX in areas like repair and maintenance is just the beginning of leveraging AI in automotive . As vehicles become more connected and complex, the role of AI in diagnosing, maintaining, and even repairing them autonomously will grow. This not only impacts service centers but also influences vehicle design and manufacturing processes. The broader implications of AI in automotive include: Improved vehicle reliability and safety through predictive analytics. More efficient and cost-effective service operations. Enhanced customer satisfaction due to faster and more accurate repairs. Potential for new business models based on AI-driven services. The practical steps taken today are paving the way for a future where AI is deeply embedded in every aspect of the automotive lifecycle. Conclusion The collaboration between Toyota and NLX provides a compelling case study on successfully implementing AI to solve real-world business problems. Their experience highlights that moving AI from the lab to large-scale production requires a holistic approach, addressing not just the technology but also executive buy-in, integration challenges, and change management. By focusing on tangible outcomes and adopting a structured implementation strategy, enterprises can unlock the significant potential of AI, driving efficiency, improving operations, and enhancing customer experiences, proving that practical AI is not just possible, but is already delivering powerful results in traditional industries.

From refining product features to chasing funding rounds and managing a growing team, the mental load is immense. This constant context-switching is not just tiring; it can hinder focus and strategic thinking. But what if there was a way to offload some of this burden, not just to an employee, but to an entity with perfect recall and endless availability? This is the bold vision behind the concept of an AI co-founder . Kisson Lin, CEO of Tanka, articulated this groundbreaking idea at a Bitcoin World Sessions event focused on AI. She highlighted the impossible demands placed on today‚Äôs founders and proposed AI as a potential solution. Unlike human counterparts, an AI co-founder wouldn‚Äôt require sleep, vacations, or grapple with emotional fatigue. It could theoretically handle routine, data-intensive, or highly repetitive tasks, freeing up human founders to focus on high-level strategy, creativity, and human-centric leadership. Why Consider an AI Co-Founder for Your Startup? The arguments for integrating advanced AI into the core leadership structure of a startup are compelling, addressing several pain points commonly experienced by human teams. The potential benefits paint a picture of a more efficient, resilient, and data-driven organization: Reduced Equity Dilution: A human co-founder typically requires a significant equity stake. An AI co-founder, while requiring investment in technology and maintenance, doesn‚Äôt dilute ownership in the same way, potentially leaving more equity for employees, investors, or the human founders. Infinite Availability and Perfect Memory: AI doesn‚Äôt forget details from past meetings, misplace documents, or need downtime. It can access and process vast amounts of information instantly, providing founders with data-driven insights whenever needed, 24/7. This is crucial for staying on top of market trends, customer feedback, and operational metrics. Objective Decision-Making: While human intuition is invaluable, it can be swayed by bias or emotion. An AI can process data points objectively, identifying patterns and recommending decisions based purely on logic and predefined parameters. This could be particularly useful in areas like pricing, resource allocation, or identifying market opportunities. Handling Repetitive & Data-Intensive Tasks: Many aspects of running a startup involve repetitive tasks or sifting through large datasets ‚Äì think analyzing customer support logs, monitoring competitor activity, generating standard reports, or managing routine communications. An AI co-founder could automate these, ensuring consistency and freeing human time. Scalability: As a startup grows, the workload increases exponentially. A human co-founder‚Äôs capacity is limited. An AI co-founder, built on scalable infrastructure, can handle growing volumes of data and tasks without hitting the same bottlenecks, supporting rapid expansion. Consistent Communication: An AI could manage routine investor updates, internal reports, or even initial customer interactions with consistent tone and accuracy, ensuring stakeholders are always informed. These advantages suggest that integrating AI at the co-founder level could fundamentally alter the operational dynamics and growth trajectory of tech startups . What Challenges Lie Ahead for AI in Startups? Despite the exciting potential, the concept of an AI co-founder is not without significant hurdles. Adopting such a revolutionary model requires addressing complex technical, ethical, and practical considerations: Lack of Human Intuition and Creativity: AI excels at pattern recognition and data processing but lacks the nuanced intuition, creative problem-solving, and abstract thinking that human founders bring, especially in navigating ambiguous situations or developing truly novel ideas. Ethical and Trust Considerations: Who is responsible when an AI makes a poor decision? How do you build trust among employees, investors, and customers when a key leader is not human? The ethical implications of autonomous AI leadership are profound and largely unexplored in a business context. Technical Limitations and Bias: Current AI models, while advanced, can still exhibit bias based on the data they were trained on. Ensuring an AI co-founder makes fair and unbiased decisions requires careful design, monitoring, and continuous refinement. The technology is also constantly evolving, requiring ongoing investment and expertise. Legal and Regulatory Status: Can an AI legally be a co-founder? How would equity be represented? What are the liabilities? The legal frameworks surrounding AI ownership and responsibility are still in their infancy, creating significant uncertainty. Building Company Culture: A human co-founder plays a crucial role in shaping company culture, motivating teams, and providing emotional leadership. An AI cannot replicate this vital human element, potentially leading to a less connected or motivated workforce. Initial Investment and Expertise: Developing or acquiring an AI capable of acting as a co-founder would require substantial initial investment and access to specialized AI talent for implementation and maintenance. These challenges highlight that while the vision is compelling, the path to widespread adoption of AI in startups is complex and requires careful navigation. How Could AI Co-Founders Function in Practice? Moving from concept to reality, how might an AI co-founder actually integrate into the day-to-day operations of a startup? While the full scope is speculative, several areas seem ripe for AI-driven co-leadership: Automated Investor Relations: The AI could track key metrics, generate automated performance reports, schedule update calls, and even draft initial versions of investor communications based on predefined templates and real-time data. Data-Driven Product Management: Analyzing user feedback, bug reports, feature requests, and usage data at scale to identify priorities, track development progress, and even suggest feature improvements based on user behavior patterns. Operational Efficiency & Resource Allocation: Monitoring project timelines, resource usage, budget expenditure, and identifying potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies, suggesting adjustments for optimal performance. Market Analysis and Competitive Intelligence: Continuously scanning market trends, competitor moves, regulatory changes, and technological advancements, providing the human founder with synthesized, actionable intelligence. Augmented Team Support: Handling routine HR queries, managing scheduling complexities, tracking OKRs or KPIs, and providing data-backed insights into team performance (while respecting privacy), allowing human leaders to focus on mentorship and strategic team building. Financial Modeling and Fundraising Preparation: Assisting with complex financial projections, scenario planning, and compiling data rooms for fundraising, ensuring accuracy and speed. In essence, the AI co-founder could act as a hyper-efficient, data-crunching engine, providing the human founder with the insights and bandwidth needed to make better strategic decisions and focus on the human aspects of leadership and innovation. This redefines the role of the human startup founder , shifting it towards vision, culture, and complex problem-solving. Integrating AI into the Startup Workflow: A Phased Approach? Adopting an AI co-founder isn‚Äôt likely to be an overnight switch. It would more realistically involve a phased integration, starting with specific functions and gradually expanding the AI‚Äôs responsibilities as trust and capabilities grow. This could look like: Automation of Routine Tasks: Begin by using AI tools to automate specific, well-defined processes like data entry, report generation, or initial customer support triage. AI as an Advisor/Analyst: Introduce AI systems that analyze data and provide recommendations to human founders and team members, without making autonomous decisions. This builds familiarity and trust in the AI‚Äôs insights. Delegation of Specific Responsibilities: Once confidence is established, delegate specific, bounded areas of responsibility to the AI, such as managing a particular type of communication or overseeing a specific operational metric. True AI Co-Founder Integration: Reaching the point where the AI operates as a strategic partner, involved in higher-level discussions and decision-making processes, requires a significant leap in AI capability, trust, and legal/ethical frameworks. This gradual approach allows organizations to learn, adapt, and build the necessary infrastructure and trust required for the widespread adoption of AI in startups at the leadership level. What Does the Future of Startups Hold with AI Partners? Looking ahead, the rise of the AI co-founder could profoundly reshape the landscape for tech startups . We might see: Faster Iteration Cycles: With AI handling operational overhead and providing rapid insights, startups could move from idea to execution and iteration much faster. Different Funding Models: Investors might evaluate startups differently, potentially placing higher value on the AI‚Äôs capabilities and the human founder‚Äôs ability to leverage it effectively. The capital required for certain operational roles might decrease. Altered Team Structures: Teams might become leaner in administrative roles, with human talent focusing more on creative, strategic, and interpersonal functions, working in close collaboration with AI systems. New Business Models: The capabilities of AI co-founders could enable entirely new types of businesses or operational models that were previously too complex or data-intensive for human teams alone. The vision of the future of startups includes AI not just as a tool, but as an integral partner, augmenting human potential and driving innovation at an unprecedented pace. Key Takeaways for Aspiring and Current Founders While a fully autonomous AI co-founder might still be some time away, the underlying principles are relevant now. Founders should consider: Experimenting with AI Tools: Integrate current AI technologies into your workflow for specific tasks like data analysis, content generation, or automation to understand their capabilities and limitations. Focusing on Human-AI Collaboration: Think about how AI can augment your skills and those of your team, rather than simply replace roles. The most powerful future likely involves effective human-AI partnerships. Understanding AI‚Äôs Limitations: Be aware that AI lacks human empathy, creativity, and nuanced understanding. Critical strategic decisions and team leadership will remain firmly in the human domain for the foreseeable future. Staying Informed: The field of AI is evolving rapidly. Keep abreast of new developments and consider how they might apply to your business challenges. The journey towards integrating AI into the fabric of startup leadership is just beginning, promising both immense opportunity and significant challenges. In conclusion, Kisson Lin‚Äôs vision of the AI co-founder is a powerful concept that forces us to rethink the fundamental structure and operation of startups. By leveraging AI‚Äôs strengths ‚Äì infinite memory, tireless availability, and data processing power ‚Äì founders could potentially overcome the crushing burden of constant context-switching, reduce equity dilution, and accelerate growth. However, the path is lined with significant technical, ethical, and practical challenges that require careful consideration and innovation. While the fully autonomous AI co-founder is a future prospect, the current capabilities of AI offer valuable lessons and tools for today‚Äôs startup founder , pointing towards a future where human ingenuity is augmented, not replaced, by artificial intelligence, ultimately shaping the exciting future of startups .

One of the best projects right now is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is on the cusp of changing Defi forever. Let us take a deep dive into this transformative project. Technological innovation Powers Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to transform the Defi industry with technical innovation. It does not simply aim to be another project in the Defi space; it aims to be the go-to project for all Defi investors seeking out long-term growth. This innovation can be seen in the design of its lending protocol. Lenders on the protocol can deposit their funds in a pool governed by an audited smart contract. Once in the pool, funds begin to accumulate interest at a rate defined by the pool‚Äôs utilization rate. The utilization rate is a measure of the amount of borrowed assets against the total assets in the pool. When most of the pool‚Äôs assets are in use, the interest rate rises. This encourages borrowers to repay their loans, while also incentivizing lenders to deposit more funds into the pools to earn higher yields. In the reverse, when the pool‚Äôs utilization rate drops, borrowers are incentivized to take more loans at the low rates, while the number of lenders goes down. That causes the rate to rise again, creating a self-sustaining cycle. The result is that the pool achieves optimal capital efficiency without external interference. Protocol Safeguards On Mutuum Finance The Mutuum Finance project is based on a philosophy of finding a balance between encouraging mass adoption and protecting the protocol‚Äôs solvency in the long term. To achieve this, it carefully examines assets that can be used on the protocol. Overcollateralization One of the most basic safeguards used on Mutuum Finance is overcollateralization. It simply means that when borrowers take a loan, they must provide collateral that is of a higher value than the loan. This ensures that there is sufficient headroom in case of market volatility. If a position sinks below an established threshold, then it becomes eligible for liquidation. The liquidators are offered a chance to buy the debt at a discount, which ensures there is a buffer between assets and liabilities on the platform. Deposit And Borrow Caps These caps are used to establish an upper limit on how much of an asset can be borrowed or deposited. It helps to limit the exposure of the protocol to some assets, which may have low liquidity or high volatility. Additionally, it mitigates against exploits related to unlimited asset minting. To determine caps, factors like on-chain volume, price stability, and historical price data are used. The borrow caps are used to reduce the chances of insolvency due to manipulated price fluctuations. Restricted Collateralization Mutuum Finance may categorize certain tokens under the Restricted Collateralization Mode. This mode sees a single collateral asset used only for borrowing the same asset, with strict limitations. For instance, if the oracle data is unreliable, restricting usage ensures there is no system-wide impact due to rapid price changes. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency For assets that are known to have correlated price movements, such as popular stablecoins, Mutuum Finance can use the Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE) mode. In this mode, users have elevated borrowing limits when the collateral and loan assets are in the same group. The main benefits are improved capital efficiency while ensuring there is no system-wide impact. Only tokens that demonstrate consistent pegs and near-identical behavior qualify for ECE. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio The LTV ratio limits how much a user may borrow in relation to the value of their assets. For instance, an 80% LTV means that a user who pledges 1 ADA worth of collateral can only borrow up to 0.80 ADA worth of another asset. The LTV of an open position is dynamically set by the changing value of an asset over time. Liquidation Threshold A liquidation threshold is triggered when the debt becomes undercollateralized. For instance, if the threshold is set at 80% of the value of the collateral, and it drops below it, a liquidation is triggered. When that happens, liquidators can acquire the collateral at a discount, which protects the long-term stability of the ecosystem. Liquidation Penalty When a position is liquidated, a liquidation penalty applies, which is equivalent to the liquidation bonus the liquidator receives. A portion of this amount may go to the protocol treasury, where it is used as part of the risk module. An allocation factor is used to determine how much of the penalty goes to the liquidator and the treasury. It helps to balance incentives for liquidations with the long-term solvency of the ecosystem. The Reserve Factor A reserve factor collects some of the interest from the borrower. An aggregate is used to collect assets and is used to offset any potential default during extreme market movements. Tokens with higher stability feature a small reserve factor and vice versa. Success Of The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The unique technical innovations mentioned above have resonated with crypto investors and led to a surge in interest in the presale. So far, the presale has received over $10.1 million from investors. Over 11,700 investors have taken part in the presale, which is currently in phase. The pace of the phase 5 presale has been quite fast, with over 1% of the tokens set aside already sold. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will go up by 16.67%, reducing the guaranteed ROI to 71.43% from the current 100%. As such, this phase presents your best opportunity to be part of a revolutionary crypto project that will transform Defi forever.

For those navigating the fast-paced cryptocurrency and blockchain space, understanding the broader technological landscape, including the crucial domain of AI Safety , is essential. The rapid evolution of AI brings incredible opportunities, but also presents complex challenges that demand careful consideration. A recent critical discussion brought together key voices to explore these very issues. The Urgent Need for AI Safety The conversation, featuring ElevenLabs‚Äô Head of AI Safety Artemis Seaford and Databricks co-founder Ion Stoica, alongside Bitcoin World AI editor Kyle Wiggers, highlighted a pressing reality: the stakes for ensuring AI is safe and beneficial have never been higher. The accessibility of sophisticated AI models means more people can deploy powerful tools, sometimes without a full understanding of the potential consequences. This democratization of AI technology necessitates a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating risks before they cause significant harm. The discussion centered on why prioritizing AI Safety is not just a technical challenge but a societal imperative. As AI systems are integrated into critical infrastructure, financial systems, and information channels, ensuring their reliability, robustness, and safety becomes paramount. Failures or malicious uses of AI could have widespread and damaging effects. Experts stressed that safety considerations must be woven into the fabric of AI development from the earliest stages, rather than being treated as an afterthought. Key areas of concern regarding AI Safety include: Unintended Consequences: AI systems behaving in ways not predicted by their creators. Security Vulnerabilities: AI models being susceptible to attacks that compromise their function or data. Systemic Risks: The potential for widespread disruption if interconnected AI systems fail or are compromised. Addressing these points requires collaboration across industry, academia, and policy-making bodies. The insights from leaders at companies like Databricks, which provides the infrastructure for scaling AI, and ElevenLabs, which works with advanced generative models, offer valuable perspectives on the practical challenges and potential solutions in achieving robust AI Safety standards. Navigating the Landscape of AI Ethics Beyond safety, the discussion delved deep into the complex terrain of AI Ethics . As AI systems make decisions that affect individuals and society, questions of fairness, transparency, and accountability come to the forefront. The ethical challenges are multifaceted, touching upon issues ranging from algorithmic bias to the impact of automation on employment and the nature of human interaction. Artemis Seaford and Ion Stoica shared their perspectives on the ethical considerations that companies developing and deploying AI must grapple with daily. They emphasized that building ethical AI is not a matter of simply following rules, but requires a fundamental commitment to considering the broader impact of the technology on people and communities. This involves anticipating potential harms and actively working to prevent them. Core ethical challenges discussed included: Ethical Challenge Description Example Context Algorithmic Bias AI systems reflecting or amplifying societal biases present in training data. Loan applications, hiring decisions, criminal justice. Lack of Transparency Difficulty understanding how an AI system arrived at a particular decision (‚Äòblack box‚Äô problem). Credit scoring, medical diagnoses. Accountability Determining who is responsible when an AI system causes harm. Autonomous vehicle accidents, incorrect medical advice from AI. Privacy Concerns AI systems requiring vast amounts of data, raising issues about surveillance and data protection. Facial recognition, behavioral tracking for advertising. Addressing these AI Ethics issues requires a combination of technical solutions, such as developing methods for detecting and mitigating bias, and policy frameworks that establish guidelines and regulations. The conversation highlighted the need for ongoing dialogue between technologists, ethicists, policymakers, and the public to shape the future of AI in a way that aligns with human values. Confronting the Threat of Deepfakes One of the most tangible and immediate ethical challenges discussed was the proliferation of Deepfakes . These AI-generated synthetic media, particularly realistic audio and video, have the potential for significant misuse, from creating fraudulent content for scams and misinformation campaigns to damaging reputations and interfering with democratic processes. ElevenLabs, working at the cutting edge of generative voice AI, is acutely aware of the risks associated with this technology. Artemis Seaford provided insights into the measures being taken to combat the malicious use of Deepfakes created with their technology. This includes implementing safeguards to prevent the cloning of voices without consent, developing watermarking techniques to identify AI-generated content, and building detection tools to help identify synthetic media. The rise of Deepfakes is particularly concerning in the context of information integrity. The ability to create highly convincing fake audio and video makes it harder for individuals to discern truth from falsehood, potentially eroding trust in media and institutions. In the financial world, Deepfakes could be used in sophisticated phishing attacks or market manipulation schemes. The experts emphasized that combating Deepfakes requires a multi-pronged approach: Technical Solutions: Developing better detection and attribution tools. Platform Responsibility: Social media and content platforms implementing policies and tools to flag or remove malicious Deepfakes . Media Literacy: Educating the public on how to identify synthetic media and be critical of online content.

July 14 is the date the Federal Reserve System is scheduled to transition from the current Fedwire Application Interface Manual (FAIM) to the ISO 20022 standard. Armando Pantoja, a well-respected figure in the cryptocurrency space, believes this move is good for XRP. He has pointed to what he thinks is a critical alignment between XRP and the incoming standards, suggesting the token is ‚Äúbuilt to thrive in this new era of finance.‚Äù Pantoja emphasized the ISO 20022 compliance of Ripple‚Äôs technology and noted that XRP is already being used in countries such as Japan , Brazil, the United States, and the UAE for cross-border settlements. Despite this, he notes that the asset remains undervalued, currently trading around $2. He predicts a significant price increase once ISO 20022 goes live, forecasting a potential range of $8 to $12 by the end of the year. $XRPs moment is near‚Ä¶ July 14, thousands of banks transition to the ISO 20022. ‚Äì XRP is already ISO 20022 compliant.‚Å∞- Banks around the world are using XRP‚Å∞- Institutions are filing $300M deals.‚Å∞ But the price?

He points to the market response, noting that Webus‚Äô stock exploded more than 400%, while XRP‚Äôs price remained largely unaffected. This led him to argue that XRP is being artificially suppressed. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This opinion about price suppression is not new in the XRP community, as market manipulation tactics often impact the asset‚Äôs price. However, Pantoja believes that this suppression cannot impact XRP‚Äôs value. Instead, such delays create a buildup of interest and energy around the token. He describes the process as a spring, gradually building up energy before an explosion. Regulatory History and Institutional Integration The video features commentary from other voices in the crypto space who highlight XRP‚Äôs history before regulatory scrutiny. One speaker noted that Ripple‚Äôs XRP was once the second-largest cryptocurrency before the SEC lawsuit. He also explained that Bank of America was conducting all internal transactions using Ripple‚Äôs system and that Ripple holds over 80 patents, linking to its institutional integration and intellectual property development. Timing and Expectations Ahead of the Transition With less than a month remaining before this major shift toward ISO 20022, analysts and retail investors alike are closely monitoring XRP‚Äôs behavior. XRP is trading at $2.18, up 3.54% in the last 24 hours. While the $8 to $12 range is unprecedented, a dominant role in global finance through ISO 20022 integration could help the asset reach this target.

When Satoshi wrote that ‚Äúparticipants can be anonymous,‚Äù he also built in the assumption that the rules are enforced by software, not by people. Most of today‚Äôs decentralized exchanges keep that promise: once a trade hits the mempool, no custodian can halt or reverse it. Yet, the certainty that a smart contract will execute does not translate into certainty that the overall game is fair. The $ 110 million Mango Markets exploit in October 2022 was executed exactly as the contract allowed; nevertheless, a U.S. jury still found it to be fraudulent this April, underscoring the gap between legal code and moral code. You might also like: Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion That gap is widening. In the first quarter of 2022, 97 percent of all stolen crypto came from DeFi protocols, a leap from 30 percent just two years earlier. Even after a 54 percent drop in headline losses last year, users still saw almost $2 billion disappear to hacks, scams, and exploits. We have eliminated trusted intermediaries, but not the need for trust itself. Anonymity‚Äôs hidden tax Because wallets are free, the reputation in DeFi is cheap. The Sybil problem is no longer academic; entire Telegram channels teach ‚Äúairdrop farmers‚Äù how to spin up hundreds of addresses and recycle the lucky winners. A trader who wipes out today can be back tomorrow under a fresh ENS name, ready to court copy-trading deposits. Survivorship bias then does the rest. Traditional asset-management studies show that excluding dead funds inflates reported performance by double-digit percentages; in DeFi, the distortion compounds at machine speed because failure leaves no paperwork trail, just a silent wallet. When a leaderboard advertises ‚Äú200 percent APY,‚Äù investors rarely see the denominator: the strategies that imploded on day two and were quietly abandoned. Attempts to patch this with social graphs or soul-bound tokens help, but without meaningful economic penalties, they simply create new points of friction. The open nature of blockchains means any identity scheme must assume an adversary with infinite wallets and infinite tries. In practice, that makes wallet-level reputation brittle and signals noisily. Code is law, but data is the loophole Even perfectly audited contracts can be gamed once economic context enters the picture. The first flash-loan attack on bZx in 2020 showed how a zero-collateral loan could distort an oracle for a single block and siphon six-figure profits. Four years on, oracle manipulation remains a favorite vector, with $403 million lost in forty-one such attacks during 2022 alone. More subtle forms of manipulation thrive on thin liquidity. Researchers still pick up spoofing and wash-trading patterns on modern perpetual-swap venues, despite automated surveillance. Because these tactics live around the contract rather than inside it, formal verification can‚Äôt catch them. The protocol behaves exactly as specified; the price feed, however, has been poisoned. Designing for credibility, not merely decentralization So, what would a trustworthy trading protocol look like? First, it would expose all the data, not just the success stories. Every strategy (profitable, flat, or wrecked) should leave an immutable on-chain scorecard. Second, reputation should cost money. Staking a percentage of notional volume or placing a refundable performance bond forces would-be gurus to internalize downside risk. Finally, identity can remain pseudonymous while still being provable. Zero-knowledge reputation proofs allow a trader to show ‚ÄúI have three years of verifiably positive PnL‚Äù without revealing a name, location, or passport number. These guardrails carry overhead, just as SOC-2 audits do in SaaS or capital ratios do in banking. But they convert ‚Äútrust me‚Äù into ‚Äúverify me.‚Äù Unlike marketing claims, cryptographic attestations cannot be photoshopped. My own team has baked these principles into the tooling we ship: immutable performance trails that include the blow-ups, mandatory skin-in-the-game deposits that price reputation, and public proofs of methodology. We regard that friction not as a drawback but as table stakes for capital that comes with fiduciary duty. The pensions and treasuries that will ultimately decide DeFi‚Äôs scale cannot defer diligence to a Discord handle with a frog avatar. Toward evidence-based transparency Critics argue that these layers re-introduce a form of centralization. Fair enough. But the real question is not decentralization versus control; it is opacity versus evidence. When a protocol advertises itself as ‚Äútrustless,‚Äù the burden is on its architects to show that trust is nevertheless deserved. Failing that, we should expect more headline exploits and more juries asked to decide whether ‚Äúcode is law‚Äù absolves economic manipulation. I remain optimistic. Public ledgers make forensic auditing easier than in any legacy market; the tools are there, and the incentives to use them are growing. What we need is a cultural shift from ‚Äúbuilt on Ethereum, therefore safe‚Äù to ‚Äúbuilt for adversarial scrutiny, therefore credible.‚Äù Until then, the most innovative technology in the world will keep struggling to win the oldest asset in finance: belief.

As mentioned before, the price remains under pressure despite the Trump family‚Äôs support in the broader market. Following the WLFI news, the token saw a modest bounce of around 6.4%, but the move retraced quickly. The market is currently showing lower highs & weakening momentum, with no confirmed breakout above key resistance, while technicals remain neutral to bearish. As seen in the above chart, the TRUMP price is stuck within a descending parallel channel and is working hard to validate a bullish reversal. Moreover, the RSI also displays a similar movement, signaling the rally could be gaining strength henceforth. On the other hand, the supertrend has turned bearish, which could push the prices below the support of the channel.

For entrepreneurs and developers in the crypto and blockchain space, who are often at the forefront of technological shifts, this presents both immense opportunity and significant challenge. How can a startup build a robust, sustainable business when the underlying AI infrastructure is a moving target? This was a central question addressed by industry leaders from DeepMind, Twelve Labs, and Amazon at the Bitcoin World Sessions: AI event, where they shared practical strategies for navigating this dynamic landscape. Understanding the Shifting Sands of Foundation Models At the core of many recent AI breakthroughs are Foundation Models . These are massive models, pre-trained on vast amounts of data, capable of performing a wide range of tasks. Think of them as powerful generalists. Their existence has democratized AI development, allowing smaller teams to leverage capabilities that previously required immense resources to build from scratch. However, relying heavily on these models isn‚Äôt without its complexities. The models themselves are proprietary and controlled by large tech companies. They are updated frequently, their APIs can change, and their capabilities evolve. This creates a dependency that can feel unstable for a business trying to establish a long-term product or service. A model update could potentially break a core feature or change performance unexpectedly. Furthermore, if everyone is building on the exact same Foundation Models , how does a startup differentiate itself? The experts highlighted that understanding the nature of these models ‚Äì their strengths, limitations, and inherent volatility ‚Äì is the first step in devising a resilient strategy. What Does it Mean to Be Truly Building on AI? Simply calling an API isn‚Äôt enough to build a durable company. The discussion emphasized that successful ventures are those that build significant value around the AI model, not just on top of it. This involves several key areas: Data: Proprietary or unique data is a massive differentiator. How are you using data to fine-tune models, personalize experiences, or create unique features? Workflow Integration: AI is most powerful when integrated seamlessly into existing workflows or creating entirely new, efficient ones. Building intuitive interfaces and robust integrations adds significant value. Specialization: While foundation models are generalists, businesses need to be specialists. Focusing on a specific domain, use case, or vertical allows you to apply AI in a deeply knowledgeable way that general models cannot replicate out-of-the-box. User Experience: The best AI product isn‚Äôt just about the model‚Äôs output; it‚Äôs about how that output is presented, controlled, and used by the end-user. A superior user experience builds loyalty and defensibility. The takeaway here is clear: True Building on AI involves creating layers of value that are unique to your business, rather than just being a thin wrapper around a third-party model. Crafting Your AI Business Strategy for Sustainability A sustainable AI Business Strategy requires looking beyond the initial novelty of AI capabilities. It‚Äôs about identifying genuine problems that AI can solve and building a business model that captures value. The experts discussed various strategic considerations: Focusing on the Problem, Not Just the Tech: What specific pain point are you addressing for your customers? How does AI provide a significantly better solution than existing methods? The technology should serve the problem, not the other way around. Finding Your Niche: Trying to compete directly with the capabilities of large foundation models is often a losing game. Instead, find a specific niche where you can apply AI deeply and effectively. This could be a particular industry, a specific type of task, or a unique combination of data and AI. Building Defensibility: In a world where AI capabilities are becoming commoditized, what makes your business defensible? Is it your data, your user base, your brand, your integration into workflows, your domain expertise, or a combination of these? Your AI Business Strategy must articulate this defensibility. Monetization Models: How will you charge? API access, subscription fees based on usage or features, value-added services? The pricing model should align with the value you provide, which should be tied to the problem you solve, not just the cost of the underlying model calls. Building a robust AI Business Strategy involves constantly evaluating where you create unique value in the AI stack. Navigating the Nuances of Generative AI Development Much of the recent excitement revolves around Generative AI Development ‚Äì models that create text, images, code, and more. Building reliable products using these models presents specific challenges. Controlling Outputs: Generative models can be unpredictable. Strategies discussed included sophisticated prompt engineering, using guardrails, implementing validation steps, and potentially fine-tuning models on specific datasets to steer their behavior. Dealing with Hallucinations and Bias: Generative models can produce incorrect or biased information. A key part of Generative AI Development is building systems to detect and mitigate these issues, ensuring the output your users receive is accurate and fair. Evaluation: How do you objectively measure the quality and relevance of generated content? Developing robust evaluation frameworks, both automated and human-in-the-loop, is crucial. Integration of Multiple Models: Sometimes the best solution involves chaining together different models or combining generative models with other AI techniques (like search or classification). Orchestrating these complex pipelines is a significant part of modern Generative AI Development . The experts underscored that successful Generative AI Development is less about magic and more about careful engineering and rigorous evaluation. The Critical Role of AI Infrastructure Choices The choices made regarding underlying AI Infrastructure have a profound impact on a startup‚Äôs scalability, cost, and flexibility. Should you rely on one provider (like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google)? Should you use open-source models? Should you try to abstract away the model layer? Abstraction Layers: Some companies are choosing to build abstraction layers that allow them to swap out underlying models more easily. This reduces dependency on a single provider but adds engineering complexity. Cost Management: Inference costs for large models can be substantial. Strategies involve optimizing prompts, caching results, using smaller models where appropriate, and carefully monitoring usage. Performance and Latency: For many applications, the speed of response from the AI model is critical. Choosing providers and models based on performance characteristics is a key AI Infrastructure decision. Data Security and Privacy: Where is your data processed? What are the data retention policies of the model providers? These are vital considerations, especially for businesses handling sensitive information. Navigating AI Infrastructure means balancing flexibility, cost, performance, and reliability to support your specific business needs. Key Takeaways for Builders From the discussions with experts from DeepMind, Twelve Labs, and Amazon, several actionable insights emerged: Don‚Äôt just build on the model; build significant value around it using data, workflow, and UX. Focus on a specific problem and niche where you can apply AI deeply. Develop a clear defensibility strategy that isn‚Äôt solely reliant on the underlying AI model. For generative AI, invest heavily in prompt engineering, validation, and evaluation. Carefully consider your AI Infrastructure choices regarding cost, flexibility, and reliability. Stay adaptable; the AI landscape will continue to evolve rapidly. Conclusion Building a sustainable business on top of rapidly evolving Foundation Models is undeniably challenging, but the insights shared by leaders from DeepMind, Twelve Labs, and Amazon provide a clear roadmap. Success lies not just in leveraging powerful AI capabilities, but in strategically building unique value through data, specialized applications, robust user experiences, and careful infrastructure choices. By focusing on solving real problems and creating defensible layers around the core AI, startups can navigate the inherent volatility of the AI landscape and build businesses that thrive.

Three names are making waves as we head into the second half of 2025: Nexchain, Solaxy, and BTC Bull Token. While each project brings unique value to the table, Nexchain stands out with its AI-driven infrastructure and real-world use cases. As Layer-1 solutions evolve, early backers are locking in positions with an eye on long-term upside, and some are already calling this the best lineup of presales this year. Nexchain‚Äôs Presale Surge Signals Smart Money Movement With momentum building rapidly, Nexchain is stepping into the spotlight. The AI-powered blockchain protocol has surpassed $3.8 million in its presale and is now selling NEX tokens at $0.066 in Stage 17. With a listing price set at $0.30, the potential ROI sits around 455%‚Äîone of the highest in today‚Äôs presale landscape. Unlike typical hype projects, Nexchain blends real scalability with innovative AI integration. Its hybrid consensus mechanism merges Proof-of-Stake with machine learning, boosting transaction speeds and enabling predictive automation across industries. Nexchain also offers non-custodial daily rewards via gas fee redistribution, and its dashboard is constantly being upgraded with features like wallet-integrated vesting and testnet access. With BTC, SOL, and TRX now accepted in the presale and airdrop buzz growing, more retail and whale investors are positioning themselves early. Nexchain may not be the loudest project, but its fundamentals make it a top contender in 2025‚Äôs presale list. Solaxy Eyes Tier-1 Listings With $44M Presale Finish Solaxy is grabbing headlines as one of the highest-grossing presales of the year, raising nearly $44 million at just $0.001744 per $SOLX token. Dubbed the first Layer-2 on Solana, Solaxy combines meme coin virality with DeFi utility, staking options as high as 92% APY, and promises of a multichain future. Its listing event is scheduled for June 2025, with a series of Tier-1 exchange partnerships in the works. That‚Äôs added fuel to the presale demand, with strong community chatter driving FOMO. However, the project‚Äôs long-term viability still depends on how it transitions from hype to utility, as some analysts remain skeptical about whether the staking returns are sustainable without actual usage volume. Still, Solaxy has done enough to earn its place in the presale spotlight. With the presale almost over, this may be the final chance to enter before it hits the market. BTC Bull Token Is Bringing Bitcoin Rewards to Presale Investors BTC Bull Token is carving a niche as the first presale offering direct Bitcoin rewards to holders. This utility has gained attention in a market where reward mechanics are increasingly tied to token value. Currently available at $0.002545, the token offers an entry point for investors looking to stack rewards tied to BTC‚Äôs performance. The project confirmed its presale ends on June 30, with token claiming and listings to follow shortly after. Momentum has grown around the idea that BTC Bull could follow a similar path to other high-yield tokens, especially given the utility appeal combined with Bitcoin‚Äôs dominant narrative in 2025. Whether or not it sustains its growth post-listing will depend on how it balances tokenomics and adoption, but the early presale structure is strong enough to catch serious attention. Nexchain Still Holds the Strongest Upside Potential Among these top contenders, Nexchain continues to look like the most grounded and forward-looking bet in the current presale market. Its utility-first design, fast execution, and transparent roadmap are ticking all the right boxes for seasoned investors. With Stage 17 nearing its cap and major developments on the horizon, this presale isn‚Äôt just another trend‚Äîit‚Äôs shaping up to be the launchpad of something much bigger.

While it briefly surged to $1.70 in mid-May amid hype over a major Pi Network announcement, the rally faded even before the news went live. Since then, Pi has retraced nearly all gains, reflecting a shift in sentiment from excitement to caution as traders reassess the token‚Äôs short-term potential. Despite completing KYC and following all migration steps, many users report seeing zero balance in their wallets, triggering a wave of backlash against the Pi Network Core Team. Looking at the growing frustration in the Pi community, Pi Network has released a detailed safety tip and advisory for its users.

Long before tech giants like Google, Uber, and Airbnb began exploring their stablecoin initiatives, Ripple had already laid the groundwork for seamless integration between cutting-edge technology companies and the traditional financial system. At the heart of this architecture is XRP, Ripple‚Äôs native digital asset, designed to serve as a neutral, scalable, and highly efficient liquidity bridge. The vision and infrastructure, as recently highlighted by X user and crypto analyst SMQKE, underscore how Ripple‚Äôs network was originally conceptualized to connect companies like Google, Uber, and Airbnb directly to legacy payment systems, including ACH, VISA, PayPal, and Alipay. These connections were not hypothetical. Ripple‚Äôs foundational documents outlined a framework where XRP serves as a bridge between emerging digital platforms and traditional financial systems. Google, Airbnb, and Uber were all part of Ripple‚Äôs original product vision for a unified global payments interface. As you can see in the document below, that blueprint runs through Ripple‚Äôs network with XRP serving as the liquidity layer. The image shows Ripple connecting‚Ä¶ https://t.co/CLEttfJ9xl pic.twitter.com/Punet55noI ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) June 6, 2025 Ripple‚Äôs Early Blueprint for Global Interoperability Ripple‚Äôs strategic focus since its inception has been to build the ‚ÄúInternet of Value‚Äù, a global network where money moves as seamlessly as information does today. The XRP Ledger (XRPL), Ripple‚Äôs enterprise-level system, enables rapid settlement of cross-border payments with unmatched cost efficiency and liquidity management. Ripple‚Äôs initial infrastructure was designed to enable seamless connections between tech platforms and financial institutions worldwide, according to the document cited by SMQKE. In this architecture, companies like Google, Airbnb, and Uber were depicted as natural participants in Ripple‚Äôs vision, interfacing with multiple payment networks via RippleNet, with XRP acting as the universal liquidity solution. This setup enabled instant value transfers across borders and payment systems, allowing users to transact seamlessly with traditional banks or digital apps. The XRP Ledger‚Äôs decentralized and trustless nature meant that financial value could be exchanged with the same reliability as a secure email‚Äîinstantly, without a central clearing house, and with full transparency. RippleNet leverages this technology to merge blockchain speed with traditional system compliance, enabling banks, remittance providers, and digital platforms to process global transactions faster and cheaper. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 From Concept to Real-World Application Ripple‚Äôs infrastructure wasn‚Äôt just theoretical, it translated into real-world partnerships with major banks, financial service providers, and digital wallets. Institutions such as Santander, SBI Holdings, PNC, and Tranglo integrated Ripple‚Äôs solutions to improve cross-border payments . Ripple‚Äôs enterprise clients used On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), powered by XRP, to eliminate the need for pre-funded nostro accounts, thus freeing up capital and reducing settlement delays. Although Google, Uber, and Airbnb were not officially onboarded as partners, their inclusion in Ripple‚Äôs foundational vision illustrates how Ripple anticipated the convergence of tech and finance. These companies rely on microtransactions, global remittances, and marketplace payments, precisely the use cases Ripple was engineered to support. With Ripple‚Äôs infrastructure in place, the vision was clear: the likes of Uber could pay drivers in Nigeria via Alipay, Airbnb could process bookings from India using PayPal, and Google could streamline payouts to app developers in Mexico, all using XRP as the liquidity bridge between these disparate systems. Stablecoins Catch Up to Ripple‚Äôs Early Design What‚Äôs striking is that companies like Google, Uber, and Airbnb are now exploring stablecoins and blockchain integrations, years after Ripple laid the groundwork with a framework that envisioned and enabled such uses. This highlights Ripple‚Äôs pioneering role in making these technologies feasible. This underscores a pivotal point: while tech giants are only now entering the stablecoin race, Ripple had already constructed the foundational infrastructure for a truly interoperable global payments network. XRP was not just another digital asset, it was designed from the ground up to solve real-world liquidity challenges that these companies are now trying to address with their proprietary tokens. XRP: The Core Liquidity Engine XRP‚Äôs distinct features‚Äîfast settlement, high capacity, minimal fees, and decentralized neutrality- make it perfectly suited for connecting different systems and facilitating seamless value transfer. Unlike stablecoins tied to a single company or nation‚Äôs currency, XRP was built to be currency-agnostic, making it particularly well-suited for a globalized digital economy. Ripple‚Äôs launch of RLUSD, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, in December 2024, is designed to complement XRP‚Äôs role in liquidity and cross-system value transfer, not replace it. The stablecoin serves as an additional tool within Ripple‚Äôs enterprise suite, while XRP remains the decentralized backbone of interoperability.

Interestingly, with growing prominence and the US president‚Äôs support, Stablecoins are growing fast in B2B payments, offering speed, low costs, and dollar stability. B2B transactions hit $36 billion of the $94 billion total, beating peer-to-peer and card-linked payments. Onchain Over Cards? Big Tech firms are reportedly in early talks with crypto companies to use stablecoins, dollar-pegged digital tokens, for processing payments. The ultimate goal is to cut card fees, streamline international settlements, and future-proof their treasury operations. Conversations involve heavyweights like Stripe and Worldpay, who‚Äôve been approached to support the backend flow of stablecoin settlements. Airbnb is testing the waters with Worldpay, while X (formerly Twitter) is mulling over integrating stablecoins into its X Money app. Meanwhile, Google Cloud already accepts stablecoin payments (via PayPal‚Äôs PYUSD) for select clients, without altering its traditional billing system. Why Stablecoins, and Why Now? Stablecoins aren‚Äôt new, but the timing might finally be right. With policy winds shifting in Washington under the Trump administration and infrastructure rapidly maturing, companies are finding real use cases. Stripe‚Äôs acquisition of stablecoin startup Bridge has only added fuel to the fire. ‚ÄúStablecoins are this old idea, but now the right pieces are coming together,‚Äù said Haun Ventures‚Äô Chris Ahn. Stablecoins also offer flexibility for treasury management. Instead of sitting on fiat, firms can hold stablecoins for faster, on-chain cross-border settlements and better liquidity strategies. Meta and Uber Join the Party Other tech giants are also showing interest. Meta has been evaluating stablecoins to lower transaction costs for international payments, especially for Instagram creators. Meanwhile, Uber‚Äôs CEO Dara Khosrowshahi confirmed the company is researching stablecoin payments as a future option. Trust Still a Barrier Despite the buzz, firms are cautious. Tether‚Äôs murky audit history and changes in USDC‚Äôs ownership have raised questions about compliance and transparency. Executives are evaluating which stablecoin issuer can be trusted with large-scale operations, and that‚Äôs slowing down direct adoption. Is This a Threat to Visa and Mastercard? Potentially, yes. Since Stablecoins cut out the need for card networks, especially in cross-border or large transactions. If stablecoin payments go mainstream, legacy processors like Visa and Mastercard could lose their grip on billions in annual processing fees. Despite the odds, the stablecoin market recently reached an all-time high capitalization of $250 billion. Industry analysts, including Standard Chartered, predict the market could grow to $2 trillion by 2028. This growth is expected to accelerate with the potential passage of the GENIUS Act, a legislative proposal aimed at providing a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S.",News|Stablecoin,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|USDC|PYUSD,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-07 09:49:52

On one hand, the potential for transformation and growth seems limitless. On the other, the landscape is heavily skewed towards established, well-funded giants. This creates a significant challenge for AI startups aiming to break through the noise and establish a foothold. How can new entrants compete effectively against companies with vast resources, existing infrastructure, and dominant market positions? This question was at the heart of a recent discussion at Bitcoin World Sessions: AI, featuring industry leaders Oliver Cameron (Odyssey co-founder), Cristina Cordova (Linear COO), and Ann Lai (NEA partner). Understanding the Landscape: The Challenge of AI Competition The reality is stark: the current AI market is not a level playing field. Large tech companies have invested billions over years, accumulating massive datasets, developing proprietary models, and hiring top-tier talent. This creates high barriers to entry for smaller players. Competing directly on foundational models or raw compute power is often a losing battle. The panel highlighted that this intense AI competition forces startups to be incredibly strategic. Simply building a slightly better version of an existing AI product offered by an incumbent is unlikely to succeed. Differentiation is paramount, but it must be the right kind of differentiation. How Can AI Startups Drive AI Innovation and Disruption? While direct confrontation is difficult, the panel outlined several strategies for new companies to foster AI innovation and achieve AI disruption : Focus on Niche Problems: Instead of trying to build a general-purpose AI, target specific, underserved problems within larger industries or create entirely new markets. Incumbents are often too slow or too broad in their focus to address these niches effectively. Leverage Unique Data: Can your startup access or generate a dataset that incumbents cannot easily replicate? This could be domain-specific data, real-time data, or data from a unique source. Proprietary data can be a powerful moaty. Build Superior User Experience (UX): Incumbents‚Äô AI products can sometimes be complex or poorly integrated. Startups can win by creating intuitive, seamless, and delightful user experiences built around AI capabilities. Speed and Agility: Startups are inherently more agile than large corporations. They can move faster to identify opportunities, build and iterate on products, and adapt to market changes. This speed is a competitive advantage. Vertical Integration: Instead of just providing an AI model, build an end-to-end solution for a specific industry or workflow. This makes the startup indispensable to its customers. Community Building: For developer-focused AI products, building a strong community around your tools or models can create network effects that are hard for incumbents to replicate. Examples of Successful AI Disruption The history of technology is filled with examples of smaller companies disrupting larger ones. While the AI landscape is unique, the principles often remain similar. Consider companies that didn‚Äôt try to out-Google Google but instead focused on specific layers or applications. Think of companies building vertical AI solutions for healthcare, finance, or manufacturing, or those creating novel interfaces or applications for existing AI models. Oliver Cameron‚Äôs work with Odyssey, focusing on accessible tools for interacting with AI, or Cristina Cordova‚Äôs experience scaling Linear, a focused software development tool, highlight the power of targeting specific workflows and user needs rather than competing head-on with broad platforms. Navigating the AI Market: Challenges and Opportunities The path for AI startups is not without significant challenges: Challenge Opportunity for Startups High Cost of Compute (GPUs) Focus on model efficiency, leverage transfer learning, target problems solvable with smaller models, or build applications around existing models. Talent Acquisition & Retention Offer unique culture, mission-driven work, equity, and focus on building strong, specialized teams. Access to Large Datasets Focus on generating proprietary data, leveraging synthetic data, or building products where data scales with user engagement. Incumbent Network Effects Build strong communities, integrate deeply into existing workflows, or create entirely new network effects. Funding Landscape Clearly articulate differentiation, demonstrate traction in a specific niche, and highlight potential for significant disruption. Ann Lai‚Äôs perspective as an investor emphasizes that VCs are looking for startups with a clear unfair advantage, a deep understanding of their target market, and a realistic strategy for navigating the intense AI competition . Simply having a good AI model is often not enough; it‚Äôs about how that model solves a real problem for a specific set of users better than anyone else. Actionable Insights for Aspiring AI Disruptors Validate Your Niche: Before building, deeply understand the problem you are solving and for whom. Is this a painful problem that people will pay to solve? Identify Your Data Strategy: How will you acquire, manage, and leverage data to train or improve your AI? Can this data become a defensible asset? Prioritize User Experience: Design your product around the user, making the AI capabilities feel intuitive and valuable, not complex. Build a Strong Team: Surround yourself with people who have deep domain expertise and technical skills, but also a strong understanding of product and market. Be Capital Efficient: Given the high cost of some AI resources, be strategic about how you spend money, especially in the early stages. Think Beyond the Model: The AI model is a component, not the entire product. Focus on the complete solution and its integration into user workflows. Embrace Agility: Be prepared to pivot and adapt based on market feedback and technological advancements. Achieving AI disruption requires more than just technical prowess. It demands strategic thinking, market insight, operational excellence, and a relentless focus on solving real-world problems in novel ways. The panelists agreed that while the incumbents hold significant power in the AI market , the door is open for nimble, innovative AI startups to create substantial value and reshape the future of the industry. Summary: Paving the Way for AI Innovation Competing against established giants in the AI market is a daunting task for new ventures. However, the path to success lies not in direct confrontation but in strategic differentiation and focused execution. By targeting niche problems, leveraging unique data, prioritizing user experience, and maintaining agility, AI startups can carve out their own space. The insights shared by leaders at Bitcoin World Sessions underscore that genuine AI innovation often comes from understanding specific needs and building tailored solutions that incumbents overlook. While AI competition is fierce, the potential for meaningful AI disruption remains high for those who play their cards right.

The initiative is in collaboration with the China Beijing Equity Exchange (CBEX) to manage digital assets seized in criminal cases. In line with this, CBEX will engage third-party agencies to help sell the assets on regulated exchanges. According to reports, the digital assets seized from criminal proceeds will be converted into yuan and deposited into designated accounts. This is the first time a mainland Chinese agency will be carrying out a process to dispose of seized digital assets. This development is possible because Hong Kong is recognized as a digital asset hub, with mainland China still choosing to enforce its ban on crypto trading and related activities. China‚Äôs crypto disposal process shows the scale of seized assets The recent framework represents the first time a formal process is being followed to ensure the handling of a large amount of confiscated digital assets that have been accumulated since China announced its crypto ban. According to authorities, the value of the digital assets awaiting disposal by the Chinese authorities exceeded several billion dollars by the end of 2022, with the amount jumping to 430.7 billion yuan ($60 billion) in 2023. The figure is a twelvefold increase from the previous year. The trend aligns with that of the global cryptocurrency seizures, with several countries now holding a huge chunk of digital assets from seizures and fraud investigations. According to reports, the United States presently holds about 200,000 Bitcoins worth $16 billion in seized assets, while the United Kingdom holds more than 61,000 Bitcoins in seized assets. China reportedly holds about 194,000 Bitcoins and 833,000 Ethereum, putting the country among the top holders in the world. The Chinese government continues to rank as one of the highest holders globally despite its ban on the asset. Some days ago, news filtered onto the internet noting that China has banned private individuals from owning digital assets. While the news has not been confirmed by official channels, the country still has a ban on assets dating back to 2013, when the People‚Äôs Bank of China ( PBoC ) prohibited banks in the country from engaging in Bitcoin-related businesses. Hong Kong deepens its status as a cryptocurrency hub The amount of seized assets has presented a challenge to the authorities, with the development also seen as an opportunity for them. While there are concerns about the market balance should they dump that size of seized assets on the market, there have been calls for them to quickly turn the seized illicit gains into legitimate state resources that will benefit the citizens. Meanwhile, Beijing‚Äôs decision to liquidate the assets through Hong Kong exchanges reveals a dual approach to digital asset regulation from territories inside China. It also establishes Hong Kong‚Äôs status as a cryptocurrency hub. Over the last few years, the area has been positioning itself as a global hub for digital assets as China continues to maintain its strict crypto ban. The country has been cracking down on exchanges, ICOs, and mining since at least 2017. Furthermore, there have been sightings of Chinese officials at crypto events in Hong Kong, allowing the city to develop as a testing ground for digital asset policies that the mainland isn‚Äôt ready to adopt or implement. This arrangement ensures Beijing controls the financial systems in the mainland while exploring the potential of cryptocurrencies through its regulatory sandbox in Hong Kong. The partnership between both parties also opens a formal channel between China‚Äôs strict control and the global crypto economy, setting a precedent for other areas with restrictive crypto policies.

Hyperliquid‚Äôs market share climbed to 10.54% of Binance‚Äôs perps volume. Trader James Wynn lost $100 million after a high-leverage Hyperliquid bet collapsed during a sudden Bitcoin downturn. Onchain perpetual futures platform Hyperliquid notched a record-breaking $248 billion in monthly trading volume for May , a 51.5% jump from April‚Äôs $187.5 billion, as market interest surged during the so-called ‚ÄúJames Wynn‚Äù trading frenzy. The year-on-year growth is even more striking. Just 12 months ago, Hyperliquid saw $26.3 billion in volume, making this May‚Äôs total an 843% increase. The platform‚Äôs rapid rise highlights its growing dominance in the onchain perps space, offering centralized exchange-like performance while keeping traders on crypto-native rails. Hyperliquid Closes In on Binance‚Äôs Perps Market Share Hyperliquid‚Äôs growing footprint is increasingly visible against long-standing giant Binance. In May, Hyperliquid‚Äôs monthly perps volume reached 10.54% of Binance‚Äôs‚Äîa new record. That ratio, up from April‚Äôs 9.76%, is fast becoming a key gauge of market share shifts across the sector. Key drivers of Hyperliquid‚Äôs momentum include its CEX-grade user experience combined with non-custodial infrastructure, plus its popular Season 2 points campaign. The campaign attracted fresh trader inflows following a well-received Season 1 airdrop. The broader trend is also reflected in the share of decentralized exchange (DEX) futures volume compared to CEX volumes. Hyperliquid‚Äôs all-time volume is nearing $1.5t and surpassing what dYdX achieved in four years Hyperliquid pic.twitter.com/IZKiMMhWLG ‚Äî hantengri (@0xhantengri) May 20, 2025 In May, DEX perps captured 6.84% of global perpetual flows, slightly below February‚Äôs record of 7.06%. For 2025, the average sits at 6.7%, a marked climb from under 2% in 2022. With onchain infrastructure continuing to close the gap‚Äîthrough improved liquidity, tighter spreads, and native stablecoin on-ramps‚Äîthe DEX share of global perp flow appears poised to break into double digits before year-end. James Wynn Loses $100M in Days James Wynn, a pseudonymous crypto trader known for turning meme coin bets into millions, revealed he lost $100 million within days after a failed series of leveraged trades on Hyperliquid. Wynn, who first rose to prominence by turning a $7,000 position in PEPE into $25 million, recently shared the story on X. In March, Wynn began trading perpetual futures for the first time and quickly transformed a $3 million position into $100 million through aggressive high-leverage plays. His rapid success attracted major online attention, with traders closely tracking his onchain moves. However, Wynn admitted the growing spotlight distorted his decision-making. In a post, he said the trading ‚Äúspiraled out of control‚Äù as he became increasingly reckless, acknowledging he wasn‚Äôt treating the rising numbers seriously. By mid-May, Wynn had built a $1.25 billion long position on Bitcoin, using up to 40x leverage. When a tweet from former U.S. President Trump triggered a sharp market downturn, Bitcoin fell below Wynn‚Äôs liquidation level, wiping out nearly his entire position. The dramatic collapse has since divided the crypto community, turning Wynn into both a cautionary tale and a controversial figure.

Despite brief rallies and ongoing developments in its legal battles, traders are beginning to look elsewhere for stronger returns and real DeFi utility. One project steadily gaining traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With a presale price of just $0.03, over $10.10 million already raised, and an active base of more than 11,700 holders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing the attention of profit-hungry investors who are now positioning early for a projected rise toward the $1 mark. XRP‚Äôs Slow Momentum Versus MUTM‚Äôs Rapid Growth Ripple (XRP) has been stuck in a pattern of uncertainty. While it has made strides in cross-border payments and has strong institutional ties, its token value remains stagnant. Traders frustrated by this sluggish pace are rotating capital into early-stage opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which has already surged 200% during its presale rounds. With the current Phase 5 price holding at $0.03 and fresh capital pouring in, momentum is building fast‚Äîprecisely the kind of movement XRP holders have been waiting for but not receiving. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers more than speculative upside‚Äîafter the launch, it has been projected to deliver a working DeFi ecosystem with active utility and real income generation. Unlike XRP, which primarily facilitates transactions between banks and payment providers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is focused on enabling individuals to earn, lend, and borrow within a secure protocol. This shift in utility from transactional infrastructure to personal financial growth has drawn attention from traders looking for more control and yield from their crypto holdings. Earning Through Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer Lending After the launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will bring together two powerful lending models. In the peer-to-contract (P2C) model, users will be able to deposit stable assets like ETH or DAI into liquidity pools, which are automatically matched with borrowers. This model will create consistent interest income for depositors with dynamic interest rates based on utilization. On the other hand, the peer-to-peer (P2P) model will allow direct borrowing and lending of more niche assets‚Äîincluding memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB)‚Äîthat are not typically supported by mainstream DeFi lending platforms. This flexibility opens a massive market of token holders who previously had no lending options for their assets. Introducing mtTokens: Smart Yield, Real Utility One of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs standout features is the introduction of mtTokens. When users deposit assets into the protocol‚Äîsuch as ETH, DAI, or other supported tokens‚Äîthey will receive mtTokens in return. These are tokenized representations of their deposits that will automatically accrue interest over time, reflecting both the principal and earned yield. mtTokens are liquid and transferable, that will allow users to move, stake, or eventually redeem them for the underlying asset plus accrued interest, assuming sufficient pool liquidity. This design gives users transparent, real-time insight into their earnings and ensures that their capital remains secured via audited smart contracts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will allow users to borrow stablecoins against their existing crypto without having to sell. By locking assets like ETH as collateral, users will be able to retain exposure to future price gains while unlocking liquidity to spend, invest, or trade. This functionality is especially attractive to long-term holders who don‚Äôt want to realize capital gains or lose potential upside just to cover temporary cash flow needs. Unlike XRP, which lacks such integrated DeFi borrowing mechanisms, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) empowers users to make their assets work harder. Security That Traders Can Trust DeFi has had its fair share of risks. But Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has proactively addressed this by completing a full smart contract audit from CertiK, one of the industry‚Äôs most respected blockchain security firms. The platform received a Token Scan Score of 80, confirming a strong commitment to code quality, minimal vulnerabilities, and active developer engagement. This level of scrutiny, particularly before launch, offers early adopters a level of assurance rarely seen in early-stage DeFi tokens. Traders looking for safer opportunities now view Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a fortified option in a risky space. The path from $0.03 to $1 is no longer speculation‚Äîit is mathematics combined with mechanics. With a working lending platform, passive dividends, growing holder count, CertiK-audited contracts, and two lending models catering to both conservative and high-risk traders, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has the infrastructure, community, and utility to support a 33√ó increase. As the platform generates fees and locks in long-term participants, the available supply will shrink, while demand continues to grow through usage, rewards, and platform revenue sharing. Conclusion: XRP Traders Know When It‚Äôs Time to Move Ripple (XRP) once offered massive promise, and while it still holds relevance in institutional finance, it no longer satisfies traders looking for fast growth, smart utility, and personal yield generation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently available at just $0.03, provides all of that‚Äîplus a community that‚Äôs growing daily and an ongoing $100,000 giveaway . With over $10.10 million already raised, audited smart contracts, passive dividends, and the ability to lend even niche tokens, it‚Äôs clear why XRP holders are pivoting fast. This isn‚Äôt a speculative shift. It‚Äôs a strategic one. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the realigned future of DeFi, and at $0.03, the road to $1 is already paved.

Andrew Bosworth, Meta‚Äôs CTO, recently shared his perspective on 2025, suggesting it could be a critical juncture for the company‚Äôs Reality Labs division and its pursuit of the metaverse. Andrew Bosworth‚Äôs View on 2025 for Reality Labs Andrew Bosworth, a long-time Meta engineer, has been a key figure in the company‚Äôs AR/VR endeavors. Earlier, he speculated that 2025 might be the year Reality Labs either achieves significant success or is seen as a major misstep. His current outlook appears more optimistic, though he emphasizes the market‚Äôs ultimate role in determining success. During a recent interview, Bosworth stated, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll judge at the end of the decade, but this does feel like the pivotal year.‚Äù This highlights the high stakes Meta places on its progress in the coming months. Early Wins: Meta‚Äôs Smart Glasses Breakthrough One area showing promising signs is Meta‚Äôs collaboration with Ray Ban on AI-powered smart glasses. Since their launch in October 2023, Meta has sold over 2 million pairs. These smart glasses even outsold traditional Ray Ban models before AI features were added. Bosworth noted that this product‚Äôs success has generated excitement among consumers and alerted competitors, pulling Meta out of relative obscurity in this hardware segment. The Competitive Landscape for Meta AR VR The success of Meta‚Äôs smart glasses has intensified competition. Google recently announced its own partnerships with Gentle Monster and Warby Parker for smart glasses based on Android XR. Apple is also reportedly planning a smart glasses release in 2026. This increased activity means the clock is ticking for Meta. Bosworth explained, ‚ÄúSuddenly, we go from toiling in the realms of obscurity to being very much in the world with a product that is very attractive to consumers, and thus competitors.‚Äù He stressed that progress made this year is disproportionately valuable because of this emerging competitive environment. Market Adoption Trumps Competition Despite the focus on rivals, Bosworth pointed out that competitor actions mean little if the market doesn‚Äôt widely adopt Meta‚Äôs AR and VR products. Mass market adoption is what will truly drive standardization and growth in the industry. He views market success, especially for hardware, as a lagging indicator. Early indicators and internal confidence are crucial in the meantime. This perspective aligns with a lesson he learned from former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg. Focusing on Internal Execution for the Metaverse Vision Drawing on Sheryl Sandberg‚Äôs insight that most companies fail due to poor internal execution rather than being beaten by competitors, Bosworth emphasizes focusing the Reality Labs team on their own plan. He stated, ‚Äúwhat I try to do with the team is really focus us, not so much on the competitive landscape as on [whether] we‚Äôre executing to our standards.‚Äù Meta has ambitious plans for the year and is currently on track. The team will know by year-end if they met their execution goals, but whether that execution was sufficient for long-term success will only become clear in five years or more, impacting the realization of the metaverse vision. 2025 appears set to be a defining year for Meta‚Äôs AR and VR efforts. With early product success, rising competition, and a strong focus on internal execution, the path forward for Reality Labs will be closely watched by the tech and digital asset communities alike.

However, some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is preparing for the ‚Äúreal‚Äù price jump toward a new all-time high (ATH) Related Reading: SUI Rally At Risk? Analysts Warn Of 30% Dip If This Level Doesn‚Äôt Hold Bitcoin Prepares For ‚ÄòReal Breakout‚Äô Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin experienced significant volatility fueled by the online feud between US President Donald Trump and Tesla and X owner Elon Musk. The flagship crypto‚Äôs price took a beating on Thursday afternoon after dropping by over 5% from the $105,000 level to the $100,000 support. Before the pullback, BTC had been attempting to reclaim its local mid-range area after its recent performance. Notably, the cryptocurrency traded sideways following its ATH rally to $111,980, hovering between the $106,800 and $109,700 price range. However, the cryptocurrency lost the key $106,800 support amid last week‚Äôs market retracement, which saw Bitcoin drop to $102,000 over the weekend. Since then, BTC has been attempting to reclaim the current levels. After yesterday‚Äôs drop, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has surged 4.5%, climbing above the $104,000 level. Crypto trader Coinvo highlighted BTC‚Äôs one-year chart, pointing to the similarly looking price action between 2024 and 2025. According to the chart, Bitcoin recorded its first major pump after reclaiming its yearly opening level, consolidating within its new range for weeks before climbing to its Q1 2024 ATH. This year, the cryptocurrency has had a similar performance, although delayed, having reclaimed the yearly opening range and surging to the first major price surge in May. Similarly, analyst Alex Clay suggested that Bitcoin is preparing for the ‚Äúreal breakout‚Äù following its retests of the range‚Äôs mid-zone resistance in Q1 2025 and a ‚Äúfalse‚Äù breakout last month. To the analyst, ‚ÄúWe grabbed the liquidity below the Broken Supply Zone. Now looking for a Real Breakout‚Äù toward the $120,000 mark. BTC Price To Range For Two Weeks? The Cryptonomist noted that Bitcoin displays a 3-week bullish falling wedge formation, with the lower boundary sitting around the $101,000 level. Following the recent price drop, BTC bounced from that area, and could break out of the pattern if it reclaims the $105,000 barrier as support, targeting the $118,000-$120,000 levels. Meanwhile, market watcher Daan Crypto Trades highlighted that its price now trades at the mid-range again, near the Monthly opening price. To the trader, ‚Äúit‚Äôs pretty safe to assume that these range high/lows are good triggers for whatever larger trend follows,‚Äù as BTC has been having a ‚Äúrelatively large move early in the month.‚Äù As he previously explained, Bitcoin tends to set its monthly high or low during the first week of the month, followed by a reversal in the opposite direction and a trend continuation until a new month begins. Based on this, he warned that if the price drops below yesterday‚Äôs lows, it will continue to trend down for another week or two, displaying ‚Äúweakness and confirming a larger correction is due.‚Äù Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes 15% Move Amid Key Resistance Retest ‚Äì Breakout Or Rejection Next? Nonetheless, if price surges above the monthly highs, around the $106,700 mark, ‚Äúthe correction is more likely to be over and there‚Äôs a good likelihood that we head to all-time highs and beyond.‚Äù ‚ÄúGood chance we range around this area for a while, though, without any of these levels breaking,‚Äù he concluded. As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,224, a 2.6% increase in the daily timeframe.

The dark horse Remittix has surfaced while the DOGE price and Shiba Inu wait for a breakthrough. Just months ago, Remittix was virtually unknown but this year, it has already surged over 420% and silently outperformed most big tokens. Remittix is becoming popular with its special use in cross-border payments and growing investor interest. Bearish Waves Hit Dogecoin Recent behavior of the DOGE price has exposed a worrying trend for investors. Currently trading below important support levels, the DOGE price has battled to keep momentum. Source: TradingView Technical indicators show the development of bearish trends, such as the bear flag, implying possible more losses for Dogecoin investors. Analysts caution that should these trends confirm, Dogecoin may suffer a major decline, perhaps falling into the $0.14 support zone. Rising long liquidations and a declining meme coin market aggravate this negative attitude surrounding the DOGE price. Market experts believe that before deciding whether to invest in Dogecoin, investors should be careful and keep a close eye on market indications. From Hype to Hesitation: Bearish Clouds Over Shiba Inu Recently showing bearish trends, Shiba Inu (SHIB) most notably shows a head-and-shoulders configuration indicating a possible 28% drop to $0.000009. Source: CoinMarketCap With main support around $0.00001041, analysts have also seen a declining triangle pattern, suggesting a probable 20% decline for Shiba Inu. A huge decline in whale activity, as evidenced by a drop of 83%, has also caused less liquidity and more bearish pressure. Analysts believe that these elements imply that Shiba Inu might move even farther down in the near future. From Obscurity to Opportunity: How Remittix is Defining the Market Usually the starting point for all successful initiatives, its crypto presale is the platform for Remittix ‚Äòs continuous initial coin offering (ICO), which shows significant indications of future success. Since its presale started some months back, the Remittix presale has generated over $15.5 million and sold around 541 million RTX tokens. Experts have selected Remittix as the best penny cryptocurrency on the market while DOGE price and Shiba Inu continue to struggle in the highly competitive market. Why is Remittix experiencing unheard-of demand? First, the RTX token has given over 420% gains to its first investors, which fuels hopeful forecasts of a 3,000% or more increase in the Remittix price over the next months. However, that‚Äôs not all. Because Remittix has great potential in global payments and Payment Finance (PayFi), long-term investors are pitching their tents. Remittix is developing technology to let crypto consumers streamline their transitions from digital assets to fiat money. Remittix customers may transmit crypto and have their recipients paid in their local currencies straight into their bank accounts with support for thirty-plus fiat currencies. The Remittix Pay API also allows conventional companies to include crypto payments in their checkout systems. Remittix is a top project to see this year because of its simplicity and its ability to solve significant bottlenecks. Conclusion Analysts say now is the greatest time for interested investors to lock in before Remittix soars, given the current price is still $0.0781 and its forecast gain of 3,000% or more. The demand for RTX tokens has resulted in estimates that the present presale round will sell out ahead of schedule. The following round will sell tokens for $0.0811.

45636494,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=399555,1749290527,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/45636494.jpeg,"Crypto Price Analysis June-07: ETH, XRP, ADA, SOL, and HYPE",https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-price-analysis-june-07-eth-xrp-ada-sol-and-hype/,"This week, we examine Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Solana, and Hype in greater detail. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum had another flat week in terms of price action, ending it with a minor loss of 1%. The price has been moving sideways since early May, holding just above the key support at $2,400. This long consolidation could signal some indecision from market participants, but it can also be the precursor of a major move later on. The recent re-test of the key support could be a sign of weakness, and another drop to that level could lead to a breakdown. ETH had a fantastic performance in April, but its momentum suddenly stopped in May and June. Volume is declining, and this could give sellers an opportunity to push the price back towards $2,000 if $2,400 falls. Chart by TradingView Ripple (XRP) XRP closed the week with a modest 2% gain. This comes after the price nearly touched the $2 support level. Ideally, buyers return here to take this cryptocurrency back to $2.3, which is currently acting as a resistance. Similarly to Ethereum, volume has been declining since the start of the year. This explains the low volatility and lack of strength to sustain a rally that can see XRP revisit $3, as in January. Looking ahead, the momentum indicators are turning flat and give no clear direction, considering the price has been bouncing between $2 and $2.6 for over three months. Until XRP breaks away from this range, don‚Äôt expect any major changes. Chart by TradingView Cardano (ADA) ADA has had a disappointing year so far. Since January, its price has fallen by over 40% from its highs around $1. While the asset found good support at $0.64, buyers failed to move it much beyond this level at the time of this post. This is why the price is similar to last week. Ideally, ADA will hold above $0.64 and make its way towards $0.90, which is the most important resistance on the chart. However, if the overall market remains undecided or turns bearish, it is unlikely ADA can sustain an uptrend. Looking ahead, Cardano appears to have found a local bottom at $0.64, but this still appears fragile. Bulls really need to break above $0.90 to restore confidence in a sustained rally. Chart by TradingView Solana (SOL) Solana suffered a major defeat this week when its price fell below the support at $152. At the time of this post, buyers are trying to reclaim this level, but it is too early to call it. SOL also closed the week with a 2% loss. The next few days are critical for this cryptocurrency because bulls are on the defensive, and any weakness could see sellers take SOL towards $130 next. If so, the current downtrend will be reinforced. Solana may fall to $130 or even $100 if the price action does not turn around soon. The odds are against it, considering the 3-day MACD did a bearish cross on Friday. This is a major bearish signal. Chart by TradingView Hype (HYPE) HYPE closed the week with a 7% gain, which makes it the best performer on our list. This comes after HYPE was listed on several major exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, and OKX. While this news was bullish in the short term, the price action seems to show the opposite. Based on the weekly candles, we can see that HYPE appears to have topped around $40 and is making lower highs since then. This could be the start of a longer consolidation or pullback around $30.

Japanese company Remixpoint, known for its energy consulting but also a significant player in the cryptocurrency space through its subsidiary operating a crypto exchange, has just made another substantial move into Bitcoin . Remixpoint‚Äôs Growing Bitcoin Holdings: What Does This Acquisition Signify? In a recent announcement on June 6th, Remixpoint revealed it acquired an additional 44.8 BTC . This purchase came at a cost of 675 million Japanese Yen, which translates to approximately $4.7 million USD at the time of the transaction. This isn‚Äôt Remixpoint‚Äôs first rodeo with crypto acquisitions, and this latest buy significantly increases their treasury reserves held in the leading digital asset. With this new addition, Remixpoint‚Äôs total Bitcoin stash now stands at roughly 758.4 BTC. This demonstrates a clear and growing commitment by the company to hold Bitcoin as part of its corporate strategy. Given that Remixpoint operates the crypto exchange BITPoint Japan, having a substantial amount of BTC in their reserves could serve multiple purposes, from treasury management to potentially supporting exchange operations or future ventures. Let‚Äôs look at the numbers: Latest Purchase: 44.8 BTC Cost: 675 Million JPY (~$4.7 Million USD) Date: June 6th Previous Holdings: Approximately 713.6 BTC (758.4 ‚Äì 44.8) New Total Holdings: Approximately 758.4 BTC Why Are Companies Like Remixpoint Increasing Their Corporate Bitcoin Reserves? The trend of companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets has gained significant traction globally over the past few years. While pioneers like MicroStrategy grabbed headlines with massive acquisitions, firms across various sectors, including those already within the Japan Crypto ecosystem like Remixpoint, are increasingly seeing the value proposition of holding digital assets. Several factors drive this trend: Inflation Hedge: Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, given its decentralized nature and capped supply of 21 million coins, contrasting with traditional fiat currencies subject to printing and devaluation. Store of Value: Bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a digital store of value, similar to digital gold, offering a non-sovereign asset alternative. Potential Appreciation: Companies anticipate potential long-term price appreciation for Bitcoin, seeing it as an investment that could outperform traditional assets in a diversified portfolio. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin provides diversification away from traditional financial instruments and currencies. Industry Alignment (for crypto firms): For companies already operating in the crypto space, holding significant amounts of BTC aligns with their core business and can instill confidence in their customers and investors. However, it‚Äôs also important to acknowledge the challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin‚Äôs price can be highly volatile, leading to significant fluctuations in the value of corporate holdings. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, including Japan, which can pose compliance and operational risks. Accounting Treatment: Accounting for cryptocurrency holdings can be complex and vary depending on regional standards. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of crypto requires robust security measures to protect against hacks and theft. Exploring the Landscape of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption, Especially in Japan Remixpoint‚Äôs latest acquisition is a notable development within the Japan Crypto scene. While Japan is a leading country in terms of cryptocurrency regulation and adoption, corporate treasury allocation to Bitcoin hasn‚Äôt always mirrored the aggressive pace seen in some Western countries. Moves like Remixpoint‚Äôs signal a potential shift or growing confidence among Japanese firms already familiar with the digital asset space. The decision to allocate a portion of corporate Bitcoin reserves is a strategic one, requiring careful consideration of market conditions, risk tolerance, and long-term objectives. For Remixpoint, operating a crypto exchange likely provides them with unique insights and infrastructure to manage such holdings effectively. This purchase could potentially inspire other Japanese companies, particularly those in tech or finance, to explore similar strategies, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a viable asset class for corporate treasuries in the region. Understanding the motivations behind such acquisitions offers valuable insight into the evolving financial strategies of businesses in the digital age. It highlights a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies beyond speculative trading, positioning them as strategic assets for balance sheets. What‚Äôs Next for Remixpoint and Corporate Crypto? Remixpoint‚Äôs increased BTC holdings position them as one of the more significant corporate holders of Bitcoin in Japan. Future announcements regarding how they plan to utilize or manage these assets will be keenly watched by the market. Will other Japanese companies follow suit? As the regulatory environment in Japan Crypto continues to mature and global examples of successful Corporate Bitcoin strategies become more prevalent, it‚Äôs plausible we could see more firms explore similar paths. Each acquisition, while perhaps small compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs overall market cap, adds another layer of institutional validation to the asset class. Conclusion: A Bold Step in Corporate Crypto Adoption Remixpoint‚Äôs acquisition of an additional 44.8 Bitcoin for $4.7 million is more than just a transaction; it‚Äôs a reinforcement of their belief in the long-term value and strategic importance of BTC . As a company deeply involved in the Japan Crypto market through its exchange operations, this move strengthens their position and signals confidence in the digital asset space. This latest step in building their Corporate Bitcoin reserves contributes to the broader narrative of institutional adoption and highlights how companies are integrating digital assets into their financial frameworks. It will be fascinating to observe how this strategy unfolds for Remixpoint and what impact it has on the wider Japanese corporate landscape regarding cryptocurrency adoption.

While the market rewards projects that use narratives to grab attention, Lightchain AI is looking at building a smart ecosystem from the ground up, focusing on computation, logic, and long-term utility. Its presale has already raised $20.8 million, with tokens available for sale at $0.007. This is not about the hype, it is about using the power of intelligence to ensure the next wave of blockchain technologies is born. For developers and early investors, Lightchain AI is quickly becoming the go-to protocol of choice for projects with purpose. Dogecoin Captures Attention With Meme-Driven Momentum Dogecoin (DOGE) has been keeping the meme spirit alive, showing that there is a change in fortune in the meme sector of the crypto industry. While most people have counted the token out, it has done enough to pull them back in. Tonight, DOGE climbed over 7% to $0.25, taking out a resistance that has prevented its rise in the last five months. Part of the jump was fueled by bullish trends in the meme coin sector and the overall crypto market. The Dogecoin community is also still active and promoting on social media so they can expand their visibility and impact. Endorsements and viral content are part of the drivers of the token‚Äôs appeal. Although it began as a meme, Dogecoin has now become a serious player in the crypto world, boasting more than $33 billion in market value. But as the meme coin industry continues to change, Dogecoin‚Äôs mix of community spirit and market action means that it will continue to be an important token in the world of cryptocurrency. Chainlink Strengthens Web3 With Trusted Data Feeds Chainlink has been improving the Web3 ecosystem by delivering trusted, decentralized data feeds that are important for smart contracts to function. Its Oracle network picks data from different sources, ensuring accuracy and removing single points of failure. This infrastructure supports a wide range of applications, from decentralized finance to insurance and gaming. Notably, platforms like TRON DAO are using Chainlink‚Äôs data feeds, improving their DeFi ecosystems with over $5.5 billion in total value locked. Similarly, Aptos has adopted Chainlink to provide developers with reliable off-chain data, improving the scalability and security of its decentralized applications. Chainlink‚Äôs commitment to providing secure and reliable data feeds is important in advancing the capabilities and trustworthiness of Web3 applications. Lightchain AI Builds the Foundation for Smarter, Scalable Protocols Lightchain AI is establishing the perfect foundation for intelligent, scalable blockchain protocols by easily integrating artificial intelligence into its core infrastructure. The platform‚Äôs architecture is designed to handle real-time AI computations with ease, allowing decentralized applications to use machine learning and predictive analytics directly within its blockchain. The integration also ensures low latency performance and high transaction throughput, important for scalable and responsive decentralized applications. To support the ongoing innovation, Lightchain AI has announced the launch of a $150,000 Developer Grant Program, encouraging the development of AI-enabled decentralized applications and tools within the ecosystem. This initiative shows the importance of the platform‚Äôs commitment to fostering collaboration and forward-thinking in its community. With its mainnet launch on the way, Lightchain AI is preparing to change the blockchain space. By focusing on intelligent integration, scalability, and a community approach, it is setting new standards for what decentralized protocols can do. The future of Blockchain is here and it is brighter than ever with Lightchain AI leading the way. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|DOGE|LINK|MARKET|APT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-07 11:00:00

Recently, a significant Bitcoin transfer from a major player caught the attention of on-chain analysts. This movement involves a Tether -associated wallet and the prominent exchange, Binance . What is the Significance of this Tether BTC Transfer to Binance? According to data shared by the on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain, a wallet identified as a Tether lending collateral custody wallet initiated a notable transaction. Eight hours ago, this wallet transferred 200 BTC , valued at approximately $20.88 million at the time of the transfer, to Binance . While a single transfer of this size is noteworthy, the cumulative activity from this specific crypto wallet adds further context. Lookonchain‚Äôs report highlights that since May 9th, this same wallet has moved a total of 1,650 BTC to the Binance exchange. This larger sum represents a significant value of around $174.7 million based on the approximate prices at the times of transfer. Such large inflows of Bitcoin to exchanges from institutional-linked wallets are often monitored closely by traders and analysts looking for potential market signals. Why Track Bitcoin Wallet Activity? Tracking movements on the Bitcoin blockchain provides transparency into where large amounts of capital are flowing. Big transfers from wallets associated with entities like custodians, whales, or institutions to exchanges can sometimes indicate an intent to sell, increase liquidity on the exchange, or engage in other trading activities. Conversely, large withdrawals from exchanges can suggest accumulation or movement to cold storage. Understanding the typical behavior of specific addresses, like a Tether custody wallet, helps analysts interpret the potential implications of their actions. While not every transfer to an exchange leads to immediate selling, a pattern of significant inflows can contribute to increased selling pressure on the order books. Understanding the Role of a Crypto Wallet in These Movements A crypto wallet is essential for holding and transacting with digital assets like BTC . In this case, the wallet is described as a ‚ÄúTether lending collateral custody wallet.‚Äù This suggests it holds Bitcoin that is likely used as collateral for lending operations involving Tether‚Äôs stablecoin, USDT. Movements from such a wallet to an exchange like Binance could be related to: Rebalancing collateral positions. Preparing assets for over-the-counter (OTC) deals. Making BTC available for distribution or sale. Internal management or consolidation of funds. Without explicit information from Tether, the exact reason for the transfers remains speculative. However, the fact that these funds are moving from a custody wallet, which typically holds assets long-term or as collateral, to a liquid exchange platform is what makes the event notable. What Does This Transfer Mean for the Market? A large Bitcoin transfer to an exchange like Binance is generally seen as a potentially bearish signal by some market participants, as it increases the supply of BTC available for trading and potentially selling. However, it‚Äôs crucial not to jump to conclusions based on a single data point or even a series of transfers without considering the broader market context. Key insights from this event include: Visibility: On-chain analysis provides transparency into significant fund movements. Potential Liquidity Increase: The transfers add substantial BTC liquidity to Binance . Interpretation Challenge: The specific intent behind the transfers by Tether is not publicly disclosed, making definitive conclusions difficult. Market participants should view this data point as one piece of the puzzle. While a large Bitcoin transfer to an exchange can signal potential selling pressure, it doesn‚Äôt guarantee a price drop. Other factors, such as overall market sentiment, demand, macroeconomic news, and other on-chain metrics, also play significant roles. Summary The recent movement of 200 BTC , following cumulative transfers of 1,650 BTC since May 9th, from a Tether custody wallet to Binance represents a significant flow of value onto a major exchange. While the exact reason for these transfers is unknown, they highlight the importance of monitoring large crypto wallet movements and exchange inflows as potential indicators of shifting market dynamics. This specific Bitcoin transfer activity from a wallet associated with lending collateral warrants attention from those tracking institutional or large-scale participant behavior in the crypto space.

But Unilabs (UNIL) is gaining traction for a good reason, as it recently launched the first AI-driven DeFi asset management platform. It already boasts over $30M AUM and countless users. Although market analysts like Maxi and Gordon remain optimistic for Ripple and Cardano, many traders are focusing more on the Unilabs Finance native crypto coin instead. This token is now in its third presale round, providing early buyers with a 55% return. Many traders even believe that UNIL could be the best crypto investment as it has many things that make it stand out. Unilabs (UNIL): DeFi Meets TradFi in a Unique Way While the Ripple price and the price of Cardano fell on the weekly charts, Unilabs (UNIL) is making a name for itself. Interest in it is sky-high as it recently launched the first DeFi asset manager fueled by AI technology. On it, users get access to next-level transparency and impressive returns. For example, Unilabs Finance has a Launchpad that uses AI-driven insights and real-time market data to locate the best new crypto coins with the most room for growth. Plus, they offer four distinct funds: AI, mining, RWA and BTC. This gives exposure to many thriving markets on Unilabs. By holding the UNIL crypto coin, traders will get perks. These include governance voting rights and staking rewards of up to 122% APY. As a result, over 500M UNIL tokens have been bought in the third presale round alone. It is now worth just $0.0062 but will soar to $0.0074 after phase four begins. This 20% growth may be the tip of the iceberg since a Tier-1 CEX will also list UNIL soon. Thus, the long-term growth potential of UNIL seems to be amazing. Maxi: The Ripple Price Could Breakout Soon Ripple (XRP) is one of the top crypto coins, but it has seen some price dips recently. CoinMarketCap shows that the Ripple price fell from around $2.20 to nearly $2.15 in the past seven days. In other words, almost a 5% drop for Ripple in a short time. But, market analyst Maxi remains optimistic about Ripple (XRP). According to a recent X post, Maxi said Ripple is now breaking out of a pennant. He even predicts that the Ripple price may surge past $4 soon. Although this bullish Ripple price prediction has made some waves, many traders are still cautiously optimistic. Given that the Ripple price has increased over 300% in the past 12 months, its highest growth may be behind it. Therefore, traders are looking to back Unilabs Finance instead of Ripple. Analyst Claims the Price of Cardano (ADA) May Moon Hard Cardano (ADA) is another crypto currency that has experienced some volatility. On the one-week chart, the price of Cardano fell over 5%, as per CoinMarketCap. The Cardano value dropped from around $0.70 to nearly $0.65 during that time. The community still thinks that the price of Cardano (ADA) may rebound soon. For instance, market analyst Gordon made an X post saying that Cardano could moon hard this cycle. Gordon even said that the price of Cardano may soar to $1.40. While this Cardano price prediction has made some headlines, many investors are still sidestepping it for Unilabs Finance. This could be because it has a high market cap of around $25B, which means a lot of new money must roll in for the price of Cardano to see a noteworthy pump. Can Unilabs (UNIL) See a Faster Price Surge Than Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA)? While the Ripple price and the price of Cardano may see rebounds soon, Unilabs (UNIL) is getting all the attention. This is all thanks to its passive income potential. Unilabs Finance announced that 30% of its platform fees will be redistributed among UNIL crypto coin holders. Plus, its referral layer will help bring more people to it. As more people join, more fees and greater returns for all UNIL holders will be present. Not only that, UNIL boasts a smaller market cap than both Ripple and Cardano and deeper AI ties. Therefore, its value will experience faster growth with less new money. As a result, traders are in a hurry to buy UNIL before a top-tier crypto exchange lists it and triggers a price spike.

This novel approach has not only piqued the interest of the crypto community but also reflected in their rapid growth, amassing over $30M in assets under management (AUM). Despite the bearish trends affecting Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA), analysts such as Maxi and Gordon maintain a positive outlook for these coins. Nevertheless, the innovative approach by Unilabs with its AI-powered asset management tools is drawing more investors towards its ongoing presale, which has already yielded a 55% return for early participants. Unilabs: Pioneering AI in DeFi Investment Strategies The distinctive edge of Unilabs lies in its deployment of AI to enhance asset management within the DeFi ecosystem. The platform offers transparency and potentially high returns, leveraging AI to analyze and predict market trends effectively. Their Launchpad is particularly noteworthy, enabling investors to spot promising new cryptocurrencies poised for significant growth. Unilabs also diversifies investment options through its specialized funds covering areas such as AI, mining, real-world assets (RWA), and Bitcoin (BTC). The added benefits for UNIL token holders include governance rights and lucrative staking rewards, with APYs reaching up to 122%. Market Dynamics: Ripple and Cardano's Struggle and Potential Recovery While Unilabs gains momentum, Ripple has encountered a slight downtrend with its price dropping about 5% last week, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite this, analyst Maxi suggests a potential breakout, predicting a significant rise past the $4 mark soon. Similarly, Cardano's recent price dip doesn't dampen spirits, as analyst Gordon forecasts a strong rebound, with price targets reaching up to $1.40. Yet, with a substantial market cap, Cardano faces a challenging climb, steering some investors towards more agile platforms like Unilabs. Comparative Growth Prospects: Unilabs vs. Ripple and Cardano While both Ripple and Cardano have robust communities and potential for recovery, Unilabs may offer quicker returns on investment due to its innovative use of AI and lower market cap. The upcoming listing of UNIL on a Tier-1 CEX further bolsters its appeal to those looking for rapid growth and substantial returns.

Analysts see both momentum and opportunity. Technical indicators like the MACD and Momentum Oscillator are sending out buy signals, which could mean a rally is coming. At the same time, Remittix (RTX) is transforming the way we carry out international transactions by connecting crypto with regular banking. Both Cardano and Remittix present tangible opportunities for massive gains in 2025. However, read on to find out why analysts believe that RTX could yield as much as 50x ROIs. Cardano‚Äôs calm before the storm Over the last month, Cardano has increased by a little over 5%. However, recent declines have eroded most of May‚Äôs early gains. The altcoin had 13 bullish days out of 30, which isn‚Äôt very encouraging. Cardano also recorded a volatility of 6.20%. It is now facing rejection at the $0.66 support zone, which is a price level it has tested and failed to break through three times. Some experts think this could mean that a bullish reversal is incoming. Many see potential in Cardano, even though it is still more than 75% below its all-time high of $3.10. CoinCodex has released a Cardano price prediction suggesting that the altcoin might reach $0.87 next month. Dan Gambardello, a well-known expert on X, also thinks the Stochastic RSI is at its lowest point. Source: X There hasn‚Äôt been a bounce yet; only pressure is growing. Nonetheless, popular technical indicators like the MACD, Momentum Oscillator, and MAs are already flashing buy signals. This supports the bullish Cardano price prediction by CoinCodex. Moreover, if the Cardano price can successfully break above the $0.87 mark over the coming weeks, a rally to $3 could take place. Remittix: where crypto meets global banking Remittix is making a strong connection between crypto and traditional finance. It lets individuals instantly change more than 100 cryptocurrencies into fiat money and send that money to any bank account in the world. All you have to do is connect your crypto wallet. The person getting the money gets a normal bank transfer, but they wouldn‚Äôt know it started as crypto. No extra fees, no FX conversion expenses, and no delays. Remittix is becoming one of the top crypto investment prospects because of this. The whole ecosystem runs on the Remittix token (RTX). Moreover, RTX holders have a say in how the platform progresses. The RTX presale is going on right now and each token is selling for only $0.0781. So far, more than 541 million RTX tokens have been sold, which has brought in over $15.5 million. There is no vesting period for presale buyers; they can get their tokens right away, five days after launch. But the team‚Äôs tokens are locked up for three years. That means actual dedication and long-term stability for the project. RTX is made for smooth trade because there are no taxes on buying or selling. RTX is one of the best cryptos to invest in if you‚Äôre seeking exponential gains in 2025. Remittix vs. Cardano: One is solid, the other could skyrocket Cardano could be getting ready for a massive breakout. The signs are there. However, Remittix is on a whole new level. It‚Äôs fixing a real urgent problem: making crypto work for ordinary global payments. RTX is set up for major moves as it has raised about $15.5 million already, showing massive investor interest. ADA has a consistent promise, but Remittix could give you rewards that change your life. Those who buy RTX for less than $0.10 now will be forever grateful for the decision when the post-presale surge sets in. Don‚Äôt only watch the next wave of crypto; ride it.

Whales are selling, with holders of 100,000 to 1 million tokens cutting stakes from 9.2 billion to 8.93 billion. Larger investors also reduced holdings from 26.45 billion to 26 billion.

In a significant move for the sector, especially for those tracking developments in Asia, South Korea is taking concrete steps towards establishing a clearer framework. Specifically, the ruling Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) is set to formalize a dedicated digital asset committee. This development signals a serious commitment from the government to address the complexities of the South Korea crypto market and integrate it into the nation‚Äôs economic strategy. What is the Digital Asset Committee and Why Now? According to local reports from News1, the DPK plans to officially establish a digital asset committee within the party structure. This committee isn‚Äôt entirely new; it currently operates under the party‚Äôs election campaign body, which played a role in supporting President Lee Jae-myung‚Äôs successful bid for office. The timing of its formalization is key: following President Lee‚Äôs election, the DPK will hold a party conference, after which the digital asset committee is expected to be officially launched as a permanent party body. The move reflects a growing recognition among South Korean policymakers of the importance of digital assets. With a high rate of cryptocurrency adoption and a vibrant local trading scene, the need for comprehensive and thoughtful regulation has become increasingly apparent. Formalizing this committee suggests a proactive approach rather than a reactive one, aiming to shape the future of the sector within the country. How Will This Committee Influence South Korea Regulation? The primary role of the new digital asset special committee will be to take the lead in shaping the party‚Äôs policies related to cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. This involves everything from identifying potential risks and developing consumer protection measures to exploring ways to leverage blockchain technology for economic growth and efficiency. Think of it as the party‚Äôs dedicated brain trust for all things crypto. They will likely: Review existing laws and propose amendments. Draft new legislation specifically for digital assets. Gather input from industry experts, investors, and the public. Develop strategies for promoting innovation while ensuring market stability. This focus on South Korea regulation from within the ruling party is a strong indicator that significant policy shifts are on the horizon. For businesses operating in or looking to enter the South Korean market, understanding the direction this committee takes will be crucial. Alignment with Presidential Promises and Future Structure The formalization of this committee is closely aligned with President Lee Jae-myung‚Äôs campaign promises regarding digital assets. During his campaign, President Lee signaled a supportive stance towards the industry while emphasizing the need for robust investor protection and regulatory clarity. Adding further weight to this initiative, a similar committee is also set to be formed under the president‚Äôs office. This parallel structure suggests a coordinated effort between the ruling party and the executive branch to develop a unified approach to digital asset policy. This dual committee structure is even outlined in a draft of the proposed digital asset basic act, indicating a long-term vision for the sector. This structure aims to ensure that the party‚Äôs policy recommendations are effectively translated into government action and legislation. It underscores the importance placed on the DPK crypto policy agenda at the highest levels of government. What Does This Mean for the Korean Crypto Market? For participants in the Korean crypto market, this development brings both potential opportunities and challenges. Potential Opportunities: Increased regulatory clarity could attract more institutional investment. Clearer rules could foster innovation and growth within the domestic industry. Investor confidence may increase with robust protection measures. South Korea could position itself as a leader in digital asset innovation and regulation. Potential Challenges: New regulations might introduce stricter compliance requirements for businesses. The specifics of policy could impact different types of digital assets differently (e.g., utility vs. security tokens). Balancing innovation with regulation is a complex task and the outcome is not guaranteed to satisfy all stakeholders. The formation of these committees is a critical step towards defining the future operating environment for digital assets in South Korea. Market participants should closely monitor the discussions and proposals emanating from these bodies. Looking Ahead: The Path to Formal Policy The official launch of the DPK‚Äôs digital asset committee after the party conference will mark the formal beginning of its work as a permanent body. Its recommendations and proposed policies will then feed into the legislative process, potentially culminating in new laws and regulations governing digital assets in South Korea. This structured approach, involving both the ruling party and the president‚Äôs office, suggests a comprehensive effort to build a foundational legal framework for the digital asset space. It moves beyond ad-hoc responses to market events and aims for a more predictable and stable regulatory environment. Conclusion: A New Era for South Korean Digital Assets The formalization of the digital asset committee by South Korea‚Äôs ruling DPK is a significant step, signaling a dedicated governmental focus on integrating cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology into the national framework. Coupled with a similar committee planned under the president‚Äôs office, this creates a powerful structure aimed at shaping future South Korea regulation . While the specifics of the policies are yet to be determined, the establishment of these bodies indicates a clear intention to provide clarity, foster innovation, and protect investors in the burgeoning South Korea crypto market. This development marks a new era for digital assets in the country, one where policy is being proactively crafted at the highest levels.

Instead, it‚Äôs about a market structure revolution, one that pivots around perpetual futures (perps). At the center of this transformation are Ripple, Flare , and Hidden Road, three entities laying the groundwork for a powerful new financial stack. According to a detailed post by CryptoCeej on X, this emerging infrastructure positions XRP and FLR as pivotal assets in the future of institutional DeFi. Perpetual Futures and Why They Matter Perpetual futures are leveraged crypto contracts that don‚Äôt have an expiration date. Traders can go long or short at any time, 24/7, allowing continuous exposure to digital assets without the constraints of standard futures contracts. Perps are not just a niche market, they represent the lion‚Äôs share of actual trading volume in crypto. Despite the attention often given to spot trading, it‚Äôs in the perpetual market that the majority of institutional capital is currently active. What makes perps so attractive to institutions and high-frequency traders is their inherent capital efficiency. They offer tighter spreads, deeper liquidity, often ten times that of spot markets, and flexible leverage ranging from 3x to 100x. For institutions seeking to hedge large positions, manage treasury risk, or simply deploy sophisticated strategies, perps offer the necessary tools with minimal friction. If you hold $XRP or $FLR , read this: The next chapter of institutional crypto isn‚Äôt just about ETFs, custody, or tokenization. It‚Äôs about perpetual futures‚Äîand Ripple, Flare & Hidden Road are building the backbone for it. Let me break it down. ‚Äî CryptoCeej: (@crypto_ceej) June 6, 2025 Ripple‚Äôs Vision: XRP as the Institutional Liquidity Layer Ripple is aligning its strategy to place XRP at the heart of this burgeoning derivatives ecosystem. The idea is to make XRP the go-to liquidity layer for institutions, with regulated perpetual futures contracts serving as the gateway. If major platforms or prime brokers like Hidden Road begin offering U.S.-regulated XRP perps, potentially settled in RLUSD and cleared directly on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), it could mark a seismic shift in market structure. This kind of setup offers multiple advantages. Ripple could hedge its own XRP holdings more efficiently, market makers would be incentivized to deepen liquidity, and institutional trading venues would gain a compliant, high-speed settlement rail powered by the XRPL. A Wall Street-friendly version of XRP trading‚Äîregulated, high-liquidity, and transparently settled‚Äîcould significantly elevate XRP‚Äôs status as a serious institutional-grade asset. With RLUSD acting as the settlement medium, the full stack becomes more cohesive and regulatory-aligned. Flare‚Äôs Role: Building the DeFi Engine for Perps Ripple focuses on institutional liquidity and regulatory compliance, whereas Flare prioritizes composability and on-chain utility. Its strategy is to support on-chain perpetuals for a suite of wrapped assets, including FXRP, fBTC, and fETH, all of which can settle natively on Flare‚Äôs EVM-based infrastructure. This unlocks a powerful set of DeFi use cases. Imagine staking FLR tokens to open a 2x long FXRP perpetual position and earning leveraged yield. Alternatively, tokenized Treasury bills can be used as collateral to borrow RLUSD, which can then be deployed into an XRP perpetual contract. These capital flows boost Flare‚Äôs liquidity pools, enabling liquidity providers (LPs) to earn higher returns. This model is not only capital efficient but also elegantly recursive: the more the system is used, the more liquidity is generated, and the more lucrative the DeFi yields become. It‚Äôs a self-reinforcing mechanism‚Äîa full-scale DeFi money machine built on top of real derivatives infrastructure. Hidden Road: The Institutional Rail That Connects It All Acquired by Ripple, Hidden Road functions as a global prime broker with a growing footprint in digital assets. Its role in this new ecosystem is multifaceted and crucial. Not only can Hidden Road custody institutional assets and execute perp contracts, but it can also act as a liquidity wholesaler. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This setup allows perpetual XRP liquidity to be white-labeled for decentralized exchanges (DEXs), providing DeFi traders with access to institutional-grade markets without relying on centralized exchanges. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for institutional capital to flow into on-chain ecosystems, without compromising on regulatory compliance or counterparty risk management. In practice, Hidden Road acts as a bridge between traditional finance and DeFi, providing seamless access to perpetual markets while handling custody, compliance, and execution in the background. A Unified Stack: DeFi 2.0 Meets Prime Brokerage 2.0 What makes this so compelling is the synergy among the three players. Ripple contributes the treasury infrastructure and compliance credentials needed to attract regulated capital. Flare‚Äôs EVM-compatible smart contract layer and composability enable the creation of sophisticated DeFi strategies. Hidden Road brings the institutional trading rails‚Äîexecution, custody, and connectivity. All of this is built around a core innovation: perpetual futures. These contracts become the centerpiece of a new, interoperable financial stack that connects traditional assets such as tokenized T-bills to decentralized liquidity pools via XRP perps. Fees from perps can feed back into DeFi LPs, while f-assets (like fBTC or fETH) can be used as collateral for new positions. With cross-chain routing enabled by solutions like Axelar, users can execute complex trades across multiple ecosystems in a single click. This is more than just a theory or a roadmap, it‚Äôs infrastructure that‚Äôs already taking shape. The Early Signal for XRP and FLR Holders CryptoCeej‚Äôs analysis presents a compelling case: the perp market is not only growing but is becoming the backbone of institutional crypto activity. And XRP and FLR are positioned at the center of this shift. For holders of these assets, this marks a critical inflection point. With institutional players increasingly seeking leverage, hedging strategies, and DeFi-compatible rails, the systems Ripple, Flare, and Hidden Road are building could become the preferred avenue for capital deployment. Those who understand this early and position accordingly stand to benefit significantly from the subsequent liquidity and adoption. In a space where timing and foresight often separate the winners from the rest, this could be the early signal the market has been waiting for.

The filing was submitted using SEC Form S-1, allowing Gemini to initiate the process without immediately disclosing key details such as financials or strategic intentions. While the number of shares and pricing range are yet to be finalized, the move signals the company‚Äôs readiness to explore public markets at a time when crypto-related firms are regaining investor attention. No official IPO date has been set. Founded in 2014 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Gemini was last valued at $7.1 billion in November 2021 after a $400 million fundraising round. However, like many other crypto firms, it experienced significant turbulence during the prolonged market downturn, leading to staff reductions. In January 2023, Gemini was targeted by the SEC over its now-defunct ‚ÄúEarn‚Äù program, which the agency alleged involved unregistered securities. Trump Connection and Regulatory Shadows Beyond its market ambitions, Gemini has also garnered political attention . The Winklevoss twins, prominent figures in both crypto and politics, each contributed $1 million to former President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign. These donations were subsequently refunded after exceeding the legal contribution cap for individuals. Though political affiliations aren‚Äôt directly tied to the IPO, such connections add a layer of public scrutiny and possible regulatory sensitivity as the exchange steps into the public market sphere. The confidential filing structure may be a strategic move to minimize premature exposure and potential backlash amid a still-uncertain regulatory climate for digital assets in the U.S. Nonetheless, the firm‚Äôs decision to move forward indicates growing optimism within the crypto sector. IPO Momentum Builds Gemini‚Äôs IPO filing comes hot on the heels of other high-profile crypto and tech firms entering public markets. USDC issuer Circle saw its share price surge 167% after a strong market debut on June 5. Earlier in March, AI infrastructure company CoreWeave made headlines after its shares skyrocketed following its public offering. Circle‚Äôs IPO caught the attention of institutional players such as BlackRock and ARK Investment, both of which are reportedly exploring large-scale stakes. The enthusiasm surrounding these listings is likely encouraging other firms‚Äîlike Gemini‚Äîto follow suit and capitalize on the renewed investor appetite. As IPO momentum builds, Gemini‚Äôs next steps will be closely watched by the crypto industry and financial markets alike.

The digital asset landscape is constantly evolving, and staying ahead means keeping an eye on emerging opportunities. Binance, one of the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently made an announcement that could pique the interest of those looking for early exposure: Binance Alpha adds AB to its platform. This news comes directly from Binance‚Äôs official channels, highlighting a specific project, referred to simply as ‚ÄòAB‚Äô, being featured on Binance Alpha. But what exactly is Binance Alpha, and why is this development significant for users navigating the world of early crypto projects ? Exploring Binance Alpha: A Gateway to Early Crypto Projects Binance Alpha isn‚Äôt just another section of the main exchange. It‚Äôs a dedicated platform integrated within the Binance Wallet ecosystem. Its core mission is to shine a spotlight on promising, early-stage cryptocurrency projects that are just starting to gain traction. Think of it as a curated showcase designed for users interested in discovering tokens before they potentially become mainstream. The selection process for projects featured on Binance Alpha is based on specific criteria. According to the announcement, tokens are chosen based on factors like community engagement and market trends among emerging projects. This suggests a focus on projects that are already building a following and showing signs of activity or interest within the broader crypto community. However, a crucial point emphasized by Binance is that inclusion on Binance Alpha does not guarantee a future listing on the main Binance exchange . This is a vital distinction for anyone considering engaging with projects highlighted on the platform. What Does Adding ‚ÄòAB‚Äô Mean for Binance Wallet Users? The addition of ‚ÄòAB‚Äô to Binance Alpha means that users accessing the platform through their Binance Wallet now have visibility into this specific early-stage project. While the initial announcement is concise, focusing on the fact that ‚ÄòAB‚Äô has been added and will be part of an ‚ÄòAB Trading Competition‚Äô (the specifics of which would require consulting Binance‚Äôs official details), the primary takeaway is the introduction of this project to the Alpha audience. For users, this presents an opportunity to research and potentially interact with the ‚ÄòAB‚Äô project at an earlier stage compared to waiting for a potential main exchange listing. Early access can sometimes come with significant upside potential, but it‚Äôs inherently linked with higher risk. Why Focus on Early Crypto Projects? Investing or engaging with early crypto projects attracts certain types of market participants for several reasons: Potential for High Growth: Early projects often have smaller market caps, meaning successful development and adoption could lead to substantial percentage gains. Being Part of a Community: Engaging with early projects often involves joining a passionate community built around the project‚Äôs vision and technology. Exploring Innovation: Early projects are frequently at the forefront of new blockchain technology, use cases, or tokenomics models. However, the allure of early opportunities must be balanced with a clear understanding of the significant risks involved. Not all early projects succeed; many fail, become inactive, or don‚Äôt achieve widespread adoption. Navigating the Risks of Early-Stage Crypto Trading While the potential rewards are appealing, engaging in crypto trading involving early-stage assets requires caution. Here are some key challenges and risks: Volatility: Early project tokens can experience extreme price swings due to low liquidity and market speculation. Liquidity Issues: It might be difficult to buy or sell large amounts of the token without significantly impacting its price. Project Risk: The project might not deliver on its promises, face technical challenges, or even be a scam. Lack of Information: Detailed information, historical data, and independent analysis might be scarce for very early projects. No Listing Guarantee: As Binance clearly states for Alpha, inclusion does not mean it will ever be tradable on the main exchange, limiting future access and liquidity options. Therefore, conducting thorough due diligence (DYOR ‚Äì Do Your Own Research) is paramount before engaging with any project featured on platforms like Binance Alpha. Actionable Insights for Binance Alpha Users If you are interested in exploring ‚ÄòAB‚Äô or other projects on Binance Alpha, here are some steps to consider: Access via Binance Wallet: Ensure you are using the official Binance Wallet to access the Binance Alpha platform. Research the ‚ÄòAB‚Äô Project: Look for any available information about ‚ÄòAB‚Äô ‚Äì its whitepaper, team, technology, use case, and community activity. Use external resources beyond the Binance announcement. Understand the ‚ÄòTrading Competition‚Äô: If a competition is mentioned, understand its rules, duration, and what participation entails. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Only allocate funds you can afford to lose, as early-stage investments are highly speculative. Monitor Community Sentiment: While not a sole indicator, community engagement and discussion can provide insights into the project‚Äôs traction. Remember that being featured on Alpha is an opportunity for visibility, not an endorsement or a guarantee of future success or listing. Comparing Binance Alpha‚Äôs Approach Binance Alpha‚Äôs model of highlighting early crypto projects through its wallet ecosystem offers a specific approach compared to other methods of discovering new tokens. Unlike launchpads which focus on initial fundraising rounds, or decentralized exchanges (DEXs) where anyone can list a token, Alpha appears to act as a curated discovery platform based on existing community interest and market trends. This positioning within the large Binance ecosystem provides visibility, while the explicit ‚Äòno listing guarantee‚Äô manages expectations regarding future exchange access. The Future of AB and Binance Alpha The trajectory of ‚ÄòAB‚Äô and other projects featured on Binance Alpha remains uncertain. Some may gain significant traction, continue development, and potentially even qualify for a future listing on the main Binance exchange based on sustained performance and community support. Others may fade away. The value of Binance Alpha lies in providing a structured way for users to find and research these projects, making the discovery process slightly more guided than sifting through countless listings on a DEX. Summary: Binance Alpha Adds AB, Highlighting Early Opportunities and Risks In conclusion, the news that Binance Alpha adds AB signals the platform‚Äôs continued effort to showcase early crypto projects to users of Binance Wallet . This presents an exciting opportunity for those interested in discovering potential high-growth tokens before they hit mainstream exchanges. However, it is critical to remember the inherent risks associated with early-stage assets, including volatility, liquidity issues, and the lack of a guarantee for future listing on the main Binance platform. Engaging with ‚ÄòAB‚Äô or any project on Alpha requires careful research, a clear understanding of the risks involved, and a commitment to responsible crypto trading practices. Stay informed, do your own research, and approach these early opportunities with caution.

The court‚Äôs three liberal justices ‚àí Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson ‚àí disagreed with that decision. The court paused an order issued by U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander of Maryland blocking DOGE from immediately getting broad access to the data, which includes Social Security numbers, medical and mental health information, tax return information, and citizenship records. Judge Hollander said DOGE was intruding on the personal affairs of millions of Americans in a fishing expedition based on little more than suspicion. She limited DOGE‚Äôs access to the information while the courts assessed the legality of the Trump administration‚Äôs actions. However, most of the judges presiding over the Supreme Court hearings said in a brief and unsigned decision that access was warranted now because the courts were likely to decide that DOGE could ultimately have the information. They added that a delay would harm the administration‚Äôs reorganization efforts and was not in the public‚Äôs interest. The judges concluded that the SSA may give members of the SSA-DOGE team access to the agency records in question so that they could do their work. Conservative lower-court judges said there was no evidence of DOGE mishandling personal information. Jackson says the court ‚Äòtruly lost its moorings‚Äô when deciding Justice Ketanji Jackson said the government wanted to give DOGE unrestricted access to personal, non-anonymized information before the courts had time to assess whether DOGE‚Äôs access was lawful. She added that the court had ‚Äútruly lost its moorings‚Äù when deciding what was worthy of emergency intervention by showing preferential treatment for the administration. Justice Jackson said the court‚Äôs action created ‚Äúgrave privacy risks‚Äù for millions of Americans by giving ‚Äúunfettered data access to DOGE‚Äù despite its failure to show any need or interest in complying with existing privacy safeguards, and all before it was known for sure whether federal law countenanced such access. Justice Sotomayor seconded Jackson‚Äôs opinion, and Justice Kagan said she would have ruled against the administration. ‚ÄúIn essence, although other stay applicants must point to more than the annoyance of compliance with lower court orders they don‚Äôt like, the Government can approach the courtroom bar with nothing more than that and obtain relief from this Court nevertheless.‚Äù ‚Äì Ketanji Jackson , Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Solicitor General D. John Sauer also argued that the ruling was an example of federal judges overstepping their authority and trying to micromanage executive branch agencies. The government claims DOGE needs access to SSA data to work The Trump administration said DOGE needed access to SSA‚Äôs data to target and cut waste in the federal government. However, former DOGE boss Elon Musk has been focused on Social Security as an alleged hotbed of fraud. The billionaire investor described it as a ‚Äú Ponzi scheme ‚Äù and insisted that reducing waste in the program was a meaningful way to cut government spending. Social Security‚Äôs Inspector General Gail Ennis previously disclosed $71.8 billion in improper payments from 2015 through 2022. Musk also said there were nearly 20 million people who were definitely dead and marked as alive in the Social Security database. However, Liz Huston, a spokesperson for the White House , applauded the Supreme Court‚Äôs order granting DOGE access to SSA records. She said that the court allowing the Trump administration to carry out common sense efforts to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse and modernize government information systems was a massive victory for the rule of law. The DOGE victory came amid a messy breakup between the president and the world‚Äôs richest man that started shortly after Musk left the White House. The breakup included threats to cut government contracts and a call for the president to be impeached. However, both men have previously said that DOGE will continue its efforts, although the future of its work would not be clear without Musk at the helm. The Tesla boss had previously suggested that $500 billion to $700 billion in waste must be cut.

Crypto investors in June 2025 have identified Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the most innovative Defi projects to launch in recent memory. They forecast that its innovation could be a major positive disruptor in the coming weeks. Let us take a deep dive into this unique project. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ‚Äì A Positive Force For Change The Mutuum Finance project aims to bring sweeping reform to how Defi works. In so doing, it aims to ensure the long-term solvency of its protocol, which will result in long-term gains for participants. Users can participate in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol as lenders, borrowers, or liquidators. When lenders deposit their assets in a pool, they start to receive interest, with the rate set by the pool‚Äôs utilization rate. The MUTM Token At the heart of this innovative protocol is the MUTM token. The positive performance of the MUTM token will be closely tied to the long-term success of the platform. This is especially so since Mutuum Finance is new to the market, and must meet and exceed investor expectations. For this reason, the team will adopt strategies that support the long-term growth of the token. Initially, a major portion of the protocol profits will be used to purchase MUTM tokens on the open market. These tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers participating in the safety module for a specific period. This will help to absorb selling pressure from buyers in the presale. Additionally, it will balance liquidity mining emissions needed to ensure optimal participation conditions for lenders and borrowers. After the initial MUTM token purchases, the team will transition to using most of the profits to reinvest in the platform. These investments will be used to enlarge safety funds, liquidity pools, and for marketing activities. However, they will continue to buy MUTM tokens on the open market and reward stakers. They will establish limits on the possible rewards to ensure it does not hamper the growth and expansion of the protocol. It is part of a long-term strategy to ensure Mutuum Finance remains solvent and continues to accumulate value for its participants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is currently in the presale, where it has raised over $10.1 million from over 11,700 unique buyers. It is currently in phase 5, where each token is going for $0.03. In phase 1 of the presale, the tokens were going for $0.01, and the price has since increased by 200%. Despite this price increase, interest in the presale has only continued to ramp up. One reason for this is that the token price will increase 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6 to $0.035. This increase will see the guaranteed ROI reduce from the current 100% to 71.43%. That has led to a surge of new buyers, with over 25% of the tokens set aside for this phase already sold, barely a week after it began. Another important catalyst is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway . The giveaway has spurred interest from new investors seeking to be one of the 10 lucky people who receive $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. To qualify for this giveaway, investors only need to participate in the presale with a minimum of $50. There are many reasons to participate in the presale, but one of the most compelling reasons is the real chance of winning a $10,000 reward in MUTM tokens. Additionally, presale buyers are added to a leaderboard, with the top 50 participants being eligible to receive bonus token drops. To view your position in the leaderboard, you can visit the presale dashboard. This gamification has attracted competitive crypto investors who are always up for a challenge. The massive success of the ongoing presale, coupled with the technical innovation of the platform, makes MUTM one of the most valuable tokens to add to your portfolio in June 2025. Analysts project modest gains of 10x at the minimum when this token lands on exchanges.

For the altcoin season to actually begin, past market performances show that there needs to be a major decline in the Bitcoin dominance. This is the ultimate trigger the market needs to confirm that altcoins will begin their own independent run. Bitcoin Dominance Needs To Fall To 62% The Bitcoin dominance is still trending at a high 64%, and this continues to be a thorn in the side of altcoins. With the dominance this high, the Bitcoin price continues to dictate where the market goes and has seen altcoins suffer crashes as a result of even the tiniest movement triggering a decline in prices. Related Reading: What Happens To The XRP Price If The 2017 Fractal Plays Out Again? However, crypto analyst Quantum Ascend has pointed out an interesting formation in the chart, which is a 7-wave crashing pattern. This pattern has been completed, and this signals a possible drop in the Bitcoin dominance as time goes on. The last phase of the 7-wave pattern was when the dominance hit a peak of 64.6% before declining back down toward 64%. This pattern suggests that the Bitcoin dominance could possibly drop to 62%, which would be good news for those waiting for the altcoin season. The last time that the dominance was this low was back on May 14, and altcoins had rallied hard as a result. For this decline to be completed, the crypto analyst reveals that confirmation lies below 63.45%, as this is the Wave 6 lows. Once this support is broken, a sharp drop toward 62% is expected from here. As the analyst explains, ‚Äúreal momentum kicks in under 62%,‚Äù and this is when altcoin season moves with full force. Altcoin Season Is Not Over The topic of a possible altcoin season is currently one of the most debated in the crypto community as market participants remain split on where it is in the cycle. Some have said there will be no altcoin season similar to what was seen in 2021, while others have maintained that it is still possible. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Averages $2 Billion In June As Price Struggles Below $0.2 One analyst on the X (formerly Twitter) platform has lent their voice, pushing the narrative that the altcoin season is far from over. For a 2021-style altcoin season to happen, though, the crypto analyst says the altcoin market, which excludes the top 10 cryptos by market cap, must break above the $470 billion resistance like it did in previous cycles. Once this happens, then they expect the altcoin season to begin.

The asset‚Äôs recent movement within a long-standing falling wedge formation has placed it in a position where either a breakout or a renewed decline appears imminent. EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), a well-respected analyst, shared this pattern with the XRP army on X, showing the conditions the asset must meet to confirm a bullish breakout on the 4-hour timeframe. #XRP ‚Äì Short-Term Move: To have #Bullish break-out then #XRP has to close: 1‚É£ $2.30 2‚É£ $2.35 3‚É£ $2.36 ‚Äì break-out from MEGA falling wedge 4‚É£ $2.45 5‚É£ $2.65 Is Go-Go signal #XRPFamily STAY STEAD and STRONG , Together We Rise pic.twitter.com/3Z2TfmWxEV ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 5, 2025 XRP Key Levels to Watch At the time of EGRAG CRYPTO‚Äôs analysis, XRP was trading at $2.24, and traders are closely watching whether momentum will tilt upward or if further downside risk remains. The chart identifies a ‚Äúmega falling wedge‚Äù pattern that has confined XRP‚Äôs price since its multi-year high of $3.39 in January. According to the analysis, several resistance levels must be broken before any meaningful upward continuation can be confirmed. These include $2.30, $2.35, and most crucially, $2.36, marked as the breakout point from the wedge. The analyst describes $2.65 as the ‚ÄúGo-Go signal,‚Äù suggesting a broader trend reversal if that target is reached. Notably, another well-known expert recently highlighted a similar falling wedge pattern , also suggesting that a massive rally of the asset will break out. XRP Support Zone Remains Critical While the asset is approaching resistance, a clear support box also stands out on the chart, ranging from around $1.77 to $2.05. EGRAG CRYPTO highlights this zone as one that needs to be retested and held if the bullish case is to remain intact. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP has shown remarkable strength this year and now faces the challenge of sustaining upward pressure without falling below key support lines. Failure to hold the lower levels could lead to a drop to $1.60 or even $1.47. The chart includes a direct warning that losing the bottom of the wedge at $1.47 could be catastrophic. Recent analysis shows a massive liquidity pool of around $2 . If the bears take control of the market, this area could help the digital asset rebound without dipping below that crucial support range. What to Expect from XRP To escape the downward pressure of the wedge, XRP must close above the critical resistance zone between $2.30 and $2.36. The $2.36 level, specifically, serves as the breakout point from the wedge. The asset is currently trading at $2.17, and a move above the outlined thresholds could set the stage for a rally toward $2.45 and $2.65. While EGRAG CRYPTO did not outline further targets, he recently predicted a move to $55 , and this could serve as a long-term target for XRP.

Over the past two weeks, XRP has stayed below the $2.20 threshold, trading within a narrow $2.14‚Äì$2.25 range. During this period, on-chain data shows daily transactions on the XRP Ledger hovering above two million, indicating steady network activity despite price stagnation. Amid this consolidation, market technician and longtime XRP bull EGRAG Crypto identified a final ‚Äúgo-go signal‚Äù at $2.65‚Äîa level he argues must be cleared for a bullish breakout. This signal comes as institutional adoption of XRP accelerates, positioning the token for a potential shift from sideways action to an extended rally. XRP Technical Analysis: The Mega Falling Wedge Since reclaiming the $3.00 mark in January 2025, XRP has entered a prolonged correction phase. On January 14, 2025, XRP peaked at $3.40‚Äîits highest level in seven years‚Äîbefore collapsing below $3.00. Subsequent price action formed a ‚Äúmega falling wedge‚Äù on the 4-hour chart, characterized by lower highs and lower lows over four months. Source: Egrag Crypto X EGRAG‚Äôs analysis pinpoints five critical price hurdles. The first is $2.30, a level XRP that has not been cleared since May 29, 2025. Next is $2.35, followed closely by $2.36‚Äîthe third target that, if conquered, would signal the wedge breakout. The fourth level stands at $2.45, representing a two-week high. Finally, EGRAG designates $2.65 as the ‚Äúgo-go signal,‚Äù suggesting that breaching this mark would confirm an end to the wedge pattern and trigger a strong upside move. Since mid-January, XRP has tested the wedge boundaries multiple times. A rally to $3.02 on March 17, 2025, stalled at the upper trend line, prompting a retest that returned the price to $2.75. Another attempt in early May saw XRP climb to $2.65 but fail to hold, instead dropping back into the wedge. These failed breaks highlight the importance of $2.65; it represents both a recent rejection point and EGRAG‚Äôs final trigger for a bullish phase. Institutional Adoption: ETFs, Futures, and Corporate Reserves Technical setups aside, XRP‚Äôs fundamentals are strengthening via institutional channels . On May 25, 2025, Brazil‚Äôs B3 exchange launched XRPH11, the world‚Äôs first Ripple-based ETF, allocating 95 percent of its assets to XRP. In parallel, CME Group introduced XRP futures on May 20, 2025, providing traders with new derivatives tools. Even more noteworthy, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first XRP futures ETF on April 30, 2025‚Äîmarking a regulatory milestone. This approval follows months of uncertainty and positions XRP alongside other major digital assets as an institutional product. On-chain flows corroborate growing demand: over $200 million worth of XRP moved into institutional-grade addresses in late May 2025, according to WhaleAlert data. Corporate adoption is also on the rise. Renewable energy provider VivoPower announced on May 15, 2025, that it raised $121 million to establish an XRP-focused treasury reserve, becoming the first publicly traded firm. Similarly, Webus International filed for a $300 million fundraising effort earmarked to create a strategic XRP reserve . These moves underscore institutional conviction in XRP as a trading asset and treasury instrument. While EGRAG‚Äôs wedge analysis provides a clear technical roadmap, market participants must weigh these levels against evolving macro and institutional drivers. XRP‚Äôs daily simple moving average (SMA) on both the 50-day and 200-day timeframes currently sits at $2.25 and $2.30, respectively. Failure to reclaim these SMAs has maintained bearish momentum. Yet, rising ETF holdings and futures volume‚Äîup 35 percent month-over-month‚Äîsignal that institutions eye XRP‚Äôs next move. What Next for XRP Price? Longer-term, EGRAG remains bullish beyond the $2.65 trigger. In prior analyses, he projected a $27 target for XRP‚Äîrelying on a broader bull cycle in digital assets that began in late 2024. XRP/USDT Price Chart| Source: TradingView However, short-term focus must center on the falling wedge. If price holds above $2.36 after breaking the wedge, the next logical step is $2.45. Sustaining above $2.45 would set the stage for the ‚Äúgo-go signal‚Äù at $2.65. At current levels‚ÄîXRP trading at $2.12 on June 5, 2025‚Äîliquidity remains thin at the $2.20‚Äì$2.30 band. Market depth is shallow, with aggregated bid orders totalling 1.2 million XRP at $2.20, versus 800,000 XRP at $2.30. This asymmetry suggests that even modest buying pressure could nudge the price toward the initial hurdle at $2.30. EGRAG‚Äôs call for a $2.65 breakout comes at a pivotal moment. Institutional networks‚Äîfrom ETFs to corporate reserves‚Äîare locked in XRP exposure. Simultaneously, on-chain activity remains robust with over two million daily transactions.

Although it dipped below $100K soon after, it‚Äôs now showing signs of recovery and a potential run upwards. Carlo Pruscino from CMC Markets believes that a Fed rate cut might drive $BTC back to $112K and potentially even beyond. Keep reading to find out Trump‚Äôs stance on a potential Fed rate cut, when we can expect one, and what the best altcoins to buy are to make the most of this pro-crypto situation. Trump Wants a Rate Cut Now Trump took to Truth Social to criticize the Fed on delayed rate cuts . He said that Europe has already had 10 rate cuts while the US is lagging behind. He also pointed out there‚Äôs no inflation anymore ‚Äì in case that‚Äôs what is holding back the Fed. He said that if inflation were to come back, the Fed could simply raise the interest rate again. As of now, though, Trump believes that the US is paying a lot more in borrowing costs than it should. It‚Äôs worth noting that the Federal Reserve has been mulling over rate cuts for quite some time. However, Trump‚Äôs ongoing trade tariff war and uncertain trade policies have held it from making a decisive move. The current borrowing rate is 4.25%‚Äì4.50%. As per CME Group‚Äôs data , 97.5% of market participants believe that this will remain unchanged in the upcoming Fed meeting on June 18. More than 51% of people believe that a rate cut might come around mid-September, where rates may be slashed by 25 basis points. If we see a rate cut earlier than expected, $BTC may be the first major asset to react. When‚Ä¶further rate cuts come, if they‚Äôre coming a lot sooner than expected, that will then impact heavily on the future price moves or crypto on Bitcoin and some other cryptos as well. ‚Äì Carlo Pruscino, a CMC Markets analyst To help you make the most out of upcoming policy changes, we‚Äôve handpicked the best cryptos to invest in . 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) ‚Äì Best Altcoin to Buy Right Now, Free $BTC Airdrops Bitcoin will almost certainly be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a rising crypto market. In fact, the ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô is what will pull the crypto market to new highs in the first place. As such, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) , a Bitcoin-inspired meme coin, is the best crypto to buy if you‚Äôre bullish on $BTC and want to maximize your returns. Unlike other altcoins, $BTCBULL token holders will be rewarded with free $BTC. This will happen on two occasions: once when Bitcoin reaches $150K and another when it reaches $200K for the first time. Just make sure to store your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet and participate in the airdrop events, which will take place on social media. In addition to having a genuine shot at grabbing real $BTC, you‚Äôll also benefit from a monstrous rise in $BTCBULL‚Äôs price. According to our BTC Bull Token price prediction , the token can reach $0.0096 by 2026 ‚Äì a 276% rise from current prices. Buy $BTCBULL now for just $0.00255 each. The project is in presale, where it has amassed nearly $7M. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) ‚Äì First-Ever Solana Layer-2, Insane $45M Presale Raise A rise in Bitcoin will likely lead to joyous times in the meme coin market as well, which is why we believe that Solaxy ($SOLX) could be one of the next cryptos to explode . Designed to strengthen the best blockchain for meme coins, $SOLX is being hyped as Solana‚Äôs prodigal son, and for good reason. After all, Solaxy will finally cure Solana of its congestion and scalability issues, which it has been facing ever since the success of $TRUMP and other viral meme coins overloaded it. Solaxy will build the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on Solana, which will offload transactions from the mainnet onto a sidechain. This will reduce the workload on Solana, thereby restoring its lightning-fast executions. Furthermore, this brand-new L2 will also process transactions in bulk, which will decrease the overall cost requirements on Solana. To participate in Solaxy‚Äôs one-of-a-kind mission and token growth ‚Äì it‚Äôs predicted to rise by over 11,300% by 2030 ‚Äì become an early investor in the project. It‚Äôs currently in presale, with over $45M raised, and you can get each token for just $0.001748. Here‚Äôs how to buy it . 3. PepeCoin ($PEP) ‚Äì Pepe-Inspired Meme Coin Currently Among the Top Gainers Although you wouldn‚Äôt be wrong to think that PepeCoin ($PEP) borrows its popularity from the legendary $PEPE meme coin, it‚Äôs got a handful of unique features that have had a fair bit of say in it being one of the top trending cryptos . For instance, PepeCoin runs on its own blockchain, which is how it offers astonishingly low transaction fees and zero $ETH gas fees. Coming to its performance, $PEP is up over 3,000% since its inception in June 2024 . More recently, the token has recorded 28% gains over the past thirty days. According to price action analysis, $PEP is closing in on a major resistance level ($0.00024), a break of which could see the token soar to $0.00027 and beyond. The Best Altcoins to Benefit from a Rate Cut, but They‚Äôre Not Completely Dependent on It With a rate cut on the horizon, major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum could finally start rallying ‚Äì and the altcoin space will only get more bullish. While new cryptos, like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and Solaxy ($SOLX) , will indeed benefit from increased public borrowing and investment, their solid fundamentals and community hype will likely see them rising regardless. However, make sure you do your own research and due diligence before investing.

45639472,https://zycrypto.com/?p=107070,1749296475,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png,Hong Kong Approves of Crypto Derivatives to be Traded by Professional Traders,https://zycrypto.com/hong-kong-approves-of-crypto-derivatives-to-be-traded-by-professional-traders/,"Hong Kong‚Äôs securities regulator has announced that professional traders can now trade crypto derivatives, allowing a select few to access virtual derivatives markets and advancing professional crypto adoption in Asia. Hong Kong has recently made many efforts to adopt reasonable crypto regulations, enabling the Asian country to lead in blockchain innovation. Christopher Hui Ching-yu, secretary for financial services, said that the move aligned with Hong Kong‚Äôs competitiveness in the global digital assets market. The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said the new derivatives market will be rolled out securely and transparently. The derivatives market is much larger than the spot market. Many traders prefer derivatives because they can use advanced tools to manage their portfolios and minimise risk. Hong Kong crypto traders can now enjoy further freedom when investing in cryptocurrencies. The new rollout, however, will be limited due to the SFC taking a cautious approach to enabling crypto trades. The SFC will monitor the situation unfolding, presumably allowing more crypto technologies if the problem is favorable. Derivatives traders were waiting for new regulations to be drawn up, removing uncertainty when trading crypto derivatives. In May, Hong Kong approved legislation relating to stablecoin adoption. Stablecoins are digital currencies that are pegged to traditional currencies such as USD. Hong Kong‚Äôs regulators also released a licensing scheme so traders could have confidence in the stablecoin market. Approval of stablecoins will inevitably allow Hong Kong to enable DeFi platforms to build sophisticated financial tools. Hong Kong seems to be taking a deliberate approach so that regulators can identify any shocks in the crypto market and roll back the approvals accordingly. The exciting news will include further tax concessions for crypto investors, including a possible concession for single-family-owned businesses. The forward-thinking nature of Hong Kong, often dubbed the New York of Asia, may attract crypto investors worldwide. The end goal of regulators may be to attract high-end investors to the local market. The government also plans to streamline services such as tax, licensing, and compliance, thus making crypto investing hassle-free. The SFC will make another announcement later in 2025, releasing information regarding web3 technologies and building blockchain infrastructure projects. There is still much more work on risk disclosures and custodial responsibilities. The future-bound announcement will address these concerns and much more. In September 2024, Hong Kong regulators promised to implement a crypto derivatives framework. They specifically wanted to build off a European standard that was widely accepted, such as one authored by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Hong Kong, meanwhile, has gathered steam while pushing for crypto adoption across the local business district. Hong Kong was responsible for releasing Asia‚Äôs first spot in the ETF market. There are over 1,000 FinTech companies across the country. Christopher Hui Ching-yu, secretary for financial services, announced that Hong Kong was reforming its tax system to attract foreign investors. The tax department will soon treat digital assets preferentially. Hong Kong has been promoting its financial services sector within its administrative borders and throughout China. Hong Kong aims to incentivize digital trading, competing with other countries on the global stage. Ching-yu acknowledged that Hong Kong was home to 8 digital asset banks.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|Hong Kong,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-07 11:41:15

Analyst Brian Meredith still has a buy rating on Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) Class B shares, but has cut the price target from $606 per share to $591, reports CNBC. In an investment note, Meredith says the decline in the share price target is due to the expectation of less investment income as well as no stock buybacks this year and in 2026. ‚ÄúWe continue to believe BRK‚Äôs shares are attractive in an uncertain macro environment with $347 billion of cash and [short-term] investments, a defensive business mix, and manageable tariff exposure.‚Äù Data shows Berkshire‚Äôs billionaire CEO Warren Buffett has parked $305.5 billion into the safe-haven asset class, short-dated Treasuries. Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs holdings in short-dated Treasuries increased from $286.472 billion in Q4 2024 to $305.501 billion in Q1 of 2025 ‚Äì a 6.64% increase in three months. Data from the Treasury Department shows Berkshire‚Äôs trove of US debt is large enough to surpass Taiwan‚Äôs holdings at $297.8 billion. At the same time, the firm has been slashing stakes in banking giants Citigroup, Bank of America, and Capital One. Filings show that the investment firm fully exited Citigroup after dumping its remaining shares worth $1 billion. The firm also sold 48.7 million Bank of America shares worth about $2.19 billion, and cashed out 300,000 shares in Capital One, which were worth roughly $46.489 million. BRK.B is trading for $493 at time of writing.

45640085,https://coinpedia.org/?p=467225,1749297864,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Chainlink Price Prediction Experts Now Recommend Bitcoin Solaris: ‚ÄòLike Mining Bitcoin in 2010 From Your Phone,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/chainlink-price-prediction-experts-now-recommend-bitcoin-solaris/,"The post Chainlink Price Prediction Experts Now Recommend Bitcoin Solaris: ‚ÄòLike Mining Bitcoin in 2010 From Your Phone appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Chainlink bulls have long argued that LINK is one of the most essential utility tokens in all of crypto. With its oracles powering smart contracts and deep integrations across DeFi, LINK has earned its reputation. But recent long-term projections‚Äîlike a modest $29.83 price in 2040‚Äîhave some investors wondering if they‚Äôre aiming too low. And that‚Äôs why a growing number of Chainlink price analysts are shifting their gaze toward a new contender: Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S). Why? Because it doesn‚Äôt just forecast growth‚Äîit unlocks wealth creation today. And it does it from the one tool every investor already owns: their phone. LINK Has Utility‚ÄîBut BTC-S Has Income Chainlink‚Äôs ecosystem is thriving. It secures billions in DeFi, anchors hybrid contracts, and powers financial data pipelines. But it‚Äôs primarily a backend service layer, not a direct income generator for everyday users. Bitcoin Solaris flips that model. It‚Äôs built not just for developers, but for anyone who wants to earn. Through the upcoming Solaris Nova App, users can mine, manage, and grow BTC-S directly from mobile devices and laptops‚Äîno expensive equipment, no technical skill, no waiting. And that‚Äôs a game-changer. The Solaris Nova App Is Making Crypto Passive Again At the center of the BTC-S movement is the upcoming Solaris Nova App, a beautifully designed mining suite that transforms the most common devices‚Äîphones, laptops, and browsers‚Äîinto daily earning tools. What it delivers: Tap-to-mine setup optimized for non-technical users Seamless operation across Android, iOS, Windows, and browser platforms Built-in wallet with biometric login and encrypted keys Real-time mining stats and earnings tracking Performance-based gamification and leaderboard features Smart device-aware energy usage controls This isn‚Äôt just accessibility‚Äîit‚Äôs wealth-building in disguise. Users can begin mining without capital barriers, echoing the energy of 2010 Bitcoin miners‚Ä¶ except now, it fits in your pocket. Deep Architecture Powering the Simplicity BTC-S isn‚Äôt only about usability. Behind the tap-to-earn interface is one of the most powerful blockchain designs in the market: a hybrid dual-layer architecture combining Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake. Base Layer: SHA-256 PoW, with 5-minute block times, anchored on accumulated hash power Solaris Layer: DPoS with 21 active validators, rotating every 24 hours Smart contract throughput of up to 100,000 TPS Block size scaling up to 32MB Smart contracts written in Rust, following the Solana development model Optional Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy and compliance This dual-consensus structure allows BTC-S to combine decentralized security with lightning-fast execution, making it a true powerhouse for both developers and earners. Turn Your Device Into a Mining Machine Real Rewards: Distribution That Favors Participation Unlike tokens, where gains depend solely on market movements, BTC-S includes direct block-level rewards: 40% of mining rewards go to Base Layer PoW miners 25% to Solaris Layer validators 20% to stakers Bonus weighting based on device specs, uptime, and contribution value This creates a powerful flywheel: users mine, get rewarded, and reinvest‚Äîall within the same decentralized ecosystem. Influencers Are Paying Attention Crypto analysts and influencers have begun echoing what early adopters already know: BTC-S isn‚Äôt hype‚Äîit‚Äôs built. Crypto Legends : Broke down how BTC-S ‚Äúfeels like early Bitcoin all over again‚Äîexcept this time, it‚Äôs mobile.‚Äù Crypto Royal : Highlighted the layered architecture and validator fairness model. Token Empire : Called the upcoming app ‚Äúa gateway to passive crypto ownership for the average user.‚Äù Token Galaxy : Focused on how the dynamic reward system encourages long-term engagement. This kind of influencer alignment rarely happens during presale phases, but it‚Äôs happening now. Presale Fueling the Engine Bitcoin Solaris isn‚Äôt just being praised‚Äîit‚Äôs being purchased. Over 11,000 unique users have already joined, and with over $3 million raised , the momentum is undeniable. What‚Äôs more, it‚Äôs happening under a strict 90-day schedule, making it one of the shortest presales in recent memory. Current Price: $6 Next Phase: $7 Launch Price: $20 Bonus: 10% Ends: July 31, 2025 Return Potential: 1,900% Only ~8 weeks remain There‚Äôs no fluff‚Äîjust utility, daily engagement, and rising demand. Security, Community, and Compliance BTC-S understands that in 2025, credibility matters. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs already passed a rigorous audit by Cyberscope , and its team is fully KYC-verified . It also maintains strong, responsive presence across Telegram and X , where updates, AMAs, and presale stats are shared live. Transparency isn‚Äôt a feature‚Äîit‚Äôs standard operating procedure. Conclusion: From Chainlink Predictions to Bitcoin Solaris Reality Chainlink will always have a place in Web3 infrastructure. But at 5% projected annual growth, it‚Äôs not a path to overnight wealth. BTC-S, on the other hand, is engineering accessibility, income, and growth directly into its architecture, then placing that power in the hands of users. This isn‚Äôt a model built for institutions‚Äîit‚Äôs built for you. And if you missed mining Bitcoin in 2010, this time, you‚Äôre holding the rig in your hand.

Their public dispute has caused markets to end the week on a bearish note. However, a weekly report from the cryptocurrency exchange Binance indicates that investors are cautiously optimistic, with growing confidence in a soft landing and a slowly cooling economy. Still, they remain sensitive to inflation risks and signals from the Federal Reserve. Trump-Musk Feud Shakes Markets Bitcoin (BTC), which has mostly consolidated between $104,000 and $106,000 since the beginning of the week, fell below $101,000, tumbling to a multi-week low amid the Trump-Musk feud . Ether (ETH) also took a hit, briefly falling below $2,400. Besides the struggling prices of BTC and ETH, their balances on crypto exchanges recorded significant drops in the first few days of the month. Since the start of May, the metric tracking the two biggest digital assets has plummeted 4.3% and 7.5%, respectively. This plunge in supply has marked new yearly lows for the balances of BTC and ETH held on exchanges. Binance believes this could be a sign of accumulation because investors are moving their assets off trading platforms. Moreover, bitcoin‚Äôs correlation with equities and gold has continued to hold. The two-month BTC‚ÄìS&P 500 correlation rose to 0.49 from last week, while the cryptocurrency‚Äôs correlation with gold climbed to 0.09. ETFs Gain Institutional Traction On the brighter side, crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are gaining institutional traction, which can be attributed to some recent regulatory reforms. Towards the end of May, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued guidance stating that staking activities on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks do not constitute securities transfers. From then on, crypto ETF providers could incorporate staking rewards into their offerings. Building on the same momentum, the multinational finance giant JPMorgan announced two days ago that it would allow clients to use crypto ETF shares as collateral for loans. Notably, Circle, the stablecoin issuer behind the USD Coin (USDC), launched its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The firm raised $1.5 billion for the IPO by selling 34 million shares at $31 each. However, the 220 million outstanding shares disclosed in its June 2 filing with the SEC said the valuation stood at $6.9 billion. At the time of writing, the firm had a market capitalization of at least $20 billion, following the skyrocketing of its shares on the NYSE after the listing.

Saylor said the company aims to raise approximately $1 billion through a 10% fixed-income preferred stock offering. The majority of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, particularly for the purchase of more Bitcoin. Saylor, who stated that they have made three different preferred stock offerings in the last six months, said that these vehicles offer high fixed returns to investors, and at the same time, the company increases shareholder value by directing these funds to Bitcoin investments. According to Saylor, this model offers ‚Äúindefinite‚Äù fixed-income investments with no debt maturity and no refinancing risk. ‚ÄúBy pairing a long-term liability with a long-term asset, we are essentially creating an indestructible balance sheet,‚Äù Saylor said, outlining the company‚Äôs strategy. He argued that this model offers both an attractive 10% yield for fixed income investors and indirectly gives equity investors access to more Bitcoin. Touching on the regulatory front, Saylor stated that the recent recognition of Bitcoin as a ‚Äúdigital commodity‚Äù by the US administration, the positive changes made in accounting standards, and the green light given to Bitcoin by banks show the improvement in the sector. Related News: Donald Trump-Elon Musk Debate Hits Cryptocurrency Markets Too! Millions of Dollars Became Liquid! Here Are the Details One of the most striking statements on the program was Saylor‚Äôs long-term Bitcoin forecast. Referring to a speech he gave in July 2024, Saylor argued that Bitcoin could provide an average annual compound return of 30% for the next 20 years. According to this scenario, Bitcoin could reach $13 million in 2045. Citing past performance as an example, Saylor said Bitcoin has gained 57% annually over the past four and a half years, four times the S&P 500 and eight times the real estate and bond returns. ‚ÄúBitcoin is crushing everything,‚Äù he said. His statements at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference also came to the fore. Saylor reiterated that he was against Strategy‚Äôs ‚Äúproof-of-reserves‚Äù application for the 567,000 Bitcoins it holds. Stating that this poses a security risk, Saylor stated that he maintained this view despite the criticisms of some Bitcoin advocates who called for transparency. *This is not investment advice.

The appointment comes a day after the company announced AI models designed for US national security applications. According to Anthropic, the new appointee , Richard Fontaine, will take up the role in its long-term benefit trust. The company‚Äôs long-term benefit trust is a governance mechanism that Anthropic claims helps it promote safety over profit. The trust also has the power to elect some of the company‚Äôs board of directors. The other members of the trust include Center for Effective Altruism CEO Zachary Robinson, Clinton Health Access Initiatives CEO Neil Buddy Shah, and Evidence Action President Kanika Bahl. Anthropic announces the appointment of its national security expert In the statement, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that the appointment of Fontaine will ensure the trust‚Äôs ability to guide the company through the most complex decisions about artificial intelligence as it relates to security. He also added, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve long believed that ensuring democratic nations maintain leadership in responsible AI development is essential for both global security and the common good.‚Äù Fontaine is expected to become a trustee in Anthropic but without a financial stake in the company. He previously served as a foreign policy adviser to the late Senator John McCain, also taking up a role as an adjunct professor at Georgetown, teaching security studies. He also led the Center for A New American Security, a national security think tank based in Washington, D.C, acting in the capacity of its president for more than six years. His appointment comes after the company appointed Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings to its board. Anthropic has been increasing its United States national security customers as it continues to seek new revenue sources. In November 2024, the company teamed up with Palantir and AWS, the cloud computing division of its major partner and investor, Amazon, to sell Anthropic‚Äôs AI to defense customers. At the time, Anthropic‚Äôs head of sales, Kate Earle Jensen, said the company‚Äôs collaboration with Palantir and AWS would ‚Äúoperationalize the use of Claude‚Äù within Palantir‚Äôs platform by leveraging AWS hosting. AI labs continue moves to land defense contracts While Anthropic has indicated its interest in going after defense contracts , it is not the only top AI lab doing so. OpenAI is looking to establish a close relationship with the United States Department of Defense. Last December, the company announced a partnership with Anduril, a defense startup that makes missiles, drones, and software for the United States military. Anduril co-founder and CEO Brian Schimpf said OpenAI‚Äôs AI models will be used to improve systems used for air defense. Meta also announced that it was making its Llama models available to defense partners. ‚ÄúWe are pleased to confirm that we‚Äôre making Llama available to U.S. government agencies, including those that are working on defense and national security applications, and private sector partners supporting their work,‚Äù Meta wrote in a blog post in November 2024. The company said it will partner with different agencies, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Scale AI to make sure Llama is accessible to government agencies. Meanwhile, Google has also announced that it is refining a version of its Gemini AI capable of working within classified environments. According to an executive of the firm, a larger percentage of the US government‚Äôs military and intelligence enterprise has shown interest in a specialized, air-gapped version of Google‚Äôs Gemini AI model. The executive also said that in private meetings with the government‚Äôs military and intelligence agencies, demos of the specialized version of Gemini have piqued the interests of their workforce.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As TRON and Solana rise, Unilabs Finance gains traction as a leading AI coin and hedge fund alternative. Table of Contents How high can the TRON price go? The Solana price nuked from its 30-day high of $187 to $140 Unilabs Finance among experts‚Äô 2025 best AI coins to invest in Closing thoughts Although the TRON price is in an uptrend and optimistic Solana price predictions are flying, Unilabs Finance (UNIL) is in the headlines for its unique approach. As the pioneering AI-backed asset management platform for digital assets, it emerges as a strong alternative to traditional financial markets. Poised to attract a substantial share of traditional hedge fund capital, experts consider its utility coin, UNIL, a better bet than TRX and SOL. It is undervalued at $0.0062 in the third stage of the ICO and is listed among the best AI coins to invest in. You might also like: Can Unilabs flip DOGE price with mining fund success and 10x forecast in 2025? How high can the TRON price go? The TRON coin is among this week‚Äôs top gainers after defying broader market trends. It is also among the best performers in the past month, soaring by over 10%. It trades above $0.27 as of press time, gathering momentum for a breakout above $0.3 In addition to bullish sentiment ‚Äî rising investor confidence ‚Äî moving averages signal further upswings in the TRON price. Bulls could force a rally above the 2024 all-time high of $0.44 in the coming weeks; hence, the current TRON price is a great entry. Be1iev9r, a top analyst on Crypto Twitter, made an optimistic TRON price prediction after hinting at a potential rally toward $0.75 in 2025. Despite its upside potential, TRX‚Äôs large market cap makes it less appealing compared to low-caps like UNIL. This new DeFi token, considered one of the best AI coins to invest in, might outperform this cycle. The Solana price nuked from its 30-day high of $187 to $140 The Solana price retested $140 from a 30-day high of $187. However, it isn‚Äôt over for the Layer-1 coin. For one, the 20-CCI, Williams Percent Range (14) and Stochastic RSI Fast give strong buy signals. Time to buy the dip? Additionally, bold Solana price predictions have been flying, suggesting a bullish reversal. Zencrypt Technologies identifies support around the $140 mark and hints at a rally toward $400 and $500. Lofi_back is also optimistic with their $500 SOL price prediction. With the current Solana price representing a discount, now might be a great time to stack up. However, UNIL‚Äôs higher upside potential makes it a new favorite over SOL. As a low-cap altcoin, there is plenty of room to run, prompting experts to list it among the best AI coins to invest in this year. Unilabs Finance among experts‚Äô 2025 best AI coins to invest in At the heart of the Unilabs Finance ecosystem ‚Äî the first AI-backed DeFi asset management platform ‚Äî is the UNIL token. It will be both the utility and governance coin, driving massive demand among investors. In just the third stage of its ICO, over $2.4 million has been raised in funding, highlighting its potential as one of the best AI coins to invest in. A token currently costs only $0.0062, which investors have been gobbling up ahead of the increase to $0.0074 in the next stage. Besides the steady increase in investors‚Äô investments as the presale progresses and the explosive growth post-launch, there are other benefits to holding the UNIL token. According to experts, investors don‚Äôt just invest; they will actively shape the future of an AI-powered DeFi ecosystem while earning consistent returns. 30% of the total fees generated by the platform will be redistributed to holders via a 5-tier system, the bigger the holdings, the bigger the drop. In addition, holders will be eligible for periodic airdrops of launched tokens and early access to high-potential investment opportunities, making it one of the best AI coins to invest in. Closing thoughts As the pioneering AI-backed DeFi asset management platform, Unilabs Finance is on track for massive adoption. Attracting just 0.1% of traditional hedge fund capital will be bullish for the protocol, making its native utility coin, UNIL, one of the best AI coins to invest in. Despite the soaring TRON price and potential rebound of the Solana price, UNIL‚Äôs small market size makes it more attractive. Additionally, a whopping 30% of the total fees generated by the protocol will be redistributed to the UNIL holders. To learn more about Unilabs, visit the website and its Telegram .

While Dogecoin comes with its charm and strong community backing, Ruvi AI‚Äôs innovative approach and real-world utility have positioned it as a smarter investment choice for 2025. Dogecoin‚Äôs Widespread Popularity and Its Limits Dogecoin‚Äôs (DOGE) rise to fame is nothing short of remarkable. Initially created as a parody of the cryptocurrency craze, it transformed into one of the most recognizable coins, thanks to its strong community and viral appeal. Celebrity endorsements and social media campaigns further cemented its status as a cultural icon in the crypto world. However, beyond its entertainment value, Dogecoin faces clear limitations. Its utility remains minimal, with most of its value rooted in speculative trading. While its low price point has attracted many beginner investors, its lack of foundational technology and industry disruption capabilities has led many to seek alternatives offering greater promise and tangible utility. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Revolutionary Approach Ruvi AI (RUVI) has emerged as a compelling choice for investors looking for innovation and real-world impact. The project seamlessly blends blockchain with advanced AI technology, creating an ecosystem focused on practical applications. The platform empowers users with cutting-edge tools to generate content including text, images, videos, and audio, targeting industries like marketing, media, and automation. The $RUVI token serves as the backbone of this ecosystem, granting holders staking rewards, governance participation, and access to premium features. Ruvi AI‚Äôs utility-driven approach sets it apart from Dogecoin‚Äôs meme-based appeal, making it a project with the potential to disrupt traditional industries and provide sustainable growth. Presale Success Reflects Ruvi AI‚Äôs Potential Ruvi AI‚Äôs presale has been nothing short of impressive. Phase 1, priced at $0.010 per token, sold out in just two weeks, delivering a 50% return when Phase 2 launched at $0.015. The momentum continues to grow, with over 135 million tokens sold and 1,400 investors joining its community. A key milestone was achieved when Ruvi AI secured its first exchange listing before the presale‚Äôs conclusion, a rare and significant accomplishment in the crypto world. This demonstrates the project‚Äôs leadership and commitment to execution. Looking ahead, more announcements regarding partnerships and listing platforms are anticipated, further solidifying its growth trajectory. Comparing Dogecoin and Ruvi AI Dogecoin and Ruvi AI represent vastly different investment opportunities. Dogecoin thrives on its meme-driven ethos, appealing to those drawn to community engagement and speculative trading. However, its lack of real-world utility limits its long-term growth potential. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, is an early-stage project with enormous upside. Its core focus on industry solutions, coupled with its strong presale performance and upcoming exchange presence, makes it an attractive choice for investors searching for exponential growth opportunities. With technology and application as its foundation, Ruvi AI is designed to deliver outcomes that extend far beyond market hype. Investment Scenarios for Ruvi AI Ruvi AI‚Äôs presale investment tiers offer excellent entry points for early backers aiming to maximize returns. Here‚Äôs how the scenarios break down, based on a listing price of $0.07 and a projected $1 token value after listing: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 $RUVI ($750 investment) Bonus : 40% (+20,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 70,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $4,900 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $70,000 VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 $RUVI ($1,500 investment) Bonus : 60% (+60,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 160,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $11,200 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $160,000 VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 $RUVI ($7,500 investment) Bonus : 100% (+500,000 tokens) Total Tokens : 1,000,000 Value at Listing Price ($0.07) : $70,000 Value at Predicted Price ($1) : $1,000,000 These tiers highlight how early investors can unlock substantial returns by participating in Ruvi AI‚Äôs presale. Why Ruvi AI Is the Smarter Bet The shift from meme-based tokens to high-utility projects is evident as investors seek more lucrative and reliable opportunities. Ruvi AI‚Äôs rapid momentum, innovative technology, and real-world applicability solidify its place as the smarter altcoin bet for 2025.

According to analysts and industry leaders, adopting a full-fledged Bitcoin strategy could serve as a powerful financial and political move for Musk. ‚ÄúFull porting Bitcoin is the best way for Elon to get back at Trump,‚Äù wrote crypto analyst Will Clemente in a June 6 post on X. Echoing that view, JAN3 CEO Samson Mow made a direct appeal to Musk: ‚Äú@elonmusk, it‚Äôs time to go all in on Bitcoin.‚Äù The comments come amid a series of public barbs traded between Musk and Trump on social media over taxes, tariffs, and government subsidies. Calls for Tesla to Resume Bitcoin Payments Mow further urged Musk to resume accepting BTC for Tesla purchases‚Äîa move the company paused in 2021 due to environmental concerns. He also called on Tesla to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy to diversify its holdings away from fiat currencies. Despite discontinuing Bitcoin payments, Tesla still holds significant digital assets , which declined in value from $1.076 billion to $951 million in Q1 2024. Mow proposed that Musk extend BTC payment options to SpaceX customers by offering launch discounts for BTC payments. ‚ÄúForce a hard money standard on the money printers,‚Äù Mow added, in a pointed comment directed at fiat-based financial systems and central banks. The push follows growing criticism that the U.S. government has failed to act on its so-called Strategic BTC Reserve, which was reportedly signed into executive order form by Trump months ago but hasn‚Äôt yet materialized into any purchases. Musk‚Äôs Potential Influence on Bitcoin Global Narrative Some believe that if Musk does commit fully to Bitcoin, the impact would be global and transformational. Lomob CEO Boyd Cohen noted, ‚ÄúIf Musk were to go BTC maxi, all bets are off. He doesn‚Äôt do anything small.‚Äù Cohen predicted Musk could rapidly build the world‚Äôs largest Bitcoin treasury and influence global adoption through his companies. The feud intensified after Musk criticized Trump‚Äôs tax plan and warned that his proposed global tariffs could push the U.S. into a recession. Trump fired back by suggesting that eliminating Musk‚Äôs government subsidies could save taxpayers billions. While Musk has a history of engaging with crypto, most recently discussing BTC-style encryption for X‚Äôs messaging feature, many are watching closely to see whether he will translate his crypto commentary into action.

Lagrange ( LA ) token dropped to $1.1345, down by 37% from its highest point this week. It has moved to its lowest level since Thursday, giving it a market capitalization of $220 million. The ongoing sell-off came after the LA price jumped by over 500% following its airdrop and eventual listing by the biggest crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase, Binance, MEXC, Bybit, and Upbit. Lagrange price has likely plunged as some earlier investors start to book profits. Data shows that exchange inflows have started to rise, a sign that this profit-taking is happening. These inflows rose on Friday and Saturday following two days of outflows. It is common for a newly listed token to surge initially and then plunge as the hype fades. For example, the Official Trump ( TRUMP ) meme coin initially surged in January and then plunged afterward, erasing billions of dollars in value. You might also like: Immutable price drops even as Guild of Guardians NFT sales jump Lagrange‚Äôs token also dropped as interest on social media eased. Data shows that its social dominance has fallen from 1.4% on Thursday to 0.97% today, meaning that the fear of missing out among traders is fading. Further, the decline also happened as the crypto market crash occured this week, with Bitcoin retesting the support at $100,000. Lagrange is aiming to be a big player in the artificial intelligence industry. It is leveraging zero-knowledge proofs to secure decentralized applications. Its main product is the ZK Prover Network that generates ZK proofs for blockchain computations. Its ZK Coprocessor enables off-chain computation of large-scale data. Lagrange price analysis LA token price chart | Source: crypto.news The 30-minute chart shows that the Lagrange price has crashed in the past two days. Technically, this crash happened after the token formed a double-top pattern at $1.8053. A double-top is one of the most bearish chart patterns because it signals that investors are afraid of placing bids above that level. Therefore, the LA token price will likely continue falling and possibly move below $1 as investors continue their profit-taking.

Developers are optimizing smart contract performance, network throughput is expanding, and Layer 1 and Layer 2 innovations are converging with AI, DeFi, and modular infrastructure. One project, in particular, is making headlines for its potential to reshape the way decentralized applications (dApps) are built: Qubetics . Its AI-powered QubeQode IDE marks a major leap forward in the no-code and low-code movement, enabling a wider range of users to build, test, and deploy blockchain applications without needing deep technical knowledge. This article explores three best altcoins to buy for the next bull run, examining their technological innovations, market strength, and ecosystem value. It dives deep into Qubetics and its developer-centric IDE, then follows with an assessment of SUI and Near Protocol. 1. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics emerges as a transformative force in the blockchain space, primarily due to its QubeQode Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This platform offers a user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop components and a comprehensive code snippet library, simplifying the development of decentralized applications (dApps). The integration of AI-driven tools further enhances the development process by enabling smart contract generation, code optimization, and error detection with minimal coding knowledge. This approach democratizes blockchain development, making it accessible to a broader audience and accelerating innovation within the ecosystem. Crypto Presale Momentum: A Testament to Growing Interest Qubetics‚Äô ongoing presale has garnered significant attention, reflecting the market‚Äôs confidence in its vision.

This robust participation in the crypto presale signifies the project‚Äôs potential and the community‚Äôs belief in its long-term value proposition. Potential Returns: Evaluating the Growth Trajectory The Qubetics presale is nearly over. With just 10 million $TICS tokens left at $0.3370, this is the last shot for adopters before it officially lists at a potential $0.40. The team recently slashed the total supply from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion, building scarcity straight into the tokenomics. They‚Äôve also handed over nearly 39% of the supply to the public‚Äîputting real power in community hands. With demand rising and supply running thin, analysts are buzzing about a breakout when $TICS hits the market. If you put in $8,000 today at the $0.3370 presale rate, you‚Äôd scoop up approximately 23,739 $TICS tokens. If it lists at $0.40, your stash would be worth $9,495.60, giving you a quick return of $1,495.60. If the token‚Äôs value rises to $1 post-presale, the holdings would be worth $23,747, yielding a 196% return. If the price escalates to $5, the value would soar to $118,735, marking a 1,383% return. Further projections estimate that at $10, the holdings would be valued at $237,470, and at $15, they would reach $356,205, indicating a 4,349% return. Why this crypto makes it to this list: Qubetics‚Äô innovative approach to simplifying blockchain development through its QubeQode IDE positions it as a compelling pick among the best altcoins to buy for the next bull run . 2.

Whales are selling off holdings, with Santiment data showing a reduction from 9.2 billion to 8.93 billion coins for mid-tier holders.

According to reports, the minister also had a meeting with New York City Mayor Eric Adams. According to reports inside Pakistan, the minister held discussions concerning blockchain with United States Senator Cynthia Lummis, who is a key architect of the US crypto regulation. Senators Bill Hagerty, Rick Scott, Tim Sheehy, and Jim Justice were also present at the meeting in Washington, DC. According to the press release made available on Friday, Saqib also engaged in several discussions with members of the Financial Services Committee at the White House. Pakistan‚Äôs crypto minister discusses blockchain regulation with US officials During the discussions, he mentioned the country‚Äôs intention to be a global leader when it comes to cryptocurrencies and blockchain . ‚ÄúFrom Capitol Hill to the White House, I shared a new face of Pakistan: one driven by youth, innovation, and global partnerships,‚Äù he said. He also discussed the recent initiatives undertaken by the country with the US officials, including Pakistan‚Äôs plans to establish its strategic Bitcoin reserve. In addition, Saqib also talked about the steps that Pakistan has taken towards the establishment of its virtual asset regulatory framework and the adoption of stablecoins to streamline the country‚Äôs remittances. According to the press release, the country sees more than $36 billion in annual remittances, owing to its booming freelance sector. Meanwhile, in a separate meeting with New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Saqib discussed the challenges and approaches to the growing digital asset industry in the country. He mentioned that the sector opens up a high-potential market, but the country needs to be careful about how it decides to approach it in terms of regulation, so it can help it and not stifle its growth. During the meeting, which took place at Mayor Adam‚Äôs residence, Saqib noted that the Pakistan Crypto Council is willing to work with New York City to aid regulation and innovation. Crypto collaboration on the horizon in the country New York and Pakistan have both launched their respective crypto councils, as they aim to ensure responsible growth of their digital asset sector. The meeting marked a step towards direct collaboration between the two councils, with plans to develop knowledge-sharing, capacity-building, and policy advisory initiatives. The visit to Gracie Mansion concluded his official US tour, which focused on blockchain innovation, public-private partnerships, and international crypto cooperation. Over the past few months, the country has set up several initiatives as it aims to regulate the crypto industry. After setting up the PCC, it set up the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority to regulate blockchain-based financial infrastructure to ensure the FATF-comp¬≠liant and responsible adoption of digital assets. The PCC meeting held earlier this month touched on various subjects, including a draft framework to regulate the sector. The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Muhammed Aurangzeb, who also serves as the chairman of the PCC. He discussed the formation of a technical committee comprising representatives from SBP, SECP, law, and IT & telecom divisions to review draft laws and propose a robust framework and governance structure for digital assets. The PCC also convened a meeting last week to discuss confusion surrounding its crypto policy. The development came after internal arguments over the legality of holding digital assets in the country, a stance that the State Bank of Pakistan has clarified.

The retrace comes amid rising US bond yields and escalating trade conflict rhetoric between major global powers, particularly the United States and China. While Bitcoin holds strong above key support levels, altcoins‚Äîincluding Ethereum‚Äîare under pressure, prompting caution among short-term traders. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 ‚Äì Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash However, some analysts believe this dip could present an opportunity rather than a threat. Top analyst Ted Pillows shared technical insights suggesting that Ethereum is holding range support well, even after the sharp decline. According to Pillows, ETH‚Äôs ability to stay above critical support zones is a positive sign, with a potential breakout toward higher levels if it manages to reclaim momentum within the range. The coming weeks will likely be decisive for Ethereum and the broader altcoin market. If market volatility calms and Bitcoin continues to consolidate above $100K, Ethereum could lead the next leg up, opening the door for a strong altseason. For now, traders are closely watching how ETH behaves around its current support to determine whether a deeper correction or a bullish reversal is in play. Ethereum Holds Range Support Amid Market Volatility Ethereum is showing resilience despite heightened macro uncertainty and political tensions between Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump. Following a sharp pullback, ETH has managed to defend key support levels, with bulls stepping in near the $2,400 zone. This recovery comes at a time when the crypto market is on edge, reacting to broader financial market volatility and shifting sentiment across global assets. ETH remains approximately 48% below its all-time high, leaving substantial upside potential if momentum continues to build. The coming weeks will be decisive, especially as Bitcoin consolidates above $100,000 and traders look to Ethereum and altcoins for the next leg higher. Despite global headwinds, including inflation and escalating trade tensions, Ethereum is maintaining strength within its current range. Pillows emphasized in a recent analysis that Ethereum is holding range support nicely after the dump. According to his view, reclaiming this range is a key signal that bulls remain in control. If ETH can break through near-term resistance levels and reclaim the $2,600 mark, it opens the door for a push toward $3,000 ‚Äî a psychological and technical milestone. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop ‚Äì Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally ETH Rebounds As Consolidation Continues Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,466, holding just above the 34-day EMA at $2,422 after a volatile week. As seen on the daily chart, ETH remains inside a consolidation range between $2,400 and $2,700. Despite recent pressure across altcoins, ETH has managed to avoid a breakdown and is attempting to stabilize above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. The chart shows that ETH‚Äôs recent pullback stopped just before the 100-day SMA (~$2,068), a level that has acted as a strong dynamic support in past cycles. Holding this structure is critical for the bullish outlook to remain intact. If bulls can push the price back above the 200-day SMA at $2,666, Ethereum could attempt a breakout above $2,700 ‚Äî a move that would likely open the door to $3,000 and signal renewed strength in the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Solana Horizontal Support Under Pressure ‚Äì Bearish Target At $142 Volume has remained moderate, suggesting traders are waiting for confirmation before entering new positions. As long as ETH holds above the $2,400‚Äì$2,450 region, the bullish thesis remains valid. A daily close below $2,400, however, could expose the asset to a deeper correction toward the $2,200 zone, where the 100-day EMA provides additional technical support.

The arrangement highlights the stark policy divide between mainland China‚Äôs hardline anti-crypto stance and Hong Kong‚Äôs ambitions as a digital asset hub. It also offers a practical solution for Chinese authorities to convert seized crypto into fiat currency without breaching domestic restrictions. According to a local report from Tech In Asia , Beijing‚Äôs Public Security Bureau established a disposal framework that involves collaboration with the China Beijing Equity Exchange to coordinate the sale of virtual assets seized in criminal cases. Third-party agencies will carry out transactions on licensed platforms, and proceeds will be converted to yuan and transferred to designated government accounts. This marks the first formal process established by mainland Chinese authorities for disposing of seized crypto.

While Beijing maintains one of the world‚Äôs most restrictive cryptocurrency policies, Hong Kong has actively cultivated its position as a regional digital asset hub. Hong Kong‚Äôs regulatory framework allows licensed exchanges to serve institutional and qualified retail investors. This creates an ideal conduit for Chinese authorities seeking to liquidate seized assets and also maintain compliance with mainland restrictions. The arrangement shows Hong Kong‚Äôs strategic value as a bridge between China‚Äôs strict domestic policies and the global cryptocurrency ecosystem. Licensed exchanges in the territory can process large-scale transactions and also ensures regulatory compliance and proper documentation.

Official estimates suggest authorities control approximately 194,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ) and 833,000 Ethereum ( ETH ). Previously, Chinese authorities lacked established mechanisms for converting seized cryptocurrencies into traditional currency. The timing coincides with global trends in government cryptocurrency holdings, as law enforcement agencies worldwide are puzzled on how to manage the substantial digital asset seizures. The United States government currently holds approximately 200,000 Bitcoin worth around $16 billion, while the United Kingdom possesses over 61,000 Bitcoin from fraud investigations. Beijing‚Äôs decision to utilize Hong Kong‚Äôs cryptocurrency infrastructure shows the practical flexibility within China‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne Country, Two Systems‚Äù framework. The arrangement allows mainland authorities to access regulated cryptocurrency markets without compromising domestic policy positions. Chinese authorities maintain that the liquidation process aligns with existing anti-cryptocurrency policies by removing seized digital assets from circulation rather than facilitating new trading activities. The framework establishes clear procedures for converting volatile digital assets into stable fiat currency and reduces storage risks and administrative burdens associated with long-term cryptocurrency custody.

This belief forms the foundation of a recent bold forecast by renowned crypto analyst EGRAG Crypto , who has confidently declared: ‚ÄúIn July we shall fly so high.‚Äù His technical analysis points to a potentially explosive breakout for XRP, with projections soaring as high as a 2,500% rally ‚Äî a move that could reshape market sentiment and reignite enthusiasm among XRP holders. The Historical Cycles: XRP‚Äôs Rhythmic Pulse EGRAG‚Äôs chart meticulously maps out XRP‚Äôs long-term price history, identifying three distinct market cycles since 2014. Each cycle appears to follow a predictable two-phase pattern: Phase 1: A strong initial rally. Phase 2: A sharp retracement or consolidation period before another surge. Cycle 1, which occurred around 2017, witnessed an initial breakout (labelled ‚Äú1‚Äù) followed by a second explosive move (labelled ‚Äú2‚Äù) that took XRP to new all-time highs. Cycle 2, spanning the period between 2018 and 2021, mimicked this pattern, though with longer consolidation and a slightly diminished relative peak. #XRP ‚Äì iN JUly wE sHaLl fLY sOo SOO hIGh: ONLY FEW : pic.twitter.com/Bha2RayjBJ ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) June 7, 2025 Now, EGRAG suggests XRP is entering the crucial second phase of Cycle 3. His analysis indicates that XRP has completed the foundational buildup of Phase 1 and is poised for a parabolic move ‚Äî Phase 2, potentially beginning in July 2025 . Technical Validation and the 2,500% Target The chart highlights a critical consolidation zone around the $0.58 level, which EGRAG identifies as the structural support area. From this base, XRP is projected to launch upwards. The chart‚Äôs annotations point toward a measured move targeting an average rally of 2,500%, with price target reaching around the $13 to $15 range. This projection is not pulled from thin air; it mirrors the magnitude of XRP‚Äôs past cycles and aligns with the broader fractal symmetry the asset has historically respected. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In addition, a notable observation from the chart is that XRP‚Äôs 21 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) appears to be curling upward, hinting at the early stages of bullish momentum. With market participants watching July closely, this EMA trend adds technical credence to the forecast. A Message to the Faithful Few EGRAG‚Äôs message is not just technical, it‚Äôs emotional. His phrase, ‚ÄúONLY FEW,‚Äù embedded in the chart‚Äôs upper quadrant, reflects a sentiment shared by many long-time XRP holders who have weathered the prolonged legal battles and uncertain regulatory climate. The phrase suggests that only a small fraction of market participants have remained steadfast, and they may now be on the cusp of a historic payoff. If EGRAG‚Äôs projection materializes, it could signify XRP‚Äôs long-awaited decoupling from its legal shadow. Broader Implications for XRP and the Crypto Market A successful 2,500% rally would not only validate EGRAG‚Äôs cyclical thesis but would also mark a significant revaluation of XRP‚Äôs role in the evolving crypto-financial landscape. Ripple‚Äôs expansion into stablecoins, cross-border payment corridors, and institutional finance underscores the increasing utility of the XRP Ledger. Moreover, if XRP follows through on this cycle projection, it could shift capital allocation within the crypto space. Traders and investors may begin to re-examine long-term value plays over short-term hype, giving renewed attention to projects with real-world use cases and strong institutional backing.

That‚Äôs just a 0.11% increase from April‚Äôs $3.282 trillion and well below what was expected by analysts, who had forecast $3.292 trillion. This gain came even though the yuan lost 1.05% against the US dollar , and the dollar itself slipped 0.23% compared to other major currencies. The regulator said the rise came from a mix of exchange rate moves and price changes in overseas-held assets, according to data from Reuters . Even though the yuan got weaker, the value of China‚Äôs foreign holdings still moved up. The number was small, but the country remains in control of the world‚Äôs largest forex reserve pile. China‚Äôs central bank also wasn‚Äôt just sitting around watching the charts. China continues gold buying despite price swings While most of the world stayed frozen in wait-and-see mode, China kept stacking gold like a country preparing for something big. In May, the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) added 60,000 troy ounces to its already massive reserve, bringing the total to 73.83 million fine troy ounces. This is the seventh month in a row of non-stop gold buying. Gold prices went wild earlier this year, climbing to record highs in April. Central banks played a huge part in that spike, as they pumped billions into the metal to move away from over-reliance on the US dollar. The PBOC‚Äôs continuous buying has been a key force keeping gold prices high even after the April rally cooled off. At the same time, investors have also been pouring into gold as global tensions and fears about US assets grow louder. Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that central banks are currently swallowing up about 80 metric tons of gold per month. That‚Äôs $8.5 billion monthly, based on where prices are sitting right now. A lot of these transactions don‚Äôt make the headlines because they‚Äôre done quietly. Still, trade data suggests that China is behind a big chunk of that demand, along with unnamed players moving shipments through Switzerland. All together, central banks and sovereign wealth funds have been absorbing about 1,000 tons of gold annually. That‚Äôs 25% of yearly global production, according to the World Gold Council. An HSBC survey in January of 72 central banks showed that over a third of them plan to buy even more gold in 2025. Not a single one said they‚Äôre selling. Timur Suleimenov, the head of the National Bank of Kazakhstan, said they were selling last year but have now flipped. Sanctions, distrust in dollar fuel move into gold This surge in buying didn‚Äôt just happen out of nowhere. A lot of it started after the US and allies froze Russia‚Äôs foreign reserves in 2022 following its full invasion of Ukraine. That single move shook a lot of governments, who suddenly realized their dollars could be taken away overnight. Many are now doubling down on reserves they can keep close and untouched. ‚ÄúGold is the safest reserve asset,‚Äù said Adam Glapinski, the governor of the National Bank of Poland. ‚ÄúIt is free from direct links to the economic policy of any country, resistant to crises and retains its real value in the long term.‚Äù Adam‚Äôs not alone. Central banks that once dumped gold in the 1990s‚Äîlike the ones in Canada, Switzerland, and the UK‚Äîare now watching other countries scoop up what they let go. After the 2008 financial crash, central banks started slowly increasing their gold stockpiles again. That pace exploded after Russia‚Äôs sanctions . But most of the action is now silent. Many buyers avoid publicly reporting how much gold they‚Äôre buying. Even when they do, it barely reflects reality. In 2024, only about a third of actual central bank gold purchases were publicly confirmed. Most banks still notify the International Monetary Fund when they adjust their gold holdings, but plenty don‚Äôt. Sovereign wealth funds also tend to keep their cards close to their chest. These days, nobody wants their reserves held hostage. Russia‚Äôs frozen money‚Äîmainly stuck in Euroclear, a clearing house based in Belgium‚Äîis still sitting there while some Western leaders now want to grab it to help Ukraine. That‚Äôs another reason gold stored inside a country‚Äôs own borders has become more attractive. Massimiliano Castelli, managing director at UBS Asset Management, said the dollar‚Äôs role in global reserves is likely to keep shrinking faster than before. That doesn‚Äôt mean countries can easily ditch the dollar‚Äîthere isn‚Äôt enough high-quality debt in other currencies to absorb the change. But that‚Äôs where gold comes in again. It‚Äôs not just about risk. It‚Äôs about control. JPMorgan Chase analysts said that if just 0.5% of global US-dollar reserves are redirected into gold in the next few years, the price could shoot up to $6,000 per ounce by 2029. That‚Äôs more than double today‚Äôs levels. Hambro, from BlackRock, said: ‚ÄúThe gold market is a big market, but the dollar market is enormous. A small amount moving from the dollar market to the gold has a big impact.‚Äù KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Economy|CNY|Federal Reserve|Gold|PBOC|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-07 13:13:15

Arca will also cut ties with Circle and stop accepting USDC in its operations following the dispute. Circle‚Äôs NYSE debut raised $1.05 billion, spotlighting USDC‚Äôs growing role in regulated digital finance. Digital investment firm Arca has sold its entire stake in Circle, following its public criticism of the stablecoin issuer‚Äôs initial public offering (IPO) process. Arca Chief Investment Officer Jeff Dorman disclosed the move after publishing a sharply worded open letter on June 5, accusing Circle of sidelining the firm during the stock allocation. Circle, which operates the world‚Äôs second-largest stablecoin USDC, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange the same day under the ticker CRCL. Arca‚Äôs $10M Circle Bid Yields Just $135K in Shares, Says Dorman Dorman claimed Arca had placed a $10 million order for Circle shares in April but was allocated only $135,000 worth of stock. In the now-deleted post, Dorman wrote: ‚ÄúWe pinged you separately two months ago indicating our order, and you thanked us for the support. If you were going to f*** us at the end, the least you could have done was tell us two months ago.‚Äù Following the IPO snub, Dorman said Arca will cut all business ties with Circle, including ending the use of USDC in its operations. ‚ÄúWe will tell every single dealer we work with that we will no longer accept USDC,‚Äù he wrote. UPDATE. They did not. In the spirit of transparency, Arca has sold its $CRCL shares. https://t.co/F37kxw77Ny ‚Äî Jeff Dorman (@jdorman81) June 6, 2025 Circle‚Äôs listing marks a major milestone in crypto‚Äôs push into traditional finance. The company raised $1.05 billion in its IPO, with shares jumping 167% on the first day of trading, closing at $82. The rally continued on June 6, with shares changing hands near $115. USDC currently holds a market capitalization of over $61 billion, cementing its role as a key liquidity instrument in crypto markets. While Circle‚Äôs Wall Street debut drew attention, Dorman‚Äôs high-profile criticism has added a layer of controversy to what was otherwise a landmark moment for the stablecoin sector. Circle‚Äôs Public Debut Shows Push Toward Regulated Digital Finance USDC, the stablecoin issued by Circle in partnership with Coinbase, remains one of the most trusted in the market, backed by regular attestations and adherence to regulatory standards. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire called the company‚Äôs public listing ‚Äúa significant and powerful milestone,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúthe world is ready to start upgrading and moving to the internet financial system.‚Äù ‚ÄúAll along, we‚Äôve aimed to be trusted, transparent, compliant, ethical, and well-governed,‚Äù Allaire said. ‚ÄúMeeting NYSE and SEC standards only reinforces that commitment.‚Äù Industry observers expect the capital raised through the IPO will support Circle‚Äôs efforts to expand its infrastructure, strengthen global partnerships, and navigate the increasingly complex regulatory landscape. Circle‚Äôs debut comes amid renewed investor interest in crypto-related stocks. The company reported $1.68 billion in revenue and reserve income last year. Net income declined to $156 million from $268 million in the previous year, but the company remains on solid footing, driven by continued growth in USDC adoption across digital payments and crypto markets.

Pepe ( PEPE ), the second-biggest meme coin on Ethereum ( ETH ), plunged to a low of $0.00001043, down by 36% from its highest point in May. This decline happened as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and most meme coins plunged because of profit-taking and geopolitical issues. Pepe‚Äôs crash also happened as whales continued exiting their positions, signaling that they expected the downtrend to continue. The supply held by whales has dropped to 137.4 trillion, down from the year-to-date high of 166 trillion. Their holdings have fallen to the lowest point since November last year. The Network Realized Profit/Loss metric has plunged into the negative zone, a sign that some sellers are exiting at a loss. More on-chain data shows that active addresses have slumped to less than 3,000. Pepe on-chain metrics | Source: crypto.news On the positive side, Pepe has become cheap, which may push investors to buy the dip.

A negative MVRV ratio means that a coin‚Äôs market value has moved below the average price at which holders acquired their coins. It often signals that a coin is in a buy zone. Pepe price technical analysis Pepe chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Pepe token price has decreased from last month‚Äôs high of $0.00001622 to $0.000011 today. It is consolidating at the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Pepe‚Äôs price has moved above the 23.6% Fibonacci Retracement level. It has also formed a cup-and-handle pattern, with the upper side at $0.00001622 and the lower side at $0.0000052. The recent dip is likely part of the formation of the handle section of the C&H pattern. Therefore, if this pattern works out, the coin will likely bounce back and retest the all-time high of $0.00002712, about 135% above the current level. This view will be confirmed if it rises above the cup‚Äôs upper side at $0.00001622.

According to data from Farside Investors, the funds recorded $25.3 million in inflows on June 6 alone, bringing the current 15-day inflow streak‚Äîdating back to May 16‚Äîto a total of $837.5 million. This persistent trend represents nearly 25% of the total $3.32 billion in net inflows since spot Ether ETFs launched in July 2024. If the momentum continues into the upcoming week, analysts predict the current streak could easily cross the $1 billion threshold. Ether ETFs Outshines Bitcoin as Flows Diverge While Ether ETFs continue their strong run, spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed a dip in investor sentiment. Bitcoin ETF inflows broke their previous streak on May 29, followed by a sharp outflow of $346.8 million. Since then, the flows have been volatile, contrasting Ether‚Äôs more consistent capital movement. During this period, Ether has outperformed Bitcoin in price growth. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has surged by over 31% in the past month, now trading at $2,490, according to CoinMarketCap. Some market analysts believe this momentum may be sustained through the current cycle. Technical analyst Crypto Eagles noted that Ether appears to be mimicking historical cycles, particularly the 2020‚Äì2021 bull run. If this pattern continues, Ether could be on track to challenge its previous all-time high of $4,878, set in November 2021. Analysts Push for Staking Features in ETFs Despite the promising trend, some industry experts argue that Ether ETFs still have room to evolve. One key area of improvement is the inclusion of staking features. Allowing investors to earn rewards from Ether staking directly through ETFs could improve both fund performance and investor appeal. On May 31, ETF provider REX Shares filed to launch the first Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs in the U.S. Although a launch date is yet to be confirmed, Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart stated that REX used ‚Äúregulatory workarounds‚Äù to bring these products closer to market. As institutional interest strengthens and new innovations emerge, Ether ETFs could play a growing role in bridging traditional finance with decentralized assets.

This rebound has reignited short-term interest in WLD, especially after multiple rejections below the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement. Despite broader weakness seen in late May, the latest bounce reflects a technically significant effort by bulls to regain momentum. What‚Äôs Happening With Worldcoin‚Äôs Price? WLD price forecast (Source: TradingView) Following a steep correction from the May high of $1.64, Worldcoin price recently revisited its 78.6% Fib level near $1.02, forming a double bottom structure on the 4-hour chart. This level coincides with a broader bullish order block extending to the $0.98 range. Price has since rebounded to $1.11, reclaiming the $1.09‚Äì$1.10 structure support. The 4-hour chart displays a breakout from a falling wedge, with the current candle structure pushing above a short-term descending trendline. As of June 7, Worldcoin has broken back into a minor supply zone between $1.11 and $1.13. Sustained closes above this level could encourage bullish follow-through toward $1.16 or even $1.23 in the coming days. ‚Ä¶ The post WLD Price Prediction for June 08 2025: Can Worldcoin Sustain Its Recovery Above $1.10? appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|Market News|News|Price Analysis|Price Prediction|Worldcoin (WLD),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|WLD,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-06-07 13:28:12

You‚Äôre reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Legislative moves The narrative Here's what's clear: There are bills and they will probably get votes next week. Here's what's unclear: What all lawmakers might need to get enough votes to actually advance these bills, and if they're there already or not. Why it matters The crypto industry has waited for years for Congress to pass legislation giving it some sort of regulatory clarity. Congress has taken a number of key steps this year already, but next week might see quite a few of these steps happen. Breaking it down Logistical details first. There will be markups in the House Financial Services Committee and the House Agriculture Committee on the market structure bill, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (otherwise known as just the Clarity Act) on Tuesday. That markup will likely end with lawmakers voting to advance the bill to the broader House of Representatives (it's possible the vote will fail, but it currently seems unlikely). On the Senate side, lawmakers might hold a series of votes as early as Monday on the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 Act (otherwise known as GENIUS) to advance it. Senator Ruben Gallego, the Arizona Democrat who spearheaded a pause in the bill's advancement, said in an interview on Thursday that he expects a massive bipartisan vote in favor of the legislation. It'll need 60 votes to clear cloture (this is a second cloture vote) and a simple majority afterward to pass the Senate entirely. After that, it's on to the House. ""We've worked in a very honest, earnest manner with our Republican colleagues. We think that they've been also doing the same,"" he said. ""They adopted a lot of the amendments, most of the amendments that we're we've been adding, and they've been continuing to work with some other Democrats who have some other concerns, but we believe that if all the changes are made, it's going to be a very solid, comprehensive bill that I think we could all be proud to vote for."" In other words, by the end of next week it's possible the House of Representatives will have both a market structure bill to consider, amend and vote on and a stablecoin bill (the House Financial Services Committee version of GENIUS, the STABLE Act, already passed out of that committee a while ago). Whether both bills will make it to U.S. President Donald Trump's desk by the August recess is an open question. Policymakers in Washington, D.C. this week seemed skeptical that both bills would be passed by that deadline, though stablecoin legislation is likely to clear the House and Senate by then. One theory flying around is that the GENIUS Act in the Senate might get tagged onto the House's Clarity Act, letting the House vote on both its market structure bill and stablecoin bill at once and sending both back to the Senate. To be clear, this isn't a firm plan, just something various individuals have suggested is a possibility. However, I've heard that there will likely be pushback from both House and Senate lawmakers should this path be pursued. The other, more likely possibility seems to be that market structure legislation will just take longer ‚Äî perhaps through the end of the year. This is despite Democrats' ongoing concerns that Trump is enriching himself through his various crypto ventures. Just this week, Trump's media firm, Truth Social, filed for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with Yorkville America and NYSE Arca. Assuming this product is approved, it'll open another avenue for a Trump-affiliated entity to benefit from interest in the industry.

Currently in phase 5 of its 11-phase presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) trades at $0.03, a 200% jump from its opening phase at $0.01. The project has raised $10,100,000, sold over 530 million tokens, and attracted 11,700 holders since the presale began. With a guaranteed 100% ROI at its $0.06 launch price, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a compelling entry point. Its innovative lending model and transparent operations signal strong potential. Dogecoin (DOGE), meanwhile, struggles with volatility, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a standout choice. This momentum flows into its unique DeFi approach. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Redefines DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is reshaping crypto investment with its dual lending system. Its peer-to-contract model lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contract pools, earning passive income through automated interest rates. Conversely, the peer-to-peer model fosters direct lending relationships, offering flexibility and transparency. Users negotiate terms, creating tailored agreements that enhance control. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a Certik audit, scoring a solid 80.00 for security. No vulnerabilities appeared in its smart contracts, and no incidents occurred in the past 90 days. Active monitoring and moderate social media engagement bolster trust. This strong foundation transitions smoothly into its promising presale performance. Presale Powerhouse Gains Traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is surging through phase 5 of its presale, priced at $0.03. Investors joining now secure a 100% ROI at the $0.06 launch price. Phase 6 looms, bringing a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, offering early buyers immediate gains. Analysts predict a post-launch value of $2.50, a 8,233% increase from the current price, driven by its DeFi utility. The project rewards top holders through a new dashboard, granting bonus tokens to the top 50 for maintaining their positions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also excites with a $100,000 giveaway , splitting $10,000 among 10 winners. Eligible investors need a $50 presale investment. This vibrant momentum leads to its innovative stablecoin strategy. Stablecoin and Scalability Edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is launching a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum, backed by on-chain reserves for stability. This overcollateralized system minimizes risks, appealing to cautious investors. Revenue from stablecoin borrowing fuels the treasury, supporting development and token buybacks. These buybacks redistribute tokens to stakers, sustaining demand and value. Layer-2 integration ensures fast, low-cost transactions, addressing crypto prices today concerns like high fees. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), which relies on social media hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility. Its beta platform launches alongside the token, enabling immediate asset deposits and interest earnings. This practical approach contrasts sharply with Dogecoin‚Äôs volatility, as explored next. Dogecoin (DOGE) Faces Uncertainty Dogecoin (DOGE) grapples with unpredictable crypto prices, trading at $0.204 after an 11% drop. Heavy whale selling and $21 million in liquidations signal bearish trends. Technical charts show a bearish crossover, with $0.17 as the next support level. Dogecoin (DOGE) lacks the utility driving Mutuum Finance (MUTM), relying on speculative sentiment. Its crypto charts reflect declining transaction volumes and futures interest, dimming its $1 target hopes in 2025. Investors seeking stability find Mutuum Finance (MUTM) more appealing, with its structured growth and DeFi focus. This contrast underscores why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) leads as the best crypto to buy now. Path to Profitable Horizons Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines as the best crypto to buy now, blending affordability with high-yield potential. Its phase 5 presale at $0.03 offers a rare entry point before the $0.06 launch. Analysts forecast a $2.50 post-launch value, promising substantial returns. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers real-world DeFi solutions, backed by a secure, audited platform. Investors can join the presale and explore the $100,000 giveaway for added rewards.

According to the analytics platform, Bitcoin is facing growing resistance after reaching a new all-time high last month. The resistance can be attributed to exhaustion from profit-taking by long-time Bitcoin holders and exhaustion from buyers who purchased earlier, according to Glassnode. Over the short term, the intensifying profit-taking could point to a distribution phase and not a fresh breakout. ‚ÄúAltogether, the market appears to be at a crossroads, shaped by elevated sell pressure, maturing bullish momentum, and demand that must prove itself resilient. The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this is a mid-cycle consolidation or the start of a broader top formation.‚Äù Glassnode says the market is experiencing the fifth major profit-taking wave in the current cycle, with the realized profits per day having risen to $1.47 billion. ‚Äú The most notable selling pressure has come from cohorts who accumulated during key historical ranges: $25,000 ‚Äì $31,000 and $60,000 ‚Äì $73,000. These groups, many of whom held through multiple volatility phases, are now contributing to the supply overhang that appears to be capping further upside, at least in the short term.‚Äù The continued selling pressure from long-term holders is raising the risk of a short-term correction, according to the analytics platform. The first on-chain support zone for Bitcoin, according to Glassnode, is around $103,700, while the second one is at around the $95,600 price. If the latter is breached, Glassnode says it could be a confirmation of a potential ‚Äúbroader risk reset.‚Äù Bitcoin is trading at $105,007 at time of writing.

XRP is climbing steadily, fueled by regulatory wins and global adoption. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is surging through its presale, offering early investors a chance at massive returns. Both tokens stand out for their unique strengths. XRP boasts real-world utility, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) pioneers innovative lending. Let‚Äôs explore why these coins are the best crypto to buy now, highlighting their distinct paths to explosive growth. XRP‚Äôs steady ascent XRP is gaining traction in the crypto market. It is currently priced at $2.23 and in 24 hours, it rose 2%, reaching a large market cap of $131.36 billion. The approval of Ripple‚Äôs RLUSD in Dubai has people in the industry excited. This action makes XRP more important in the world of global finance. The world of finance in Dubai supports stablecoins because the hub is home to thousands of companies. This milestone boosts investor confidence. Rumors of a settled SEC case further fuel optimism. Social media buzz suggests a favorable deal, pushing XRP‚Äôs price upward. Polymarket predicts an 87% chance XRP stays above $2.10 soon, reflecting strong market support. XRP‚Äôs potential shines brighter with ETF speculation. Applications from firms like Bitwise and WisdomTree are under review. Approval could unleash institutional funds, driving XRP‚Äôs value higher. Short-term, XRP may hit $2.50 if trading volume rises. Mid-term, $3.00 is possible, but long-term forecasts eye $5.50 by 2026. Some analysts even predict $50, a 2100% leap. While ambitious, XRP‚Äôs fundamentals, like its stablecoin and legal clarity, make it a top crypto to buy. Its role in cross-border payments ensures lasting relevance. XRP‚Äôs trajectory looks promising, but another coin is stealing the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is igniting interest in its Phase 5 presale, priced at $0.03 per token. The project has raised $10,200,000, with over 535 million tokens sold and 11,700 holders onboard. Phase 5 is currently underway, but Phase 6 looms, bringing a 16.7% price hike to $0.035. Buying now guarantees a 100% return at launch, when MUTM lists at $0.06. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $2.50, a 8233% jump from today‚Äôs price. This positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top crypto for investors seeking high-yield opportunities in 2025. Innovative lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) redefines DeFi with its dual lending system. Its Peer-to-Contract model lets users deposit stablecoins into smart contracts, earning passive income. Borrowers access funds instantly, with dynamic interest rates maximizing lender profits. The Peer-to-Peer model fosters direct lending, cutting intermediaries for transparent, user-driven agreements. A USD-pegged stablecoin, launching on Ethereum, ensures secure transactions. Its algorithmic balance prevents instability, bolstering reliability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates Layer-2 technology for faster, cheaper transactions. Unlike XRP, which focuses on payments, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prioritizes lending innovation, making it a standout in the crypto market. Security and community buzz Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is solidifying trust with a recent Certik audit, scoring an impressive 80.00 for security. No vulnerabilities were found in its smart contracts, and zero security incidents occurred in the past 90 days. The team also launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens for loyalty. Why these coins matter in 2025 XRP and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer distinct paths to massive returns. XRP leverages regulatory wins and global adoption, aiming for $5.50 or beyond. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), with its presale momentum and innovative lending, targets $2.50 post-launch. Both coins address real-world needs‚ÄîXRP in payments, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in DeFi lending.

The interview, held in Washington with a small group of reporters, was Trump‚Äôs most extensive remarks on Musk since the two started quarreling on social media. When asked if he would consider canceling federal contracts with Musk‚Äôs companies if elected again, Trump responded: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll take a look at everything.‚Äù The POTUS reiterated that any decision must be ‚Äúfair for him and for the country.‚Äù ‚Äú He‚Äôs got a lot of money. He gets a lot of subsidy. So we‚Äôll take a look at that. Only if it‚Äôs fair. Only if it‚Äôs fair for him and for the country, I would certainly think about it, yeah ,‚Äù Trump reckoned. The president also sidestepped questions about reopening investigations into Musk‚Äôs business practices, insisting that he had ‚Äúno idea whether or not they had an investigation‚Äù and that he would let the relevant agencies speak for themselves. Questions on Musk‚Äôs drug use When asked about the chatter about Musk‚Äôs alleged drug use while operating companies under government contracts, Trump declined to comment directly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to comment on his drug use. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know what his status is. I read an article in the New York Times. I thought it was, frankly, it sounded very unfair to me,‚Äù he surmised. Trump told the reporters that he is focused on national and international affairs rather than personal issues involving Musk. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not thinking about Elon,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúI just wish him well.‚Äù Tesla, DOGE, and ‚Äòthe key‚Äô Trump was also questioned about the figurative ‚Äúkey‚Äù to the White House given to Musk last week when the latter officially exited the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Asked if he would want that key returned, Trump replied, ‚ÄúI gave him a key. He tried very hard.‚Äù The US president praised the DOGE co-founder for ‚Äúhelping his administration a lot,‚Äù and added that ‚ÄúIt helped our thinking.‚Äù He also claimed that Musk‚Äôs involvement in the initiative saved ‚Äúhundreds of billions of dollars‚Äù and described the outcome as ‚Äúterrific.‚Äù According to Trump, many individuals who worked with Musk during that period are still involved with current Republican efforts, and ‚Äúthey‚Äôre going to remain with us.‚Äù ‚Äú A lot of good things are happening with our country. We‚Äôre taking in billions of dollars of tariff money. The money is pouring in. And it hasn‚Äôt even started yet, really, relatively. We‚Äôre going to have a very successful country very soon and a very strong bill ,‚Äù he continued. Despite Musk‚Äôs once-close advisory role, Trump confirmed he has no plans to reach out to the billionaire entrepreneur, and rejected rumors of behind-the-scenes efforts to reconcile, stating: ‚Äú A lot of reporters have been calling me. I didn‚Äôt call any reporter. A lot of reporters, they ask me the same question. No, I don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not even thinking about that. I‚Äôm not really interested in that. I‚Äôm really interested in the country and solving problems .‚Äù Foreign policies and meetings with world leaders Throughout the interview, Trump steered the conversation to the global crises and what he described as the country‚Äôs recent economic successes. He claimed credit for the latest stock market rally and job growth figures, asserting that the US economy is ‚Äúdoing better than it‚Äôs ever done before.‚Äù ‚Äú A lot of jobs are being created. That‚Äôs what happened this morning. You saw the jobs. And the nice part, they‚Äôre not government jobs. They‚Äôre jobs of people coming in and doing other things, including hotel and leisures ,‚Äù the president boasted. He also talked about the Federal Reserve, bashing Chair Jerome Powell and repeating his call for interest rate cuts. ‚Äú If we had a good Fed chairman, you would lower rates ,‚Äù he beckoned.

These platforms combine deep liquidity, cutting-edge tools, and ironclad reliability. Whether you‚Äôre looking for non-custodial freedom, margin trading, or low-fee execution, these platforms are built to make trading efficient and seamless. 1.

Founded in 2018, Bybit has rapidly grown into one of the top five derivatives exchanges in the world, now handling over $23.4 billion in daily derivatives volume as of early 2025, before the exchange was hacked. Unlike exchanges that try to serve everyone, Bybit stays laser-focused on delivering a turbocharged trading experience.

Through its Web3 Wallet, traders can interact with multiple blockchains (Ethereum, BSC, Arbitrum, Polygon, etc.), join liquidity pools, buy NFTs, or connect to dApps without leaving the exchange environment. Why Users Choose OKX: Unified CeFi + Web3 Access: Trade, stake, swap, and interact with DeFi protocols using the integrated OKX Wallet. Smart Trading Tools: Grid bots, copy trading, DCA tools, and perpetual contracts all in one place. Robust Derivatives: OKX ranks in the global top 3 for futures and options trading.

And with its new AI-powered trading assistant launched in 2025, OKX is future-proofing how pros manage risk, predict sentiment, and automate strategies. It‚Äôs a glimpse into what Web3-enabled trading desks will look like in the next decade. 6. Bitget: Best for Copy Trading and Pro-Level Derivatives with a Social Edge If you could combine the firepower of a derivatives exchange with the community-driven energy of social trading, you‚Äôd get Bitget. The platform is a fast-rising platform among traders who know the value of signal sharing and strategic mirroring.

The best platform for you depends on your trading goals, risk tolerance, and level of experience. By examining platforms like ChangeNOW, Binance, Kraken, Bybit, OKX, and Bitget, here are the key factors you should consider: 1. Custodial vs Non-Custodial ChangeNOW operates as a non-custodial exchange, meaning it doesn‚Äôt hold your funds. This offers more control but requires you to manage your own wallet security. In contrast, platforms like Binance, Kraken, and Bitget are custodial, which is more beginner-friendly but places custody risk with the exchange. 2. Regulation and KYC Requirements Platforms like Kraken and Binance have strong regulatory licensing and mandatory KYC, offering greater security and compliance. These are essential for institutional or high-volume users. Meanwhile, others like ChangeNOW are only partially licensed and have trigger-based KYC, giving more privacy but less oversight. 3. Security Measures Security varies significantly. OKX boasts ISO/IEC 27001 certification, while Kraken emphasizes cold storage and audits. Binance uses TSS (Threshold Signature Scheme) and multi-sig wallets. 4. Fiat Currency Support Need to fund your account with cash? Exchanges like Binance, Kraken, and ChangeNOW support 7+ fiat currencies, while platforms like Bybit do not support fiat at all, making it less ideal for new users without crypto holdings. 5. Number of Supported Cryptocurrencies ChangeNOW supports over 1,225 coins, ideal for altcoin hunters. Kraken and Bitget also support a wide range, whereas Bybit focuses mainly on major coins, limiting asset diversity. 6. Trading Tools and Liquidity If you‚Äôre into margin, futures, or options, Binance, Bitget, and OKX offer robust tools and high liquidity. ChangeNOW doesn‚Äôt offer these features, making it better for simple conversions than active trading. 7. Fees and Commission Commission levels range from low (Binance, Kraken) to very low (Bitget). ChangeNOW‚Äôs model offers convenience but may not be cost-effective for frequent trades. Evaluate fee structures in line with your trading volume. 8. Web3, NFTs, and Staking OKX stands out with Web3 support, staking, and NFT integration. Binance also offers these features, while Kraken, Bybit, and Bitget are still primarily CeFi-focused. For those interested in DeFi, go for hybrid or Web3-enabled platforms. 9. User Experience & Mobile Access All listed platforms offer mobile apps, but UX varies: Binance and OKX provide pro-level UX, while ChangeNOW offers a simple and intuitive interface, making it better for quick swaps and beginners. In conclusion, if privacy and simplicity is your goal, try ChangeNOW. Binance or Bitget are strong options for full trading tools and liquidity. Meanwhile, Kraken security and compliance are top-notch, while OKX gives you Web3 and NFTs-focused exchange. Be informed that the best platform isn‚Äôt always the flashiest; it‚Äôs the one that quietly delivers speed, trust, and efficiency at scale.",Information,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING|ZRX|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-07 13:41:15

Eric Trump announced that tensions over the memecoin project named after his father have calmed down, and that the family‚Äôs controlled World Liberty Financial will purchase a ‚Äúsignificant amount‚Äù of the memecoin in question. In a post from his X account, Eric Trump stated that the company behind the Trump memecoin will not continue with the digital wallet project that caused the crisis with World Liberty. According to a report in Bloomberg News on Thursday, World Liberty Financial, which is partly owned by the Trump family, sent a ‚Äúcease-and-desist‚Äù letter to the organization Fight Fight Fight, expressing opposition to the digital wallet project called ‚ÄúTRUMP Wallet.‚Äù According to the allegations, World Liberty is planning to launch its own digital wallet service. Related News: Big Bull Michael Saylor's Company Strategy Shares New Bitcoin Purchase Move In the statement that ended the tension, Eric Trump stated that World Liberty would buy a significant amount of the Trump memecoin and add it to its own reserves. Fight Fight Fight, the company that launched the Trump memecoin, is run by longtime President Trump friend and supporter Bill Zanker. Since launching the memecoin in January, the company has generated over $300 million in revenue, according to data analytics firm Chainalysis. Fight Fight Fight and Trump family affiliate CIC Digital LLC hold 80% of the token supply, with a combined value of around $2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. *This is not investment advice.

What followed, however, would become one of the most notable recoveries in the history of the stock market. Over roughly two years, Tesla‚Äôs value surged by approximately 3,500%, rising from $12 to $420. This explosive recovery came after a consolidation period and major volatility, leaving behind a clear technical pattern. EGRAG CRYPTO, a widely followed analyst on X, highlighted this Tesla rally in a December 2024 post and compared it to XRP‚Äôs performance . At the time, the digital asset had not yet hit $3.39, which happened in January. EGRAG CRYPTO noted that XRP had already mirrored Tesla‚Äôs early trajectory, including a 50% decline. The analyst observed that the asset‚Äôs chart resembled Tesla‚Äôs, scaled down by a factor of ten, suggesting that the digital asset might be following a similar trajectory with a delayed cycle and comparable structural movement. The Thesis on XRP and TSLA In his December analysis, EGRAG CRYPTO detailed how Tesla‚Äôs breakout began after a long consolidation. Once the stock found its bottom and regained momentum, it launched into a sustained uptrend. He noted that Tesla stock rose 3,500% over 700 days, after months of stagnation and doubt. He then directed attention to XRP, arguing that it had already experienced a comparable 50% decline and recovery structure. With XRP trading around $0.62 at the time, EGRAG charted a historical similarity that suggested the possibility of a large move ahead. The post noted that XRP‚Äôs price action seemed algorithmically in sync with Tesla‚Äôs , scaled down by order of magnitude. A Follow-Up After XRP‚Äôs Rise Now, with XRP having reached $3.39 in January, EGRAG CRYPTO has followed up on his earlier projection with renewed emphasis. He reaffirmed that the most significant price moves for XRP may still lie ahead, referencing ‚Äúmassive multipliers‚Äù yet to be realized. Although XRP has completed one major leg upward, he implied that further upside could resemble Tesla‚Äôs continued post-breakout expansion. Following the post in December, XRP mirrored Tesla by breaking out of its long-term range , and it could continue this trend by following EGRAG CRYPTO‚Äôs prediction. According to the analyst, those expecting 10x, 20x, or even 30x gains from current levels should not lose confidence. The digital asset is currently trading at $2.16, and a 3,500% surge would send it to $77.76, a level another analyst has set as a mid-term target . #XRP ‚Äî Just a Reminder | #TSLA We already experienced a 50% drop, but many still doubt that #XRP will 10x, 20x, 30X or even more in the final leg of the cycle.

Render (RNDR) is showing resilience after a notable dip, Cardano (ADA) continues to attract steady investor confidence, and Unstaked is making waves with what‚Äôs shaping up to be the best crypto presale of 2025. With data-driven growth, unique token models, and AI integration becoming more valuable than ever, these three projects offer insight into where the market may be heading next. Among them, Unstaked is rising fast, offering more than just hype; it‚Äôs bringing innovation and early-stage opportunity into sharp focus. Render (RNDR) Finds Support and Stabilizes Render (RNDR), after falling by 18% last week, is beginning to recover. The token briefly fell below $4.00 but managed to bounce back and is now holding at $4.03. Despite recent turbulence, it still maintains a 57% gain compared to earlier market levels. The short-term selloff was triggered in part by intensified competition, including the debut of Google‚Äôs VEO 3, a centralized AI rendering platform that momentarily disrupted confidence in decentralized alternatives. But RNDR‚Äôs current performance suggests stability may be returning. While daily indicators don‚Äôt yet show an oversold condition, the 4-hour chart does hint at a potential rebound. Spot market outflows totaling $13 million over the last three days are slowing, a subtle but promising sign. Render continues to lead in the decentralized GPU rendering space. With over 2 million developer visits, 100,000 monthly signups, and $157 million in funding, including a significant $80 million Series C round, its ecosystem shows strength even as the broader market recalibrates. Cardano (ADA) Sees Quiet Confidence and Steady Growth Cardano (ADA) might not be grabbing headlines for wild price moves, but beneath the surface, it‚Äôs showing the kind of slow, steady growth that builds lasting trust. Currently priced at $0.75, ADA has dipped just over 2% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, trading volume has climbed 2.09%, reaching $655.73 million, a clear sign that activity is heating up despite the sideways price action. What continues to set Cardano apart is its consistent developer activity and commitment to foundational growth. As a Layer-1 platform with academic rigor behind its upgrades, Cardano appeals to long-term holders seeking durable blockchain infrastructure. While it remains range-bound for now, its ecosystem is quietly expanding through continuous improvements in scalability, interoperability, and governance. Investor sentiment appears to be shifting in favor of reliable infrastructure projects, and Cardano remains a key player in that space. Still, with new presales gaining speed, ADA faces strong competition for attention from newcomers offering unique tech and faster growth narratives. Unstaked: The AI-Focused Presale That‚Äôs Leading the Pack With $1M Giveaway While RNDR stabilizes and Cardano builds trust, Unstaked is catching fire, and it‚Äôs not just hype. With more than $9.2 million already raised during its Stage 19 presale, Unstaked is offering its $UNSD token at $0.011065, setting sights on a launch price of $0.1819. That potential 28x return is enough to draw headlines, but there‚Äôs much more beneath the surface. Unstaked‚Äôs strength lies in its deep integration of artificial intelligence. Its Proof of Intelligence protocol leverages live machine learning to guide network decisions dynamically. This isn‚Äôt your average governance token. Unstaked is built to learn, adapt, and evolve as its user base grows. The ecosystem is fully decentralized, and governance is handled through AI-guided proposals and weighted community voting. No private allocations means there are no early investor advantages or insider selling pressures. This public-only model is appealing to retail investors looking for fairness and long-term alignment. To ramp up awareness and engagement, Unstaked has launched a $1,000,000 giveaway campaign. Running over five months, the Unstaked gives 20 winners a chance to receive $50,000 each in $UNSD. Entry is simple: complete tasks, refer friends, post on social media, and invest at least $100. As a result, Unstaked is seeing a significant rise in community participation across all platforms. As the convergence of AI and crypto accelerates, Unstaked offers something rare: a working, scalable framework that prioritizes innovation and community from the start. It‚Äôs not just a token sale, it‚Äôs a foundational ecosystem with long-term potential. One Market, Three Paths, And a Sleeper Standing Tall Render is finding its feet again in a crowded AI sector. Cardano continues to win over long-term investors with a strategy rooted in research and consistent delivery. But it‚Äôs Unstaked that is commanding attention in real time, not just for its funding milestones, but for what the project represents: the fusion of intelligence, decentralization, and equitable access. With $9.2 million already raised, a robust AI-native design, and a community-first approach, Unstaked is becoming the best crypto presale opportunity in this cycle. For investors watching the evolution of crypto infrastructure, this is one presale that goes far beyond the typical.

While Dawgz AI and Bitcoin Hyper grab attention with new ideas, BlockDAG is shaking up the presale model entirely. Dawgz may have raised $3.5M, and Bitcoin Hyper is priced under $0.012, but BlockDAG is in a league of its own. With over $288.5 million raised, BlockDAG ‚Äôs Buyer Battles are creating real buzz. It‚Äôs not just another presale, it‚Äôs a daily competition. The top buyer wins a chunk of a 150M BDAG token pool, all while locking in the lowest price. That‚Äôs why BlockDAG is the best presale crypto to buy right now. Real accumulation, real rewards, and a game-changing format that‚Äôs opening doors for all investors. BlockDAG Buyer Battles: Win Big with Every Purchase BlockDAG is turning the presale game on its head with its revolutionary approach, Buyer Battles. This isn‚Äôt your typical presale; it‚Äôs a competitive, real-time contest where 150 million BDAG tokens are up for grabs every single day. The best part? Whatever tokens remain unsold each day go straight to the highest buyer. No raffles, no random selections, just strategy and action. Every day, one lucky buyer walks away with a massive bonus, making it an exciting opportunity for those ready to make their move. Unlike traditional presales that rely on whitelist spots or hope for decent allocations, BlockDAG‚Äôs Buyer Battles create a dynamic and engaging environment. And with BDAG priced at just $0.0018 until July 13, the early bird advantage is undeniable. Already, buyers are seeing incredible returns, 2,520% ROI since Batch 1, with Batch 28 now priced at $0.0262. With over $288.5 million raised and 21.9 billion BDAG tokens sold, the presale is proving to be a massive success. BlockDAG is set to list at $0.05, and with its upcoming GO LIVE reveal on June 13, 2025, the excitement is building. More than 1 million users are already mining, and 17,700 ASIC miners have been sold, showing the solid foundation this project is built on. BlockDAG is more than just another crypto presale; it‚Äôs a game-changer. The competitive Buyer Battles format gives everyone, from newcomers to seasoned investors, a chance to grab a piece of the action before it hits the charts. Dawgz AI: The Future of AI-Powered Crypto Dawgz AI is building a unique ecosystem with AI trading bots and staking features designed to support its token‚Äôs utility. With over $3.5 million raised, the presale price is currently set at $0.004. $DAGZ token holders can earn passive rewards through staking programs over the next three years, with the project‚Äôs smart contract audited by SolidProof. The token is expected to list at $0.00702. Combining AI tools with community rewards, Dawgz AI allocates 30% of its 8.88 billion token supply to the presale and 15% for community incentives. Some analysts project a price of $0.0157 by year-end, with long-term estimates pushing as high as $0.035 by 2030. With its strong fundamentals, Dawgz AI is gearing up for substantial growth in the coming years. Bitcoin Hyper: Layer 2 Meets Bitcoin for Smart Contracts Bitcoin Hyper is revolutionizing Bitcoin with its Layer 2 solution that brings smart contracts and DeFi capabilities to the network. By integrating with Solana‚Äôs virtual machine (SVM) and using zk-proofs for batching transactions, Bitcoin Hyper anchors everything back to Bitcoin for ultimate finality. Users can bridge BTC to the network, engage with decentralized apps, and stake $HYPER tokens. The token is currently priced at $0.011675, with over $320,000 raised, and a listing set for Q4 2025. The tokenomics are well-structured, with 30% allocated to development, 15% for staking, and the rest designated for treasury and exchange purposes. Additionally, the presale introduces a unique block-based reward system, offering 199.77 $HYPER tokens per Ethereum block over the next two years. This innovative approach sets Bitcoin Hyper up for significant growth. Final Thoughts Dawgz AI is making waves with over $3.5M raised, staking rewards, and AI-powered trading tools already in play. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Hyper is getting attention with its focus on Layer 2 speed, zk-proofs, and Solana tech, all driving interest in its growing staking pool. But when it comes to disrupting the presale game, BlockDAG is in a league of its own. Forget the usual static tiers and lockups, BlockDAG‚Äôs Buyer Battles introduce a daily challenge where the top buyer scoops up a share of a 150M BDAG token pool. Plus, participants can still grab tokens for just $0.0018 before the July 13 deadline. With over $288.5M raised, BlockDAG is more than a presale; it‚Äôs a chance to win big.

A final decision regarding EU brandy imports would be delivered on July 5th. China-EU talks on minimum prices for EVs have reached the last phase. On Saturday, the Ministry of Commerce of China revealed that it would create a green channel to speed up the approvals of rare export licenses for qualified EU firms. The ministry added that it will also reveal its final decision regarding its investigations into EU brandy imports on July 5th. The Chinese ministry also revealed that minimum price talks with the EU on EVs manufactured in China have reached the final stage, saying efforts from both parties were still necessary. China says it would speed up approval for export licenses Q: French President Macron stated that during his recent call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, both sides agreed to expedite efforts to resolve the issue of Cognac brandy.

Is there a possibility of‚Ä¶ ‚Äî ‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩÂïÜÂä°ÈÉ®MOFCOM (@MOFCOM_China) June 3, 2025 Following U.S. President Trump‚Äôs tariffs, China restricted exporting a wide range of rare earths to certain countries. The country also suspended the export of rare magnets to EU firms, affecting the supply chains central to semiconductor firms, automakers, military contractors, and manufacturers worldwide. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce revealed that China was concerned about the issues raised by the EU regarding the export of rare earths. The ministry added that it was working on streamlining the approvals. Commerce Minister Wang said he hoped the EU would meet China halfway and implement effective measures to enable, safeguard, and enhance compliant trade in high-tech goods to China. The European Chamber, a Beijing lobby group, said that despite the fast approvals for needed shipments, there had not been sufficient progress that would protect many firms from supply chain disruptions. Jens Eskelund, the president of the European Chamber, said member firms were still struggling with a lack of transparency in the matter. Eskelund added that some member companies were still experiencing delays. China promises to issue a final decision on brandy exports China recently imposed anti-dumping guidelines that applied import duties of up to 39 percent on European brandy, further straining relations between China and the EU. The Chinese government enforced the duties days after the EU raised concerns about Chinese-made EV and tire imports. The EU said it took action against EV imports from China to shield its local EV industry. Emmanuel Macron , the President of France, accused China of pure retaliation after introducing import duties on European brandy. According to the EU, the brandy import duties have dented sales of European brands, including Pernod Ricard, Remy Cointreau, Hennessy, and Martell. The commerce ministry had previously said it would issue its final decision regarding the brandy duties by January. However, the ministry extended the deadline to April but later pushed it to July 5. The commerce ministry said on Saturday that French firms and organizations had delivered applications on price commitments for brandy exports to China. The ministry added that Chinese investigators had already agreed with the French firms and relevant organizations on the core terms. The Ministry of Commerce revealed that relevant authorities reviewed the full text of those price commitments. The ministry ensured the final decision would be ready before the predetermined date. The European Commission said in April that the EU and China had struck a deal to consider setting minimum prices for EVs made in China instead of tariffs imposed by the Union last year. The commerce ministry said the EU had also suggested exploring new technical routes relating to EVs, adding that the ministry was still evaluating them. China has shown increasing concern that Europe has taken a Trump-like path by imposing restrictions on the sales of chipmaking equipment and semiconductors to China. Trump said the US would hold talks with China in London on Monday, paving the way for more de-escalation in the tariff war between the two nations. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

According to a recent news report by blockchain forensics firm Glass Ledger, over $15 million worth of reserves linked to Garantex has been actively transferred since March, staying off blacklists by hopping between chains, using mixers like Tornado Cash, and exploiting successor platforms like Grinex. The drama began early in March, when US, German, and Finnish regulators froze $27 million of USDT held by Garantex as part of a sweeping crackdown on the sanctioned exchange. Tether's freeze, which was implemented at the smart contract level, was hailed as a crypto compliance milestone, with regulators trumpeting it as proof that digital assets can be made subject to on-chain blacklists. Garantex, in turn, directly accused Tether of ‚Äùdeclaring war on the Russian crypto market‚Äù and shut down temporarily, but first threatened customers it had ‚Äùsolutions‚Äù for individuals with BTC and ETH. How¬†Garantex Funds¬†Kept Moving Later on-chain information revealed that the freeze was only the tip of the iceberg of a new cat-and-mouse game. One of the long-dormant Garantex Ethereum wallets that first raised the eyebrows of compliance experts was revived in March and collected over 3,200 ETH before it flowed $2.3 million through Tornado Cash, a highly respected decentralized mixer used to launder dirty money. The same wallet now holds $6.1 million worth of ETH, while other funds are moved on the Bitcoin and BNB blockchain. Notably, 2.2 BTC was bridged to Tron and partially sent to Grinex, which is the platform commonly regarded as Garantex's operational successor. Global Ledger CEO Lex Fisun summed up the dilemma: ‚ÄùThe Garantex case bursts the bubble of control so many still carry. $15 million freely available through dark chains and mixers is not a breakdown of law ‚Äî it's a breakdown of sanction enforcement.‚Äù Their latest report details how Garantex exploited the delay between freeze statements and enforcement as well as the inherent limitations of blacklists in the multi-chain universe. The investigative trail doesn't end there. Grinex, now suspected of appropriating Garantex's infrastructure and base of customers, has moved over $1.6 billion on international exchanges in just a few weeks, according to our reporting at Global Ledger. Some of these flows directly or with intermediate hops to major regulated exchanges ‚Äî raising the red flags of compliance and highlighting the danger even for platforms that have KYC and AML guidelines set up. In one case, $191,000 of USDT was sent directly from a wallet linked to Grinex to a top global exchange, and another $500,000 transfer ended up at an EU VASP in just a single intermediary wallet. What's behind these transactions? Forensic analysts pinpoint several factors: blacklist-based freezing's limitations, delays in operations in Tether's multi-signature freeze mechanism (up to 44 minutes at times, long enough for bad guys to execute withdrawals prior to the freeze taking effect), and Garantex's tactic of hot wallet rotation, use of less-regulated blockchains, and use of cross-chain bridges in order to remain one step ahead of enforcement mechanisms. Besides, Garantex's operating trends changed rapidly following sanctions: they changed address clustering, rerouted transactions to Asian exchanges like HTX and OKX, and began rotating hot wallets more frequently ‚Äî daily sometimes to evade detection. Compliance Challenges and Industry Response Compliance experts now insist that exchanges go beyond the simple blacklist screening. ‚ÄùYou require real-time blockchain analytics, behavioral risk scoring, and active transaction monitoring,‚Äù a leading AML consultant said. ‚ÄùOtherwise, sanctioned players will always find a way through.‚Äù Exchanges are also requested to strengthen onboarding due diligence, flag high-risk flows from known mixers or successor entities, and cooperate with forensics firms for timely identification. The Garantex case has once more fueled controversy surrounding the utilization of decentralized cross-chain bridges and mixers in enabling illicit finance. Although some suspect that mixers have a valid purpose for privacy, their adoption by criminals and sanctioned entities is currently surpassing the industry's ability to freeze and monitor assets, critics argue. The appearance of services such as Grinex, essentially a rebranded Garantex, demonstrates how quickly criminals can adapt, bringing technology and userbases along with them in order to evade enforcement.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-07 14:50:55

AVAX‚Äôs price may have rebounded from political jitters and moved on the back of major developments in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization and institutional adoption. The token climbed from a low of $19.37 to $20.96, recovering from a wider market sell-off triggered by growing tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk earlier this week, which saw the former threaten to terminate government contracts for the latter, who in turn accused the president of being implicated in the Jeffrey Epstein files. The token rebounded after showing multiple signs of bullish momentum, according to CoinDesk‚Äôs Research's technical analysis data model, which shows AVAX established a strong footing around $19.40 that was confirmed by volume exceeding the 24-hour simple moving average. Volume further rose around the time of AVAX‚Äôs breakout last the $20 mark, showing strength in the move. The token has now formed short-term resistance near $21 and support at $20.81, the model shows. But the stronger-than-average rebound may not just be technical. Last month, FIFA announced it chose Avalanche to power its FIFA blockchain network, with plans to migrate its existing non-fungible token (NFT) collection from Algorand and Polygon into the new network and to build out new fan experiences. Institutional momentum added another leg. Asset manager VanEck is expected to roll out a $100 million PurposeBuilt Fund this month after first announcing it on May 21, focused exclusively on projects within the Avalanche ecosystem. The fund will back tokens and businesses in gaming, finance, and AI, while deploying idle capital into on-chain real-world asset products like tokenized money markets. The price still faces technical resistance near $24.80, but the combination of institutional activity, on-chain RWA growth, and network usage from high-profile partners like FIFA could help AVAX stay ahead of broader market volatility through June.

It has seen conversations around the technology, and cryptocurrencies rise to new levels. As investors become more knowledgeable about the sector, they have pivoted to projects that offer real-world utility. One of the most popular projects amongst informed investors in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . The project aims to expand the reach of Defi by offering real-world utility through innovation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Innovative Approach To DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a project built on the foundation of innovation. It aims to offer as much utility as possible to its users, giving them opportunities for long-term, sustainable growth. This can be seen in how the protocol is designed. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol is designed for borrowers, lenders, and liquidators to participate freely and derive benefits. Lenders can deposit their funds for the chance to earn interest at a rate determined by the pool‚Äôs utilization rate. Borrowers, on the other hand, have a chance to use their assets as collateral to acquire assets that they can use to benefit from crypto market opportunities in real time. Using borrowed assets also has a tax benefit in that they can avoid capital gains. Additionally, borrowing can be used to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise without having to sell assets. They can then repay their loans, once they have made a profit elsewhere on the market, and get back their assets. Liquidators are called in when a loan position goes into distress. When that happens, they are offered a chance to buy the debt at a discount. When a position is liquidated, the borrower is charged a liquidation penalty, which is used as a reward bonus for the liquidator. The rest of the penalty goes into the protocol‚Äôs treasury. The allocation factor is used to determine how much the surcharge goes to the treasury and what portion goes to liquidators. As with all aspects of the project, the goal is to find a balance between incentives to ensure rapid liquidation and the long-term solvency of the protocol. Genius Solution For Market Volatility While the crypto market has evolved a great deal over the last decade, a hallmark of the industry is high price volatility, relative to the rest of the market. To counter this volatility, Mutuum Finance requires that all loan positions be overcollateralized. This requirement ensures that a position can be closed quickly without price slippage. In addition, borrowing and lending caps, combined with liquidation parameters, help to limit the exposure of the protocol. When liquidity falls, various incentives may be offered to ensure that there is effective coverage. Price fluctuations can also impact the collateral underpinning a position. If volatility causes collateral to drop below the value of the loan, it could impact the solvency of the protocol. As such, various measures are taken to maintain the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio at the correct level. The liquidation threshold must also be kept at a certain level to ensure that there is enough headroom for liquidators when they buy debt. Assets that are stable and highly liquid, like Ethereum (ETH), will have a high LTV of up to 80% and a liquidation threshold of around 80%. Meanwhile, volatile assets like the DOGE meme coin will have a low LTV of around 40%, while the liquidation threshold is set at around 65%. These parameters are set to ensure there is little chance of sudden price dips that can cause under-collateralization, triggering liquidation. The team asses each token based on various metrics to determine the reserve factor. Assets that have low volatility will typically have a lower reserve factor of around 10%, while more volatile ones can have a reserve factor of up to 35%. The design ensures there is a balance between maintaining the solvency of the protocol and fostering broader participation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Giveaway The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is currently in phase 5, and has raised over $10.1 million for over 11,700 unique investors so far. Tokens in the current phase are going for $0.03, a 20% increase from the phase 4 price of $0.025. In the upcoming phase, the price will increase 16.67% to $0.035. So far, over 25% of the phase presale tokens have been sold, barely a week after it began. A major catalyst for this fast pace is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway .

Isabel Schnabel, a top policymaker at the ECB, made it very clear on Saturday that there won‚Äôt be a lasting divergence in strategy between Europe and the U.S. Schnable‚Äôs words came during the 31st Dubrovnik Economic Conference, where she called current market speculation misleading. ‚ÄúI would not expect a sustained decoupling,‚Äù she said, adding that the idea of a split is not backed by actual market pricing. Schnabel said the trade war between the U.S. and China is acting like a global shock that hits both demand and supply worldwide. ‚ÄúWe can discuss which of the two effects on inflation is larger because that determines the net effect,‚Äù she added. But either way, she shut down the idea of long-term separation. Fed stays on pause while ECB slashes rates Both the ECB and the Fed hiked rates aggressively through 2021 and 2022 as inflation went wild after the pandemic. In 2024, they started cutting. But here‚Äôs where things split ‚Äî or at least looked like they did. The ECB has already cut rates eight times. The most recent cut happened on Thursday, bringing its key rate down from 4% to 2%. Meanwhile, the Fed hasn‚Äôt touched its rates since December 2024, keeping the federal funds rate steady at 4.25% to 4.5%. Still, Schnabel pushed back on the idea that this temporary gap means anything long-term. Fed officials will meet again June 17‚Äì18 in Washington, and most expect no changes. They‚Äôre waiting to see what direction Donald Trump‚Äôs administration goes with trade, taxes, and immigration. Nobody at the Fed wants to move before they know what kind of economic shock Trump‚Äôs policies might bring. Inflation in both the U.S. and Europe took off after the pandemic and peaked around the middle of 2022. Then, it cooled down at almost the same time in both places. This is exactly why Schnabel and others inside the ECB say inflation is now a global issue, not a local one. Trump‚Äôs trade moves split inflation paths But recently, inflation trends started drifting apart. U.S. inflation stayed sticky. In contrast, eurozone inflation dropped below the ECB‚Äôs 2% target in May, coming in at 1.9%, and it‚Äôs now expected to average just 1.6% in 2026. Trump‚Äôs new tariffs could push U.S. prices up, while in Europe they might actually drive prices down. Why? A few things. The dollar is weaker, global demand is slowing, and Asian exports that can‚Äôt go to America will likely get dumped in Europe at lower prices. Schnabel acknowledged the theory: ‚ÄúIf China can no longer export to the United States, they‚Äôre going to flood the rest of the world and especially Europe with cheap goods ‚Äî and that could then lead to high inflation in the U.S. and low inflation in Europe.‚Äù But she dismissed it as not a big deal. ‚ÄúThis effect is actually quantitatively quite small.‚Äù And even if that did become a real threat, Schnabel said Europe would hit back. ‚ÄúYou can be sure that there would be counteracting measures coming from the European Commission.‚Äù Her bottom line? ‚ÄúThis is not an argument for divergence.‚Äù ECB President Christine Lagarde backed this up last Thursday. She said rate cuts are almost done. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a good position,‚Äù she told reporters, hinting that most of the heavy lifting is already finished. Internally, some officials now believe that 2% could be the final rate. Even Yannis Stournaras, one of the most dovish members of the ECB, told Bloomberg on Friday that ‚Äúthe bar for another rate cut is high.‚Äù According to him, it would take ‚Äúbig downward surprises‚Äù in growth or inflation to push rates any lower. Inflation is falling faster than expected. That 1.9% reading in May was a surprise. Forecasts now show it averaging 1.6% in 2026 before climbing back to 2% in 2027. Europe‚Äôs economy grew 0.6% in the first quarter of 2025, as exports from countries like Ireland and Germany surged ahead of expected U.S. tariffs. The concern now is that this short-term boost could fade fast in the coming quarters. Schnabel also pointed out that while the recent drop in inflation was mostly because of falling energy prices, she‚Äôs seeing deeper shifts. ‚ÄúWe do see that also the more persistent components are coming down,‚Äù she said. Still, she admitted not everything is fixed. ‚ÄúWage growth is still too high, service inflation is still relatively high, and domestic inflation is generally high,‚Äù Schnabel said. But she added, ‚ÄúOur confidence is there that kind of the past shocks are now fading and that we are in a good place on that.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino is among the advisors of the project. This new chain, called ‚ÄúStable,‚Äù will use USDT, the world‚Äôs largest stablecoin, for transaction fees (gas fees).

The index has surged 20% since April but is now stalled just 2.3% below its all-time high. Traders are holding their breath ahead of the consumer price index (CPI) data due Wednesday and the Federal Reserve‚Äôs interest rate decision set for June 18. According to Asym 500 , this double-whammy is all anyone is watching right now. The calm has been unnatural. For seven straight sessions leading into Friday, the S&P 500 moved less than 0.6% in either direction ‚Äî the quietest stretch since December. That‚Äôs not normal for a market this close to record highs. But despite solid earnings and no major signs of recession, everyone knows this silence might not last. Traders wait for data, prep for fallout Eric Diton, president and managing director of Wealth Alliance, says the rally can‚Äôt keep going unless there‚Äôs less uncertainty. ‚ÄúFor US stocks to get back to all-time highs, we have to get rid of uncertainty, but most catalysts are elusive for now until the trade war chaos is resolved,‚Äù he said. His firm is already hedging against a possible drop. The data coming in hasn‚Äôt helped. May saw a slowdown in US job growth. Manufacturing and services activity dipped. But markets don‚Äôt care. Everyone‚Äôs betting the damage from Trump‚Äôs trade war won‚Äôt hit too hard. That‚Äôs helped the Nasdaq 100 stay just 1.9% from its record. Still, some traders are nervous. Inflation is expected to rise. The May CPI is forecast to show a 0.3% monthly increase in core prices, higher than the 0.2% reported in April. That would push the year-over-year reading to 2.9%, way above the Fed‚Äôs 2% goal. Wells Fargo economists say inflation will climb even faster later this year. Some traders think this could force Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates in September. But others say rising inflation or sudden volatility could crush riskier trades. And that fear is building just under the surface. The S&P 500 is also trailing global stocks by a lot. It‚Äôs underperforming the MSCI All Country World Index (excluding the US) by nearly 12 percentage points so far in 2025 ‚Äî the worst relative start since 1993. Michael Hartnett, a strategist at Bank of America, says investors are too loaded up on risky bets, and the setup looks close to triggering a technical selloff. Inflation pressure builds as volatility returns Traders are still glued to the big macro events. Data from Asym 500 shows that in the last three months, S&P 500 volatility jumps to 42% on days with CPI, Fed, or jobs data, compared to just 29% on all other days. These reports move markets, and everyone knows it. Over the last two months, fund managers have dumped cash and gone all-in on US equities. But that rush has left them without much protection. If CPI comes in hot on Wednesday, the market could get caught with its pants down. Pursche says that‚Äôs exactly the problem. ‚ÄúI fear many are not paying attention to these threats because most are thinking ‚Äòeverything will be fine,‚Äô but they‚Äôre ignoring warning signs,‚Äù he said. This kind of blind optimism is exactly what makes traders anxious. Deutsche Bank says rules-based and discretionary traders are still holding fewer stocks than usual. So, technically, they could still buy more. The wildcard now is the lag effect of tariffs. No one really knows when or how they‚Äôll start hitting inflation numbers. Brooke May, managing partner at Evans May Wealth, says people might be underestimating that risk. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve become desensitized with inflation because everyone is betting that it will take months before tariffs will flow through into the economic data,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut if there‚Äôs a hot CPI print, it could lead to another selloff in stocks, though will investors use any drawdown to keep buying the dip, or sell?‚Äù That‚Äôs the big question. Will traders treat a dip as a buying opportunity or get spooked and start running for the exit?

RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra reaffirmed the central bank‚Äôs stance even as a government committee reviews policy options and the Supreme Court presses for clearer guidelines. The tension highlights India‚Äôs ongoing regulatory deadlock, where legal, judicial, and financial forces continue to clash over the future of digital assets. Malhotra underlined during a news conference following the announcement that the RBI is still concerned about the possible threats that cryptocurrencies could pose to monetary policy and financial stability. ‚ÄúRBI has maintained a consistent stance on this issue. A [government] committee is currently examining the matter. We remain concerned about the potential risks crypto poses to financial stability and monetary policy,‚Äù Malhotra said .

The court ruled that the banking ban was disproportionate and violated constitutional rights under Article 19(1)(g) of the Indian Constitution. Following the court ruling, RBI instructed banks not to block cryptocurrency transactions based on the invalidated circular. This provided a temporary relief to the crypto industry. RBI‚Äôs persistent opposition to private cryptocurrencies Despite legal setbacks, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has consistently characterized cryptocurrencies as posing ‚Äúhuge risks to financial stability‚Äù and called them a ‚Äúclear danger‚Äù to the economic system. Previous statements from Das suggested that all cryptocurrencies should be banned due to their potential to undermine India‚Äôs financial and macroeconomic stability. The central bank has remained firm in its belief that crypto could undermine India‚Äôs financial stability. It has also cited concerns about its use in money laundering and its potential impact on monetary policy effectiveness.

The sizable gift, sent less than five months after Ulbricht‚Äôs sentence was commuted, immediately sparked speculation that he had covertly reclaimed old Silk Road earnings. Anonymous Bitcoin Gift to Ross Ulbricht According to the intel shared by cryptocurrency tracing firm Chainalysis with WIRED, the 300 BTC donation did not originate from Silk Road at all. Instead, the funds appear to trace back to AlphaBay, a now-defunct darknet market that operated between 2014 and 2017, well after Silk Road‚Äôs takedown. AlphaBay, which was reportedly ten times the size of Silk Road at its peak, was known for trafficking in drugs, malware, and illegal services. Phil Larratt, Chainalysis‚Äôs director of investigations and a former UK law enforcement official, said there are ‚Äúreasonable grounds to suspect‚Äù the Bitcoin came from someone involved with AlphaBay ‚Äì likely a former vendor, given the size of the amount. Prominent blockchain investigator ZachXBT, who had earlier examined the donation, also concluded the funds did not come from Silk Road. Despite the sender‚Äôs use of Bitcoin mixing services, ZachXBT traced the BTC to a wallet previously flagged by Chainalysis as connected to illicit activity. He shared his conclusion with WIRED, wherein he noted that the donation itself may be genuine, but ‚Äúnot legitimate funds.‚Äù Additional clues suggest the person behind the transfer may have been actively trying to avoid detection: ZachXBT discovered the same individual had previously cashed out other crypto through centralized exchanges in small, spread-out amounts, rather than large single transactions. This behavior is consistent with an effort to evade asset freezing or scrutiny. AlphaBay Crackdown Chainalysis reportedly declined to share specifics on how exactly it linked the donation to AlphaBay. But it is important to note that the firm is widely known for its expertise in mapping illicit activity across blockchain networks and played a crucial role in dismantling the now-defunct marketplace during the multinational law enforcement initiative known as Operation Bayonet, involving¬†the FBI, DEA, and Europol. The crackdown later led to the conviction of Bryan Connor Herrell, an AlphaBay moderator, who was sentenced to 11 years in prison.¬†As for Ulbricht, he has not publicly addressed the donation.

New research from Outset PR, an agency known for its data-driven, boutique approach to PR in Web3 , shows that 73% of active crypto news outlets in the region saw traffic decline in Q1 2025. Just six crypto-native publications accounted for 69% of total traffic across the crypto-only segment. The report ‚Äî based on SimilarWeb data from 55 tracked LATAM media sites ‚Äî paints a stark picture of media contraction. Once-reliable names lost ground, some disappearing from the radar altogether. Surprisingly, Bitcoin‚Äôs January rally and early-year bullish momentum didn‚Äôt translate into sustained audience growth. Instead, a mix of macro headwinds, market corrections, and Google‚Äôs March algorithm update created a perfect storm, hitting crypto-focused sites hardest ‚Äî especially those lacking strong SEO strategies or diversified content models. Media Instability Escalates Amid Market Turmoil In January 2025, Bitcoin briefly surged past $109,000, fueled by institutional inflows and broader optimism around U.S. economic policy. But the rally proved short-lived. By February, a wave of exploit-driven panic, meme coin collapses, and shaky sentiment pulled the market into a sharp correction. The downturn hit the media landscape just as hard. Advertising budgets contracted, user interest waned, and Google‚Äôs March 2025 algorithm update wiped visibility from many LATAM-focused crypto outlets ‚Äî especially those relying on outdated SEO tactics or thin content. According to Outset PR‚Äôs tracking , 21.8% of the 55 monitored outlets gained traffic in February, while a staggering 78.18% saw declines. Performance snapshot of LATAM crypto outlets in February 2025, as reported by Outset PR Google‚Äôs March Update Creates a Visible Divide March brought more instability ‚Äî both in markets and media. Bitcoin spent most of the month fluctuating between $83,000 and $94,000, with modest rebounds tied to renewed institutional interest and broader macro optimism. Amid price swings, crypto readers turned to the media for clarity. But just as visibility was needed most, Google‚Äôs March core algorithm update reshaped how regional publishers ranked in search. The update hit LATAM outlets unevenly. According to Outset PR, 24 of 55 active crypto-focused sites regained some traffic by the end of March. But most remained below their January baselines. Outset PR data showing March 2025 traffic trends for LATAM crypto media A sharp divide emerged: agile players optimized quickly and adapted, while others continued their downward spiral. Notably, CryptoNews Brasil went offline entirely for Brazilian users , likely due to government-imposed access restrictions tied to new regulations targeting offshore betting platforms. The site remains accessible in Europe, but its LATAM visibility has vanished. Finance News Sites Outrank Crypto-Native Brands in Traffic, But Offer Limited Crypto Depth According to the report, all the top Latin American media sites with crypto coverage are web portals for finance and general news. They regularly got millions of visits but mentioned crypto mostly during periods when it was on an uptrend ‚Äî losing interest when the hype died down. The bulk of these platforms operate in Brazil and Argentina , and they make many content choices based on trends in their countries' politics and economies. Therefore, their reports about crypto can be inconsistent. Though macro trends may bring exposure for crypto-based content on these general sites, they typically do not provide the ongoing and meaningful connection that crypto-native platforms can. Six Crypto-Native Outlets Dominate LATAM Visibility A key insight from Outset PR‚Äôs Q1 report is the extreme concentration of visibility in the region. Despite the vast number of sites tracked, just six publications accounted for 69.13% of total crypto-native traffic. Q1 2025 media tier segmentation for LATAM crypto outlets, sourced from Outset PR Together, these six outlets drew 4.11 million visits across the quarter. They were the only crypto-native sites to consistently surpass the 400,000 monthly average visits. Their dominance highlights the narrowing field of reliable crypto voices in LATAM, especially as newer or mid-sized players struggle with traffic volatility and indexing issues. The next tier captured traffic in the 130K‚Äì270K range. While still influential, these outlets represent a sharp drop in reach. Most fall short of driving large-scale visibility for crypto projects without additional amplification. Beneath this, Outset PR categorized the remaining outlets as long-tail players. Fourteen of them attracted fewer than 10,000 monthly visits. Though potentially useful for SEO or niche audiences, these sites now contribute minimal impact in terms of direct reach. Strategic Takeaways for LATAM Crypto Media Both the size and influence of Latin America‚Äôs crypto media landscape are shrinking ‚Äî and consolidating. What once felt like a sprawling ecosystem is now concentrated in the hands of a few players. Outset PR‚Äôs report underscores how quickly visibility can shift. In fast-moving markets like LATAM, media influence doesn‚Äôt erode gradually ‚Äî it can collapse in a matter of weeks. And influence today is about how often an outlet gets indexed, how visible it is in algorithm-driven feeds, whether its audience is real, and how quickly it publishes.

Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $100,811 on Thursday as markets turned bearish. However, the decline was short-lived as the price rebounded on Friday to erase most of the previous day‚Äôs losses and settle above $104,378. The flagship cryptocurrency is up over 1%, trading at around $105,128. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has struggled after Thursday‚Äôs decline, which saw the price dip below $2,400. However, it has struggled to regain momentum and has registered only a marginal increase over the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is up nearly 2%, while Solana (SOL) is up over 2%, trading around $151. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up almost 6%, and Cardano (ADA) is up over 3%, trading around $0.668. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) have also registered notable increases. Gemini Confidentially Files for US IPO Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange owned by the Winklevoss brothers, has disclosed it confidentially filed for an IPO as crypto exchanges attempt to take advantage of renewed market momentum. Several high-profile companies, including crypto exchanges, have launched successful listings, indicating growing demand and renewed vigor in the capital markets. Recently, USDC issuer Circle went public, making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Matt Kennedy, Senior Strategist at Renaissance Capital, stated, ‚ÄúPre-IPO crypto companies would be crazy not to move ahead with listings after seeing how Circle traded. Crypto can be an unpredictable market, so when you get a chance like this, you take it.‚Äù The recent spate of IPOs heralds a turning point for the industry, reflecting growing confidence among digital asset firms to attract mainstream investors. It also suggests companies are confident about meeting transparency, regulatory, and capital requirements. Gemini has not determined the size or the proposed range for its offering. Kat Liu, vice president at IPOX stated, ‚ÄúGemini's move contributes to the broader momentum and reinforces the idea that crypto-native firms are increasingly preparing to access public markets. More broadly, this signals that long-anticipated firms are now ready to reengage with public capital.‚Äù Singapore‚Äôs Ousted Crypto Firms Have Nowhere To Go Singapore recently passed an order prohibiting unlicensed crypto firms from serving overseas customers. The order marks the beginning of the end for regulatory loopholes in the blockchain industry. The directive, issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, orders crypto firms offering services abroad to get licensed or leave. The movie aligns with a broader global push for compliance and cracks down on money laundering and terrorism financing. Joshua Chu, co-chair of the Blockchain Alliance, stated, ‚ÄúFor exchanges still playing regulatory pinball ‚Äî constantly seeking loopholes to avoid licensing requirements ‚Äî the reality is clear: They will soon find themselves having to relocate to their favorite destination, the moon. With jurisdictions like Singapore, Thailand, Dubai, Hong Kong, and others tightening oversight and closing gaps, there‚Äôs simply no escaping the global push for compliance.‚Äù Some in the crypto space have interpreted the recent order as a sharp policy reversal. However, the regular said it has always maintained a steady stance. Singapore‚Äôs Central Bank stated, ‚ÄúMAS‚Äô position on this has been consistently communicated for a few years since the first response to public consultation issued on February 14, 2022, and in subsequent publications on October 4, 2024, and May 302025.‚Äù Dow Jones Rises On Back Of Strong Market Data Wall Street ended the week positively after better-than-expected job numbers boosted investor confidence. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 443 points, leading Friday‚Äôs gains among major indices. The S&P 500 rose 1.03% to close above 6000 for the first time since February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.2% thanks to a major rebound in tech stocks. Data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the US added 139,000 jobs in May, above the expected 125,000. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2%, while the wage growth also came in higher than expectations. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) recovered from Thursday‚Äôs dramatic decline to register an increase of nearly 3% on Friday and recoup a significant chunk of the previous day‚Äôs losses. The flagship cryptocurrency has extended its gains in the current session and has reclaimed $105,000 to trade around $105,150. Analysts believe miner activity could impact BTC‚Äôs near-term outlook. According to an analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst, miners have increased the volume of BTC transferred to crypto exchanges. According to the analysis, miner-to-exchange inflows exceeded $1 billion per day between May 19 and May 28. Analysts view such inflows as a proxy for miners intending to sell their assets. This could impact short-term supply dynamics and introduce volatility to BTC‚Äôs spot market performance. The spike in realized inflows from miners to exchanges can be interpreted as a sign of growing sell-side pressure. Large-scale transfers to exchanges are generally interpreted as miners preparing to offload their assets. Analysts have pointed out that while miner selling isn‚Äôt inherently negative, it could impact short-term price stability. On the other hand, when miner inflows spike, it reflects sentiment regarding profitability, operational stress, or anticipated price changes. BTC started the previous week positively, registering a marginal increase on Monday. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.03% to $107,834. Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. The price declined on Friday, dropping 1.51%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,067.

ETH ETFs recorded $25.2 million in net inflows on June 6th marking 15 consecutive days of positive inflows. US-based spot Ethereum ETFs have attracted a combined $281 million in inflows over the past week. Despite positive inflows, ETH has been unable to cross $2,700, a level where it faces substantial resistance. ETH started the previous week positively, rising 0.49% on Monday.

Unilabs Finance: A Novel AI launchpad for digital assets Closing thoughts Despite the recent market downturn, the XRP price hovers above the 200-EMA, while the Dogecoin price begins a comeback. With an overall market rally anticipated in the coming days, DOGE and Unilabs Finance (UNIL) are bullish waves not to miss ‚Äî top DeFi coins to invest in. Priced below $1, Dogecoin and UNIL are not only pocket-friendly; they are also high-potential altcoins. Hence, investors have been showing significant interest, pushing the ongoing UNIL presale above $2.4 million in record time. You might also like: Can Unilabs flip DOGE price with mining fund success and 10x forecast in 2025? The XRP price hovers above the 200-EMA Amidst a general market downturn, the XRP price has seen a 2% decrease over the last 24 hours. Nevertheless, it hovers above the 200-EMA ($2.08), which has proven to be a solid support. Further supported by technical indicators like Momentum (10) and Commodity Channel Index (20), an XRP price bounce is on the table. Next key level to watch is a retest of its 30-day high of $2.64, positioning it among the top DeFi coins to invest in. Top analysts believe a rally above this level could push the XRP price above $3 and potentially flip its all-time high of $3.84. Meanwhile, WestBfieldLa‚Äôs optimistic price prediction has become a subject of much interest, highlighting why it is one of the top DeFi coins to invest in. However, UNIL‚Äôs significant upside potential has been attracting more investor interest. Can the Dogecoin price surpass $1? The Dogecoin price dipped by 10% on the weekly chart, pushing it back down to the $0.17 level. Does that mean it is over? Certainly not. Technical indicators like the Williams Percent Range and Commodity Channel Index give a strong buy signal, suggesting now is the time to double down on the dog-themed cryptocurrency. Moreover, Investments_CEO is optimistic that the Dogecoin price will climb toward $2 this year, which is considered a bold forecast. Hence, at the current price, it presents a great entry to what could be significant gains. A modest price prediction is by John Mark, suggesting the leading memecoin could hit $0.739 and surpass its 2021 all-time high. The above highlights its potential, placing DOGE on the list of the top DeFi coins to invest in. With the Dogecoin price underpriced at less than $0.2, it is a promising wave not to miss, although experts consider UNIL, a new AI coin, to be more attractive due to its small market size. Unilabs Finance: A Novel AI launchpad for digital assets Unilabs Finance ‚Äô s native utility coin, UNIL, is among the top DeFi coins to invest in this year for several reasons. At the heart of an AI-powered DeFi ecosystem, its outlook is promising, also functioning as a governance token. In addition, it is in its early stages, meaning participation in the ongoing presale can yield significant ROIs. At $0.0062 in the third stage of the ICO, a jump toward $0.0074 is anticipated by the fourth round. With early investors positioned for gains as the presale progresses and well after the token‚Äôs market debut, there are other benefits to holding. UNIL holders are eligible for periodic airdrops of tokens from projects that launched on the Unilabs AI Launchpad and a share of platform-generated profits through consistent dividends. Also, there will be early access to high-potential investment opportunities through the UNIL token, positioning it among the top DeFi coins to invest in this year. Closing thoughts The XRP price hovers above the 200-EMA despite market downturn, while the Dogecoin price is tipped to surpass $2 this cycle. Meanwhile, Unilabs Finance‚Äôs UNIL token is on experts‚Äô lists of the top DeFi coins to invest in. Investors have been doubling down on the AI coin due to its solid fundamentals as the native utility token of a DeFi asset management platform.

The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 2%, trading around the $105,071 mark. BTC‚Äôs drop to $100,000 wiped out over $1 billion in leveraged bets over the past 24 hours as traders rushed to sell. Analysts believe BTC‚Äôs decline has been sustained by long-term holders locking in their profits. Bitcoin (BTC) Turns Bearish Amid Political Tensions Bitcoin (BTC) dipped sharply on Friday, plunging 3% to hit a low of $100,421 as political tensions between President Donald Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk escalated. However, it has recovered since, regaining its position above $105,000. The price action reflects increased volatility across crypto after an acrimonious escalation of tensions between President Trump and Musk. The tensions triggered a risk-off sentiment heading into the weekend as the global crypto market cap plunged over 4%, and Bitcoin fell to $100,000, with market watchers sweating over a further decline. According to data from CryptoQuant analyst Darkfrost, the Binance net taker volume fell from $20 million to -$135 million in under eight hours, indicating a sharp change in investor sentiment. The analyst emphasized that this was the largest intraday net-taker volume reversal observed on the exchange this year. The shift shows how quickly sentiment changes if influential figures or macro-narratives dominate headlines. Miner Inflows Could Pressure Price Action Bitcoin has recovered after Thursday‚Äôs dip, rising back above $105,000 during the ongoing session. While BTC has recovered, the broader crypto market is still digesting the fallout. However, CryptoQuant analysts have pointed out another factor that could decide the near-term outlook. According to on-chain data, Bitcoin miners have dramatically increased the amount of BTC transferred to exchanges. Miner-to-exchange inflows crossed $1 billion per day between May 19 and May 28. These inflows are often seen as a proxy for miners‚Äô preparing to sell their holdings. This could significantly impact BTC‚Äôs short-term supply dynamics and introduce volatility to the flagship cryptocurrency‚Äôs spot market performance. The spike in realized inflows from miners to exchanges can be interpreted as a sign of growing sell-side pressure. Large-scale transfers to exchanges are generally interpreted as miners preparing to offload their assets. Analysts have pointed out that while miner selling isn‚Äôt inherently negative, it could impact short-term price stability. On the other hand, when miner inflows spike, it reflects sentiment regarding profitability, operational stress, or anticipated price changes. ‚ÄúPaying close attention to these inflows‚Äîespecially during historical peaks like the current phase‚Äîcan help with risk management and more informed trading decisions.‚Äù Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp drop on Thursday, falling to an intraday low of $100,421 on Thursday as markets turned bearish. Sentiment turned bearish following an ugly spat between President Trump and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. However, the decline was short-lived as BTC rebounded on Friday to cross $104,000 and settle at $104,378. The price briefly crossed $105,000 during the ongoing session but has declined and is currently trading around $104,799. Despite the decline, analysts believe a pullback was expected and could trigger a move to fresh all-time highs. According to an analysis, BTC follows a similar path after each halving. The analyst pointed out that BTC rose around 280% a year after the 2016 halving and 550% a year after the 2020 halving. During the current cycle, BTC has climbed around 70% since the halving. According to Klarch, price action has picked up after a slow start during previous cycles, indicating there is more room for growth. According to the analyst, BTC‚Äôs recent all-time high is a milestone that marks the beginning of a move higher. BTC has multiple tops before it hits the cycle‚Äôs real peak. BTC started the previous week positively but was back in the red on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as the price fell 1.03% to $107,834. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC plunged over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. The price declined on Friday, dropping 1.51% to go below $105,000 and settle at $104,067. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. Source: TradingView BTC plunged to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,903. Price action turned bearish on Tuesday as BTC fell 0.44% to $105,435. The price declined on Wednesday, falling nearly 1%, slipping below $105,000 and settling at $104,755. Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday thanks to the Trump-Musk spat. As a result, BTC fell over 3%, plunging to an intraday low of $100,421 before settling at $101,615. The decline was short-lived as the price recovered on Friday, rising almost 3% and settling at $104,378. BTC briefly crossed $105,000 during the ongoing session before registering a marginal decline and moving to $104,952, an increase of nearly 1%.

Meanwhile, Cardano 's staking rewards have achieved an unprecedented high, leading to speculation about ADA's price stabilization. This article delves into the potential growth for these coins and examines current market sentiments. XRP Price Trends Show Mixed Signals with Recovery and Bearish Pressure Over the past month, XRP advanced by about 2.19%, with minor weekly gains of 1.46%. However, in the last six months, the coin has dropped around 16.50%. This price performance has been characterized by volatility, with brief upward movements failing to reverse the long-term decline. Recent technical measures indicate modest short-term efforts to regain momentum, but the overall trend continues to experience downward pressure, creating a mixed scenario for traders and investors. Current XRP pricing is fluctuating between $1.95 and $2.53, within a range marked by significant support and resistance levels. Immediate resistance is at $2.88 , with a further level at $3.45. Support is noted at $1.73 and $1.15. Market indicators, including a Relative Strength Index of 44.13, suggest a slight bearish sentiment. Limited upward movement points to cautious trading behavior. Strategies may include entering long positions near $1.73 and selling at $2.88 if a rally occurs. Alternatively, a drop below $1.73 could signal short positions, emphasizing the need for tight stop-loss measures. Cardano Price Snapshot: Declines and Key Levels to Monitor Cardano has seen a modest dip of nearly 2% in the past month and a significant decline of almost 45% over the last six months. The asset has steadily fallen in value during this period, with recent performance slightly less severe than the longer-term drop. After a time of notable weakness, the coin has shown a small recovery in price action, although underlying pressures remain evident. The current trading range lies between approximately $0.597 and $0.819, with immediate support near $0.508 and secondary support around $0.286. Key resistance levels are at about $0.952 and $1.174. Recent indicators suggest that bears are dominant, as momentum readings indicate weakness. There is no clear trend, allowing for potential recovery plays if buyers step in near support. Traders may find cautious entry points near lower boundaries, aiming for a bounce towards the first resistance level. Conclusion Analysts have confirmed a vital support level for XRP , suggesting stability ahead. Meanwhile, Cardano 's staking rewards have reached a new peak, indicating strong network participation. This could signal that ADA's price has potentially found a bottom, offering investors a more solid footing. Together, these developments highlight positive momentum for both cryptocurrencies.

Today, that same buy would be worth hundreds of thousands. What those early adopters understood wasn‚Äôt just the idea of Bitcoin ‚Äî it was the power of timing. Not hype. Not speculation. Mechanics. That moment may never return for Bitcoin. But it‚Äôs beginning again for Bitcoin Solaris. The Nova App, the project‚Äôs mobile-first mining gateway, allows anyone with a modern smartphone to contribute idle CPU and storage to earn BTC-S tokens. There‚Äôs no GPU farm, no locked staking. Just a device and a connection. Entry? As little as a few bucks. Turning Phones Into Earning Engines Bitcoin Solaris flips the mining model on its head. Where traditional networks depend on high-capital nodes and complex validator structures, BTC-S runs on an architecture optimized for everyday participation. Through the Nova App, phones run background operations that contribute to block validation. This creates yield not in theory, but in real time. Closed beta testers have already demonstrated the power of that simplicity, reporting consistent weekly earnings from passive phone usage alone. That kind of performance isn‚Äôt common in new-layer protocols. It‚Äôs even rarer when it happens before exchange listings. And with phase 6 of the presale active at $6 per token, even small investments today open the door to protocol-level rewards ‚Äî without the usual bottlenecks or dependencies. What Makes This Model Work? Bitcoin Solaris doesn‚Äôt scale through brute force. Its strength comes from separation of function. The base layer secures the network through a hybrid of Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Capacity ‚Äî mechanisms that keep energy costs low while maintaining robust consensus. On top of that, the Solaris Layer processes transactions with Proof-of-History and Proof-of-Time, two clock-based systems designed for speed and precision. That separation allows the network to reach over 10,000 transactions per second without congestion. Finality settles in around two seconds. These figures aren‚Äôt ideal conditions or load-tested projections. They reflect what the system is engineered to maintain under real usage. And because the design limits the burden placed on individual devices, it opens the door for phones to play a role in consensus. This approach solves a long-standing issue in blockchain design. Most networks either require validators with constant uptime or miners with high hashpower. Both models create entry barriers. Bitcoin Solaris avoids that by shifting emphasis from raw output to consistent, verifiable contribution. When a phone provides idle storage or computing bandwidth, it‚Äôs supporting the system. That support is measured and rewarded through direct token distribution. Audited, Verified, and Fully Transparent Security isn‚Äôt a footnote in the Bitcoin Solaris model. It‚Äôs central. The Nova App has already passed a full Freshcoins audit , confirming its technical architecture, mining logic, and efficiency assumptions. On the protocol level, Cyberscope completed a comprehensive code review of smart contracts and consensus structures. And team identity verification has been completed through KYC documentation , adding another layer of accountability. This is the kind of transparency that simply doesn‚Äôt exist in early-stage mobile projects. And according to Crypto Volt‚Äôs breakdown , that‚Äôs exactly why Bitcoin Solaris stands out in a saturated landscape of speculative coins and hype-based launches. The Tokenomics That Lock In Opportunity Bitcoin Solaris has a hard cap of 21 million tokens. That figure isn‚Äôt symbolic ‚Äî it defines the economics of the entire network. No additional tokens will ever be minted. No emissions curve, no inflation schedule, and no backend wallet allocations. The rules are fixed, and that certainty shapes every decision around acquisition and participation. Out of the full supply, 4.2 million BTC-S are allocated to the presale. That‚Äôs a one-time distribution window ‚Äî not a recurring release. Anyone buying in now is acquiring tokens before broader network access, before centralized exchange liquidity, and before the mining rollout scales competition. It‚Äôs not just about getting a better price ‚Äî it‚Äôs about starting with a stronger position. At $6 during phase 6, early buyers are operating at a fraction of the exchange listing benchmark, which is targeting $20 based on network growth and liquidity provisioning. But more importantly, holding tokens at this stage isn‚Äôt passive. Once the Nova App goes live, those tokens secure access to mining rewards. Early accumulation leads to early earnings ‚Äî and in a system built on capped supply, that advantage doesn‚Äôt level out over time. It compounds. This model rewards participation, not speculation. Price movement may draw attention later, but the real economic value is already forming through protocol access. Each user entering now locks in a role before the wider market shifts the balance. Crypto Isn‚Äôt Dead. Access Was. Until Now. The barriers that once defined crypto access don‚Äôt apply here. $15 ‚Äî the cost of just a few BTC-S tokens ‚Äî gives users a real position in an operational mining ecosystem. The Nova App turns idle smartphone resources into income. The device you already own becomes a functional part of the protocol. Beta testers running early versions of the app reported earnings that rivaled ‚Äî and in some cases outperformed ‚Äî browser-based miners and leading staking platforms. The difference is accessibility. Instead of tying rewards to who has the most capital or tech knowledge, Bitcoin Solaris ties them to contribution. That‚Äôs what makes the $15 entry point meaningful. It‚Äôs not a lottery ticket or a speculative flyer ‚Äî it‚Äôs a working gateway into the protocol‚Äôs economy. The earlier you start, the more you compound returns before broader network demand increases competition and shifts pricing.

Known for its fast cross-border payment solutions and expanding partnerships, XRP remains a staple among the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for both short-term gains and long-term holding. While XRP navigates regulatory headwinds and market volatility, fresh coin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as promising new crypto coins, attracting attention for their disruptive DeFi innovations and impressive growth projections. Over $10.1 million has been raised and the project now has 11700 holders. For investors wondering what crypto to buy now, XRP and MUTM offer contrasting but compelling opportunities in the evolving digital asset space. XRP Price Outlook and Market Sentiment XRP is trading at $2.23 which is an increase of 1.8% from yesterday. Significant resistance has developed for the cryptocurrency at $2.50 since this level has stopped it from rising before. If the current resistance is breached analysts think the price might head toward $5 over the next four years. However it‚Äôs important to be careful because a few indicators hint that another fall could happen to areas under $1.76 in the absence of breaking resistance. XRP‚Äôs investors need to pay close attention to its performance because going past important resistance points will shape its path. Other newly developed coins, for example Mutuum Finance (MUTM), are attracting interest for their significance in the ongoing crypto sector. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. Mutuum Finance stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain, fully collateralized and USD-pegged.

While the cryptocurrency‚Äôs recent pullback near the $100,000 region may have alarmed the crypto market, analysts suggest that this move is part of a broader trend that could push BTC to its next price high. Golden Cross Formation Pits Bitcoin At $150,000 Bitcoin has once again flashed a classic bullish signal, the Golden Cross, prompting renewed optimism for a major price rally in the coming months. According to a technical analysis by ‚ÄòChain Mind,‚Äô a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), Bitcoin may be on the verge of an explosive surge to $150,000 if this historical pattern plays out as expected. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash To $100,00 Loading: Next Targets Revealed As Bears Take Over The last time BTC formed this pattern was in November 2024. Immediately after the cross‚Äôs completion, Bitcoin‚Äôs price experienced a 10% correction, followed by a sharp 62% rally over the next several weeks. This behavior established a clear trend of a short-term shake-out preceding a strong bullish continuation. Now, in early June 2025, Bitcoin has printed another Golden Cross on its chart, and so far, price action appears to be closely mirroring the one from the previous year. Notably, Bitcoin has dropped 8%, suggesting a smaller but comparable corrective phase to the one observed in 2024. Technical projections from Chain Minds now show a possible 51% rally on the horizon from the post-correction bottom. This would potentially place Bitcoin in the $150,000 range by the end of 2025. Notably, Chain Mind‚Äôs analysis identifies Bitcoin‚Äôs recent crash toward the $100,000 region as a potential local bottom, with the Golden Cross acting as the catalyst for the next leg of the bull run. If the current historical pattern holds, Bitcoin may be entering a sustained period of upward movement to new all-time highs. With the cryptocurrency already recovering from the brief downturn and now trading at $105,050, a 51% increase would potentially place its price at approximately $158,625 once the historical Golden Cross pattern is fully completed. Bitcoin Uptrend At Risk If $100,000 Level Is Lost Despite the broader bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin, its price is currently navigating a critical trading range between $100,000 and $112,049, which analysts suggest is crucial for maintaining its current optimistic outlook. Crypto Fella, the market expert responsible for this analysis, has shown via a chart that BTC is consolidating within a rectangular band, reflecting a pause in momentum after a sharp upward move earlier in the quarter. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Crash Trigger To $96,000: The Head And Shoulders Pattern That‚Äôs Forming The crypto analyst has boldly asserted that as long as Bitcoin continues to trade within the range above, there should be little cause for concern for another major crash. However, if the $100,000 mark fails to hold, the next likely target for downside movement is between $97,000 and $95,000, representing a 9.56% and 7.66% decline from current levels, respectively.

The hourly price chart confirms that bears are making efforts to prevent the Manta price from an immediate surge. However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.263, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.322. MANTA Chart on TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta‚Äôs price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.196, resulting in a correction to $0.161. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta‚Äôs rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‚Äòs scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA‚Äôs potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‚Äòs future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price down today? Manta price has triggered a strong bearish rally toward $0.22. This occurred after buyers failed to maintain the buying pressure around local tops at $0.23. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option.

The catalyst? A public feud between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over the proposed repeal of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit, which analysts estimate could cost Tesla $1.2 billion in annual profits. Elon Musk, who recently stepped down as a special government adviser, fired back on social media, rejecting Trump‚Äôs claims and even floating the idea that without him, Trump wouldn‚Äôt have won the election. By the next day, Tesla‚Äôs stock rebounded 5% on mere rumors of a reconciliatory phone call between the two. Source: Bloomberg This extreme volatility, with $150 billion lost, then a partial recovery based on a potential chat, exposes a stark reality: markets are driven by trust, not fundamentals. Trust, or the lack thereof, is the real currency, and Tesla‚Äôs upheaval is a case study in what happens when markets are built on personal interactions, not reliable systems. Marko Ratkovic, the CTO of Graphite Network , an L1 blockchain platform designed to eliminate this type of chaos by embedding reputation-based features directly into its core, commented on the Trump-Musk feud: ‚ÄúTesla‚Äôs value can change dramatically based on Musk‚Äôs public statements or political relationships, not solely on its production or innovation. This is an example of what happens when trust isn‚Äôt engineered into the system,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúThe market becomes emotional, not structural. Traders and investors react to tweets, headlines, and breakfast meetings rather than robust, transparent mechanisms. ‚Äù Tesla‚Äôs challenges, including a 71% profit decline in the Q1 of 2025 and a 15% drop in vehicle sales compared to the previous fiscal year, make this clear. Besides capital and innovation, reputation highly influences market outcomes. Unlike the traditional finance markets, which often rely on opinions of individual personalities and political factors, Graphite Network is creating systems where a user's or project‚Äôs trust is determined by systems that are built in from the beginning, not as an afterthought. A Deeper Look Into Graphite Network Trust Isn‚Äôt Assumed ‚Äî It‚Äôs Measured Graphite Network‚Äôs infrastructure is designed to let everyone in the market verify each other‚Äôs actions based on proof, not just promises. It features a built-in Trust Score system that rates how trustworthy each user is, based on factors like account history, interaction records, and KYC level. While KYC is optional, completing it contributes to a higher Trust Score and unlocks a smoother, more seamless user experience ‚Äî similar to how credit scores function in traditional finance. This system helps individuals and businesses assess counterparties before transacting, reducing risk and increasing confidence in decentralized environments. Data Integrity That‚Äôs Built to Last The platform uses trusted KYC centers to maintain data integrity, ensuring that all information is accurate and secure. It uses smart contracts to automate KYC processes, while zero-knowledge proofs enable third-party dApps to verify user information without exposing sensitive details on the network. One Identity, One Account Graphite Network keeps things simple with a one-user-one-account policy ‚Äî no sock puppets, no gaming the system. It means everyone‚Äôs reputation is tied to a single identity, making interactions more fair, transparent, and harder to fake. Tagged Addresses for Transparent Funding Graphite Network‚Äôs upcoming tagged addresses feature will enhance blockchain transparency by linking wallets to specific purposes, like charity or grants. This makes fund usage traceable in real-time. If funds are misused, the system flags it instantly ‚Äî and smart contracts can block suspicious transactions on the spot, adding built-in accountability. Smart Contracts That Know Who to Trust With reputation-based smart contracts, trust becomes programmable. A bank, for example, could require a minimum Trust Score or verified ID before issuing a loan. This approach aligns blockchain activity with real-world expectations, improving both security and transparency. Earning Trust ‚Äî Literally On top of that, Graphite Network doesn‚Äôt just measure trust ‚Äî it rewards it. The system is designed to incentivize meaningful participation across all layers of the ecosystem. Both entry-level and authorized nodes are recognized and rewarded for their role in strengthening the network, making Graphite Network a rare example of a blockchain that compensates contributors directly at the protocol level. Value is earned through verifiable actions, consistent contributions, and transparent behavior ‚Äî turning trust from a passive attribute into an active, measurable asset. Building Real Applications on a Reputation System That Actually Works Graphite Network is built to scale efficiently using L2 solutions. This allows it to support a wide range of real-world applications, from finance to supply chain management. Their roadmap for 2025 outlines several projects and L2 products they plan to introduce within their reputation-based framework . Some of these projects include: Phonebook Reputation MVP: One of the first features coming soon is a tool that links trust scores from Graphite Network to phone numbers, making it easier for DeFi users to verify the legitimacy of others before making transactions. It‚Äôs a simple but powerful way to bring familiar identifiers into the Web3 space, helping people feel more confident about who they‚Äôre interacting with. Reputation-Based Dating App MVP: This app uses Graphite Network's technology to verify user profiles, making online dating in the Web3 space safer and more reliable. Competitive Voting System: This system will use reputation as the basis for governance, rather than the number of tokens a person holds, promoting fairer decision-making in blockchain projects. These features and applications lay the groundwork for a trust-based DeFi system where reputation is founded on solid principles rather than emotional factors. When Markets Run on Mood Swings, Graphite Becomes the Blueprint for Unshakable Trust The lesson from Tesla‚Äôs $150 billion wipeout is clear: when trust hinges on individual personalities like Elon Musk and Donald Trump, markets behave like mood rings, not machines. A single tweet, a public feud, or the rumor of a reconciliatory phone call can swing billions ‚Äì not because the company changed, but because the perception of reputation changed. That‚Äôs the failure: capital flows based on personal drama, not verified performance. And that‚Äôs exactly the problem Graphite Network is solving. In Graphite Network‚Äôs world, trust isn‚Äôt reactive ‚Äì it‚Äôs pre-engineered. Reputation isn‚Äôt built in a press cycle, it‚Äôs measured, maintained, and made visible through on-chain history, cryptographic proofs, and transparent systems. No billionaire breakfast meetings, no policy whiplash, no need to guess who‚Äôs in favor this week. The Musk‚ÄìTrump fallout wasn‚Äôt just a media spectacle. It was a reminder that reputation drives markets, and that systems built on people will always be fragile. Graphite Network‚Äôs message couldn‚Äôt be clearer: in an age of personality-driven volatility, codified trust is the only way forward.

Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading at around $2,500 at last check on Saturday ‚Äî higher than this week‚Äôs low of $2,380. A potential catalyst for ETH is the ongoing exchange-traded fund inflows, which have surged in the past few weeks. SoSoValue data shows that these funds have added substantial inflows in the past three weeks. They added $25 million on Friday, the 15th consecutive day of gains, bringing the cumulative inflows to over $3.3 billion. All these funds now hold over $9.4 billion in assets, equivalent to 3.1% of Ethereum‚Äôs market cap. You might also like: IOST price surges amid $21m raise to accelerate RWA growth The iShares Ethereum ETF, whose ticker symbol is ETHA, has had a cumulative inflow of $4.85 billion and is slowly nearing the $5 billion milestone. This growth is likely because BlackRock is the biggest name in the ETF industry, and it trades at a 0.35% discount to net asset value. Rising Ethereum ETF inflows are notable because it is an indirect signal that American institutional investors are buying. More data shows that Ethereum‚Äôs network is doing well. For example, the total value locked in its decentralized finance ecosystem has jumped by 26% in the last 30 days to $130 billion. Its bridged TVL has moved to about $400 billion, while the stablecoins in its network have jumped to $125 billion. Ethereum price technical analysis ETH price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that ETH price surged in May and reached a high of $2,743, which coincided with the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level. It has now formed a bullish flag pattern, a common bullish continuation sign. This flag pole is about 50% long, and measuring the distance from its breakout zone gives the target price of $4,097. This target coincided with its highest point in 2024. The other bullish case is that Ethereum price has formed a golden crossover as the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages have crossed each other. This crossover often leads to more gains. For example, it happened in November last year, triggering a 35% jump.

Featuring the tagline ‚ÄúPowering Global Payments for All,‚Äù the ad illustrates Ripple‚Äôs intent to be at the center of a global payment transformation powered by XRP. The ad was shared by Edoardo Farina, CEO of Alpha Lions Academy and a well-known XRP advocate. It features a unique use case that enables people to instantly receive payments, including a moment showing someone making an instant payment from space. It showcases Ripple‚Äôs continued focus on delivering real-time, borderless payments.

This @Ripple Ad broke the internet $XRP will move ALL THE MONEY pic.twitter.com/uNGIL0Ma3p ‚Äî EDO FARINA üÖß XRP (@edward_farina) June 6, 2025 Ripple‚Äôs payment system enables real-time global payments using stablecoins, crypto, and local currencies. These solutions are designed for businesses, fintechs, and payment service providers seeking faster, more affordable, and reliable payment infrastructure. According to Ripple, its network covers 90 markets and supports over 55 currencies. The rapidly expanding network supports a range of functions, including sending and accepting payments globally without holding digital assets. Users can settle payments instantly and around the clock, and XRP is the bridge currency that powers this vast network.

He noted that their collaboration with Ripple eliminated pre-funding requirements in over 20 countries. Tranglo has been using XRP for real-time cross-border payments for some time, and Lee emphasized that by working with Ripple, Tranglo is pushing forward its mission to offer more equitable access to financial services across new markets. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently spoke about the company‚Äôs plans to rewire the entire banking system , and Farina wrote, ‚ÄúXRP will move ALL THE MONEY.‚Äù By building the infrastructure to move money in real-time across borders, Ripple is positioning XRP as a tool to enable global liquidity. The underlying implication is not just that Ripple facilitates payments, but that XRP could serve as the bridge asset for all of them. By connecting financial institutions, fintechs, and payment providers, Ripple aims to create a network where XRP moves value anywhere in the world. With robust infrastructure, trusted partnerships, and growing adoption, XRP will be central to the future of global payments.

This article delves into four digital currencies poised for potential growth: AAVE , CRO , INJ , and STX . Learn about these promising tokens and why they stand out in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. Curious about which coins are ready to thrive? Read on to discover more. Aave Price Rally Amid Mixed Long-Term Trends Aave experienced a significant month-long surge with a 46.55% gain, while a six-month look reveals a decline of 10.66%. The coin‚Äôs recent performance shows a rapid move from lower valuations toward a more robust mid-range price. A modest weekly increase of 0.39% hints at stability amid short-term volatility. Past performance highlights a market that has embraced rapid gains over the last month yet struggled to maintain a longer-term upward trend. The current price sits between a low of $179.40 and a high of $298.70, confined within a range where support is at $111.81 and major resistance near $350.42. Indicators provide mixed signals: a positive monthly performance contrasts with a momentum indicator reading of -12.49, while the RSI at 55.04 signals a neutral state. Trading invites caution as neither bulls nor bears have taken definitive control. Short-term strategies include monitoring a breakout from resistance near $350.42 or waiting for a pullback towards support for a conservative buy. Cronos Shows Short-Term Gains Amid Long-Term Challenges Cronos displayed a modest monthly gain of 5.68%, but recent price action has turned downward with a dip of 2.91% over the past week. The half-year results are less favorable, exhibiting a significant decline of 51.74%. This performance highlights a turbulent path, characterized by periodic recoveries overshadowed by a long-term downtrend. Traders might find the volatility both challenging and intriguing as they navigate these fluctuations. Currently, the price trades within the range of $0.09 to $0.12, with immediate support at $0.08 and further support at $0.05. Resistance levels sit near $0.12 and $0.15. The market shows a relatively balanced state, with no clear dominance from bulls or bears. The RSI reading of 47.22 reflects a neutral position, accompanied by a slight negative momentum and an Awesome Oscillator close to zero. Traders should watch for a breakout above $0.12 or a decline below $0.08 to identify potential trading opportunities. Injective Sees Volatile Movements Amid Shifting Market Trends Injective recorded a notable upturn over the past month with a 27% price increase, while the half-year performance showed a sharp drop of 64%. Price behavior during this time reveals a coin that has faced significant highs and lows, reflecting fluctuating investor sentiment. Movements over the last month indicate buying interest has pushed prices upward, but the six-month decline underscores persistent bearish pressure affecting the coin's long-term stability. Recent price adjustments highlight its vulnerability to rapid shifts, making this performance a blend of recovery spurts and deeper retracements from earlier highs. Currently, the price of Injective is trading within a range between $8.82 and $15.47. A resistance level near $18.81 poses a challenge for bulls, with a second resistance at $25.47 indicating a higher hurdle if momentum builds. Support is found around $5.50, providing a crucial buffer against downside risks. Technical indicators suggest a slight bearish lean, with the Awesome Oscillator at -0.25 and a momentum reading of -2.90. The RSI at 48.94 reflects a neutral stance, signaling no clear overbought or oversold conditions. Trading strategies may focus on monitoring behavior around the $18.81 level for potential breakouts while watching the support at $5.50 for any signs of intensified bearish pressure. Stacks (STX) Market Outlook: Past Declines and Present Key Levels The past month STX has shown a significant downward movement, marked by a 27.44% drop in Stacks. Over the last six months, the situation worsened with a staggering 76.14% decline, indicating a severe correction phase. During this period, price behavior remained constrained within specific boundaries. Weekly trading has reflected a loss of 12.85%, underscoring continuous pullbacks. This volatility has been a constant theme, characterized by quick upward shifts followed by steep declines. Long-term investors have faced relentless pressures, signaling a distinctly bearish climate that has compelled traders to reevaluate risk and explore potential entry points. Currently, Stacks trades between $0.61 and $0.97, with immediate resistance at $1.21 and a further barrier at $1.58. The closest support stands at $0.47, while additional backing is around $0.10. Bearish sentiment is evident, as indicated by the Awesome Oscillator and momentum metrics. The RSI suggests oversold conditions at 33.197. Bears dominate the market, with no clear upward trend visible. Trading strategies should consider cautious positioning near resistance levels and vigilant management around support. Short positions near the upper resistance are advisable, while any signs of recovery should be monitored for potential long entries, particularly near the $0.47 support, to minimize risk. Conclusion AAVE offers a strong lending platform. CRO ‚Äôs connection to a growing exchange boosts its potential. INJ innovates with its decentralized derivatives exchange. STX benefits from Bitcoin‚Äôs security for smart contracts. All four have unique strengths that make them solid choices for a long-term strategy. Focusing on these can provide diversification and potential growth. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Table of Contents Elon Musk vs Trump sends the crypto market falling After the drop, some investors panic ‚Äì others spot opportunity Why Pepeto is quickly becoming a top contender A public feud between Donald Trump and Elon Musk just rattled global markets. The two titans clashed over Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill,‚Äù with Musk publicly blasting the policy for threatening economic stability. Trump, never one to back down, responded by hinting at halting government support for Musk-linked ventures like SpaceX and Tesla. Within hours, Tesla shares nosedived, and the ripple effect slammed into the crypto space, signaling more than just political drama. For investors, the message was clear: uncertainty is back, and the smart money is already repositioning. You might also like: Pepeto, Solaxy stand out as leading crypto presales amid altcoin rally Elon Musk vs Trump sends the crypto market falling After Elon Musk and Donald Trump clashed online over the weekend, the entire crypto market took a heavy hit. Bitcoin fell sharply, dropping below the $101,000 mark, while Ethereum slipped by over 6%. In total, more than $170 billion was wiped from the market in just a few hours. The sell-off was quick and brutal. Within a single day, over $950 million in long positions were liquidated. Traders were forced out of their bets as prices dropped fast, and panic spread across exchanges. It was one of the most sudden crashes seen in recent months. Some believe it was just a healthy correction. Others think it might have been triggered on purpose. With two of the loudest voices in tech and politics, Musk and Trump, now at odds, tension is rising. Trump criticized Tesla and hinted at policy changes, while Musk fired back online. Tesla shares took a hit, and soon after, crypto followed. Now many are asking the same question: Was this just a coincidence‚Ä¶ or a move to reset the market and shake out weak hands? Either way, this dip has created new chances, and sharp investors are already moving toward the next breakout. After the drop, some investors panic ‚Äì others spot opportunity Big crashes don‚Äôt scare everyone. In fact, they often light the path for those paying attention.

In a tweet , he boldly asserted that many would wish they had bought XRP five years from now. Notably, XRP is currently trading at $2.18, and Squire believes the coin could be worth significantly more by 2030.While he did not provide a specific price projection, his warning suggests many might regret not buying more XRP while it was around $2, as it could far surpass that price range.https://twitter.com/TheCryptoSquire/status/1931157913218777257Edoardo Farina, founder of Alpha Lions Academy, expressed a similar sentiment in a separate commentary. He specifically urged market participants to buy XRP now, while he believes the coin is still selling at discounted prices. This perspective supports the view that XRP could be worth much more than $2 in the coming years.https://twitter.com/edward_farina/status/1931071812152234388Looking Back at XRP Five Years AgoIndeed, looking back five years, those who bought XRP are in a much better position today. As of June 2020, XRP was trading as low as $0.1745. Compared to today‚Äôs price of $2.18, that represents a massive 1,149% gain.To put this in perspective, someone who invested $10,000 in XRP five years ago could have purchased approximately 57,306 tokens. At today‚Äôs price, that investment would be worth around $125,000.This historical performance may be shaping the perspective of XRP advocates, who warn that investors could regret not buying XRP ‚Äúcheap‚Äù now by the end of the decade.Bullish FactorsBeyond historical performance, many are bullish on XRP due to its fundamentals. Martin Hiesboeck, a researcher at crypto exchange Uphold, argues that the current price may be the final entry point before a major move, citing multiple catalysts:Spot XRP ETF Decision: The SEC will rule on Franklin Templeton‚Äôs application soon. A green light could propel XRP in a similar way to how Bitcoin‚Äôs ETF approval affected its price in early 2024. Other asset managers like Grayscale and Bitwise are also seeking to list XRP ETFs.Institutional Adoption: Companies are adopting XRP as part of their treasury assets. Notable names include Webus International, Nasdaq-listed VivoPower, and Wellgistics. Upcoming Events: Hiesboeck also points to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting (June 17‚Äì18). A potential rate cut could trigger a broader altcoin rally, benefiting risk assets like XRP.¬†Additionally, the XRP Ledger APEX Summit(June 10‚Äì12) could spark investor optimism if Ripple unveils major developments in AI, DeFi, and cross-chain technology.How High Can XRP Get by 2030?In a hypothetical scenario where XRP repeats its historical performance, a 1,149% surge from its current price would place it at approximately $27.23 by 2030.¬†While speculative, several analysts, including EGRAG, have mentioned this price level. EGRAG believes it could even materialize within this year. However, such projections remain speculative.On the higher end, Teleagon analysts suggest XRP could reach $48 by the end of the decade. Meanwhile, Bitwise analysts offer a target of up to $30 by 2030. Yet, they also caution that XRP could fall as low as $0.10 in a bearish scenario where its fundamentals fail to materialize.",Market|Latest XRP (Ripple) News Today|XRP Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-07 16:52:43

Ruvi AI‚Äôs blockchain and AI integration has got everyone talking, leaving Tron (TRX) in the spotlight. Tron (TRX): Decentralized Content Pioneer Tron (TRX) has been around since 2017, carving out its niche by decentralizing content sharing. The platform allows creators to store and distribute digital content directly to consumers without intermediaries, more control and lower costs. Tron‚Äôs system stands out for its scalability, fast transaction speeds and low fees, making it a great option for dApps. And Tron acquired BitTorrent, expanding its reach in peer-to-peer file sharing. But while Tron has continued to innovate within its ecosystem, some analysts say its strategies feel static compared to the disruption of newer entrants like Ruvi AI. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Blockchain + AI Ruvi AI‚Äôs mission is clear, to merge blockchain and AI to create a decentralized content production ecosystem. The platform is a decentralized superapp, allowing users to generate AI driven text, audio, video and images seamlessly. Its applications directly address industries like marketing, content creation and automation. The $RUVI token is at the heart of this ecosystem. It powers payments, unlocks premium features for users and offers governance and staking rewards. Ruvi AI‚Äôs forward thinking approach allows it to solve real industry problems, giving it a level of utility that goes way beyond speculative trading. Presale Momentum Ruvi AI is moving fast. The project sold out Phase 1 of its presale in 2 weeks, with tokens at $0.010. Early supporters got a 50% price increase as Phase 2 bumped the token price to $0.015. With over 1,400 holders already on board, Ruvi AI is still hot during presale.Milestones include first exchange listing and partnership with a major trading platform, increasing liquidity and accessibility for investors. This has raised $1.5 million in funding and is setting up for a big entry. High Returns with Ruvi AI‚Äôs Investment Tiers Investors in Ruvi AI‚Äôs presale can take advantage of its VIP tier system which offers big bonuses and high returns. Here‚Äôs how the tiers work: VIP 2 Threshold: 50,000 RUVI tokens ($750 at $0.015 each). Bonus: 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens: 70,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price: $4,900 (553% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch: $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold: 100,000 RUVI tokens ($1,500 at $0.015 each). Bonus: 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens: 160,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price: $11,200 (647% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch: $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold: 500,000 RUVI tokens ($7,500 at $0.015 each). Bonus: 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens: 1,000,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price: $70,000 (833% ROI). Value at $1 Post-Launch: $1,000,000 (13,233% ROI) These tiers show Ruvi AI‚Äôs commitment to rewarding its early supporters and a pathway to big returns. Why Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI stands out with blockchain and AI. Unlike many tokens focused on speculation, Ruvi AI has real world use cases with scalable solutions for individuals and businesses. Plus its transparent and community driven with its decentralized governance model. That‚Äôs building trust and growing its user base. With an aggressive roadmap and big partnerships in the works, Ruvi AI is positioning itself to be a player in the next bull run. The Future Tron is a mature blockchain but its incremental progress leaves room for new entrants. Ruvi AI‚Äôs model is an attractive alternative, getting attention from analysts and investors with its growth and utility. For those looking to get in early on crypto investments, Ruvi AI is the chance to get in on the future of blockchain and AI. With its momentum and big goals, Ruvi AI is one to watch as the market gets ready for the next bull run.

With utilities in place and early access pricing, many of these coins could see major gains after launch. From privacy-focused wallets to mining-enabled platforms, these early-stage cryptos are shaping a new wave of adoption. If you‚Äôre searching for the best performing crypto today, these presale crypto projects might be the best place to look. Each brings a unique utility, and they‚Äôre gaining traction fast. Here‚Äôs a look at BlockDAG, BTC Bull, Snorter, and Best Wallet Token and why they stand out. 1. BlockDAG ‚Äì Hybrid Tech with Strong Mining Support BlockDAG is setting a new bar among presale crypto projects by mixing blockchain and DAG structures. This design allows for faster transactions and scalable performance. It also supports Ethereum tools and smart contract creation with low-code setup. Developers and users alike find it easy to access. Its mining features are just as impressive. BlockDAG miners, including the X1 mobile miner and X100 ASIC, are efficient and profitable. These devices can produce as much as 2,000 BDAG coins per day, helping both newcomers and advanced users. BlockDAG has now raised over $288.5 million and sold more than 22 billion coins. Batch 28 is priced at $0.0262, marking a 2,520% return since batch 1. The current frozen price is $0.0018, valid until June 13, offering an even bigger 2,678% potential gain. The launch price is set at $0.05. So far, 17,700+ ASIC miners have been sold. With real-time mining activity and fast-growing adoption, BlockDAG is among the best performing crypto projects in the presale space. 2. BTC Bull ‚Äì Built to Mirror Bitcoin‚Äôs Momentum BTC Bull is one of the few presale crypto projects designed to track Bitcoin movement while adding its own rewards twist. Traders are drawn to it for its gamified design, which includes incentive loops and events. This keeps activity high even when Bitcoin slows. With a presale price of $0.009 and over $5.6 million raised, BTC Bull is moving fast. Only a small portion of its supply is left, and that‚Äôs increasing the demand. Should Bitcoin surge again, BTC Bull could benefit directly. Those following the best performing crypto today see this project as a strong short-term prospect with fast action potential. 3. Snorter ‚Äì Community and Fun Rolled Into One Snorter is shaking up the meme space by tying fun to real interaction. This presale crypto project rewards users for engaging in community activities like sharing memes and voting. The token has built-in deflationary mechanics and keeps value growing through activity. Now in its fourth presale stage, Snorter is priced at $0.00062 and has already raised $3.1 million. More features, such as SnorterBoards and meme battles, will go live after launch. Those seeking the best performing crypto today with low entry points and real engagement are giving Snorter a serious look. 4. Best Wallet Token ‚Äì Privacy Meets Real Utility Best Wallet Token is focused on delivering actual services to users. As the native coin of a Web3 wallet, it covers everything from fiat on-ramps to built-in staking. Its main draw, though, is privacy. The wallet includes a stealth mode for masked transactions, which is timely as more users demand better protection. Currently in Stage 5 with a $0.0043 price tag, Best Wallet Token has raised more than $7.2 million. Early adopters will get higher APYs for staking in-wallet. If you‚Äôre checking the best performing crypto today based on use and privacy, this one has strong appeal. Key Insights With renewed focus on utility and strong entry prices, presale crypto projects are proving to be the hot picks of 2025. BTC Bull is capitalizing on Bitcoin trends, while Snorter adds community fun with real value. Best Wallet Token offers privacy-backed use, but BlockDAG continues to lead with $288.5 million raised, 22 billion coins sold, and fast-selling mining hardware. The GO LIVE reveal on June 13 will mark BlockDAG‚Äôs debut on 20 major platforms, positioning it well for growth. If you‚Äôre tracking the best performing crypto today, these four presales all deserve attention, but BlockDAG is clearly ahead of the curve.

From strong presale progress and technical growth to active use cases in staking and DeFi, the assets featured here are showing real traction. These aren‚Äôt speculative tokens with empty hype, they come with developments, data, and user momentum. BlockDAG leads with over 2,520% gains from early presale stages. Cosmos (ATOM) is expanding its cross-chain capabilities, Aptos (APT) is breaking DeFi activity records, and Aave (AAVE) has delivered a major performance surge. What links them all? They‚Äôre building consistently, delivering updates, and gaining adoption. This is a data-based view of four assets that stand out among the top cryptos to buy now. BlockDAG: Utility-Driven ROI with Multi-Device Mining Options BlockDAG set itself apart by blending active community support with ongoing delivery. Its presale has already secured over $288.5 million, and more than 22 billion coins have been sold, priced currently at $0.0018. With a listing price of $0.05, that‚Äôs a built-in 2,520% upside for initial contributors. The hybrid DAG-blockchain framework enables faster, parallel transactions while maintaining security. Developers can deploy with ease through EVM compatibility and low-code smart contract tools. Mining participation ranges from the X1 mobile device yielding 20 BDAG/day to the powerful X100 producing 2,000 BDAG/day. Over a million users are mining, and sales of 17,850+ ASIC units underscore strong adoption. With the GO LIVE reveal now part of the roadmap, BlockDAG (BDAG) ranks high among the top cryptos to buy now. Cosmos (ATOM): Cross-Chain Moves and Market Confidence Cosmos is holding around $4.45 in early June 2025 and is actively advancing utility through network improvements. The recent Eureka upgrade enables seamless Ethereum communication using the IBC protocol, creating multichain flexibility for developers. Cosmos has also reduced inflation to support long-term coin holders. Momentum is building on the institutional front as well. Bitbank listed ATOM with no fees for early adopters, and Canary Capital is considering a Cosmos-backed ETF. Although prices fell from $5.49 to $4.26, support levels are emerging again. With structural changes and a cross-chain focus, Cosmos has a clear case among the top cryptos to buy now. Aptos (APT): DeFi Growth and System Advancements APT currently trades near $4.96 after recovering from a dip to $4.56 in late May. May brought 2.5 million new users to the Aptos network, which processed 130 million+ transactions. DeFi trading volume hit $3.2 billion, with more than 14 million trades conducted by over 150,000 users. Major players like Hyperion and ThalaLabs are driving this high activity. The performance boost includes the new RapidLane tech in its Block-STM engine, delivering up to 12x faster processing during peak traffic. Security upgrades, such as the MoveEVM vulnerability detection framework, strengthen the platform‚Äôs foundation. With $1.13 billion in stablecoins and $350 million in tokenized assets, Aptos stands tall among the top cryptos to buy now. Aave (AAVE): Stablecoin Surge and Lending Growth AAVE is priced at approximately $265.72 as of June 4, showing a 68% jump over the past month and a 20% spike between May 19 and 20. Daily trading volume rose to $180 million, driven by the sharp rise in GHO stablecoin activity. GHO‚Äôs supply climbed 530%, supported by $116 million in cross-chain transfers via Chainlink‚Äôs CCIP. Further growth is set to come from the v3.3 ‚ÄúUmbrella‚Äù update, which aims to automate risk management. Liquidity has also expanded by $1.5 billion thanks to collaboration with Spark Protocol. With 45% of the decentralized lending market under its belt, Aave‚Äôs position is solid. The consistent user base and market share keep AAVE on the list of top cryptos to buy now. Final Thoughts! Presale appeal, DeFi usage, and technical capability define this group of strong-performing cryptos. BlockDAG continues to push ahead with measurable ROI and active development, including its upcoming GO LIVE reveal. Cosmos is focusing on real cross-chain utility and institutional support. Aptos is locking in serious transaction volume and security improvements. Aave maintains a lead in decentralized lending while expanding its stablecoin use. For anyone narrowing down the top cryptos to buy now , these four deliver proof of momentum, utility, and broader adoption.

Cardano ( ADA ) slumped to $0.668 at last check on Saturday ‚Äî down by 22% from its highest point in May. It is hovering at its lowest point since May 6. On-chain metrics show that Cardano may be on the verge of more downside. Santiment data shows its social dominance score has moved to 0.792%, down from 1.8% in May. This metric means that fewer people are discussing Cardano on social media platforms like X and Reddit. Another metric shows that the daily active addresses have fallen in the past few weeks. There were 21,565 addresses on Friday, down from over 60,500 in May, a sign that fewer people are interacting with it. You might also like: Cookie crypto price crumbling? Support holding firm at key level Further, the closely watched mean dollar invested age (MDIA) has plunged, a sign that old coins are being moved. The 365-day MDIA figure has tumbled to minus 425, down from 62 in September last year. The network realized profit/loss has moved negative to the negative zone, signaling that buyers have started to capitulate. Finally, the Market Value to Realized Value or MVRV ratio has turned negative, signaling that Cardano has become a bargain. However, the MVRV ratio of minus 0.019, is higher than it was in April when the coin bounced back. ADA on-chain metrics | Source: Santiment Apart from on-chain metrics, more data shows that Cardano‚Äôs ecosystem is not doing well. The total value locked in its decentralized finance ecosystem has dropped to $387 million , while the total supply of stablecoins is just $30 million. These metrics are much lower than Sonic and Unichain, which launched earlier this year. Cardano price technical analysis ADA price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the Cardano price has plunged from $1.317 in December to $0.66 today. It has moved below the descending trendline that connects the highest swings since December. Most recently, it formed a small double-top pattern at $0.845, and has moved below its neckline at $0.713, its lowest point on May 19. It has also moved below the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling as sellers target the next key support at $0.513, its lowest point in April, down by 23% from the current level.

This innovative platform introduces an initiative where users can pay transaction fees with Tether, the world‚Äôs largest stablecoin, USDT . This new approach aims to make using the blockchain easier and cheaper, especially for people in growing markets. Stablecoin Brings Shift in Blockchain Payments Stable is the first Layer 1 blockchain where users can pay fees with USDT. Unlike most blockchains, where users need different tokens just to pay fees, Stable‚Äôs system lets users pay directly in USDT, making things easier and more user-friendly. The team behind Stable said that peer-to-peer transactions between users will be completely free. People will be able to send money to each other without paying extra. The project wants to support people in places with high demand for stablecoins. Stable believes this is a significant step toward making stablecoins more useful. While stablecoins like USDT settle over $100 billion daily, the team says current blockchains do not provide a proper environment for their growth and practical adoption. Stable wants to change that by building a system specifically for stablecoin use. This move comes when stablecoins are gaining wide acceptance, especially among institutions. Reportedly, top U.S. banks are exploring plans to create a joint stablecoin project . Stable to Solve Today‚Äôs Blockchain Problems Blockchains today can be difficult to use. They are often expensive, slow, and confusing. Stable says its new design aims to fix these problems. By focusing on stablecoins, the project offers easy and fast transfers from regular money to USDT. It also includes smart contracts that run in dollar values and wallets that do not require users to pay gas fees. This approach is set to make it easier for users to interact with the blockchain without needing to understand its complexities. Stable wants to make the system so smooth that users won‚Äôt even know they are using blockchain technology . Stable Targets Both Institutions and Everyday Users Stable is designed for both large companies and everyday users. Businesses can use Stable‚Äôs tools to work with digital dollars without extra steps or costs. At the same time, people can send and receive money easily and for free. The team says that users will not need to learn how blockchain works in the future. They will just use apps that feel simple and normal. Stable wants to hide the complex parts and focus on the user experience. Tether‚Äôs CEO, Paolo Ardoino, has welcomed the project and says the idea is revolutionary. He emphasized the growing importance of stablecoins in payments, remittances, and trading. Ardoino added that stablecoins have a lot of room to grow, and Stable‚Äôs innovation is a step forward.

That‚Äôs why smart community members are watching this year‚Äôs top altcoin for huge gains. In that mix, Qubetics , a rising heavyweight, is gathering serious momentum. Already attracting tens of thousands of token holders, this Web3 aggregator is flipping the table on fragmented blockchains. And it‚Äôs doing it while still in its crypto presale phase. Qubetics: Addressing Blockchain Interoperability Challenges with Unified Infrastructure One of the most persistent and critical challenges in the blockchain industry is interoperability‚Äîthe ability for different networks to communicate, share data, and execute transactions across ecosystems seamlessly. Despite rapid advancements in individual chains like Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana, most operate in isolation, requiring users and developers to bridge assets manually, maintain multiple wallets, or rely on third-party solutions prone to inefficiencies, delays, and security vulnerabilities. This fragmentation leads to increased complexity, slows innovation, and presents significant barriers to adoption for enterprises and individual users alike. Qubetics resolves these issues by offering a purpose-built, Layer 1 infrastructure designed to aggregate and harmonize multi-chain operations under a single, decentralized framework. Rather than forcing users to switch between platforms or manually bridge data and assets, Qubetics enables real-time communication across major chains through its native interoperability protocol. Smart contracts, assets, and applications built within the Qubetics ecosystem are inherently cross-chain compatible, drastically reducing the operational burden for developers and users. By eliminating siloed architecture and central points of failure, Qubetics delivers the efficiency, flexibility, and scalability required to support next-generation decentralized applications‚Äîwithout compromising on speed, security, or user control. Final Presale Stage: From $0.01 to $0.3370 ‚Äî Final Opportunity Before Market Launch Qubetics launched its crypto presale at just $0.01 per token in Stage 1. Now, in Stage 37, the final phase, $TICS is priced at $0.3370. The project has already raised over $17.7 million, distributed more than 515 million tokens, and attracted a growing community of over 27,500 holders. Once this phase concludes, $TICS will list publicly at $0.40, providing an immediate 20% return for those who secure tokens now. At the current rate, a $7,000 investment would yield approximately 20,772 $TICS tokens. If the token reaches $1, that investment would be valued at $20,772, delivering a 197% return. Should $TICS rise to $5, the value would grow to $103,860. If the token reaches $10 or $15 during the next market cycle, the investment would scale to $207,720 or $311,580 respectively. With the total token supply reduced from over 4 billion to 1.36 billion, and 38.55% of that supply allocated to the public, Qubetics has created a model grounded in scarcity, decentralization, and long-term growth. Only 10 million tokens remain at this price. Once sold out, the presale ends‚Äîand access shifts entirely to the open market. Pi Network: The Social Powerhouse of Mobile Mining You‚Äôve probably heard someone talking about Pi Network in a group chat or Reddit thread. And it makes sense‚Äîit‚Äôs built its reputation on being accessible. By allowing users to mine tokens right from their smartphones, Pi opened up crypto to a huge global community that didn‚Äôt need a high-powered GPU to get started. That social, invite-only model helped create a passionate base of backers. While some critics question the long timeline, loyal community members believe the real prize is Pi‚Äôs mobile-first vision and scale. It might not be everyone‚Äôs pick for immediate returns, but when it comes to the top altcoin for huge gains over time, Pi still has skin in the game. The combination of social reach, grassroots mining, and long-term dApp integration gives Pi serious potential‚Äîif it executes. Cosmos: The OG Interchain Architect Cosmos, often dubbed ‚Äúthe Internet of Blockchains,‚Äù isn‚Äôt flashy‚Äîbut it‚Äôs powerful. Known for its tech-forward approach, Cosmos has focused on letting different blockchains communicate, scale, and work together without being dependent on Ethereum or Bitcoin. Its native coin, ATOM, fuels transactions, secures the network, and stakes the ecosystem forward. For tech-savvy community members who want a battle-tested pick among the top altcoin for huge gains, Cosmos stays in the conversation. It‚Äôs not a flash-in-the-pan project‚Äîit‚Äôs a network that‚Äôs helped others launch and thrive. When buyers talk about sustainable value in the decentralized world, Cosmos still has serious weight. Conclusion: Which Project Is Primed for Massive Returns? Each of these three projects‚ÄîQubetics, Pi, and Cosmos‚Äîhas built something unique. Pi shows how social-first design can change how people think about mining. Cosmos is the underdog infrastructure champ that‚Äôs quietly running half the multichain world. But when it comes to real-time traction, high-level use cases, and explosive potential, Qubetics stands out. It‚Äôs solving real problems with interoperability. And it‚Äôs still in crypto presale, which means the upside is seriously strong for early backers. That‚Äôs why so many in the space are calling it the top altcoin for huge gains . The current stage won‚Äôt last long, and the data doesn‚Äôt lie: over millions raised and growing. You don‚Äôt want to be the one reading about what could‚Äôve been after $TICS hits mainnet.

Qubetics is the world‚Äôs first Web3 aggregator, focused on true interoperability across multiple blockchains. It enables seamless data and asset movement between platforms, solving the cross-chain chaos that slows down business and personal use cases. Is Qubetics still in presale? Yes, Qubetics is currently in the 37th stage of its crypto presale, with over 515 million tokens already sold and a current price of $0.3370. Demand is high, and each new stage brings a price increase. Why is Qubetics considered a top altcoin for huge gains? Thanks to its real-world interoperability use cases, growing adoption, and strong presale numbers, many analysts forecast Qubetics to deliver massive returns post-mainnet, with price predictions hitting up to $15.

Sun, a Chinese-born crypto billionaire, has nevertheless been supporting the token, with World Liberty Financial dropping its cbBTC for wBTC after he joined as an advisor.

In this case, cryptocurrency analyst Ted Pillows highlighted this parallel, noting similarities between Bitcoin‚Äôs current price behavior and gold‚Äôs historical rally, he said in an X post on June 7. In his breakdown, Pillows explained that Bitcoin appears to follow the same sequence of market phases gold experienced before its major breakout. He noted that gold went through a distribution phase, followed by years of accumulation between 2013 and 2018. It then entered a re-accumulation phase after 2020, leading to a sharp rally to record highs of around $3,500. Gold and Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Ted Pillows According to Pillows, Bitcoin is mirroring that path. After peaking in 2021, BTC underwent a steep correction, followed by an accumulation phase throughout 2022 and 2023. In 2024, Bitcoin entered what Pillows described as a re-accumulation phase, gaining momentum and breaking higher. If the pattern holds, it could enter a rally phase similar to gold‚Äôs before its surge. Pillows noted that both assets corrected after hitting new highs, reinforcing the comparison. To this end, the expert projects that Bitcoin could reach $125,000 to $130,000 by Q3 2025. ‚ÄúBTC is perfectly mimicking Gold‚Äôs rally. Gold also had a correction after hitting the new ATH, and the same happened with BTC. I think BTC will hit $125,000 to $130,000 by Q3 2025,‚Äù Pillows said. While the price patterns align, Bitcoin and gold remain fundamentally different. The precious metal is a centuries-old store of value, while Bitcoin is still evolving. Still, both have shown strong momentum in 2025. Bitcoin‚Äôs key price levels to watch Meanwhile, a separate analysis by RLinda , published on TradingView on July 7, highlighted key Bitcoin technical levels to monitor. She noted that BTC is recovering after a liquidity sweep of nearly $100,000, though the short-term outlook remains mixed. While the broader trend is bullish, the market is in a corrective phase with a bearish structure below key resistance. Bitcoin is currently testing the $105,900 and $106,720 zones. If buying momentum weakens, a rejection here could drop the price to $103,000. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView However, RLinda noted that a sustained move above $105,500 could revive bullish momentum and push prices toward $110,400, assuming support holds. Bitcoin price analysis By press time, Bitcoin was trading at $105,660, up 0.5% in the past 24 hours and nearly 1% over the past week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold The current price sits comfortably above its 50-day ($100,893) and 200-day ($87,224) simple moving averages ( SMA ), indicating continued bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) stands at 51.09, signaling neutral market conditions, with no immediate signs of the asset being overbought or oversold.

Trump confirmed he doesn‚Äôt plan to make up with Musk, saying bluntly, ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù when asked if he‚Äôd try to fix things. When asked whether their relationship is now done, he said, ‚ÄúI would assume so, yeah.‚Äù Just months ago, Musk was part of the administration. Now Trump is threatening him with punishment over political donations. Their public fight started earlier in the week on social media. Trump posted attacks on Truth Social, and Musk fired back on X. But the real tension started before that when Musk slammed the GOP-led spending bill that passed the House last month. Trump is backing the bill and trying to push it through the Senate before July 4. Trump says Musk disrespected the presidency In a follow-up question about their broken relationship, Trump said he‚Äôs too busy to even think about talking to Musk. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too busy doing other things,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI have no intention of speaking to him.‚Äù But he also made it clear this isn‚Äôt just about money or politics‚Äîit‚Äôs personal. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs a very bad thing because he‚Äôs very disrespectful. You could not disrespect the office of the President,‚Äù he said. That accusation came after Musk posted and later deleted several attacks on X, including one that pointed to old allegations linking Trump to Jeffrey Epstein. Trump brushed it off: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs called ‚Äòold news,‚Äô that‚Äôs been old news, that has been talked about for years. Even Epstein‚Äôs lawyer said I had nothing to do with it.‚Äù The blowup escalated when Trump, from the Oval Office, said on Thursday he was ‚Äúvery disappointed‚Äù in Musk, who he claimed knew the full details of the budget bill. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve helped Elon a lot,‚Äù he added. Shortly after that, Musk fired off a string of now-deleted posts, one calling for Trump to be impeached and another warning that his tariff policy would cause a recession later in the year. Trump then took to Truth Social, writing: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago.‚Äù He also claimed that Musk already knew what was in the budget and waited too long to criticize it. But his most aggressive shot was aimed at Musk‚Äôs government deals. ‚ÄúThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon‚Äôs Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,‚Äù Trump posted. ‚ÄúI was always surprised that Biden didn‚Äôt do it!‚Äù Trump denies investigations, still backs bill On Saturday, when asked if he planned to cancel any of Musk‚Äôs federal contracts, Trump said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be allowed to do that, but I have, I haven‚Äôt given it any thought.‚Äù The warning still stands, but Trump isn‚Äôt confirming if he‚Äôll actually follow through. There are louder voices outside the White House pushing for more. Steve Bannon, a longtime ally, has been calling for federal investigations into Musk‚Äôs immigration record and business activities. But when asked about it, Trump said he hasn‚Äôt had those discussions: ‚ÄúI mean it‚Äôs not something that‚Äôs on top of my mind right now.‚Äù Even with the clash playing out across headlines, Trump dismissed the idea that it could hurt his spending bill. He told NBC he was ‚Äúvery confident‚Äù the bill would pass in the Senate by July 4. ‚ÄúThe Republican Party has never been united like this before,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never been. It‚Äôs actually more so than it was three days ago.‚Äù What makes this feud more awkward is that Musk spent over $250 million last year helping Trump win the presidency. After the election, Trump gave him control of the Department of Government Efficiency, a role that led to mass layoffs and several agency shutdowns. But even with all that history, their partnership has collapsed. In the final part of his interview , Trump gave one more jab. He said Musk‚Äôs meltdown may have ended up helping his bill. ‚ÄúI think, actually, Elon brought out the strengths of the bill because people that weren‚Äôt as focused started focusing on it, and they see how good it is,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo in that sense, there was a big favor. But I think Elon, really, I think it‚Äôs a shame that he‚Äôs so depressed and so heartbroken.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Money is flowing out of well-known projects like Polygon (MATIC) and into the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. The crypto market has noticed this trend, raising interest in Mutuum Finance (MTM) to an all-time high. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is Making Waves The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project has become one of the most popular crypto projects in June 2025 as investors rush to claim their share. So far, it has garnered over 20k followers across its social media channels. One of the main reasons for this rising interest is the ongoing $100,000 giveaway . Mutuum Finance plans to give 10 lucky winners $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. To participate in this giveaway, participants must purchase a minimum of $50 worth of MUTM tokens in the ongoing presale. The Beta Version Update Another reason for the rising interest in Mutuum Finance is the recent announcement that they would launch a beta version of the platform on the token listing day. Currently in the presale, this announcement spurred heightened interest in the presale, which has now raised over $10.1 million. Launching the beta version of the platform is expected to increase buying pressure on the MUTM tokens after they go live. Additionally, it is expected to increase the popularity of the project, as people will be able to test the platform‚Äôs features and report on them. The planned beta version release will also boost confidence in the project, as it will showcase that the team is working hard on their vision. CertiK Audit Results Another reason for the growing discussions around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the results of the recent CertiK audit. In the DeFi sector, one of the most important tests required to earn the trust of the crypto community is the CertiK report. Having successfully passed the audit, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now has a clear path to become one of the most widely used DeFi protocols once it goes live. CoinMarketCap Listing Another important milestone for the project was achieved when it was listed on CoinMarketCap. The listing will increase the project‚Äôs visibility and could help push up the price of MUTM tokens once they go live. It will provide an easy means through which to track various metrics of the token, making it easier for people to make buying decisions. The CoinMarketCap listing is also going to boost confidence in the project. When researching new projects, one of the main tools that crypto investors use is the platform. If a project is not listed on the platform, it may cause investors to have second thoughts. The reason for this is that projects listed on the platform must undergo a rigorous inspection process to ensure they are genuine. Details OF The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed as a decentralized, non-custodial lending protocol where users can participate as borrowers, lenders, or liquidators. When a user joins the protocol as a lender, they deposit assets and begin to earn interest. Borrowers can then deposit collateral to access those funds. The interest that lenders earn is determined by the pool utilization rate. As more borrowers join a pool, the interest rate that lenders earn goes up. When that happens, it incentivizes borrowers to pay back their debt, while also causing more lenders to join. That action pools down the utilization rate, which is a measure of the total funds in a pool versus the amount that is borrowed. Overall, this creates conditions for maximum capital efficiency. Fair Price Discovery On Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Fair pricing is critical for Mutuum Finance to achieve maximum capital efficiency. In line with this, the protocol plans to use reliable price oracles to determine pricing. The primary pricing oracle will be Chainlink data feeds, widely used in the Defi sector. Additionally, the protocol will include fallback oracles, which will provide alternative data feeds in case the main oracle goes down for any reason. The team also plans to integrate aggregate feeds by combining multiple price oracles, reducing dependency on one source of data. Mutuum Finance also plans to use on-chain metrics to determine pricing when there is sufficient liquidity. To do this, the platform will use DEX price data, which will include time-weighted price averages. This will serve as an extra source of price references to ensure the best pricing possible on the platform. The Mutuum Finance platform is clearly designed to be a fair and reliable protocol that offers numerous unique features for all its users. For those who are fortunate enough to discover it during the presale phase, when the price is $0.03 per token, joining now could lead to massive gains in the future.

After a sharp retrace alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana is stabilizing above key demand levels, sparking cautious optimism among investors. Many are eyeing this zone as a potential launchpad for the next leg up, especially as the market seeks to recover and regain bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Largest Net Taker Volume Drop Of 2025 ‚Äì Traders React To Trump-Elon Clash Despite recent uncertainty, sentiment around Solana remains constructive. Analysts point to strong structural support and a history of sharp rebounds from similar technical setups. Among them, top crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a key signal that has caught the attention of traders: the TD Sequential indicator has flashed a buy signal for Solana on the daily timeframe. Historically, this signal has preceded notable price rallies, particularly when it aligns with strong support zones. With Solana holding firm and broader sentiment gradually improving, bulls are watching closely for a push into higher supply zones. If confirmed, a breakout from this range could send SOL toward new short-term highs. The coming days will be critical in determining whether Solana can sustain this momentum and lead the next altcoin rally. Solana Tests Support As TD Sequential Signals Rebound Solana is holding a critical support zone near $145 after shedding more than 20% of its value since late May. The correction has brought SOL into a key demand area, where bulls appear to be defending the level with strength. Despite attempts to reclaim $160, the altcoin has faced persistent resistance, with fading momentum and rising macro risks clouding short-term price action. Market-wide conditions haven‚Äôt helped either. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have stalled below key resistance zones, failing to spark a broader rally in altcoins. This hesitation has intensified uncertainty, with some analysts calling for a deeper retracement in SOL if market leaders continue to slide. However, others remain optimistic that Solana could soon turn the tide. A key signal for Solana has emerged, with analyst Martinez reporting that the TD Sequential indicator printed a buy signal on the daily chart. Historically, this indicator has been a reliable precursor to significant local bottoms and bullish reversals, particularly when seen near strong support levels. With SOL recently experiencing a selloff and now stabilizing, this signal underscores the growing bullish potential. For now, Solana‚Äôs ability to hold above $145 will be key. A bounce from this level, combined with improving sentiment across large-cap assets, could trigger a fresh push toward $160 and beyond. If confirmed, such a move would signal that SOL is regaining strength and ready to retest higher resistance levels in the weeks ahead. Related Reading: Ethereum Stabilizes After Market Drop ‚Äì Key MA Reclaim Could Trigger A June Rally SOL Retests Support After Prolonged Correction Solana (SOL) is trading at $148.44 after attempting a modest rebound from its recent local low near $145. The daily chart shows that SOL has lost momentum since peaking above $180 in late May, marking a 20% correction. Price is now holding just above the 100-day moving average (144.68), a key technical level that previously acted as support during consolidation phases. The 50-day and 34-day moving averages are now trending downward, with the 50-day SMA around $159.33 and the 34-day EMA near $159.35 ‚Äî both acting as dynamic resistance. Meanwhile, the 200-day SMA remains higher at $177.49, reinforcing the presence of a strong overhead supply zone between $160 and $180. Despite the bearish pressure, volume has remained relatively muted during the recent drop, suggesting that panic selling hasn‚Äôt taken over yet. If SOL manages to hold above the $144‚Äì$145 region, this could form the base for a rebound, especially if broader market sentiment improves.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!‚Äù This will be the first face-to-face negotiation since the two sides temporarily relaxed tariffs after talks in Geneva last month. According to CNBC, the meeting will include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who will represent the U.S. delegation. Trump announced these renewed discussions shortly after his Thursday phone call with Xi, a conversation that reportedly lasted long and covered unresolved trade tensions. These talks are taking place while both countries remain stuck in a long-running economic fight. Although trade in goods between them reached $582 billion last year, diplomatic trust is still missing. Beijing and Washington point fingers after Geneva promises stall After last month‚Äôs agreement in Switzerland, China accused the U.S. of walking back from what had been decided. Specifically, Beijing objected when the U.S. Commerce Department told American companies to stay away from Chinese semiconductors. In another move that added pressure, Trump‚Äôs administration announced it would start revoking visas for some Chinese students studying in the U.S. That move triggered more protests from Beijing, which said Washington was intentionally escalating tensions. On the other side, Trump‚Äôs team claimed China failed to deliver on a promise made during the Geneva meetings‚Äîmainly the pledge to approve additional exports of rare earth minerals. The U.S. wants those materials for high-tech industries, but shipments haven‚Äôt come. After Thursday‚Äôs call, Trump posted, ‚ÄúThere should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products,‚Äù though he didn‚Äôt explain what he meant by that.

And one of the strongest signs of growing investor confidence is wallet activity. That‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . With over 11,700 wallets now holding MUTM tokens, this sudden explosion in user growth is sounding alarms across the crypto space. Traders, whales, and DeFi enthusiasts are rushing to accumulate at the current presale price of just $0.03. With Phase 5 underway and more than $10.10 million already raised, the math and momentum are aligning toward a 15x surge‚Äîand that‚Äôs just the beginning. Early Backers Already Sitting on 200% Gains Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched its presale at $0.01. Fast forward to Phase 5, and the price has reached $0.03‚Äîa full 200% increase from the initial round. Investors who stepped in early have already tripled their capital. And while those gains are impressive, what‚Äôs more important now is that the window to capture similar returns is rapidly narrowing. As the project moves closer to its public launch and platform rollout, the profit margins between phases shrink. Waiting for the token to list before jumping in would mean entering at a much higher cost, making this moment an ideal entry point for those looking to capture the biggest upside. Passive Income That Works While You Sleep One of the strongest reasons why more wallets are flocking to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the ability to earn passive income through real DeFi utility when the platform goes live. Users will be able to deposit popular assets such as ETH or DAI into the protocol‚Äôs smart lending pools and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens will automatically grow in value as borrowers pay interest, offering a yield-generating alternative to traditional HODLing. For example, depositing $1,000 worth of ETH into the protocol at current utilization rates will generate an annual passive return of approximately 7% to 12%, all while the original ETH remains safe and untouched in the system. Mutuum Finance is also gaining attention for its projected dual-lending model‚ÄîPeer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). While P2C offers stable, automated lending using liquidity pools for assets like ETH, BNB, and stablecoins, the P2P model unlocks something entirely different. Users will be able to lend and borrow tokens that traditional platforms avoid, including memecoins like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB. This will open up untapped markets and give users the flexibility to work with a wider variety of assets‚Äîall while earning or borrowing with more favorable terms. Layer-2 Speed and Low Fees Make It More Attractive One of the technical breakthroughs that‚Äôs boosting Mutuum Finance‚Äôs adoption is its upcoming Layer-2 integration. This architecture drastically reduces transaction costs and speeds up operations, solving one of DeFi‚Äôs biggest challenges‚Äînetwork congestion. Users no longer have to deal with high gas fees or delays when moving assets or executing smart contract functions. The result is a faster, cheaper, and more user-friendly experience that stands out in a crowded DeFi field. Security is non-negotiable in crypto, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has taken the right steps to earn user trust. The project underwent a thorough smart contract audit conducted by CertiK, a leading blockchain security firm. The audit, which included both manual review and static analysis, returned a Token Scan Score of 80, indicating a high level of protocol integrity and developer transparency. For new users entering the space, this offers an extra layer of assurance that their assets and data are protected. Future Utility Through a Decentralized Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is also working on launching a fully overcollateralized, decentralized stablecoin, which will be minted using assets already held within the protocol. This innovation eliminates the need for centralized reserves and enhances transparency. The stablecoin will offer a more reliable borrowing option while feeding interest revenue back into the ecosystem, boosting returns for MUTM token holders and reinforcing long-term sustainability. Let‚Äôs say an investor puts in $1,000 at the current price of $0.03 per MUTM token. That translates to roughly 33,333 tokens. When Mutuum Finance (MUTM) reaches a 15x price milestone, that same investment turns into $15,000. With this kind of realistic projection‚Äîand considering the rising number of users joining daily‚Äîthere‚Äôs a clear signal that the current price offers significant upside for those who act fast. As a cherry on top, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to launch a beta version of its lending and borrowing platform at the time of token go-live. This means early holders will not only benefit from price growth but will also be among the first to use and earn from the actual product. Additionally, the team is running an ongoing $100,000 giveaway , rewarding users and building stronger community engagement as it heads into the next development stage.

Recent developments in the DeFi landscape have spotlighted Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has witnessed a remarkable increase in wallet counts to over 11,700. This surge has occurred as the project progresses through its presale phases, currently priced at an enticing $0.03. The phase-wise fundraising has successfully amassed over $10.10 million, aligning the trajectory towards a potential 15x increase in value. Significant Gains for Early Investors Launching initially at a mere $0.01 per token, early backers of MUTM have seen a substantial 200% gain as the token price has escalated to $0.03 in Phase 5. This gain underscores the shrinking window of opportunity for new investors seeking comparable profits before the public launch, making the present a prime time for investment. Maximizing Returns: The Allure of Passive Income Mutuum Finance not only promises substantial direct gains but also offers an attractive passive income model. Upon its platform's activation, users can deposit assets like ETH or DAI to receive mtTokens, which accrue value as borrowers pay interest‚Äîfacilitating earnings between 7% and 12% annually on deposited sums. Innovative Lending Models to Capture Diverse Markets The dual-lending approach of Mutuum Finance, encompassing both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models, broadens its appeal. The P2C model is designed for stable, automated lending, while the P2P model caters to a variety of tokens, including memecoins like DOGE and SHIB, thus tapping into previously unexplored market segments. Enhancing User Experience with Layer-2 Solutions The integration of Layer-2 solutions marks a significant stride in enhancing the DeFi experience by mitigating common issues like high fees and network delays. This technical advancement positions Mutuum Finance as a user-friendly platform poised for rapid growth. Security and Trust in DeFi Investments Recognizing the importance of security, Mutuum Finance has undergone rigorous auditing by CertiK, which confirms a high level of security and protocol integrity with a Token Scan Score of 80. This reassurance is crucial for attracting new users who prioritize asset and data protection. Looking Forward: The Role of a Decentralized Stablecoin The impending launch of a decentralized stablecoin by Mutuum Finance could revolutionize borrowing practices while enhancing the overall ecosystem's profitability and sustainability. This development is anticipated to bolster the long-term value of MUTM tokens. With a rapidly increasing user base and a promising array of features, Mutuum Finance stands at the cusp of potentially huge gains. The $100,000 giveaway adds an extra layer of excitement, auguring well for community engagement as the platform transitions to the next stage of its development.

On June 6, ETFs tied to Ether attracted another $25.3 million in inflows, according to data from Farside. This marked the third straight week of uninterrupted gains. Momentum Builds Since Mid-May The inflow streak began on May 16 and has now totaled $837.5 million. That figure accounts for about 25% of the $3.32 billion in net inflows since Ether ETFs launched in July 2024. If current momentum continues, another $162.5 million in inflows would push the streak past the $1 billion mark. By contrast, Bitcoin ETFs saw their own streak broken on May 29, when they recorded outflows totaling $346.8 million. Bitcoin ETF flows have since been mixed, showing both inflow and outflow days. Ether, meanwhile, has enjoyed strong price performance. Its price rose more than 31% over the last 30 days, currently trading around $2,490, according to CoinMarketCap. Technical Signals Point to $6K Potential Analysts remain optimistic about Ether‚Äôs long-term trajectory. Crypto Eagles, a well-followed technical analyst, suggested on June 3 that Ether‚Äôs current cycle mirrors past price patterns, possibly setting the stage for a rally toward $6,000. Ether last hit its all-time high of $4,878 in November 2021, per CoinGecko. Some market watchers believe that incorporating staking into spot Ether ETFs could be the next major development. This enhancement could significantly boost their competitiveness and investor appeal. Staking ETFs May Be on the Horizon Recent developments suggest staking options could soon arrive in the U.S. market. ETF provider REX Shares has filed to launch both Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst, noted that REX used regulatory workarounds in an effort to bring these products to market. While no official launch date has been set, expectations are building.

Many traders argue that without a fresh catalyst, DOGE could struggle to move beyond this threshold. As a result, prudent investors are scouting for projects with stronger fundamentals and clearer paths to substantial gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one such opportunity. Priced at $0.03 on presale phase 5, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a strategy to outpace Dogecoin (DOGE)‚Äôs hype, guided by real utility and passive income potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A DeFi Game-Changer Awaits Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that will empower users to lend, borrow, or liquidate assets. It will leverage two distinct lending models: pool-based (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). In the P2C structure, depositors will supply assets into shared liquidity pools, earning yields that will adjust automatically with demand. In the P2P environment, participants will negotiate direct loans using tokens often excluded from standard pools, such as memecoins like PEPE, DOGE, and SHIB. This flexibility will draw conservative lenders and high-volatility traders alike, expanding the platform‚Äôs addressable market well beyond most DeFi competitors. At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be the MUTM token. With a total supply of 4,000,000,000 tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched its presale at $0.01. Today, MUTM trades at $0.03 in Phase 5, delivering a 200% gain for early participants. Over $10.10 million has been raised so far, and more than 11,700 holders back the project. Entering now at $0.03 means capturing the last low-tier pricing before Phase 6 raises the price to $0.035. Later phases push MUTM through $0.04, $0.045, and beyond, shrinking the window for outsized returns. Experts forecast a 20x move that brings MUTM nearer to $0.60, a far more attainable target than Dogecoin (DOGE)‚Äôs uncertain rally. A $1,750 investment at $0.03 secures 58,333 MUTM tokens, which become $35,000 when the price hits $0.60. Layer-2 Power: Lightning-Fast, Low-Cost Transactions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will distinguish itself with Layer-2 integration, solving two key DeFi pain points: high fees and slow confirmation times. While Dogecoin (DOGE)‚Äôs network continues to draw fans, it will lack the infrastructure to match the speed and cost-efficiency of a well-built Layer-2 solution. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs choice of Layer-2 will ensure that users experience seamless, near-instant transactions without worrying about surging gas fees. In a market where impatience costs money, this technical edge will amplify user satisfaction and foster sustained growth. Beyond lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin backed entirely by on-chain assets locked within the protocol. Unlike traditional stablecoins that rely on centralized reserves or fiat collateral, Mutuum‚Äôs stable asset will use algorithmic supply adjustments to maintain a transparent dollar peg. Interest paid on stablecoin loans is redirected into the protocol‚Äôs treasury, reinforcing sustainability and enhancing the value flow within the ecosystem. This stablecoin provides users with reliable, decentralized access to dollar-equivalent liquidity, while adding a powerful new utility layer to the MUTM token. CertiK Audit Passed: Building Trust and Transparency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) earned trust through a comprehensive CertiK audit. Employing manual code review and static analysis, the audit granted Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a TokenScan score of 80.00. Requested on February 25, 2025, and revised on May 20, 2025, this thorough review confirms that core contracts perform as intended. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also majorly completed Phase 1 milestones, including the presale launch, community-building marketing campaigns, ongoing $100,000 giveaway , listing on major tracking platforms, and the implementation of an AI-powered helpdesk. Educational content detailing Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs principles and algorithm is on the way to achieve. Dogecoin (DOGE) investors may watch its price hover around $0.20 for months. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) trades under $0.03 and offers both yield and growth potential. Each presale phase narrows the discount window: Phase 6 at $0.035 and Phase 7 at $0.04 push the price higher, reducing upside for latecomers. The ongoing giveaway fuels FOMO, drawing new users daily. At $0.03, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at a sweet spot where buyers secure cheap tokens, collect passive income through staking mtTokens, and join a vibrant community. As development hits key milestones, demand for MUTM will multiply, driving price appreciation and rewarding those who act now. Conclusion: A Clear Path to 20x Returns Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out from the hype cycle of meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE). Its dual lending model serves broad market segments, offering real yields that range from 9% to 11% on assets like SOL and BNB. Layer-2 integration ensures fast, low-cost transactions, while a forthcoming decentralized stablecoin strengthens the ecosystem and expands token utility. With over $10.10 million raised, more than 11,700 holders, and a CertiK audit confirming protocol security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a compelling value proposition. At $0.03, joining today secures the potential for a 20x move to $0.60. Investors who pivot to MUTM now lock in a cleaner path to major gains, leaving Dogecoin (DOGE)‚Äôs uncertain rally behind. Endeavor to be part of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs story before the next presale phase closes the window on cheap entry.

With developments slowing without new catalysts, investors are turning their attention to emerging projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in its promising presale phase priced at just $0.03. An Introduction to Mutuum Finance's Innovative DeFi Model Mutuum Finance aims to reshape the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape with its non-custodial liquidity protocol which allows for lending, borrowing, and asset liquidation. It introduces two lending models to cater to diverse investor needs: pool-based and peer-to-peer lending. In the peer-to-peer model, users can directly negotiate loans, offering more flexibility with assets including popular memecoins like PEPE and SHIB. The core of the Mutuum ecosystem is built around the MUTM token, boasting a robust supply aimed at fostering growth and adoption. The ongoing presale has already seen significant interest, with the token price appreciating to $0.03, offering early investors substantial returns. Technological Edge: The Role of Layer-2 Solutions In an era where transaction speed and fees determine user retention and satisfaction, Mutuum Finance integrates Layer-2 solutions to offer near-instant transactions at lower costs. This strategic decision positions Mutuum well above many traditional and contemporary DeFi platforms, including Dogecoin, which lacks such infrastructural enhancements. Building Trust: The CertiK Audit Security and transparency are paramount in gaining investor confidence. Mutuum Finance has successfully passed a comprehensive audit by CertiK, achieving a commendable TokenScan score of 80.00. This not only elevates the project's reliability but also assures potential investors of its robustness. Amidst its strategic developments, Mutuum also boasts a community-centric approach, which includes a $100,000 giveaway , fueling further engagement and investment from the community. Why Mutuum Finance Could Outshine Dogecoin With Dogecoin's trajectory becoming more uncertain, Mutuum Finance offers a clearer and potentially more profitable path. Its innovative lending options, combined with strategic technological adoption and strong community engagement initiatives, present a compelling case for investors looking for substantial returns. Investing in Mutuum at the current presale price could secure significant future gains, making it an attractive alternative for those disillusioned with Dogecoin's slow movement.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse recently underscored this in a video clip shared by prominent XRP advocate Amelie on X. Speaking candidly, Garlinghouse laid out how XRP is not just another crypto asset, it‚Äôs a tool designed to solve a real, global problem: the inefficiencies of cross-border payments. Real-Time Liquidity Across Borders Garlinghouse explained XRP‚Äôs utility within Ripple‚Äôs On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform by offering a straightforward but powerful use case. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about payment flow that might be going from dollar to Mexican Peso and you‚Äôre holding a dollar, you‚Äôre selling that dollar and buying XRP. You‚Äôre moving that XRP across XRP Ledger to let‚Äôs say, Bitso, you‚Äôre selling the XRP and you‚Äôre buying Mexican Peso,‚Äù he said. WOW! RIPPLE CEO BRAD GARLINGHOUSE: ‚Äû #XRP IS THE ONLY DIGITAL ASSET POISED TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AT SCALE, A GLOBAL PAYMENTS PROBLEM!‚Äú pic.twitter.com/vg60eVOZeB ‚Äî ùìêùì∂ùìÆùìµùì≤ùìÆ (@_Crypto_Barbie) June 6, 2025 This process, executed in real time, cuts out the delays and costs associated with traditional correspondent banking. According to Garlinghouse, ‚ÄúBy enabling that liquidity to move from dollar to Peso in real time, you‚Äôre changing how the oil is greasing the engine of correspondent banking.‚Äù This model eliminates the need for pre-funded accounts and multiple intermediaries. Instead, XRP acts as a neutral bridge currency that ensures instant, cost-effective conversion between fiat pairs. In practical terms, this reduces settlement times from days to seconds and significantly lowers capital requirements for financial institutions. XRP in a World of Hype Garlinghouse also took aim at the broader crypto landscape, where countless projects promise transformation but deliver little in terms of real-world application. Ripple‚Äôs focus, he emphasized, is different. ‚ÄúSo for us, in a world of hype, in a world of experimentation, in a world where people talk more about opportunity and really the speculation of digital assets, we feel XRP is the only digital asset really poised to solve a problem at scale, a global payment problem,‚Äù he stated. This isn‚Äôt a vision based on potential alone. Ripple has spent years building infrastructure that addresses the pain points in international money movement, high fees, slow settlements, and lack of transparency. XRP is the linchpin of that infrastructure, enabling seamless value exchange across borders. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Real Usage, Real Partners Garlinghouse‚Äôs remarks reflect what Ripple is already doing on the ground. In Latin America, Ripple has Bitso, one of the region‚Äôs largest crypto exchanges, to power the U.S.‚ÄìMexico ODL corridor. Institutions are actively using this corridor to move millions of dollars every week without the need for pre-funding or third-party intermediaries. Ripple has also expanded ODL corridors in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond, working with financial institutions and remittance companies that want faster, cheaper, and more transparent cross-border services. With each new corridor, Ripple is turning XRP into a tool of real economic value, not just a speculative asset. XRP: Positioned for Real-World Impact Garlinghouse‚Äôs words cut through the noise. Unlike many digital assets that exist in a world of future potential and unfulfilled promises, XRP is actively being used to solve a decades-old problem in global finance . It‚Äôs fast, cost-efficient, regulatory-compliant, and already integrated into real-world payment flows. Ripple‚Äôs vision is ambitious yet grounded in execution. By making cross-border payments as seamless as sending an email, XRP is redefining the value of digital assets. Under Garlinghouse‚Äôs leadership, Ripple continues to push toward a financial future powered not by hype, but by utility. And in Garlinghouse‚Äôs own words, that‚Äôs exactly what sets XRP apart: it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe only digital asset really poised to solve a problem at scale, a global payment problem.‚Äù Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Mask Network ( MASK ), a privacy-focused token, rose to $3.6766, and then erased those gains and moved towards $2. On-chain data shows that the whale transaction count jumped. Santiment data shows that these transactions jumped to 26, its highest point since May 28. A deeper dive reveals that these whales are selling the Mask token. The supply of held by whales dropped to 28.26 million on Friday, the lowest level on record.

The 180-day figure dropped to 29.6, down from 50 in May, while the 365-day figure plunged to 38 from 70. The MDIA figure looks at the average age of all coins weighted by their purchase price in US dollar terms. A falling figure is usually a bearish sign for a cryptocurrency. The other bearish sign for the Mask Network is its negative funding rate in the past few days. This happens when more traders are shorting an asset and are thus paying bullish ones a small fee.

It dropped below the key support at $2.50, the highest swing on April 1. The Relative Strength Index tilted downwards, moving from a high of 80 to 54. Therefore, the token will likely continue falling as sellers attempt to move below $2 and the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Sustained selling may see it drop to $0.9475, the lowest point in April.

But with Pump.fun raising $1 billion to launch its own token, things might get heated once more. The resulting boom looks set to uplift both BONK and TRUMP, helping them overcome current travails. Does this make them the best coins to invest in? Let's find out. Pump.fun's token launch turbocharges Solana meme ecosystem Pump.fun transformed the Solana meme landscape by allowing users to create and deploy their own meme tokens at any time. No fundraising or research required. Launched a little over a year ago, it has made giant strides and is now taking things to a new level with a token launch. According to reports from Blockworks , Pump.fun's plan is to raise $1 billion at a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $4 billion for its new token. This event would be open to public and private investors, and it has generated a lot of chatter around the crypto space. Industry watchers expect this to be a high-profile event that would inject life into an ailing meme coin market. Solana meme coins like BONK and TRUMP are also expected to benefit the most from the presale since Pump.fun caters majorly to this crypto niche. TRUMP struggles to hold onto key support level The Trump coin launched with much fanfare and aplomb in January. It pays homage to US President Donald Trump and spiked above $45 immediately after its launch. However, TRUMPsuffered a quick correction which saw the meme coin drop to $30. Trump coin price chart. Source: CoinGecko The following economic headwind created by tariff wars pushed TRUMP and other meme coins further down. Over the next months, TRUMP lost more ground and is now struggling to hold onto a key $10 support level. But given the controversies around TRUMP and the confusion around the official TRUMPwallet launch, it's unlikely that Trump coin will hold onto this support level. Meme coins rely on hype and positive sentiments to boom. Bad publicity like this often affects their prices negatively. BONK price prediction: Is there light at the end of the tunnel? Bonk coin has endured a torrid 2025, depreciating by over 70% as Solana meme coins felt the brunt of bearish market sentiments. Over the last couple of months, BONK's price appreciated steadfastly but hit a wall around $0.000025 and came tumbling down. BONK price chart over the last month. Source: CoinGecko Due to this weak performance, BONK price predictions aren't encouraging. This is in spite of BONK dropping a 'kill-to-earn' FPS game on Solana. Meme popularity has tanked and unless Pump.fun's token launch sparks renewed interest in this phenomenon, BONK is quite vulnerable to further drops. The bottom line - BONK or TRUMP? Although the future looks a little bleak for BONK and TRUMP, Pump.fun's momentum could turn things around for them. Both tokens are quite popular and only need a bit of positivity to return back to winning ways. The major drawback is that they are meme coins and have little to no utility. They have little control over their fortunes and are highly vulnerable to market forces. Extreme caution is recommended for those willing to take a bet on them‚Äì or better still, invest in trailblazing tokens with a real-world use case like Remittix (RTX) instead. Remittix focuses solely on transforming cross-border payments, touting an ingenious PayFiprotocol that allows anyone to send crypto as fiat, from wallets to traditional bank accounts worldwide. This is a groundbreaking feature, and that is why Remittix is heading to the top. Its presale is highly contested, with half a billion tokens sold already.

Two such cryptocurrencies, BONK and Trump Coin (TRUMP) based on the Solana network, have been making waves, albeit facing challenges in maintaining their market positions. The Challenge Ahead for BONK and TRUMP Initially, these coins enjoyed robust support and quick recognition within the crypto community. However, as the novelty fades, sustaining investor interest and value becomes a significant challenge. BONK and Trump Coin, despite their initial surge, have found it increasingly difficult to hold onto their strong support zones. New Developments with Pump.fun Amid these market challenges, there's a new development poised to inject some excitement back into the Solana meme coin ecosystem. Pump.fun, a platform celebrated for its innovative approach in the meme coin sector, has announced a daring $1 billion token launch. This move is not just a significant financial undertaking but also a strategic push that could revitalize interest and investment in meme coins like BONK and TRUMP. According to Blockworks , this upcoming token sale by Pump.fun has set a target that could potentially raise its valuation to $4 billion, indicating a substantial confidence boost for associated Solana meme coins. Market Impact and Investor Sentiment This new development is anticipated to have a considerable impact on the market, possibly reversing the downward trend faced by BONK and Trump Coin. As platforms like Pump.fun continue to innovate and attract investment, the supporting ecosystem for meme coins could see renewed vigor and potentially lucrative returns for early investors. Scrutinizing Trump Coin's Market Position Trump Coin, in particular, has seen its fair share of volatility. Released with significant fanfare, its value surged initially but later faced corrections amidst broader market fluctuations and external economic factors. The coin's value has been further pressured by controversies and confusion about its management and direction, especially with the reported confusion surrounding its official wallet launch . Future Prospects for BONK BONK, on the other hand, has not been immune to challenges either. The coin's value has depreciated significantly, reflecting the broader bearish sentiment in the crypto market. Nevertheless, the coin managed a brief recovery, showing some resilience and potential for growth, albeit hitting resistance points. BONK's recent initiatives, including launching a 'kill-to-earn' FPS game on Solana, attempt to diversify its appeal and utility in the blockchain space, aiming to transcend beyond the typical meme coin narrative. Investment Considerations While the allure of meme coins can be attractive, they represent a high-risk investment category with high volatility and often speculative interest. For those looking deeper into the crypto space, innovative platforms like Remittix offer an alternative with their focus on transforming cross-border payments.

Ripple (XRP) holds strong at $2.20 amid bullish market sentiment Ripple (XRP) is trading at $2.20, maintaining its position above the critical $2.00 support level. This stability is underpinned by renewed investor optimism, fueled by ongoing ETF speculation and increased whale accumulation between $2.20 and $2.40. Analysts suggest that a breakout above the $2.50‚Äì$2.60 resistance zone could propel XRP toward $5.00, especially if favorable developments, such as ETF approvals, materialize.

With decentralised finance evolving and real-world asset tokenisation gaining traction, ONDO is gaining renewed attention. But while ONDO sets the stage for steady long-term growth, another name is turning heads with explosive short-term potential‚Äî Qubetics . Experts analyzing market trends, tokenomics, and macroeconomic influences suggest a cautiously optimistic trajectory for ONDO. According to these forecasts, Ondo price prediction 2030 points to an average price of $6.68 by the decade‚Äôs end. While volatility is expected, this figure represents a significant rise compared to current levels, indicating strong potential for long-term buyers. ONDO‚Äôs Monthly Price Forecast for 2030 The journey to an average of $6.68 by December doesn‚Äôt happen overnight. The year 2030 could start with relatively modest price action, with January‚Äôs minimum price predicted to be around $4.68 and its maximum at $5.75. This pattern of steady growth is projected to continue month after month. In February, ONDO may trade between $4.84 and $5.94, while in March, price expectations grow with forecasts between $5.01 and $6.13. As we progress into the second quarter, April might see ONDO reach as high as $6.32, and by May, the token could range from $5.34 to $6.51. The upward momentum doesn‚Äôt stop there. June and July 2030 suggest continued growth, with July showing a possible peak price of $6.89. August could be the month where ONDO breaks past the $7 barrier, touching a high of $7.08 while maintaining an average of $6. By September, things get even more interesting. Analysts predict a maximum of $7.27 and a minimum of $6. This consistent pattern of gains sets the tone for the last quarter of the year, which appears to be the most bullish. Final Quarter Surge: Bullish Sentiment Grows Stronger The final stretch of 2030 could be particularly rewarding for ONDO holders. October might bring a peak price of $7.46, followed by November pushing toward $7.65. If this bullish trend holds, December 2030 could mark a climactic end to the year with ONDO trading between $6.50 and $7.84. This bullish year-end outlook aligns with the broader Ondo price prediction 2030, where the token‚Äôs long-term fundamentals are expected to attract more institutional and retail attention. The increasing use of Ondo‚Äôs services in tokenized assets, secure DeFi protocols, and digital securities infrastructure may also contribute to this forecasted price rise. Qubetics: The Breakout Star of 2025? The Qubetics crypto presale is currently in its 37th stage, having sold over 515 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,500 holders. With over $17.7 million already raised, buyers can still grab TICS tokens at just $0.3370. And while Ondo price prediction 2030 projects impressive growth over time, Qubetics offers immediate and staggering return potential. While ONDO continues building its foundation for the long term, Qubetics is surging ahead with aggressive growth in 2025. The presale is attracting thousands thanks to its unique asset tokenization model and zero-gas transaction ecosystem. And the numbers don‚Äôt lie: $17.7M+ in total funds raised Final 10M tokens available at $0.3370 Price increase to $0.40 upon listing (20% gain) Supply slashed to 1.36B; 38.55% for public sale Analyst outlook: Major gains likely after exchange launch These analyst projections suggest that TICS could offer multi-fold returns even before ONDO touches its expected average price. That said, both assets target different audiences‚ÄîONDO appeals to those seeking long-term decentralised finance stability, while Qubetics caters to buyers hungry for explosive early-stage gains. Final Thoughts on Ondo Price Prediction 2030 While no forecast can guarantee accuracy in a market as dynamic as crypto, the current Ondo price prediction 2030 paints a compelling picture. With a projected average price of $6.68 and a potential high of $7.84, ONDO has solid prospects for the long-term buyer. As always, doing your own research and considering your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions is essential. But Ondo might be a name worth watching closely for those looking ahead to 2030.

Arca no Longer Accepts USDC Jeff Dorman, Arca‚Äôs Chief Investment Officer, announced the new development on X. Going forward, Arca will no longer accept USDC as it closes all of its accounts with Circle. According to Dorman, the investment firm will inform every dealer it works with of this development. He had posted an unscathed open letter the day before criticising Circle for giving the investment firm a ‚Äúthrowaway‚Äù allocation in the recently listed IPO. Dornam highlighted that his firm had written to the stablecoin issuer in April 2025, requesting $10 million in Circle shares. Arca Receives $135,000 Allocation From Circle IPO Upon going public and listing under the ticker symbol CRCL, Arca received only a $135,000 allocation. The investment firm is irked by this, as it has been a long-time supporter of the stablecoin issuer and one of the earliest investors to submit a bid. Dorman made sure to express his displeasure. ‚ÄúWe pinged you separately two months ago, indicating our order, and you thanked us for the support,‚Äù the Arca executive vented. ‚ÄúIf you were going to f[***] us at the end, the least you could have done was tell us two months ago so we didn‚Äôt waste our analysts‚Äô and ops teams‚Äô time on a deal that you had no intention of allocating shares to us.‚Äù Circle IPO Go Listed on NYSE Circle‚Äôs IPO is significant for the broader crypto market, especially as the second-largest stablecoin issuer. It also marks progress in the regulatory landscape of the crypto ecosystem. The company‚Äôs stock, trading under the ticker CRCL, was listed on the NYSE on June 5, 2025. This was in addition to announcing its plans to create a seamless value exchange using products like USDC, EURC, and Circle Payments. The stock‚Äôs orders went up 25 times more than the available shares. As a result of this high demand, the stablecoin issuer raised its IPO price to $31 per share.

Their split‚Äîreportedly triggered by disagreements over Trump‚Äôs tax policies‚Äîhas cast a shadow over the White House‚Äôs agenda and the fragile partnership between Washington and Silicon Valley. Senator Ted Cruz, present during a fiery Oval Office moment, voiced regret and encouraged both sides to ‚Äúmake up.‚Äù Musk, who had attacked Trump earlier in the week, appeared open to peace talks, reacting positively to hedge fund manager Bill Ackman‚Äôs call for unity. Trump, however, played down the conflict on CNN, suggesting he was no longer thinking about Musk but wished him well. The fallout came as the president promoted his economic record and called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates following underwhelming job data. Behind the scenes, prominent tech leaders are scrambling to contain the damage. One Republican donor said Musk is avoiding calls‚Äîeven from investors with billions tied to his companies. The situation worsened after Trump reportedly decided to offload his Tesla vehicle and dismissed rumors of a reconciliatory call with Musk. Billionaire Tim Draper, an investor in Tesla and SpaceX, urged both men to revive a joint government efficiency initiative once praised in tech circles. Yet frustrations over Trump‚Äôs tax bill had already been bubbling. Critics in the tech sector argue it threatens social programs while piling on national debt, leaving many disillusioned. The political split may also jeopardize the roles of Musk allies in government. Jared Isaacman‚Äôs removal from a NASA nomination sparked concerns about a broader purge. Others potentially at risk include crypto and AI advisor David Sacks, policy aide Sriram Krishnan, and Michael Grimes from the Commerce Department. Sacks, known for his vocal presence on social media, has gone silent. As the dust settles, some predict a Musk comeback. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be back, but more cautious,‚Äù said crypto figure Ryan Selkis. Others like Delian Asparouhov see no signs of de-escalation and warn of tougher times ahead for companies tied to Musk‚Äôs ventures. While some feel Silicon Valley may have been used for political gain, others believe this breakup might simply make room for a new generation of tech leaders in Washington. As one investor summed it up, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the end of tech‚Äôs influence‚Äîjust a shift in who represents it.‚Äù",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-06-07 18:16:44

But that‚Äôs no longer the case. Now, both macro indicators and on-the-ground developments suggest that global acceptance is not just underway, it‚Äôs accelerating. Institutions are investing, while leading governments are adapting. Infrastructure is evolving. The most recent confirmation comes from a joint report by OKX and Blockworks Research, a result of extensive analysis and insights from industry heavyweights, including Polygon, Standard Chartered, and Google. It shows a significant uptick in crypto integration across finance, supply chains, and consumer industries. Global Indicators Show Crypto Is Embedding Itself Into the System The OKX‚ÄìBlockworks report gets right into the facts by presenting hard data. Sixty percent of asset managers are reportedly planning to launch crypto investment products by 2026. Meanwhile, two-thirds of financial leaders are developing infrastructure for tokenized products. Institutional adoption, once a cautious experiment, is quickly becoming a strategic priority. Beyond banking, sectors like sports, fashion, and luxury goods are now applying blockchain for logistics, anti-counterfeiting, and audience engagement. *Metaplanet Announces Accelerated 2025-2027 Bitcoin Plan**Targeting 210,000 $BTC by 2027* pic.twitter.com/xJKu3J8Apb ‚Äî Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) June 6, 2025 This trend is mirrored in state-level moves as well. Japan-based Metaplanet, already holding over 8,800 BTC, has revised its Bitcoin reserve target to a staggering 100,000 BTC by 2026. The rationale, as per a spokesperson, is that traditional safe havens are failing, and Bitcoin, with its limited supply and decentralized design, offers a more reliable anchor in a shifting global economy. Another country to join the bandwagon is Pakistan. Its newly appointed crypto minister is actively in talks with U.S. and Wall Street leaders, aiming to position the country at the forefront of blockchain innovation. These visits‚Äô agenda included serious discussions with Cantor Fitzgerald and Tether-backed ventures, with commitments toward Bitcoin bonds and a strategic national reserve. Regulatory progress across major economies is aligning as well. From the UK‚Äôs maturing framework to the EU‚Äôs MiCA rollout and increasing policy integration in the U.S., the legal backbone for a crypto-driven financial world is slowly solidifying. For long-term investors, these aren‚Äôt just news events. They‚Äôre signs of a foundational shift worth positioning for. Best Crypto to Buy Now - Presale Gems to Leverage Positive Market Sentiments While the market may be taking a hit right now with prices dropping, the macro trend suggests we are still in the bull run, which makes now an excellent time to stock up on projects with huge potential that are still priced at a nominal rate. Presales are excellent options for investors seeking such value, and we list some of the best options to consider in the space right now, considering their concepts, use case, and more. Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper introduces itself as an advanced Layer 2 solution looking to solve Bitcoin‚Äôs transactional limitations. It introduces a new protocol that allows users to move BTC onto a faster chain where transactions can be validated and settled with lower fees and greater efficiency. The framework integrates multiple scaling methods, including Optimistic Rollups, ZK-Rollups, and Rootstock sidechains, while maintaining Bitcoin as the underlying asset. What makes Bitcoin Hyper distinct is that it does not replace or compete with Bitcoin. Instead, it enhances its utility by making it viable for high-frequency trading, micropayments, and faster peer-to-peer transfers. By using the Solana Virtual Machine for its smart contract infrastructure, Bitcoin Hyper manages to bring scalability into a traditionally slow ecosystem without compromising security. Featured in videos of channels like Today Trader and more, its popularity has only skyrocketed in the past few days. The project is still in its presale phase, which means the infrastructure is in early development, but the roadmap points toward an interoperable environment that prioritizes usability and throughput. Bitcoin Hyper‚Äôs long-term growth potential hinges on whether it can become the go-to transaction layer for Bitcoin holders who want speed without sacrificing decentralization. As traditional systems begin to integrate tokenized services and faster settlements, a Bitcoin-native Layer 2 could find a solid use case. For users, this presents an opportunity to engage with Bitcoin in a more functional context while retaining the credibility of the base chain. SUBBD SUBBD is developing an infrastructure that centers around the creator economy, but with an approach that redefines ownership, monetization, and digital identity. It offers a token-based platform where creators can issue unique access rights, gated content, and on-chain audience engagement tools. This setup replaces traditional social media monetization models, which rely heavily on advertising and centralized revenue distribution. The $SUBBD token powers every transaction within the network, enabling creators to build their micro-economies without needing intermediaries. Subscription payments, limited-access merchandise, and voting systems for community decisions can all be implemented using smart contracts. The long-term objective is to create a circular economy that rewards both creators and their most active followers directly. This model is especially relevant in a digital environment where decentralized identity and blockchain-integrated content systems are gaining institutional attention. The OKX and Blockworks report highlighted how tokenized product infrastructure is becoming a focus for financial leaders. Platforms like SUBBD tap into this same technological direction but apply it to consumer engagement and digital media. In a climate where users are becoming more conscious of data ownership and fair compensation, SUBBD provides a framework that is both timely and needed. If successful, it could transform how people support creators, how content is licensed, and how engagement is rewarded, all while bypassing traditional gatekeepers. Its early presale pricing allows entry before utility expansion, making it a project of interest for those tracking real-world blockchain applications. Best Wallet Token Best Wallet Token anchors a multi-feature crypto wallet ecosystem that integrates advanced tools for portfolio tracking, secure storage, in-app swaps, and early access to presale tokens. It supports over 60 blockchain networks and uses a decentralized, non-custodial architecture to ensure user control over funds. In addition to wallet features, it includes a built-in DEX aggregator, market insights panel, and presale dashboard to help users discover and invest in upcoming projects. The wallet‚Äôs native token is designed to grant users exclusive access to higher staking yields, token launch allocations, and reward systems within the app. Its token utility is deeply connected to the broader usage of the app rather than external speculation. For instance, the more a user interacts with tools like the presale aggregator or the Best DEX, the more benefits they unlock through token holding. This model mirrors what many institutional frameworks are now shifting toward‚Äîfully integrated platforms that tie user activity directly to tokenized incentives. As firms explore tokenization across finance and user services, a wallet that links discovery, investment, and reward within one ecosystem becomes increasingly relevant. Best Wallet‚Äôs presale offers exposure to an infrastructure project already functioning at a public level but aiming to scale further. With crypto adoption rising and demand for self-custody solutions growing in response to both regulatory and institutional movement, utility-focused wallets may play a central role in onboarding new users securely and efficiently. Solaxy Solaxy‚Äôs Layer 2 blockchain enables efficient cross-chain activity between Ethereum and Solana. One may think of this as a Bitcoin Hyper-like project, but for a different blockchain. Also, rather than existing as a general-purpose L2, it has a defined objective, which is streamlining transactions for users who require the liquidity of Ethereum and the speed of Solana without being locked into one network. This approach allows users to bridge assets, execute smart contracts, and stake tokens across both chains in a single environment. The project‚Äôs token, SOLX, plays a central role in securing the network and rewarding validators. Users can stake SOLX to earn a share of protocol fees or participate in governance decisions that influence bridge parameters, transaction incentives, and protocol upgrades. For developers, Solaxy offers compatibility with Ethereum‚Äôs EVM and Solana‚Äôs Sealevel, allowing applications to run simultaneously across both ecosystems. $SOLX has got what YOU need. üõ∏ü™ê45M Raised! üî• pic.twitter.com/hamUNI7Hgz ‚Äî SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) June 6, 2025 This model aligns with ongoing conversations about blockchain interoperability. As adoption grows, the demand for networks that can manage liquidity and activity across different chains without increasing transaction costs is only going to rise. Solaxy aims to solve this by reducing friction in asset movement while preserving decentralization. It has already raised upwards of $45 million in what is one of the most successful presales this quarter and is set to launch soon. The regulatory trend, particularly in the EU and UK, is beginning to accommodate networks that serve as backbones for decentralized applications. With enterprise-grade compliance structures becoming more common, Solaxy‚Äôs cross-chain design could find relevance in a regulated market that favors scalable, interoperable, and low-cost infrastructure. For users and developers looking for technical reliability tied to practical use, the platform presents a strong case for growth through function, not speculation. Snorter Snorter is a trading bot project that integrates artificial intelligence with on-chain market signals to provide real-time automated decision-making for crypto traders. The system is designed for both experienced and casual users, offering different levels of control, from fully autonomous trading to customizable strategy overlays. Built on a decentralized framework, the bot operates without third-party custody, ensuring that trades are executed from the user‚Äôs wallet while maintaining full transparency. The technology relies on large-scale data parsing from various blockchains, price aggregators, and liquidity pools. This input is filtered through machine learning algorithms that continuously optimize for volatility detection, arbitrage potential, and trend shifts. Users can also access backtesting tools and detailed performance analytics within the dashboard to assess effectiveness over time. Snorter‚Äôs token is used for tiered access, governance proposals, and fee reduction. Holding more tokens allows access to premium indicators, faster execution lanes, and higher API request limits. It also enables community participation in refining AI models through a structured feedback mechanism, making the system adaptive over time. As the world moves to AI integration in finance, tools like Snorter could become essential for managing the increasing complexity of decentralized markets. As institutional players and regulators begin to recognize algorithmic trading in the blockchain space, AI-based bots that maintain decentralization and data sovereignty will have strategic importance. Snorter is positioned as a utility-first protocol in a segment where usability, performance, and control directly influence adoption. For traders seeking automation without compromise, it offers a focused solution. Conclusion Mass adoption of cryptocurrency is materializing through measurable actions from governments, financial institutions, and infrastructure providers worldwide. From strategic Bitcoin reserves to institutional-grade compliance platforms and tokenized financial products, the direction is clear. For investors, this phase represents a critical window‚Äîone where early engagement in credible, utility-driven initiatives may offer the most substantial long-term advantage. The projects mentioned above could be one of the starting steps to creating a profitable portfolio, as long as one is careful about the risks involved in investing and only invests as much as they can afford to lose.

These developments could mark a turning point for XRP, which has struggled to sustain long-term rallies despite periodic surges. How quickly could these factors translate into upward price action? New XRP Reserve Strategy Suggests Potential Upside Webus International has disclosed a $300 million XRP reserve strategy in a new SEC filing, positioning XRP as a critical asset in its upcoming infrastructure. This move follows VivoPower International's $121 million XRP treasury announcement. To traders, the reserve plans are a strong signal of institutional trust in Ripple's utility. At the same time, Ripple‚Äôs delayed 1 billion XRP unlock adds a layer of unpredictability to short-term supply expectations. Historically, monthly token unlocks have influenced price action, and the recent delay may temporarily limit downside pressure. Price-wise, XRP has formed a tight consolidation pattern. Technical analysts suggest a breakout may be in play if volume expands and XRP‚Äôs price sustains above the $2.1 resistance. According to InvestingHaven , XRP is showing resilience within its structure, and if support levels remain intact, a breakout toward $3 may become viable. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP ETF Approval Odds Soar: 92% Chance of Approval in 2025 XRP‚Äôs odds for a spot ETF approval in 2025 have jumped to 92%, according to Polymarketdata . In May 2025, the odds were 83%, and in April, it was much lower. This rise is attributed to the SEC‚Äôs ongoing review of multiple XRP ETF applications from asset managers, including Bitwise, 21Shares, Canary Capital, Grayscale, and Franklin Templeton. A key factor influencing this optimism is the improved relationship between Ripple Labs and the SEC. In March 2025, the SEC dropped its longstanding lawsuit against Ripple, removing a significant legal obstacle. Although an amended settlement awaits finalization, the dismissal has positively impacted market sentiment. Remittix Could Become The #1 PayFi Token Traditional remittance networks still suffer from high fees, long settlement times, and rigid infrastructure. Remittix is positioning itself as a more fluid alternative, leveraging Ethereum‚Äôs security while introducing a token model built for transaction speed and conversion ease. It‚Äôs not trying to replace fiat, but simplify the process of getting value from wallet to bank account. As memecoins cool off and altcoin liquidity shifts, assets like Remittix stand out by offering functional advantages. Circle‚Äôs USDC expansion into Brazil, for example, shows the growing appetite for regulated digital payments. Remittix is pushing features within that space, but with a lighter framework that doesn‚Äôt require a central issuer. Moreover, Remittix‚Äôs native RTX token serves a purpose beyond mere representation. It powers fee reductions, unlocks advanced routing features, and will be central to governance updates expected later this year. As trading volume returns and altcoins regain momentum, protocols like Remittix that solve the everyday problem of moving money are getting attention for the right reasons. Conclusion XRP‚Äôs rising ETF approval odds and $300 million reserve push are reshaping its outlook, but the spotlight isn‚Äôt solely on Ripple. Remittix is gaining traction as the practical bridge between crypto and fiat, solving pain points in traditional remittance flows. At just $0.0781 , and over $15.5 million already raised, Remittix offers a low entry point into a project solving real PayFi problems.

These factors could catalyze a major shift in its market performance. Strategic Reserve Allocation and Market Confidence Webus International recently unveiled a strategic move by filing with the SEC a plan to allocate $300 million to XRP reserves. This action positions XRP as a pivotal component in their financial infrastructure, mirroring a similar initiative by VivoPower International, which announced a $121 million investment in XRP. Such substantial commitments signal a growing institutional trust in Ripple‚Äôs utility and stability. Adding to the intrigue, Ripple's decision to delay the release of 1 billion XRP tokens could alter short-term market dynamics, traditionally influenced by the monthly token releases. This deliberate postponement might mitigate immediate sell-offs, thereby cushioning the currency against potential devaluation. Market analysts are closely monitoring XRP's trading patterns, suggesting that a sustained price above the $2.1 resistance could indicate an impending breakout. According to insights from InvestingHaven , XRP's resilience might soon propel it towards the $3 mark, provided it maintains current support levels. Surging Prospects for XRP ETF Approval The likelihood of an XRP ETF receiving approval by 2025 has dramatically increased to 92%, as per Polymarket data . This optimism stems from the SEC's ongoing evaluations of several ETF propositions from notable asset managers like Bitwise and Grayscale. A pivotal moment in this trajectory was the SEC's dismissal of a longstanding lawsuit against Ripple in March 2025, fostering a more conducive environment for regulatory approvals. Introducing Remittix: A Revolution in PayFi Solutions While XRP makes strides in the investment world, Remittix is making headlines as a formidable contender in the PayFi sector. By leveraging blockchain technology, Remittix offers a compelling alternative to traditional financial networks, which are often hampered by high fees and slow transaction times. Remittix uses the Ethereum blockchain to enhance security and efficiency, ensuring faster transactions and lower fees. Its native token, RTX, further enriches user experience by offering discounts and advanced transaction features, making it an attractive option for those seeking efficient digital payment solutions. Concluding Thoughts As XRP gears up with strategic reserves and favorable ETF prospects, the broader financial technology landscape is also evolving. Projects like Remittix underscore the growing demand for innovative financial solutions that bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.

The company reports that over $2.1 billion has already been lost to crypto-related attacks in 2025. Most of the damage stems from wallet breaches, which far outpace all other attack vectors in terms of losses. Wallet Compromises Inflict Most Damage The report revealed that despite accounting for only 23 reported incidents, wallet compromises led to a whopping $1.6 billion in losses, making it the most damaging category by far. In comparison, phishing incidents were the most frequent, with 114 cases resulting in approximately $401.5 million in losses. Next up was code vulnerabilities, which were nearly as common, with 100 incidents leading to $281.6 million in losses, highlighting the continued threat posed by insecure smart contracts and flawed implementations. Interestingly, access control issues were reported 19 times but caused relatively lower financial damage at $14.1 million, while exit scams, despite being notoriously difficult to track and recover from, totaled just 9 incidents and $1.6 million in losses. Price manipulation attacks were similarly limited in scope, with 15 cases and $8.1 million in damages. The stark contrast between the frequency and financial impact across incident types indicated a critical insight: while phishing and code vulnerabilities are more common, wallet compromises result in disproportionately higher losses. This suggests that attackers are increasingly targeting high-value wallets. Crypto Attacks Claimed $140M in May In May alone, the total amount lost to a combination of exploits, hacks, and scams came down to approximately $140.1 million after $162 million in assets linked to these incidents was successfully frozen. Sui-based decentralized exchange, Cetus, topped with $225 million in losses. Of the total losses, Code vulnerabilities and phishing emerged as two major threat vectors during the month, accounting for roughly $230 million and $47.6 million in stolen funds, respectively. Meanwhile, around $8.5 million resulted specifically from wallet-draining attacks.

Among the best cheap cryptos to buy now, Cardano (ADA) stands out, while still boasting one of the most robust ecosystems in the space. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new cryptocurrency still in its presale phase, is drawing attention with its DeFi-focused model and whispers of massive upside. The project is selling at $0.03 and is gaining interest rapidly. Already, more than $10.1 million has been raised in the presale of Mutuum Finance, with 11,700 people participating so far, who will witness the tokens appreciate to $0.035 as phase six begins. If Bitcoin smashes through resistance and triggers another market-wide surge, these altcoins could be among the next cryptos to explode, offering huge potential for early investors looking for the best crypto to invest in today. Cardano Set to Surge if Bitcoin Breaks All-Time High A new all-time high for Bitcoin (BTC) could give Cardano (ADA) a strong push higher. Today, ADA is going for about $0.69 and it is a great choice for buying cheap crypto because of its strong background and continuous growth. Over time, ADA‚Äôs performance has been strongly linked to the large rallies in the Bitcoin market, during those rallies, ADA went from below $0.10 to $3. Because BTC price discovery is underway, ADA may reclaim the $1 mark and could surge to $1.20‚Äì1.50 if positive momentum appears in the altcoin market. Many investors trying to catch the next major cryptocurrency rise are likely to keep ADA on their watchlist.

Bitcoin price recently set another ATH (again), but there are indications it is slowing down. Conversely, Ethereum is increasingly exhibiting bullish indicators, positioning itself for a substantial price surge. If Ethereum plays out and explodes, it will have a cascading effect on ERC20 tokens, specifically ENA and Remittix . Who will have a compounded effect of their positive outlook and the base layer Ethereum jump. Cooling Bitcoin Worries Market Several technical indicators are suggesting a deceleration in Bitcoin‚Äôs move. Although it made headlines again as it punched a new ATH, its MACD and ROC are pointing towards a downturn. Even the monthly RSI, though higher than expected, is still in neutral territory. The US BTCETFs also mirror the sentiment, with $268 million in outflow. Bitcoin price cooling off after hitting $112K ATH. Graph source: CoinMarketCap Some suggest BTC is just doing a normal retraction, while other analysts see BTC in a Tariff Trap . Coupling this with risks of higher inflation on the horizon, if the Bitcoin price doesn‚Äôt shake out of the cooling period soon, it can test the $100,000 floor and in a worse situation, go well below it. Ethereum's Ascending Technicals and Ecosystem Boost While the bull run had many traders disappointed with Ethereum‚Äôs performance, this finally seems to be changing. 20, 50 and 100 EMAs are all pointing towards a buying opportunity, supported by its 12 and 26 MACD. ETH price movement for 30 days. Source: CoinMarketCap This technical narrative is further supported by ETF firms, where BlackRock and Fidelity dumped $180 million worth of BTC as it bled, and bought $78 million of ETH instead. EthereumCo-founder Buterin‚Äôs privacy advocacy on the Ethereum chain can also be a market mover, further strengthening Ethereum‚Äôs jump. What‚Äôs the verdict? Experts say Ethereum price can hit $4,000. Ethena On Recovery Ehtena (ENA) has experienced a pretty deep dive. Traders see the recent token unlock as the main reason, with supply flooding the market. Even with technical indicators like 10EMA and ROC showing a strong selling moment, savvy money is seeing this as a buying opportunity. ENA drop may be a buying opportunity. Source: CoinMarketCap With renewed interest in ETH, ERC20 tokens like ENA can ride the wave and recover losses. Pair that with rumors that Coinbase may list it, there is a flurry of buying activity. Remittix May Win The Race While all major ERC20 tokens can take advantage of the ETH predicted price boost, none will enjoy it more than Remittix . The PayFi protocol brings a whole new financial inclusion concept. It breaks the siloed nature of crypto and fiat, merging them into one. With seamless remittance of crypto into fiat, anyone with crypto can send traditional money to loved ones or even do grocery shopping where crypto is not accepted. The secret sauce?

While Bitcoin has enjoyed its fair share of the spotlight, reaching new all-time highs, its momentum seems to be tapering off, possibly making room for Ethereum to take center stage. Ethereum's Bullish Prospects With Ethereum displaying strong bullish patterns, the ripple effect on associated ERC20 tokens could be substantial. In particular, tokens like ENA and Remittix may see enhanced activity and valuations owing to their foundational relationship with Ethereum's technology. Deceleration in Bitcoin's Market Activity Recent analyses suggest a slowing in Bitcoin's ascent. Despite hitting a record high of $112K, various technical indicators such as MACD and Rate of Change, signal a potential downturn which might cause investors to pivot towards other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. View the recent Bitcoin price movement on CoinMarketCap . Implications for ERC20 Tokens: ENA and Remittix ENA is currently showing potential as a buying opportunity despite recent price dips. This sentiment is primarily due to the overall strengthening of the Ethereum ecosystem which might support recovery in related tokens. Graphical insights into ENA's recent performance can be viewed on CoinMarketCap . Furthermore, Remittix stands out with its PayFi platform that bridges the gap between crypto and fiat currencies, simplifying transactions and reducing fees, which could attract considerable attention with Ethereum's rising tide. Remittix's Market Position and Future Outlook Remittix has already seen substantial presale activity, signaling strong market trust and interest. With Ethereum's expected surge, Remittix‚Äôs innovative solutions could push it to the forefront of ERC20 tokens, making it a preferable choice for investors looking to leverage Ethereum's growth.

With a $2 trillion market cap and dominance over 40% of the entire crypto market, its every move sends ripples across the altcoin sea. Most altcoins move in lockstep with it, boasting a correlation as high as 0.9. So when Bitcoin flinches, the rest of the market often follows. That‚Äôs why all eyes are on BTC this June. A confirmed breakout could ignite what traders call ‚Äúaltcoin season‚Äù, and some coins are perfectly positioned to ride the wave. Cardano is flashing bullish technicals, Litecoin is showing signs of a quiet comeback and Remittix , a newcomer with real-world payments utility, is gaining serious traction. Here, we‚Äôll see why, if Bitcoin plays ball, these three may not just follow, they could lead the next leg up. Cardano could fly high if Bitcoin gives it wings Cardano (ADA) is flashing signs of bullish momentum, trading between $0.75 and $0.81 after a 14% weekly climb. Analysts project a June range of $0.791‚Äì$0.905, with bullish scenarios targeting $1.08‚Äì$1.47, if it can break above $0.85. However, a slip below $0.73 could pull ADA toward $0.50, especially if Bitcoin stumbles. Source: Bitpanda On-chain data and whale accumulation (over 420M ADA bought recently) support short-term price stability. Technologically, Cardano is advancing with its Ouroboros upgrade and Hydra Layer-2 scaling solution, while its Argentina partnership for lithium tokenization shows growing real-world use. Still, ADA‚Äôs fate is tightly linked to Bitcoin, with a 0.8‚Äì0.9 correlation. If BTC surges past $118,000, ADA could rally 25%‚Äì80%. But without BTC momentum or ecosystem catalysts like the Hydra launch, a major breakout remains uncertain. Cardano may soar, but only if Bitcoin lifts the tide. Litecoin may be down but not out Litecoin price action in mid-2025 tells a story of quiet resilience. After falling from $130 to as low as $71, LTC is regaining ground, trading between $71.57 and $100. Analysts forecast a June target of $117‚Äì$140, with bullish voices like Paulo Ricci eyeing $150 by July, assuming Bitcoin keeps climbing. Source: CoinCentral Behind the scenes, Litecoin is quietly evolving. The MWEB upgrade boosts its privacy and scalability, while rising hash rates and on-chain accumulation point to growing confidence. Institutional tailwinds, from Fidelity‚Äôs retirement accounts to Telegram‚Äôs payments integration, add fuel to the fire. If Bitcoin hits $118K, LTC could easily ride the wave to $120 or higher. Still, competition is fierce, and the Litecoin price needs more than nostalgia to soar. Without unique innovation or a fresh narrative, LTC‚Äôs breakout depends heavily on Bitcoin‚Äôs next move. Remittix is building what crypto always promised Imagine a digital design studio in Lagos working with clients from Berlin, Dubai and New York. Instead of fighting with unavailable Stripe support or eating wire fees, they integrate RemittixPay . Clients pay in fiat or crypto and Remittix handles the rest, converting to local currency and delivering it to their bank. Clean, compliant, no currency chaos. Is Remittix the Next XRP?! New 10X Potential Crypto?! This isn't just another payment tool, it‚Äôs infrastructure. Like Shopify for global commerce, Remittix gives creators and small businesses control. Its flat-fee crypto-to-fiat engine supports 100+ tokens and 30+ currencies, turning blockchain into a bridge, not a barrier. It‚Äôs as intuitive as online banking. No seed phrases, no Web3 jargon, just send, receive, withdraw. With Ethereum-linked momentum and BTC correlation near 0.8, a Bitcoin breakout to $118K could launch RTX toward $1.50. If crypto‚Äôs next wave is about real-world utility, Remittix might be riding its crest. Conclusion Bitcoin steers the crypto market and if it breaks out in June, Cardano, Litecoin and Remittix are poised to soar. Cardano‚Äôs tech upgrades and partnerships, Litecoin‚Äôs steady comeback and Remittix‚Äôs real-world payment utility could lead the next rally, if Bitcoin plays ball, these altcoins won‚Äôt just follow, they‚Äôll lead.

These once-buzzing assets are now lying low, but could rapidly gain value when retail frenzy returns. Discover which coins are poised for a sudden surge and ready to take off at a moment's notice. FLOKI: Recent Gains Masking Long-Term Decline Amid Bearish Pressure FLOKI ‚Äôs price advanced approximately 10.5% over the past month, pushing it toward the upper range between $0.000063 and $0.000115. Despite this short-term uptick, the coin has faced a significant long-term decline of about 67% over the last six months. This stark contrast between short-term recovery and long-term weakness highlights ongoing bearish sentiment in the market. Recent volatility suggests some buyer interest, but overall trends indicate that the improvements have not reversed the prevailing downward trajectory. The coin is currently trading between $0.000063 and $0.000115, with resistance near $0.000145 posing a challenge for further gains. If momentum improves, resistance may extend to around $0.000196, while support at approximately $0.000041 could provide stability during downturns. Oscillator readings show the Awesome Oscillator at -0.000011 and the Momentum Indicator at -0.000017, accompanied by an RSI near 45, indicating a market under bearish pressure despite a modest weekly gain. Trading strategies may focus on breaking through the $0.000145 level, but it's crucial to employ risk management given the long-term decline. Pepe Performance: Price Movements and Current Trends Pepe showed a strong pulse during the past month with an impressive rise nearing 38.44%, countered by a steep decline of around 56.76% over the previous six months. The coin‚Äôs performance has been marked by sudden bursts of activity, leading to significant corrections. Price swings over the short period suggest a burst of investor interest that was not sustained long term, while the half-year data indicate instability. These moves illustrate how Pepe's price is sensitive to market forces, with buyers entering during lows and selling during peaks. Past trends reveal that while early gains can be appealing, major pullbacks caution against a one-sided view of momentum. Current price levels settle between $0.00000726 and $0.00001639, with clear resistance near $0.00002113 and a higher barrier at $0.00003026, while support is seen at approximately $0.00000285. Negative signals from the Awesome Oscillator and the Momentum Indicator, along with a neutral RSI of 45.42, suggest that bearish pressure currently outweighs optimism. The price action appears range-bound, with bears defending lower levels and bulls testing resistance. Trading ideas involve watching for a breakout above $0.00002113 to ignite renewed bullish activity or waiting for a retracement toward support for buying opportunities. Caution is advised as the lack of a clear trend calls for careful positioning. Bonk Price Swings Under Volatile Trends BONK fell by 9.24% over the past month and dropped by 66.38% in the last six months, reflecting a persistent downward trend. Sellers have dominated during these periods, making it difficult for the coin to find stability. Recent performance indicates ongoing struggles in a highly volatile market, with technical indicators not signaling a strong recovery. Traders face several challenges as the coin continues its historical decline, which complicates decision-making in this segment. Currently, the coin trades between a low of $0.0000127 and a high of $0.0000231. Resistance is noted around $0.0000297, while support is identified near $0.00000885. A second resistance level is near $0.0000401. Market indicators suggest bears are in control, with the Awesome Oscillator at -0.00000359 and the Momentum Indicator at -0.00000454. The RSI at 39.57 indicates an oversold condition, but a clear trend is lacking. Traders may look for movements above resistance for bullish potential or reductions towards support for shorting opportunities. Cautious strategies are advised due to the ongoing volatility. Conclusion FLOKI , PEPE , BONK have been unusually quiet this month. Despite the lull, these coins could see a significant rise soon. Retail interest can trigger explosive growth. Patience may reward those keeping an eye on these memecoins. They have shown potential for sudden spikes in the past. If retail FOMO returns, these coins could rapidly gain momentum again. Their quiet phase might just be the calm before the storm. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Over time, it grew into one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies, transforming early adopters into millionaires. Today, investors wonder if Ruvi AI , a cutting-edge AI-powered blockchain project, has the potential to mirror Binance Coin‚Äôs meteoric rise. With over 1,400 holders , $1.5 million raised , and nearly 135 million tokens sold during its presale, Ruvi AI is building momentum to become a major player in the crypto ecosystem. Could Ruvi AI follow in Binance Coin‚Äôs footsteps? Here‚Äôs why analysts are optimistic. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Rocket Start in Phase 2 Ruvi AI‚Äôs Phase 2 presale has quickly turned heads in the investment community. Currently priced at $0.015 per token , the project offers an affordable entry point for early backers. What separates Ruvi AI from speculative projects is its structured valuation. The token‚Äôs value will automatically rise to $0.07 upon presale completion , eliminating guesswork. Analysts anticipate that Ruvi AI‚Äôs value could hit $1 post-listing , presenting substantial upside potential for those who participate now. By comparison, Binance Coin‚Äôs early growth was largely fueled by its utility within the Binance ecosystem. It took years for BNB to break out as a top-ranking cryptocurrency. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, couples utility with massive growth potential right from the presale stage, giving it the foundation to capture investor attention early on. Practical Applications Set Ruvi AI Apart While Binance Coin‚Äôs appeal was tied to one platform initially, Ruvi AI stands out thanks to its real-world applications spanning healthcare, logistics, and finance: Healthcare : Ruvi AI leverages advanced AI to improve diagnostics and reduce inefficiencies, empowering healthcare institutions to deliver higher-quality care at lower costs. Logistics : Using AI-enabled optimization, Ruvi AI helps businesses streamline supply chain processes, reducing costs and improving on-time deliveries. Finance : With fraud detection tools and secure blockchain transactions, Ruvi AI provides enhanced safety and efficiency to financial networks. These use cases ensure that Ruvi AI isn‚Äôt just another ‚Äúflavor of the month‚Äù crypto project. Its ability to solve pressing global problems gives it the staying power needed to emulate Binance Coin‚Äôs legacy of success. VIP Tiers Offer Exceptional Returns Ruvi AI‚Äôs VIP investment tiers amplify the benefits for early adopters, ensuring significant returns when the token‚Äôs price rises. Here‚Äôs how the tier system works: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . This tier structure is designed to multiply early investments substantially, rewarding those who get in at the ground level. How Ruvi AI Could Match Binance Coin‚Äôs Success Binance Coin‚Äôs dominance was built on strong utility and widespread adoption. Ruvi AI similarly focuses on practical, real-world solutions while establishing a scalable framework for long-term growth. The timing of its presale, paired with its transparent and structured valuation, gives it a competitive edge. Binance Coin‚Äôs early investors benefited from its platform-centric growth, but Ruvi AI goes beyond single-platform utility. Its applications across multiple industries make it more versatile and secure against market fluctuations. With over 1,400 holders already backing the project, Ruvi AI has laid a strong foundation for future success. The Verdict Ruvi AI‚Äôs impressive early achievements indicate it‚Äôs not just chasing hype but rather building a high-potential cryptocurrency designed for lasting impact. From its structured presale to its diverse use cases, every aspect of Ruvi AI aligns with the criteria investors look for in market leaders.

After attempting to reclaim upside momentum above $ 2.60 in May, the cryptocurrency has struggled to maintain this run, and its price action over the past few days has brought it close to losing the $2.10 price level. Notably, the price action has resulted in the formation of a head and shoulders pattern on the daily candlestick chart. This might be the final straw that finally sends the XRP price plummeting below $2. Related Reading: Bitcoin Scarcity May Spark Explosive Surge, Bank Study Shows XRP Breaks Head And Shoulders Neckline As identified by a crypto analyst on the social media platform X, XRP has now printed a classic head and shoulders formation, with clearly defined symmetry between the left shoulder, head, and right shoulder. The head and shoulders formation began taking shape in late April, when the price climbed to $2.26 to become the left shoulder of the pattern. In early to mid-May, XRP surged above $2.60 to create the head of the formation and what appeared at the time to be a resumption of strong bullish momentum. The rally lost steam soon after reaching that May peak, and the price began to retreat once again. By June 3, XRP made another attempt to push higher, reaching $2.27 in what is the formation of the right shoulder. However, this push wasn‚Äôt enough, and the ensuing price action has seen sellers gradually fighting for control. The head and shoulders pattern, which is often associated with trend reversals, became more concerning once XRP broke below the neckline around the $2.18 level to reach as low as $2.07 on July 6. Interestingly, the breakdown below the neckline was accompanied by increased volume, which provided additional confirmation of the bearish signal. EMA Rejections For XRP: What‚Äôs Next? Now that XRP has broken beneath the neckline, the $2.18 to $2.20 zone is beginning to flip into a firm resistance barrier for any attempt at recovery. The daily candlestick chart shows XRP continuing to trade below both the 9-day EMA and the 50-day SMA, which currently stand at $2.1877 and $2.2649 respectively. Despite a modest recovery over the past 24 hours, XRP has repeatedly failed to break back above the 9-day EMA since the neckline breakdown, showing persistent weakness in the short-term structure. As long as XRP is trapped beneath the neckline and the EMA/SMA resistance cluster, the prevailing structure continues to favor a downward extension. Based on the head and shoulders setup, a measured move from the neckline breakdown projects a decline toward the $1.85 to $1.80 range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Network Activity Booming Despite A Quiet Market‚ÄîData At the time of writing, XRP now finds itself trading at the neckline resistance again at $2.18 after a 2.6% increase in the past 24 hours from $2.13. However, the strength of this bounce is questionable, as it has occurred alongside a sharp 48.14% drop in trading volume. The next 24 hours will be important, as price behavior around the $2.18 to $2.20 range could determine whether XRP resumes its descent and break below $2.

Most people associate it with banking and finance. But according to crypto analyst Stellar Rippler, this view only tells part of the story. Beneath the surface, XRP is quietly becoming the foundation for a much bigger revolution, one that involves digital identity, privacy, and even control over your biology. XRPL: More Than Just Payments The XRP Ledger (XRPL) was designed with a wider vision than just helping banks move money. It was built to support tokenization, healthcare innovations, and giving people control over their digital identities. This broader purpose is coming to life through projects like XRP Healthcare and DNA Protocol, which are using the XRPL to anchor identity, genetics, and ownership on the blockchain. These initiatives are laying the groundwork for a new kind of freedom‚Äîwhat Stellar Rippler calls bio-financial freedom‚Äîwhere your health data and identity are securely managed without relying on traditional middlemen like banks or government agencies. How DNA Protocol Creates a New Kind of Identity One of the most exciting developments is DNA Protocol, which enables genome-based identity verification on XRPL while keeping your data completely private. Here‚Äôs how it works: (1/ ) What if I told you‚Ä¶ XRP is not just for finance? Everyone thinks XRP is only about payments. But beneath the surface, there‚Äôs a deeper revolution. It‚Äôs about identity, privacy, and sovereignty. A $100B+ industry coming on-chain on XRPL. This will blow your mind: pic.twitter.com/1hm3hMELtD ‚Äî Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) June 7, 2025 First, your DNA is sequenced by trusted labs and anonymized, so it can‚Äôt be traced back to you. Then, advanced cryptography called zero-knowledge proofs creates a unique digital fingerprint of your genome, called a verifiable genome hash (vGenome). This vGenome proves who you are without revealing any sensitive genetic information. This fingerprint is stored permanently and securely on the XRP Ledger. When you need to prove your identity or share specific health information, third parties can verify the necessary details through smart contracts, without ever seeing your raw DNA. In simple terms, this system allows for ‚ÄúKYC without KYC‚Äù, you can prove your identity and meet regulatory requirements without handing over personal documents or exposing your data. Building Healthcare on the Blockchain While DNA Protocol handles identity, XRP Healthcare focuses on using this technology in real-world medical settings. The project is creating tools that allow everything from prescription tokens to AI-driven health markets‚Äîall secured on XRPL. Imagine walking into a clinic and instantly sharing your verified health data, or opening a bank account without repeating tedious identity checks. Your digital wallet, powered by XRPL, could safely store all your health and identity credentials, giving you full control over what information you share and with whom. This approach could transform healthcare into a faster, more secure, and patient-centered system that works without the usual bureaucratic delays. A $100 Billion Industry Quietly Emerging Genetic data is one of the most valuable assets in healthcare and insurance today. Pharmaceutical companies and insurers are eager to access this information. However, DNA Protocol aims to shift control from these corporations back to individuals, giving people ownership of their most personal data: their DNA. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This market is projected to exceed $100 billion, yet few are talking about how blockchain can empower individuals in this space. By putting genomic identity on XRPL, these projects could redefine how we think about privacy, health, and financial services. Why Now Matters As governments and companies increasingly collect personal data, privacy concerns grow. DNA Protocol offers a timely solution by providing a way to control your identity without sacrificing privacy. Stellar Rippler also highlights a subtle but important moment: public figures like Tristan Tate calling out ‚ÄúBig Pharma‚Äù and data harvesting hint at the rising awareness around these issues. DNA Protocol‚Äôs response emphasizes a future without middlemen‚Äîwhere your encrypted genome on XRPL is yours alone. The Quiet Revolution on XRPL What‚Äôs happening on XRPL is not flashy or hyped‚Äîit‚Äôs deliberate and strategic. Projects like DNA Protocol and XRP Healthcare are building foundational infrastructure for a new kind of digital ecosystem, one that combines healthcare, identity, and finance on a single ledger. This isn‚Äôt just a side project. It could become the next trillion-dollar use case for blockchain technology. In summary, XRP is evolving far beyond payments. Thanks to the work of projects anchored on XRPL, your health, identity, and even your DNA could soon be securely managed on-chain, under your full control. This is a new frontier in privacy, sovereignty, and digital freedom, quietly unfolding on the XRP Ledger. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to an analysis by Investing Scope , the recent downturn that saw XRP nearly crash below $2 reflects weakening momentum with the token struggling to break out of a narrow consolidation range that began after its January peak. However, in a TradingView post on June 5, the analyst indicated that the broader monthly chart tells a different, potentially bullish, story. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In this case, a recent symmetrical triangle breakout mirrors the pattern observed between 2014 and 2017. At that time, XRP moved sideways before breaking out in late 2017, forming a consolidation range and surging to an all-time high in January 2018, just beyond the 1.382 Fibonacci extension level. XRP‚Äôs $8 target Currently, the chart shows a similar post-breakout consolidation just below the 1.0 Fibonacci level. Based on historical fractals and Fibonacci extensions, this structure suggests a potential price target of $8, aligning with the 1.382 Fib level from the recent move. Further strengthening the bullish outlook, the monthly relative strength index ( RSI ) shows a recurring pattern of peaks, consistent with prior bullish cycles. Moreover, XRP has decisively moved above the 50-month moving average ( MA ), historically marking a shift from resistance to support during previous rallies. This optimistic technical setup is notable as key on-chain activities have sparked speculation. For instance, on June 6, Ripple transferred $498 million worth of XRP to an unknown wallet. This move deviates from the typical early-month escrow transactions and has stirred market curiosity about XRP‚Äôs next direction.

On Saturday, in a phone interview with NBC News , President Trump warned that there would be ‚Äúserious consequences‚Äù if Elon Musk financially backed Democratic candidates running against Republicans who support the GOP‚Äôs budget bill. ‚ÄúIf he does, he‚Äôll have to pay the consequences for that,‚Äù Trump said, adding later, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that.‚Äù Trump, who has often boasted of past support from Musk, firmly dismissed the idea of mending ties. ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said when asked whether he wished to repair the relationship. ‚ÄúI would assume so, yeah,‚Äù he added when asked if the rift was permanent. Despite the intensifying feud between two of the most influential figures in U.S. politics and technology, Bitcoin remained unfazed. The cryptocurrency held onto earlier gains and continues to trade near weekly highs. The market's composure suggests that traders may increasingly view BTC as a hedge against institutional dysfunction, or at least as an asset insulated from the partisan fallout that tends to impact equities more directly. Technical Analysis Highlights BTC traded in a 24-hour range of $1,162 (1.13%), from a low of $104,624 to a high of $105,786, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Strong support formed at $104,800, where above-average volume confirmed buyer interest. Resistance at $105,200 was broken and has since flipped into a short-term support zone. Volume peaked at 378 BTC during key breakout moments, especially around 13:43‚Äì13:46 and 13:53. A short consolidation occurred between $104,300‚Äì$104,600 before the final surge to near highs.

On-Chain Clues Emerge,https://coinpaper.com/9482/is-ripple-selling-xrp-behind-the-scenes-on-chain-clues-emerge,"A storm is brewing in the XRP base as blockchain analysts and cryptocurrency commentators finger Ripple Labs for secretly dumping millions worth of XRP in dark, intermediary-held wallets ‚Äî belying public assurances of its escrow-locked reserves. The charges, set off by suspicious exchange-to-wallet leaps and a recent $300 million Webus International treasury transaction, have again put controversy around transparency and regulation compliance at the San Francisco firm at the center of buzz. The Allegations: Escrow Unlocks, Hidden Flows Lurking behind the drama at the center are Ripple's monthly escrow releases. While the company has previously asserted that 55 billion XRP (55% of the circulating supply) are tied up in escrow contracts, critics reference on-chain evidence of morsels of these unlocked tokens being sent to untagged addresses before they reached exchanges. Blockchain analytics firm Santiment tracked a string of transactions in early June when 120 million XRP ($54 million) were moved from a known Ripple escrow account to an unidentified wallet labeled ‚ÄùrP4X2.sKxv3.‚Äù In a matter of hours, the funds were divided into smaller tranches and delivered to Bitstamp, Bitso, and other exchanges ‚Äî a trend some blame on past sell-offs. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about scheduled unlocks. It‚Äôs about Ripple using shadow wallets to mask institutional dumps.‚Äù ‚Äî @Crypto_Sleuth_2025 (June 5, 2025) The Webus Connection: A Compliant Backdoor? The scandal heated up after Asia mobility firm Webus International Ltd. disclosed a $300 million XRP treasury managed by SEC-registered adviser Samara Alpha. Crypto analyst Darkhorse believes such an arrangement enables Ripple to sell XRP to middlemen such as Samara, which then sell tokens to corporate clients‚Äîskirting a 2024 court injunction against direct institutional sale without SEC approval. ‚ÄúRipple‚Äôs ‚Äòcompliant by design‚Äô backdoor lets them move XLP without triggering securities laws. It‚Äôs structured, not casual.‚Äù ‚Äî @Darkhorse (June 4, 2025) Ripple denied any partnership with Webus, stating it ‚Äùdoes not control third-party XRP acquisitions.‚Äù Blockchain analysis firm ChainArgos, however, observed a cluster of wallets connected to both Ripple and Samara Alpha, raising doubts about coordination. Ripple's Response: ‚ÄùFiction Over Fact‚Äù To NewsBTC, Ripple CTO David Schwartz rebutted the accusations as ‚Äùconspiracy theories,‚Äù maintaining the certainty that all escrow releases are pre-planned and transparent. ‚ÄúThe XRP Ledger is public. Every transaction is visible. Suggesting we‚Äôre secretly dumping tokens ignores both the data and our legal obligations.‚Äù ‚Äî David Schwartz, Ripple CTO The company also referenced its Q1 2025 Markets Report, which identified $240 million in XRP sales‚Äîall ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) transactions, not institutional open-market deals. Community Divided: Geniuses or Dodging? XRP owners are split. Some applaud Ripple's alleged genius to avoid regulatory hurdles, while others fear stealth sell-offs will continue to push prices downward. ‚ÄúIf Ripple‚Äôs dumping via proxies, retail investors are the bagholders. Time for an independent on-chain audit.‚Äù Meanwhile, pro-Ripple commentators like Jay Nisbett argue the criticism is overblown: ‚ÄúWebus buying XRP via Samara is just corporate adoption. No different than MicroStrategy holding Bitcoin.‚Äù What‚Äôs Next? With its price 12% lower since June 1, investors are cautioned to monitor closely two measures: Escrow wallet activity: Suspicious unlocks or transfers could be offloading. Exchange netflows: Long-term flows without retail demand could be institution selling. Regulators are watching too. The SEC is already in court fighting Ripple but could look into the Webus-Samara structure for securities law issues.

In 2027, it will range between $2.47 and $2.80, with an average price of $2.54. In 2030, it will range between $7.94 and $9.64, with an average price of $8.17. Unlike the common sentiment of being a meme token, ApeCoin (APE) has utility. APE is an ERC-20 token that governs the ApeCoin DAO. The token also has utility within an affiliated company, Yuga Labs, the firm behind the Otherside metaverse, BAYC, and MAYC NFTs. Will APE reach $10? What will its price be in 2025? Let‚Äôs explore these and more in the Cryptopolitan Price Prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency ApeCoin Symbol APE Current price $0.6967 Market cap $524.41M Trading volume $52.28M Circulating supply 752.65M All-time high $39.40 on Mar 17, 2022 All-time low $0.3545 on Apr 7, 2025 24-hour high $0.7192 24-hour low $0.6797 APE price analysis: Technical analysis Metric Value Price volatility (30-day variation) 6.01% 50-day SMA $0.6087 200-day SMA $0.7220 Sentiment Bullish Green days 18/30 (60%) APE price analysis: APE begins descent At the time of writing (June 7), APE‚Äôs price rose by 15.09% in one week and dropped by 0.51% in the last 24 hours, trading at approximately $0.70. The cryptocurrency‚Äôs trading volume dropped by 46.22% in 24 hours, showing waning interest from traders. APE/USD 1-day chart analysis APE/USD 1-day price chart APE fell below $1 in January and $0.5 in April. It started recovering last month as it rose above $0.65. The MACD histogram shows that the price is experiencing negative momentum as it falls. The William Alligator trendlines show rising price volatility. APE/USD 4-hour chart analysis APE/USD 4-hour price chart The 4-hour chart highlights APE‚Äôs recovery as it rose above $0.69. It registered continuous bearish candles that saw it reverse from the recent high at $0.75. At current levels, it registers little volatility with rising negative momentum.

APE price analysis shows the market had positiveactivity in the last few days but bears have started to gain control. It should drop over the short term. Why is APE down? APE is correcting from highs registered in the last quarter of 2024. The drop could be attributed to the wider market sentiment. Can ApeCoin reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, APE will break above $10 in 2030. At the time, APE should have bridged to ApeChain and grown much utility and applications such as in the metaverse. Will APE reach $100? It is unlikely that the APE price will be extended to $100 in the foreseeable future. At such a valuation, APE will be more valuable than the USDT stablecoin, which is more of a ‚Äòhousehold‚Äô cryptocurrency. Can ape coin hit $1000? It is unlikely that the APE price will reach $1000 before 2031. Does ApeCoin have a future? With the launch of ApeChain, ApeCoin now has more utility and is, therefore, much more likely to last into the future. How much is ApeCoin worth in 2025? For 2025, the APE coin price will range between $0.58 and $1.59. The average price for the year will be $1.01. Is APE a good investment? APE‚Äôs utility is growing, and the launch of ApeChain is anticipated to attract more projects that use the APE token either for governance or settling fees on the chain. Yuga Labs and other new firms will likely promote APE. Recent news With the launch of ApeChain, APE proceeded to pump by over 100% accompanied by the launch of new projects such as Donkey Dash, Ape Express, Battle Plan, and the Ape Portal APE price prediction June 2025 The APE June price prediction ranges between $0.48 and $1.15, with an average of $0.69.

APE historic price sentiment ApeCoin price history Yuga Labs founded the ApeDAO in 2022. 62% of the tokens were given to the ApeDAO. 15% to BAYC and MAYC NFT holders, 16% to Yuga Labs, 14% to launch contributors, and 8% to BAYC founders. APE was distributed and began trading on March 17, 2022, at $7.26. The year 2022 closed with APE trading at $3. It remained bearish for the first three quarters of 2023. In October, it had dropped to $1.09. The crypto market sentiment changed in October as institutional interest in electronically traded funds rose. As the global crypto market cap broke above $2 trillion, APE broke above $2. The bull run continued in 2024, pushing APE as high as $2.43. The market started reversing afterward, and by June, it had fallen below $1. It crossed into August trading at $0.71. In September, it rose to $0.87 but later corrected falling to the $0.67 mark in October.

Meanwhile, Uniswap is witnessing an uptick in substantial trading activities. This raises an intriguing question for investors: which of these DeFi giants presents the most promising investment opportunity today? This article delves into the potential growth of both AAVE and UNI, helping investors make an informed choice. Aave Price Rally Amid Mixed Long-Term Trends Aave experienced a significant month-long surge with a 46.55% gain, while a six-month look reveals a decline of 10.66%. The coin‚Äôs recent performance shows a rapid move from lower valuations toward a more robust mid-range price. A modest weekly increase of 0.39% hints at stability amid short-term volatility. Past performance highlights a market that has embraced rapid gains over the last month yet struggled to maintain a longer-term upward trend. The current price sits between a low of $179.40 and a high of $298.70, confined within a range where support is at $111.81 and major resistance near $350.42. Indicators provide mixed signals: a positive monthly performance contrasts with a momentum indicator reading of -12.49, while the RSI at 55.04 signals a neutral state. Trading invites caution as neither bulls nor bears have taken definitive control. Short-term strategies include monitoring a breakout from resistance near $350.42 or waiting for a pullback towards support for a conservative buy. Uniswap Price Dynamics: 1-Month Surge Amid 6-Month Downturn UNI price action recorded a 24.90% climb over one month and a steep 67.21% drop over six months, highlighting a dramatic short-term rebound against a long-term struggle. Price has moved within a range from $4.62 to $7.58, reflecting volatility and rapid shifts in sentiment. A one-week decline of 1.51% further underscores recent fluctuations as the coin attempted to regain stability while enduring broader bearish undertones. The disparity between a robust monthly uptick and a much larger six-month downturn marks uneven market responses. Current trading sees price testing important thresholds, with resistance levels at $9.12 and $12.08 and support areas at $3.20 and $0.24. Trading activity remains mixed, with technical indicators pointing to a generally cautious market. Neither bulls nor bears appear to have established clear control. A break above $9.12 could usher in bullish momentum, whereas a dip below $3.20 might spell further declines. These levels present viable zones for entry and exit, urging traders to consider protective stops and timed positions. Conclusion AAVE appears to be on the brink of breaking out to $280. This suggests strong momentum and potential for growth. On the other hand, Uniswap is experiencing increased whale activity. This signals higher investor interest and possible future gains. Both AAVE and UNI have promising prospects. AAVE's technical outlook is impressive, while Uniswap's surge in whale activity shows increasing confidence. Evaluating these factors, both DeFi projects show strong potential. The choice depends on whether one prioritizes current breakout potential or investor activity.

The show will feature eight online streamers competing for a special prize: one Bitcoin (BTC). This news has caught the attention of the crypto community. This comes as the flagship crypto is gaining interest beyond finance, reaching the entertainment industry. Bitcoin Prize Reward Raises Eyebrows Unlike most shows that offer cash prizes or sponsored holiday trips, the House of Streams show, backed by the Malta Film Commission, will reward the winner with cryptocurrency. The decision to offer Bitcoin prizes has raised eyebrows with the crypto community. Meanwhile, Netflix has explored crypto themes in past content. This includes Trust No One: The Hunt for the Crypto King and the upcoming The Altruists. However, this is the platform‚Äôs first time directly tying a cryptocurrency to a prize. The eight House of Streams contestants will participate in many challenges. Notably, the details of the show have yet to be revealed. The contestants reportedly have a combined following of four million across popular streaming platforms, such as Twitch. Some familiar names already revealed include The Black Hokage, CyborgAngel, and OutplayedByJade. The Fake Token Menace Following the announcement, scammers tried to exploit the show‚Äôs buzz. They launched fake tokens using the House of Streams name. In response, the producers issued a warning on May 22, urging viewers to stay cautious and report any suspicious promotions. This malicious act is very common in the crypto industry as scammers do take advantage to impersonate popular events or growing trends. Crypto-Related Crimes Are On The Rise House of Streams is launching during a tense time in the crypto industry. As digital assets become more valuable, high-profile figures are being targeted . In May 2024, a crypto entrepreneur‚Äôs father was rescued from a hostage situation in France. The kidnappers had cut off one of his fingers to force access to his son‚Äôs wallet. Not long after, French crypto exchange CEO Pierre Noizat faced a similar scare . His daughter and grandson were nearly abducted in a broad daylight attack. Thankfully, authorities fought off the masked assailants with the help of a bystander. In the U.S., a man returning from a crypto event in Las Vegas was kidnapped at gunpoint. Teenagers from Florida forced him into a car, covered his head, and drove him over 70 miles into the Arizona desert. These frightening incidents have sparked urgent calls for better protection for crypto holders and influencers. As the value of digital assets climbs, so too does the risk.

Among the best crypto coins to buy now, Shiba Inu (SHIB) stands out with its deep liquidity, devoted community, and burn-driven tokenomics, all of which could send its price soaring as ETH climbs. On the other end of the spectrum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto coin still in its presale phase, is drawing comparisons to early-stage DeFi giants, with speculation mounting about its potential for exponential growth. The project has gained more than 11,700 investors who have contributed $10.1 million during the ongoing presale. Investors taking part in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will see a 100% ROI when it launches at $0.06 when the token is launched in exchanges. For those scanning the market for the next big cryptocurrency or simply deciding what crypto to buy today for short-term gains, SHIB and MUTM are positioned as two of the most explosive Ethereum-linked plays right now. Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance Presale Now Underway The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of risky meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $10.1 million total sales and attracted more than 11,700 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.03 during Phase 5 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Reimagining DeFi Lending with a Powerful Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders can depend on regular income, while borrowers find safe options when they borrow money. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users. Certified Secure: USD-Pegged Stablecoin Validated by CertiK Mutuum Finance will launch its fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Built to survive the collapses of algorithmic models, the stablecoin‚Äôs robust construction enables long-term stability and price consistency. Underpinned by open-source smart contracts and the success of a Certik audit, the platform offers a safe foundation for digital financial transactions. Mutuum Finance is pairing state-of-the-art lending features with a robust ecosystem, charting a definite course for the future of DeFi. Early Investors Reap Rewards as Community Expands As the platform gains traction, Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway prize, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. As Ethereum picks up steam, altcoins built on its network are starting to gain serious traction‚Äîand two in particular are standing out. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is getting renewed attention thanks to its active community and steady token burns, while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about new DeFi projects. With over $10.1 million raised and more than 11,700 investors already on board, MUTM is still in its presale phase at just $0.03 per token. When it goes live at $0.06, early buyers could double their investment right away. For anyone looking to ride Ethereum‚Äôs momentum, SHIB and MUTM both offer exciting upside, and now might be the perfect time to jump in.

The central bank‚Äôs stand was reasserted by Malhotra during a press conference, citing the danger that cryptocurrencies present to monetary policy and financial stability. ‚ÄúWe continue to be concerned with respect to the potential risks crypto poses to monetary policy and financial stability,‚Äù Malhotra said. Though a government committee continues to consider possible policy frameworks, the central bank has said it would not support legalization or implementation of private cryptocurrencies. Policy Pressure from the Supreme Court India‚Äôs Supreme Court has also been more forceful, urging the government to provide regulatory clarity. A bench led by Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh recently stated that complete ban was no longer possible given what is being observed on a worldwide basis. The judges found fault with the lack of a clear framework, warning that continued uncertainty puts consumers at risk and stifles innovation. The final discussion paper is to be released in June 2025, but industry players are not hopeful about progress. Regulatory Back-and-Forth Since 2018 India‚Äôs rocky past with crypto began in 2018 when the RBI disallowed banks from supporting crypto business. The Supreme Court in 2020 overruled that ban on the basis of constitutional rights violations. That comfort was short-lived, with no permanent regulatory framework to replace it. Even after the court ruling, RBI continued to raise many objections. Governor Shaktikanta Das has made many statements labeling cryptocurrencies as a ‚Äúclear danger‚Äù to economic stability and has asked for a complete ban. High Taxation, Unclear Future India implemented one of the world‚Äôs toughest tax regimes in 2022‚Äîimposing a 30% tax on crypto gains and a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on transactions. These regulations, combined with regulatory uncertainty, have held back local crypto activity. As a framework is being discussed, the RBI stance and lack of political urgency have left India‚Äôs crypto future uncertain. Stakeholders are holding out for the next discussion paper, but doubts run high that anything significant will materialize anytime soon.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-07 20:25:00

The second-largest meme coin has lost 9.4% of its value in the past week and is currently trading at $0.00001273. According to crypto data analyst Buddy King, this bearish trend might be ignited by soaring selling pressure, which has resulted in a big wave of liquidations. Mixed Reactions Engulf the Shiba Inu Ecosystem All hope is not lost because Shiba Inu is revisiting a key technical level that previously triggered a notable 400% price rally. Market analyst Yahu Crypto added, ‚ÄúThis level, often tied to strong historical support or resistance on the charts, acted as a launchpad for SHIB‚Äôs explosive growth in past market cycles. With the memecoin market showing renewed volatility and trading volume surging.‚Äù Nevertheless, the analyst added that the crypto community was torn between whether SHIB would replicate past performance or a correction was in the offing since on-chain data, such as holder sentiment and whale activity, were showing mixed signals. This is based on the fact that some investors were stashing more SHIB into their holdings, whereas others were taking profits, owing to the recent price swings. Shiba Inu‚Äôs open interest has been surging after recording a 4.11% increase to hit $163.73 million, suggesting that market liquidity and activity were still game on. Additionally, SHIB whales have been moving their holdings to cold storage in droves , signalling an all-time high blowup.

The premier cryptocurrency has somewhat struggled to break out of a consolidation range since reaching a new all-time high in the month of May. The Bitcoin price recently succumbed to bearish pressure, falling to around $101,000 on Friday, June 6. While the market leader has enjoyed some resurgence to begin the weekend, a prominent blockchain firm has now identified significant levels in the event of a return to the $100,000 level in the coming days. Here Are The Next Support Levels For BTC In a June 6 post on the social media platform X, crypto analytics firm Sentora (previously known as IntoTheBlock) revealed an interesting on-chain perspective on the price of Bitcoin and its latest dip toward $100,000. According to the intelligence platform, there are some significant levels lying just beneath the six-figure valuation threshold. This analysis is based on the average cost basis of several Bitcoin investors and the distribution of the BTC supply around the current price. For context, cost-basis analysis basically evaluates the capacity of a price level to act as support or resistance, depending on the volume of crypto last acquired by investors at this level. As observed in the chart below, the size of the dots directly corresponds with the quantity of BTC purchased within each price bracket and the region‚Äôs capacity to act as support or resistance. This implies that the larger the dot, the higher the number of coins purchased, and the stronger the support or resistance level; the green dots are support (as they are usually below the current price), while the red dots serve as resistance (as they are above the asset price). According to data by Sentora, the Bitcoin price seems to have major support within the $95,000 ‚Äì $99.000 region due to heavy accumulation by investors. This price zone would serve as an on-chain cushion for the Bitcoin price, as investors with their cost bases around the level are likely to defend their positions by acquiring more coins if the price falls toward the $95,000 ‚Äì $99,000 zone. Sentora mentioned that if the bulls do defend this support level, the Bitcoin price could be in for an extended rally. On the flip side, the on-chain firm asked investors to expect a surge in volatility if this support level fails to hold. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just above $104,400, reflecting an almost 3% increase in the past 24 hours.

Calling out this development market analyst Bit Guru noted, ‚ÄúXRP has been testing the $2.10 support level repeatedly, forming a potential descending structure with lower highs. Bears are gaining momentum as each bounce weakens, and a breakdown seems imminent if bulls fail to reclaim higher ground fast.‚Äù Even though XRP has soared to $2.20, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is not out of the woods yet. This is because it has to surge higher to avoid a pullback below $2.10, which might trigger a quick drop toward the psychological price of $2. XRP Steals the Show in Corporate Treasury Chats Despite the shaky grounds that XRP is facing, this altcoin is gaining significant attention in corporate treasury discussions, thanks to its capability to transform liquidity management and cross-border payments. For instance, Chinese AI mobility firm Webus International recently revealed that it was rolling out a $300 million XRP reserve to support real-time global payments. Notably, this decision by Webus is anchored by the firm‚Äôs commitment to lower cross-border costs. Furthermore, energy giant VivoPower inked a $121 million deal with BitGo to develop an XRP-focused treasury strategy to enhance its operational potential in the digital asset sector.

He got frustrated.‚Äù The deleted posts came just days after Elon started going after Trump over his administration‚Äôs massive tax and spending proposal, known as the ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill.‚Äù Elon, who recently wrapped up his role running the Department of Government Efficiency, had been publicly supportive of Trump just a week earlier. The sudden change shows how fast their relationship has collapsed. That bill appears to be the trigger . Elon has publicly expressed frustration that the legislation didn‚Äôt include key policy goals he had pushed for. Karoline Leavitt, Trump‚Äôs press secretary, spoke to CNN and dismissed Elon‚Äôs attacks as political whining. ‚ÄúThis is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,‚Äù Karoline said. But the Epstein accusation is what escalated things. Elon claimed the reason certain Epstein documents haven‚Äôt been released is because Trump‚Äôs name is in them. He gave no proof, no documents, and no follow-up. Just a bold accusation and then silence. Trump responds with warnings and ends relationship Speaking to Kristen Welker of NBC News on Saturday, Trump said Elon would face ‚Äúserious consequences‚Äù if he backs Democratic candidates in the next election. ‚ÄúIf he does, he‚Äôll have to pay the consequences for that,‚Äù Trump said in the phone interview. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that,‚Äù he added, though he didn‚Äôt explain what those consequences might be. Trump then made it clear the relationship is over. ‚ÄúI gave him a lot of breaks, long before this happened,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI gave him breaks in my first administration and saved his life in my first administration. I have no intention of speaking to him.‚Äù When asked if the relationship is finished, Trump replied, ‚ÄúI would assume so.‚Äù He also criticized Elon for being ‚Äúdisrespectful to the office of the president.‚Äù KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Economy|United States,EN,0,0,REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-07 20:50:51

Captured in a candid, no-hype interview clip shared by well-known content creator and XRP advocate Ray Fuentes, journalist Vincent Scott shared his unfiltered perspective on the transformative nature of Ripple‚Äôs technology and the evolving role of XRP in global finance. A Defining Question at XRP Las Vegas The interview, which has been widely circulated on social media, centers on a key exchange between Vincent Scott and Ripple CTO David Schwartz during the XRP Las Vegas event. Speaking in the video, Scott said, ‚ÄúI got a question answered by David Schwartz yesterday.‚Äù When prompted by the interviewer to elaborate, he revealed the question he posed to Schwartz was: ‚ÄúDid Ripple build a financial system?‚Äù Scott‚Äôs explanation that followed was deeply technical, yet underscored a revolutionary premise: that Ripple and XRP may be doing more than just enhancing payments; they may be redefining the infrastructure of value transfer itself. ‚ÄúDid Ripple build a new financial system?‚Äù @VincentSco72192 says YES‚Äîand breaks down how $XRP , DLT, and @Ripple are rewriting the rules of money. This raw, no-hype interview from #XRPLV2025 is a must-watch. Watch now: https://t.co/1efjyIL5Fm #XRP #Ripple #Crypto pic.twitter.com/Xk415VcLBm ‚Äî rayfuentes (@RayFuentesIO) June 6, 2025 Vincent Scott‚Äôs Interpretation: A System Redefined by Utility Scott elaborated on the question‚Äôs context by dissecting the layered functionality of XRP within the emerging financial architecture: ‚ÄúI went on to explain when the unit of account could transmit over a method of payment. XRP through the means of exchange, through either gas to be burnt for the facilitation of the actual transaction or a money processor to convert to whatever Stablecoin or tokenized asset that you want with stores of value as RWA‚Äôs or anything else back in the unit of the account.‚Äù In this view, XRP acts not merely as a bridge asset or transaction token but as an integral component within a broader value transmission mechanism. Whether used as gas, an intermediary currency, or a facilitator of tokenized assets such as real-world assets (RWAs), XRP becomes the technological backbone of a new model ‚Äî one where value can move with internet-like efficiency and near-zero friction. Schwartz‚Äôs response to this theoretical framing was direct and impactful. According to Scott, ‚ÄúDavid Schwartz said Yes, that‚Äôs the financial system.‚Äù Implications for the Global Monetary Landscape Scott‚Äôs analysis ventures far beyond technicalities. He sees this emerging infrastructure as a seismic threat to the entrenched global financial order. ‚ÄúNow what we have in our hands here for the transmission of value and internet of value,‚Äù he stated, ‚Äúthis is a new way of transacting throughout the world, and what that means for the Federal Reserve System‚Ä¶‚Äù We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 His statement then turned sharply political, alluding to controversial underpinnings of the traditional monetary system. ‚ÄúThis system has been propped up by CIA coups, blackmails, and the Epstein stuff. It‚Äôs pretty evil what they‚Äôve done throughout the entire world, and there‚Äôs blood on the hands of the people who have put this system upon us, and we need to all get out of it.‚Äù While these remarks reflect a personal and impassioned view, they underscore a broader sentiment within parts of the crypto community ‚Äî that blockchain-based systems, especially those with decentralized traits or open standards, could offer an alternative to centralized, opaque, and politically manipulated financial institutions. Contextualizing Ripple‚Äôs Role in the Financial Future Ripple has long positioned itself at the intersection of legacy finance and blockchain innovation. Its global payment solution, RippleNet, has been adopted by hundreds of financial institutions, while the company has continued to push forward with tokenization initiatives, including the December 2024 launch of RLUSD, designed to bridge institutional finance and the XRP Ledger. Moreover, the XRPL ecosystem has expanded significantly with developments such as the EVM sidechain (led by Peersyst Technology) and integrations with central bank digital currency (CBDC) platforms across various jurisdictions. These tools, combined with XRP‚Äôs role as a neutral, liquid, and interoperable asset, give weight to Scott‚Äôs suggestion that Ripple may have built, or is actively building, a financial system of its own.

This led to slight losses in Bitcoin institutional products last week, although the recent court decision on tariffs played a huge role. Several crypto analysts have tipped another bull movement due to whale purchases and long-term holder repositioning. Bitcoin Whales Are Buying Heavy On-chain data shows massive institutional Bitcoin adoption, potentially opening up a new bull phase. Digital asset analyst Amr Taha pointed to increased spot volumes, whale accumulations, and other positive metrics behind higher Bitcoin trader optimism. According to the data, long-term holders (LTH) net realized metric soared above the $20 billion mark. This becomes crucial to access the market‚Äôs state in line with historical data. LTH rapid buys always precede a bullish phase, as seen in 2021 and 2024. Recent movements also spiked optimism to new highs, backed by new capital flows. Long-term holders received this traction because, unlike retail traders who often prioritize profit taking, they refrain from sales during price dips. ‚Äú The convergence of rising exchange dominance, long-term holder confidence, and supply tightening paints a bullish picture for Bitcoin. While short-term corrections are possible, the underlying demand and reduction in available BTC on exchanges suggest that the uptrend is far from over. Furthermore, outflows from centralized crypto exchanges led to price gains before another correction. In the last 48 hours, Kraken and Bitfinex saw over 20,000 BTC offloads. Transfers out of exchanges soar trader confidence due to a higher chance of long-term holdings and decentralized finance (DeFi) activities in the case of meme coins. Crypto trader Ali Martinez flagged massive whale accumulations this week. Over the last four days, whales picked up 30,000 BTC, highly influenced by surging institutional participation . Mainstream Adoption Behind Soaring Bitcoin Optimism CryptoQuant data shows wallets with above 1000 BTC adding tokens at a steady pace. An interesting aspect is the ‚Äúyoung/new whale addresses‚Äù have gained more exposure to Bitcoin in the last two months. This is directly linked to growing institutional interest in crypto assets. While the United States leads the pack, other jurisdictions have also beefed up holdings. Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy continues to accumulate above 581,000 tokens worth approximately $60.4 billion. As companies increase exposure, governments are leaning toward the market, seeking to drive investment. Recently, Pakistan‚Äôs crypto task force unveiled a strategic Bitcoin reserve similar to the United States model.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-07 20:59:39

With Ruvi AI being touted as a 100x growth project industry experts are watching this rivalry unfold. Avalanche (AVAX): A Blockchain for Scalability and Speed Avalanche has been a foundation of blockchain since its launch in September 2020. Known for its high throughput and scalability Avalanche gives developers a platform to build decentralized applications (dApps) with near instant finality. Its consensus mechanism Avalanche Consensus has set the bar for energy efficiency and performance. Avalanche‚Äôs architecture X-Chain, P-Chain and C-Chain makes it versatile and can cater to many use cases while maintaining security and decentralization. This has made it a go to platform for developers and enterprises to build and scale Web3 projects. But the evolving blockchain landscape has brought new players like Ruvi AI and investors are looking for disruption and high growth. Ruvi AI (RUVI): Blockchain and AI Ruvi AI is unlike anything in the crypto space. A decentralized superapp that combines AI and blockchain. This allows Ruvi AI to produce AI driven text, audio, video and image content for industries from digital marketing to creative arts and content automation. The $RUVI token is at the heart of its ecosystem and serves multiple purposes such as transactions, premium features, staking rewards and governance to its community. By solving real world problems with practical applications Ruvi AI is carving a niche for itself as a versatile and innovative blockchain project. Strong Presale Momentum Since the presale started Ruvi AI has been on a roll. The first phase sold out in 2 weeks and tokens were priced at $0.010. Early investors saw a rapid increase in value as the token price went to $0.015 for the ongoing Phase 2. That‚Äôs a 50% gain for those who got in early.The numbers don‚Äôt lie. Over 1,400 holders have already joined the Ruvi AI ecosystem and the project has raised $1.5 million and sold 135 million tokens. Ruvi AI has also got its first listing and partnered with a major exchange and more announcements are coming soon. Momentum is building for adoption. Investment Tiers Ruvi AI‚Äôs presale has a tiered investment structure that gives bonuses based on the level of investment. Here‚Äôs how it works: VIP 2 Threshold : 50,000 RUVI ($750 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 40% (20,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 70,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $4,900 (553% ROI). Value at $1 (Predicted Post-Listing Price) : $70,000 (9,233% ROI). VIP 3 Threshold : 100,000 RUVI ($1,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 60% (60,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 160,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $11,200 (647% ROI). Value at $1 (Predicted Post-Listing Price) : $160,000 (10,567% ROI). VIP 5 Threshold : 500,000 RUVI ($7,500 at $0.015/token). Bonus : 100% (500,000 additional tokens). Total Tokens : 1,000,000. Value at $0.07 Listing Price : $70,000 (833% ROI). Value at $1 (Predicted Post-Listing Price) : $1,000,000 (13,233% ROI) These numbers are why Ruvi AI is the talk of the town. Why RUVI? So why is Ruvi AI getting so much attention from analysts and investors? First, it‚Äôs the project‚Äôs ability to combine blockchain and AI into one ecosystem that solves real world problems. From marketing workflows to AI tools for everyone, Ruvi AI is a token with utility beyond speculation. Second, its transparent and community driven governance model is what today‚Äôs investors want. Paired with a solid roadmap and a fast growing user base, Ruvi AI has all the ingredients of a successful project. Experts Back Ruvi AI Ruvi AI is the new generation of blockchain projects that marry technology with value. While Avalanche has laid the foundation in the crypto space, Ruvi AI‚Äôs growth and 100x potential makes it a top performer for investors looking for high returns. With a successful presale underway, partnerships in place and real world use cases defining its narrative, Ruvi AI is a rising star in the crypto universe. If you want to be part of this revolution, now is the time to get in.

Two contenders, Ruvi AI and Tron , are vying for investor attention, but their potential for profit differs significantly. While Tron is an established player with a strong blockchain base, Ruvi AI‚Äôs ongoing presale and groundbreaking focus on real-world utility give it the edge. Here‚Äôs how these tokens compare and why Ruvi AI could be the one to watch as the year closes. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Presale Momentum Builds Investor Confidence Ruvi AI is rapidly gaining traction with a hugely successful Phase 2 presale . At this stage, the project has raised $1.5 million and sold nearly 135 million tokens . With a token price of just $0.015 , it‚Äôs an accessible opportunity for early investors seeking significant returns. What makes Ruvi AI unique is its $0.07 valuation at the end of the presale, which isn‚Äôt merely speculative but baked into the presale structure. On top of that, analysts predict a post-listing valuation of $1 per token . For those investing now, the potential upside before year‚Äôs end is immense. This early-stage growth offers a more exciting trajectory compared to Tron, which has already matured within the crypto ecosystem. Tron‚Äôs Steady but Limited Growth Path Tron has carved a niche for itself in building decentralized entertainment applications. Its blockchain provides fast transaction speeds and high throughput, earning it a solid position among traditional cryptocurrencies. However, as a well-established token, Tron‚Äôs growth potential is largely tethered to incremental updates and broader market trends. While Tron continues to build its ecosystem, its appeal to new investors may not be as dynamic. Unlike Ruvi AI, whose presale opportunity offers exponential growth potential, Tron‚Äôs mature market cap means smaller percentage gains for its holders. Real-World Utility Propels Ruvi AI Ahead One of the key differentiators of Ruvi AI is its real-world utility . The project integrates blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI) to solve industry-specific challenges. Its applications include: Healthcare : Ruvi AI helps streamline diagnostics and medical processes, making healthcare delivery more efficient and accurate. Logistics : By improving supply chain operations, the platform allows businesses to save costs and manage inventory more effectively. Finance : Ruvi AI strengthens cybersecurity by detecting fraud and safeguarding financial transactions. These practical applications ensure Ruvi AI isn‚Äôt just riding a trend but actively addressing pressing challenges across industries. This focus positions it for widespread adoption and scalability compared to Tron, which remains limited in scope. Maximizing ROI with Ruvi AI‚Äôs VIP Tiers Ruvi AI sweetens its presale with an attractive VIP investment structure. Backers receive bonus tokens based on their tier, maximizing their returns. Here‚Äôs what investors can expect: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . This tier system incentivizes early adoption, highlighting Ruvi AI‚Äôs confidence in delivering strong returns for investors who commit early. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out Before Year‚Äôs End Ruvi AI‚Äôs calculated presale structure, combined with its real-world applications, lends it a unique appeal. Its potential to scale across multiple industries ensures demand well beyond the crypto space. Add to that a predicted value jump to $1 per token post-listing, and the reasons to invest become increasingly compelling. By contrast, Tron offers stability but without the explosive growth potential that Ruvi AI provides during its nascent stage. For investors seeking to maximize profits before the year concludes, Ruvi AI shines as a standout choice.

In a market driven by increasing greed, these altcoins might be on the verge of remarkable performance. This article delves into the factors that could propel these coins to new heights, providing insights on which tokens are primed for growth. AVAX upbeat Opportunities Amid Volatile Trends AVAX price movement over the last month shows a modest gain of nearly 3% despite a slight weekly decline. The half-year view reveals a significant drop of about 63%. The situation reflects mixed sentiment, with short-term improvements clashing against long-term downward trends. Brief positive momentum has not erased the pain from the steep cumulative loss over six months. Historical behavior indicates rapid downturns accompanied by intermittent signs of recovery, suggesting that recent gains could be fragile in the context of substantial seasonal underperformance. The current trading landscape finds Avalanche moving between a low of around $17.67 and a peak of $25.40, with immediate resistance at $29.98 and support at $14.52. Bears appear to dominate as indicated by declining momentum figures and a lower RSI reading. A second resistance around $37.70 presents a potential ceiling for further gains, while deeper support at $6.79 serves as a risk management point. Traders might consider accumulating at the lower support level, using the resistance plateau for profit-taking while observing if buying interest can overcome bearish trends. Aptos Market Outlook: Price Behavior and Key Support Levels APT prices dropped slightly over the past month with a decline of around 1.57%, while the half-year period saw a steep fall of approximately 67.45%. The coin‚Äôs movement has been modest recently yet painful over the longer term. Price activity remained subdued despite the steady downturn, indicating that investor sentiment has been cautious during both intervals. Past performance reveals that APT experienced short-term corrections accompanied by a sustained bearish phase, leaving room for potential recovery should market conditions shift favorably. APT currently trades between a low of $4.08 and a high of $5.83. The nearest support level is marked at $3.43, with short-term resistance near $6.92. Additional benchmarks include secondary support at $1.68 and resistance close to $8.67. Momentum indicators show a market influenced by bearish pressure. The RSI value at 41.85 suggests selling pressure persists. Technical signals lean negative, and there is no clear bullish trend as price action stays confined within established support and resistance lines. Traders might consider short-term buying opportunities near support while watching resistance. Conclusion Both AVAX and APT show signs of strong potential for gains. Market trends indicate growing interest in these altcoins. AVAX offers unique features that attract investors. APT is gaining attention for its innovative approach. With increasing market attention, these altcoins could outperform others. The rising market enthusiasm supports this outlook. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In a market flooded with speculation and overhyped tokens, discovering projects with utility, innovation, and sustainable growth potential is rare. Today‚Äôs web3 participants are actively scanning the digital frontier for real tools, real use cases, and real profits. Qubetics , a revolutionary web3 aggregator, is quickly becoming the standout project in this search ‚Äî not just for its token value but for the real-world blockchain applications it brings through powerful no-code development tools and cross-chain infrastructure. While many cryptocurrencies fight for attention with dated models or stagnated ecosystems, a few are breaking new ground. Qubetics, with its all-in-one ecosystem and rapidly selling Qubetics presale, is a powerful contender. Meanwhile, Injective is building real traction in decentralized finance, and XRP remains a dominant force in enterprise crypto solutions. This article dives deep into why these three stand out in the race for the best crypto ICOs to invest, comparing their real-world functionality, technological innovation, and growth potential. Qubetics: Where Functionality Meets Web3 Aggregation ‚Äì The Best Crypto ICOs to Invest Qubetics isn‚Äôt just another coin with lofty ambitions; it‚Äôs a full-fledged blockchain ecosystem that solves real-world problems through modular, no-code tools. Positioned as the world‚Äôs first true web3 aggregator, Qubetics bridges leading blockchains and unifies fragmented tools into one seamless experience. This positions it as one of the best crypto ICOs to invest in for those seeking long-term value over hype-driven volatility. The flagship of Qubetics‚Äô application layer is QubeQode IDE ‚Äî a powerful, user-friendly development environment crafted for businesses, creators, and developers alike. QubeQode combines drag-and-drop blockchain components with form-based configuration, making token deployment, authentication, and smart contracts accessible to those without coding backgrounds. A small e-commerce startup can launch its own loyalty token in minutes. An educational institution could roll out verifiable academic credentials using the same drag-and-drop tools. What takes this platform to the next level is its Code Snippet Library. Rather than starting from scratch, early adopters can access pre-written modules to integrate wallet authentication, token management, and data interactions instantly. This saves both time and technical overhead ‚Äî a major win for time-sensitive web3 projects. Qubetics‚Äô ability to appeal to multiple demographics ‚Äî from fintech companies to NFT creators ‚Äî makes it an incredibly versatile project. It‚Äôs not hard to see why it‚Äôs catching attention as one of the best crypto ICOs to invest in 2025. While many platforms cater solely to developers or enterprise users, Qubetics breaks down barriers and welcomes both with open infrastructure. Qubetics Final Presale Stage Positions Itself Among the Best Crypto ICOs to Invest With Listing Price Set at $0.40 Qubetics is now in Stage 37, the final phase of its public token sale. The current price for $TICS is fixed at $0.3370, with the listing price confirmed at $0.40. The project has raised over $17.7 million, sold more than 515 million tokens, and onboarded over 27,500 holders to date. With just 10 million tokens left in this final phase, Qubetics is increasingly being viewed as one of the best crypto ICOs to invest, particularly by participants who prioritize structured pricing and well-defined supply limits before public launch. Qubetics has also updated its tokenomics to support long-term viability. The total token supply has been reduced from more than 4 billion to 1.36 billion, helping establish scarcity from the outset. Additionally, the public sale allocation has increased to 38.55%, which allows for broader community access and strengthens decentralization. These adjustments aim to create a more sustainable value framework and support ongoing participation in network development. From an investment perspective, a $2,000 allocation at the presale price of $0.3370 secures approximately 5,937 $TICS tokens. When the token is listed at $0.40, the value of that stake increases to $2,400. If $TICS reaches $5 in a future cycle, that same investment could rise to $29,685. At a $10 value, it would reach $59,370. These calculations are based on current supply levels and confirmed listing details. With its final stage underway and a clear structure in place, Qubetics is being closely followed as one of the best crypto ICOs to invest for those seeking early exposure to a project with measurable metrics and long-term utility potential. Injective Protocol: The Smart Chain of DeFi Innovation Injective continues to be a dominant force within the decentralized finance space, creating a highly interoperable DeFi infrastructure that goes far beyond a standard Layer-1 blockchain. Its smart contract capabilities are built specifically for finance-based applications ‚Äî including derivatives, spot trading, and prediction markets ‚Äî making it a powerful choice for those focused on financial instruments and automated trading. At its core, Injective differentiates itself by being built on the Cosmos SDK, allowing for cross-chain interoperability. Developers using Injective can launch permissionless, fully customizable DeFi apps while tapping into a robust liquidity pool connected across blockchains. That means faster transactions, minimal fees, and real-time settlement capabilities ‚Äî all without compromising decentralization. Recently, Injective has ramped up its on-chain activity through strategic partnerships with data providers and oracles. By focusing on real-time data integration, it enhances its utility in building smart financial contracts, which is drawing attention from algorithmic trading firms and DeFi institutions alike. Additionally, its burn auction mechanism and token scarcity model continuously reduce $INJ supply, contributing to long-term value potential. Injective‚Äôs appeal lies in its commitment to programmable finance. Its native token $INJ serves not just as a medium of exchange, but as a governance tool that supports fee capture and staking rewards. Whether it‚Äôs building next-gen DEXs or deploying synthetic assets, Injective remains a go-to protocol for serious DeFi builders. XRP: The Enterprise-Grade Settlement Layer for Global Payments XRP, powered by Ripple Labs, has long held its ground as a leader in global payment solutions. Unlike many cryptocurrencies chasing retail hype, XRP has always focused on one major use case: cross-border transactions at lightning speed and ultra-low cost. It delivers what traditional SWIFT systems can‚Äôt ‚Äî real-time global settlements with minimal friction. What makes XRP especially relevant today is its ability to facilitate liquidity for financial institutions, central banks, and remittance companies. Major banking partners continue to utilize RippleNet to tap into XRP for on-demand liquidity, especially in regions where traditional infrastructure struggles to keep up. With regulatory clarity in key jurisdictions and strong enterprise adoption, XRP remains a staple in high-volume transactions. The token‚Äôs speed is unmatched ‚Äî processing up to 1,500 transactions per second ‚Äî and its fee structure remains under a fraction of a penny. Its deflationary supply model and consensus algorithm provide network stability without requiring energy-intensive proof-of-work mechanisms. XRP has also gained traction for its sustainability credentials.

In fact, DappRadar‚Äôs latest findings identify May 2025 as a turning point for the dapp sector. During the same period, the NFT market also saw signs of life. Turning Point for the Dapp Ecosystem In May, the dapp industry exhibited renewed optimism as the daily Unique Active Wallets (dUAW) rose 8% to 25 million, amid broader positive market trends. Notable growth was seen in three key sectors: AI dapps surged 23% to 4.8 million dUAW, social dapps grew 21% to 4.3 million, and NFT dapps increased 9% to 3.9 million. These sector-specific gains indicate stronger user engagement and contribute to a more balanced dapp ecosystem, according to DappRadar‚Äôs report . Meanwhile, AI, DeFi, and gaming dapps were found to have been converging in terms of user activity, and each captured a similar share, which evidenced a diversified and maturing market The DeFi sector also maintained strong growth as the Total Value Locked (TVL) surged by 25% to around $200 billion. This growth aligns with the overall market rally, driven by Bitcoin‚Äôs new all-time high and Ethereum‚Äôs 40% price increase, which boosted DeFi asset values and liquidity. Decentralized exchange Hyperliquid stood out by reaching $244 billion in trading volume, capturing about 10% of Binance‚Äôs market share despite massive criticism from prominent industry players after the controversial handling of a market manipulation incident. This achievement positioned Hyperliquid among the top 5 exchanges by trading volume, across both centralized and decentralized platforms, and within the top 10 by TVL across all blockchain networks. NFT Market Rebounds Meanwhile, the NFT market showed renewed activity in May, with trading volume rising 40% month-over-month to $280 million. Transaction counts also climbed 35%, totaling 2.7 million. Although these figures signal improving momentum, DappRadar said that it is premature to call it a full recovery. Continued growth over the coming months will be crucial, but the recent gains still offer a promising sign for the sector. Ethereum regained its lead in the NFT market in May, with a 30% jump in trading volume and a 53% market share. It was followed by Immutable zkEVM at 13% and Abstract at 10%. Abstract‚Äôs 1200% surge was largely driven by speculation tied to farming incentives and potential airdrops.

As a ratings platform, Weiss Ratings reported that interest levels make up 50% of the federal deficit. ‚ÄúTotal U.S. federal debt is $34 trillion. That‚Äôs an increase of $11 trillion in just four years, the fastest pace in history. At roughly $1 trillion a year, interest alone now accounts for half the federal deficit.‚Äù The report read. Speaking on the dangers of the new development in the U.S. economy, Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, brought attention to the emerging U.S. debt market crisis. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big deal, it is a real problem,‚Äù he remarked. Bitcoin as an antidote to economic collapse In a follow-up response, Weiss‚Äôs Crypto rating outlined a bullish scenario that could unfold if the current market pattern continues. Should the Treasury market collapse with the introduction of new issuance, the Federal Reserve system could kick off a fiat currency printing spree; a move that could position Bitcoin and other crypto assets as better alternatives. ‚ÄúThe moment the Treasury market cracks under a mountain of new issuance, the Fed will ride to the rescue to buy U.S. government debt. They will print with reckless abandon, debase the currency, launching crypto (and other assets) straight into the stratosphere.‚Äù The report read. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are increasingly considered alternative assets capable of combating inflation for traditional market players. Notably, Ryan Cohen, the CEO of GameStop referred to Bitcoin as an inflation hedge against traditional currencies.

Notably, one prominent analyst whose bullish sentiments remain untested is predicting that Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous founder of Bitcoin, could record a massive increase in his net worth. In the near term, Nakamoto‚Äôs net worth could topple that of longtime Billionaires Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg , he asserted. Eric Balchunas, the senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg who took to X to share his outlook, is painting a bullish scenario for Bitcoin to validate this prediction. Balchunas outlined the possibilities in a post shared with his 357,000 followers, remarking that Satoshi Nakamoto could be catapulted to a new position in the world‚Äôs billionaire list if Bitcoin follows its historical yearly trend of attaining a 50% increase in price value. This year, Nakamoto could replace Warren Buffett and go on to knock out Mark Zuckerberg to become the second richest billionaire, he asserted. At report time, Bitcoin is trading at $105,422. A 50% increase in Bitcoin‚Äôs current price will result in a total value of $158,133. ‚ÄúIf bitcoin does its normal 50%, then Satoshi will pass Buffett this year and Zuck sometime next year-ish to be #2 richest in the world (Elon has a huge lead).

The Ethereum competitor will likely rally towards its $165 target, a 13% rally within the next week. While Ethereum draws the interest of institutional investors, Solana is competing through partnerships and decentralized applications on the blockchain. Table of Contents Solana price forecast SOL could rally for these three reasons Solana derivatives analysis How Trump-Musk tussle influenced Solana price Solana: A one-trick pony or not Solana price forecast According to technical indicators on the SOL/USDT daily price chart, Solana ( SOL ) could soon observe a trend reversal. SOL is trading at $149.92, and the Ethereum ( ETH ) competitor could rally 13% and test resistance at $170, the upper boundary of the FVG on the daily price chart. Above $170, there are two key resistances: R1, which is the psychologically important price level of $200, and R2, which is the lower boundary of an FVG on the daily price chart, at $218.40. The RSI on the SOL/USDT price chart reads 39 and slopes upwards. MACD flashes red histogram bars under the neutral line. The OBV indicator shows a bullish divergence, with the price heading downwards while the OBV indicator slopes upward. The divergence is typically a sign of a potential trend reversal. In this case, the consolidation likely ends and SOL price changes in the coming week.

Solana‚Äôs meme coin ecosystem tanked in response to the tussle between U.S. President Donald Trump and Tesla Chief Elon Musk. In the past week, the past 24 hours, and on Friday, the sector‚Äôs market capitalization has declined. The market cap of the Solana meme coin ecosystem has fallen 5% in the past 24 hours to nearly $10 billion. It is likely that once the tussle settles, Solana could resume its uptrend.

Solana has made strides with gains on Friday, it remains to be seen whether the token can wipeout the losses from the past seven days, in the coming week. The Trump-Musk tussle‚Äôs impact is felt in the Solana meme coin ecosystem, with a steep decline in market capitalization. A 5% drop within a 24-hour timeframe is significant, and a recovery is less likely unless led by a catalyst. Solana: A one-trick pony or not Analysts at Standard Chartered, the banking giant, labeled Solana a one-trick pony for the meme coin ecosystem‚Äôs role in pushing SOL‚Äôs price and value higher in the past year. However, it is likely that there is more to SOL with stablecoins, DeFi protocols and partnership announcements in 2025 alone. Standard Chartered meme coins have stress-tested the blockchain in the past, proving its scalability and throughput are effective and paving the way for higher adoption and partnerships. In their report, Standard Chartered suggests Solana expand to other sectors to boost its utility, however SOL generates higher volume and utility from meme coin transactions in the past year. While usage may have declined since the peak of the meme coin rally. Meme coin utility peak | Source: Standard Chartered Solana trades at $150 at the time of writing on Friday.

This bag has significantly supercharged his net worth, but not without some controversies. In clear terms, Trump‚Äôs net worth, including real estate, is approximately $5.6 billion. President Donald Trump Holds $900 Million in Liquid Assets Trump entered new crypto-related ventures just before the US presidential elections, which he eventually won in November. Since then, he has accumulated up to $1 billion in crypto assets. According to a Forbes report, he currently holds about $900 million worth of liquid assets, and up to half of this amount comes from his crypto pursuits. From Forbes‚Äô calculation , crypto has done more than elevate Trump‚Äôs net worth. It has equally made liquidity available for him. For context, the US president was drowning in cash scarcity as of a year ago. At the time, he could only boast of having $400 million on his balance sheet while he had more than $500 million in legal judgments against him. TRUMP Memecoin Gains Industry Traction Trump launched his memecoin, TRUMP, just before he assumed office as the POTUS. In such a short while, the crypto asset has become a phenomenon in the digital currency space. He recently highlighted the idea that TRUMP serves as a reflection of public sentiment toward his leadership. Tokenomist data suggests that only 26.48% of TRUMP‚Äôs total supply has been unlocked. This leaves about 73.52%, approximately 735 million tokens, on lock. Per a scheduled unlock, another 50 million TRUMP tokens will hit the market by July 18. This holding is valued at over $520 million. Trump Receives Criticism Over Crypto Involvement Some critics are concerned about Trump‚Äôs involvement with crypto and foreign investors. In April, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised concerns about the possible impact of Trump‚Äôs support for cryptocurrencies. This sect believes that U.S. laws supporting stablecoins¬†could affect Europe‚Äôs financial markets. On this basis, the ECB urged EU lawmakers to make the Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation tougher to reduce these potential risks. While the impact on potential Web3 businesses are high, the safety of consumers remain the top priority for EU lawmakers.

The lawyer fired back at an X user who made several claims about the token, including a statement that XRP‚Äôs legal status remains undefined. Bill Morgan retorted, explaining that the Judge had in fact established that XRP was not a security. Notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission did not counter the Judge‚Äôs assertion during the legal battle between the regulator and Ripple. ‚ÄúThis is a lie.

The New York court decision on President Trump‚Äôs tariff plan boosted investor sentiment mid-week. Last week‚Äôs fund flows highlighted a slight geographical shift, although the United States remained dominant due to institutional demand. A String Of Consecutive Weekly Inflows The digital asset market remains bullish following recent global institutional investment. A recent CoinShares Fund Flows shows a $286 million inflow, marking the seventh consecutive weekly gain. Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap, saw swift exits, recording $8 million outflows. Bitcoin started the week in the green zone on the heels of institutional accumulation but lost steam after a New York court decided on recent White House tariffs. Still, Bitcoin price trades within the $106k zone, though down from its $111k all-time high. Bulls are optimistic due to publicly-listed firms acquiring the assets. Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy purchased 705 BTC on Monday, taking holdings to 580,955 BTC. Although the buy was the smallest in several weeks, Strategy bolstered wider interest. Japanese Metaplanet also scooped up more assets in the same period. Meanwhile, Ether was the highest gainer last week as institutional funds attracted a massive $321 million. This brings the figure for the last six weeks to $1.19 billion as investors remain keen on an altcoin resurgence. Monthly figures are now up to $889 million while assets under management jumped above $14 billion. Spot Ethereum ETFs in the United States also notched gains within the week. Last month, the general spike in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities was a major ETH driver. This string of bullish inflows marks the highest Ether run since December 2024. XRP Loses Institutional Momentum Per the data, XRP shed $28 million in the last seven days, stretching monthly losses, while year-to-date figures remain in the green zone. XRP saw huge gains earlier this year on the back of an expected spot ETF approval, but lost momentum after delayed decisions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Odds are still in favor for an approval this year. ‚Äú Regionally, investor focus shifted somewhat away from the US, which still recorded inflows of US$199m last week. Germany and Australia saw inflows of US$42.9m and US$21.5m, respectively. Meanwhile, Hong Kong experienced its strongest weekly post-seed inflows since the launch of exchange-traded products just over a year ago, totalling US$54.8 million.‚Äù",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Ethereum News|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-07 21:42:39

With whispers of a 44x ROI potential, MUTM is quickly becoming a top contender for those wondering what crypto to invest in before the next market surge. Dogecoin Targets $5 as 2025 Heats Up Even through market ups and downs, Dogecoin (DOGE), remains one of the most notable cryptocurrencies to look at. DOGE is trading around $0.195 in June 2025 and due to its strong fan base, previous volatility and possible upswing, people are discussing how it might hit the $5 mark. Even though many think DOGE will stay around $0.80 in the near term, some enthusiasts believe that the introduction of crypto ETFs, updated laws and a revival in the retail market will launch another huge rally. Investors are talking a lot lately about the best crypto to acquire now and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is joining the conversation as a coin with great potential. MUTM‚Äôs Rise Has Only Just Begun Mutuum Finance is now in Phase 5 of its presale, following a sell-out of Phase 4. Tokens are available at $0.03, prior to their listing price of $0.06, which is a 100% gain for phase 3 investors upon the token‚Äôs launch. With over $10.1 million raised and a growing community of 11,700+ investors, MUTM is quickly making a name for itself in the DeFi market. The price will increase to $0.035 in the subsequent round, hence the investors who buy now can realize an immediate 16.67% profit. Reinventing DeFi Lending: A Smarter, Hybrid Model The uniqueness of Mutuum Finance is in its innovative hybrid lending mechanism, which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. With P2C, users are able to lock stablecoins like USDT into smart contract-implemented liquidity pools to earn passive income automatically. Meanwhile, the P2P mode allows lenders and borrowers to be matched directly, without intermediaries, with customized loan conditions and better privacy. This dual approach gives users the best of both worlds: greater decentralization, flexibility, and competitive yields. Rewards for Early Investors Fuel Ongoing Community Growth As Mutuum Finance continues to grow, it remains committed to its earliest supporters. To show appreciation, 10 early investors will be selected to share a $100,000 giveaway ‚Äîeach receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens in recognition of their foundational role in the project. Built on Trust: Fully Audited and Stablecoin-Ready Mutuum Finance is not just about innovation but also about transparency and security. Its open-source smart contracts have been audited by Certik, one of the top names in blockchain security. Along with that, the platform is developing a fully collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin, specially designed to avoid the weaknesses that leads to the downfall of algorithmic stablecoins. The stablecoin will be one of the key pillars of the ecosystem, further reinforcing the long-term stability and trustworthiness of Mutuum Finance. Dogecoin and Mutuum Finance are both gaining attention in 2025, but for very different reasons. DOGE, sitting around $0.19, still benefits from its strong community and the hope of another breakout‚Äîthough most analysts see it more realistically reaching $0.78 by year‚Äôs end. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a newer DeFi project offering real use cases and strong growth potential. It‚Äôs already raised over $10.1 million and attracted more than 11,700 investors. At $0.03 per token in Phase 5 of its presale, early buyers could see a 2x return at launch‚Äîand possibly much more if growth continues. For those looking ahead, MUTM might be the more practical pick.

Amid the current price action, crypto analyst Decode has provided insights into whether the leading crypto will rally to $120,000 or drop below $100,000 next. Analyst Reveals What‚Äôs Next For The Bitcoin Price In an X post, Decode shared an accompanying chart in which he made an ABC wave analysis of the current Bitcoin price action. Based on his analysis, the leading crypto is expected to drop below $100,000 before it rallies to a new ATH of $120,000. The chart showed that BTC could fall to as low as $96,500 on the Wave B corrective move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Bounces Off Re-Accumulation Zone: Why $120,000 Could Be Next This drop to $96,500 is expected to happen this month. Once that is done, Decode predicts that the Bitcoin price could rally above $120,500 before the end of July. This will mark the Wave C impulsive move to the upside. This aligns with veteran trader Peter Brandt‚Äôs prediction that BTC could reach as high as $150,000 by late summer. However, crypto analyst KillaXBT has predicted that the Bitcoin price could hit the $120,000 target by mid-June. This coincides with the June FOMC meeting, which is scheduled for June 17 and 18. A Fed rate cut could serve as the catalyst for such a parabolic rally from the current BTC price level. According to CME FedWatch data, there is a 97.4% chance that the Fed would keep interest rates unchanged. As such, market participants aren‚Äôt expecting a rate cut, which is why the Bitcoin price could pump massively if Jerome Powell and the FOMC were to surprise everyone. Moreover, US President Donald Trump yesterday urged the Fed to cut rates by a full point. A Breakout Might Be On The Cards In an X post, crypto analyst Titan of Crypto suggested that a breakout could be imminent for the Bitcoin price. He noted that BTC is progressing inside a 4-hour falling wedge, which indicates a bullish reversal pattern. If confirmed, the analyst stated that the breakout could target the $107,500 and $109,500 zones, which are the Fibonacci confluence areas. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Puts Bitcoin Price At $120,000 If This Range Breakout Happens Crypto analyst Kevin Capital highlighted the solid V-shape recovery for the Bitcoin price after the leading crypto dropped to as low as $100,000 on May 5. However, the analyst noted that BTC‚Äôs rebound back to the $105,000 zone won‚Äôt matter until it breaks above the $106,800 level. The leading crypto must also show actual follow-through with 3-day to 1-week closes to support a breakout. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $105,000.

Its methodical development and focus on scalability earned it a loyal following. However, recent market trends suggest Cardano‚Äôs momentum is slowing, leaving room for emerging projects like Ruvi AI to take the spotlight. With its robust technology and growing investor interest, Ruvi AI appears set to lead the next bull run. Here‚Äôs why. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Presale Is Off to an Explosive Start Unlike Cardano, which is grappling with its next growth phase, Ruvi AI is surging forward with an immensely successful Phase 2 presale . To date, the project has raised $1.5 million and sold nearly 135 million tokens , signaling strong investor confidence and excitement. At a remarkably low entry price of $0.015 per token , Ruvi AI‚Äôs presale is designed for accessibility and growth. What sets this presale apart is its $0.07 valuation upon conclusion , a programmed feature rather than mere speculation. Analysts further project a $1 valuation post-listing , emphasizing Ruvi AI‚Äôs potential for astronomical returns. Early investors are seizing the opportunity to get in before prices climb steeply. Real-World Applications That Solve Big Problems While Cardano has focused on establishing a strong technical foundation, Ruvi AI is leveraging its integration of AI and blockchain technology to tackle real-world challenges across multiple industries. These tangible solutions set Ruvi AI apart and broaden its appeal: Healthcare : Ruvi AI bolsters patient care with advanced diagnostics and streamlined medical workflows, reducing inefficiencies while ensuring better outcomes. Logistics : The platform optimizes supply chain operations, saving businesses time and money while enhancing delivery efficiency. Finance : With cutting-edge fraud detection systems, Ruvi AI offers enhanced safety and efficiency in financial networks. These use cases ensure Ruvi AI isn‚Äôt just another speculative token. It‚Äôs delivering practical advancements that make a measurable difference, positioning it for sustainable growth and adoption. Cardano‚Äôs Challenges Could Be Ruvi AI‚Äôs Opportunity Despite its strengths, Cardano has faced significant hurdles as it tries to maintain investor trust and expand its ecosystem. Critics point to delays in delivering updates and projects, which have raised questions about its momentum and ability to compete with newer players. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, benefits from being in its early stages, with the advantage of executing a clearly defined and transparent roadmap. By focusing on immediate deliverables and securing major milestones like its first exchange partnership , Ruvi AI is creating a strong launchpad for future growth. Rewarding Investors with VIP Tiers To encourage participation during its presale, Ruvi AI offers a rewarding VIP investment tier system , maximizing returns for early supporters. Here‚Äôs how the numbers stack up: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens received: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900 . Value at $1 per token: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens received: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680 . Value at $1 per token: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens received: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600 . Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000 . These tiers not only reward investor confidence but also strengthen Ruvi AI‚Äôs ability to attract serious backers who believe in its long-term potential. Why Ruvi AI Is Positioned as a Leader in the Next Bull Run Ruvi AI has all the makings of a standout project in the cryptocurrency space. Its ability to address real-world needs, coupled with its successful presale structure, builds a solid case for sustained growth. Cardano‚Äôs slower momentum opens the door wide for Ruvi AI to step in and become a leader in the next bull run. What makes Ruvi AI particularly appealing is the timing of its presale. With a low buy-in price and an already-built roadmap for value growth, it offers a rare chance to invest in a project before its breakout success. The $1 valuation analysts forecast after listing could be just the beginning.

33767162,[object Object],1749333654,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,On-Chain Data Signals Bitcoin Correction Ahead: Here Are 2 Levels To Watch,https://bitcoinist.com/glassnode-signal-bitcoin-correction-levels-to-watch/,"Bitcoin has returned above $104,000 following a rather turbulent trading week. As a matter over a GOP tax bill morphed into a major fallout between US President Donald Trump and the world‚Äôs richest man Elon Musk, the crypto market experienced significant levels of outflows with Bitcoin prices dipping as low as $101,000 on Thursday. While there has been a modest price rebound in the last 24 hours, the maiden cryptocurrency remains in danger of a price deeper correction. Bitcoin Bulls Eye Support Near $103,700 And $95,600 In an X post on Friday, analytics company Glassnode shared a potentially impactful on-chain data insight on the BTC market amidst a price correction that has lasted over the past two weeks. During this time, Bitcoin prices have dipped from its current all-time high of $111,970 to its recent low of $100,516. Presently, Glassnode explains that BTC long-term holders are slowly offloading their holdings with the absence of a clear positive market catalyst indicating that the present price correction might persist for the short-term. In such a scenario, the analytics firm has identified two potential support zones using the Work of Cost (WOC) price model. For context, the WOC price model by measures Bitcoin value on cost basis by tracking the acquisition price for currently circulating coins. The WOC displays BTC supply in Spendable Supply Distribution (SSD) or Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) quantiles which reflects the distribution of coin acquisition prices. If Bitcoin‚Äô price correction persists, Glassnode‚Äôs WOC indicates the next major support lies at the $103,700 which aligns with the 0.95 SSD quantile i.e. the price at which 95% of circulating (spendable) bitcoin have a lower acquisition price meaning only 5% of Bitcoin supply was bought higher than this price point. If selling pressure proves overwhelming at this first support level, Bitcoin is expected to hit its next price floor at the 0.85 SSD quantile around the $96,500 indicating a potential price decline of 7.2% from current market prices and 13.8% from BTC‚Äôs market high. Interestingly, this projected price drawdown still falls within a healthy correction range within a broader bull rally. Nevertheless, the bull rally must soon discover a positive market rally rather in the form of marco quantitative easing, increased institutional investments or ETF inflows among others. BTC Market Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $104,418 reflecting a 2.98% price gain in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset‚Äôs daily trading volume has dipped by 20.02% and is valued at $51.67 billion.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|Bitcoin support|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Donald Trump|Elon Musk|Glassnode|Work of Cost price model,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|COMP|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|LPT|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-07 22:00:54

The size and timing of the transfer have sparked intense speculation: is this part of a broader institutional strategy, a liquidity shuffle, or something more strategic? As Ripple‚Äôs activity draws attention, XRP‚Äôs price movement is beginning to reflect cautious optimism. With bulls eyeing a breakout past key resistance, this development could mark the beginning of a new phase‚Äînot just for XRP, but for other altcoins as well. XRP Shows Steady Climb, Eyeing $2.48 as Bulls Struggle to Break Resistance Source: tradingview XRP is currently trading between $2.05 and $2.33, showing slight growth in the past week. Bulls are attempting to push past the $2.48 resistance level. However, they're finding it challenging. The price has risen modestly by around 2% in the past week and month. The Relative Strength Index sits around 57, indicating a potential upward push yet not overbought. If XRP breaks through the current resistance, it might climb towards the $2.76 mark, which is a sizeable increase from its current position. But for now, the momentum remains sluggish, with the bulls needing more strength to achieve significant growth beyond the modest percentage increases of late. Conclusion While Ripple‚Äôs $487 million XRP transfer has yet to reveal its true intent, the market‚Äôs reaction hints at growing anticipation. If XRP can overcome the stubborn $2.48 barrier, it could set the stage for a rally toward $2.76 and beyond. Investors are now watching closely‚Äînot only to decode Ripple‚Äôs next move but also to identify which altcoins might ride the wave of renewed momentum.
