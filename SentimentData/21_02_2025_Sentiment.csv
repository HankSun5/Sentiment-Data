Among the heavy hitters, three projects stand out: Qubetics, Polkadot, and Astra. Each one brings its own unique value proposition to the table, from blockchain interoperability and high scalability to seamless cross-chain transactions. With digital finance gaining rapid traction, these projects have the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems while offering massive growth opportunities for early adopters. While Polkadot has established itself as a formidable force in the blockchain interoperability arena, Astra is catching the attention of investors with its focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps). However, it’s Qubetics that seems poised to take the industry by storm. With an innovative non-custodial multi-chain wallet and a groundbreaking partnership with 1inch, Qubetics is making waves in the decentralized finance ecosystem. This article will dive deep into each of these projects, exploring how they work and why they may just be the best cryptos to invest in today for exponential returns. Qubetics, in particular, offers real-world solutions that its predecessors—such as Polkadot and Astra—have yet to fully address. By combining the best features of blockchain technology with cutting-edge wallet solutions, Qubetics has positioned itself as a leader in the DeFi space. Whether you’re a business, professional, or individual, Qubetics is creating a platform where the barriers to seamless blockchain transactions are broken down, and users can unlock the full potential of their digital assets. Qubetics: Leading the Charge in Blockchain Innovation When it comes to the best cryptos to invest in today for exponential return potential, Qubetics ($TICS) should be at the top of your list. The project is revolutionizing the blockchain and digital finance landscape with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet , strategic partnerships, and advanced transaction capabilities. Currently in its 22nd presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $13.4 million and sold more than 481 million tokens to over 20,600 holders. The ongoing presale offers tokens at $0.08073 each, with projections indicating massive returns—up to 18,480% after the mainnet launch. One of the standout features of Qubetics is its non-custodial multi-chain wallet. This wallet offers users an unmatched level of security and flexibility, allowing them to manage multiple cryptocurrencies across different blockchains in a single, easy-to-use interface. By integrating cross-chain functionality, the Qubetics wallet ensures that users can seamlessly swap assets without the need for intermediaries. This opens up a world of possibilities for businesses and individuals alike, making it a valuable tool for anyone involved in the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance. Qubetics’ partnership with SWFT Blockchain is also a game-changer. Together, they are introducing next-gen wallet innovation that brings lightning-fast transactions across multiple blockchains.

40609952,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132182,1740093380,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exclusive: Kraken’s Ambitious $5 Billion Play to Dominate Crypto Options Market with Deribit Acquisition?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kraken-deribit-acquisition-talks/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The rumor mill is buzzing, and it’s a big one. Whispers of a potential mega-deal are circulating, suggesting that crypto giant Kraken Exchange might be in serious talks to acquire Deribit, a leading cryptocurrency options exchange. Despite some reports suggesting the deal was off the table, CoinDesk has reported that discussions are still ongoing. Could this be a game-changer for the crypto options market ? Let’s dive into what we know. Is a Kraken – Deribit Deal Really on the Cards? Unveiling the Crypto Exchange Acquisition Buzz The crypto world is no stranger to acquisitions, but a potential merger of this magnitude is noteworthy. According to reports from CoinDesk and Bloomberg, Kraken is indeed engaging with Deribit for a possible acquisition. Deribit, known for its robust crypto options trading platform, is also reportedly working with FT Partners to evaluate bids, with a staggering valuation of $4 billion to $5 billion, or even higher, being floated. Adding fuel to the fire, a second source has indicated that Coinbase Exchange, another major player in the crypto space, has also expressed interest in acquiring Deribit. Imagine the implications! While Kraken and Deribit have remained tight-lipped, declining to comment, and Coinbase has yet to respond, the silence itself speaks volumes. Why is Deribit a Prize Catch in the Crypto Options Market? Deribit has carved a niche for itself as a premier platform for crypto options trading . But what makes it so attractive to giants like Kraken and Coinbase? Here’s a quick rundown: Market Leader in Options: Deribit is arguably the leading exchange for crypto options, commanding a significant share of the market. Acquiring Deribit instantly grants a dominant position in this lucrative segment. Sophisticated Platform: Deribit boasts a sophisticated trading platform with advanced features and a wide array of options contracts, appealing to professional traders and institutions. Institutional Appeal: As institutional interest in crypto derivatives grows, Deribit’s established platform and reputation make it a highly desirable asset for exchanges looking to cater to this burgeoning market segment. High Trading Volume: Deribit consistently demonstrates high trading volumes, indicating strong user engagement and platform utility. Kraken Exchange Eyeing Expansion: What’s the Strategic Rationale Behind a Deribit Acquisition? For Kraken, acquiring Deribit would be a strategic masterstroke, significantly bolstering its position in the competitive crypto exchange landscape. Let’s consider the potential benefits for Kraken Exchange : Benefit Description Instant Options Market Dominance Acquiring Deribit would catapult Kraken into a leading position in the crypto options market overnight, a segment where it currently has a less prominent presence. Diversification of Revenue Streams Options trading generates significant revenue through trading fees. Adding Deribit’s platform would diversify Kraken’s revenue streams beyond spot trading and futures. Attracting Institutional Investors Deribit’s institutional-grade platform would enhance Kraken’s appeal to institutional investors seeking sophisticated crypto derivatives products. Competitive Edge Against Rivals In a fiercely competitive market, acquiring Deribit would give Kraken a significant competitive advantage against rivals like Coinbase and Binance, particularly in the derivatives space. Coinbase Exchange’s Interest: A Battle for Crypto Options Supremacy? The reported interest from Coinbase Exchange adds another layer of intrigue to this potential acquisition saga. Coinbase, known for its user-friendly platform and strong retail base, is also clearly eyeing the lucrative crypto options market. If Coinbase were to enter the bidding, it could trigger a competitive battle, potentially driving up Deribit’s valuation even further. Coinbase’s motivation might stem from a desire to expand its product offerings and capture a larger share of the derivatives market. Acquiring Deribit would provide Coinbase with a ready-made, highly respected options platform, accelerating its entry into this complex but profitable market segment. Challenges and Considerations in a Crypto Exchange Acquisition of This Scale While the potential benefits are substantial, a Deribit acquisition , particularly at a valuation of $4-5 billion, is not without its challenges and considerations: Regulatory Hurdles: Crypto acquisitions are increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny. Both Kraken and Deribit would need to navigate complex regulatory landscapes to secure approvals for such a deal. Integration Complexities: Integrating two large and complex platforms like Kraken and Deribit would be a significant undertaking, requiring careful planning and execution to ensure a smooth transition and avoid disruptions. Valuation Justification: A $4-5 billion valuation is hefty, even in the crypto world. The acquiring exchange would need to justify this valuation based on projected revenue growth and synergies. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its volatility. Market downturns could impact the perceived value of the acquisition and the performance of the combined entity. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Traders and Investors? For crypto traders and investors, the potential acquisition of Deribit by Kraken (or Coinbase) could have several implications: Expanded Options Trading Access: If Kraken acquires Deribit, users of Kraken may gain access to Deribit’s extensive suite of crypto options products directly through the Kraken platform. Platform Enhancements: Integration of Deribit’s technology could lead to enhanced options trading features and functionalities on the acquiring exchange’s platform. Increased Market Liquidity: A combined entity could potentially lead to increased liquidity in the crypto options market, benefiting traders with tighter spreads and better execution. Potential for New Products: The acquisition could pave the way for the development of innovative new crypto derivatives products and services. The Future of Crypto Options Trading: A Bold Move or a Risky Bet? The potential crypto exchange acquisition of Deribit by Kraken, or the interest from Coinbase, signals a significant maturation of the crypto market and a growing focus on derivatives, particularly options. Whether this deal materializes remains to be seen, but the very fact that these discussions are taking place underscores the immense value and potential of the crypto options market. A successful acquisition could reshape the competitive landscape and further propel the growth of crypto derivatives trading. Keep a close watch on this developing story – it could be a pivotal moment for the future of crypto trading.

Bybit, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just announced the upcoming launch of the AVL/USDT perpetual contract. This exciting news, first reported by BWE News Telegram channel, signals a significant expansion in trading opportunities for Avalanche (AVL) enthusiasts and the broader crypto community. Are you prepared to explore the potential of AVL/USDT perpetual contract trading on Bybit? What is the Buzz About the AVL/USDT Perpetual Contract on Bybit? The introduction of the AVL/USDT perpetual contract on Bybit is more than just another listing. It represents a strategic move by the exchange to cater to the growing demand for diverse trading instruments and to further solidify its position in the competitive crypto derivatives market. For traders, this means access to a new avenue for participating in the Avalanche ecosystem, leveraging its price movements against the stability of USDT. Let’s break down what makes this launch noteworthy: Perpetual Contracts: Unlike traditional futures contracts with expiry dates, perpetual contracts, like the new AVL/USDT perpetual contract , allow traders to hold positions indefinitely. This feature is particularly attractive for those looking to capitalize on long-term trends or engage in continuous trading strategies. Avalanche (AVL): Avalanche is a high-performance, scalable, and customizable blockchain platform known for its speed and low transaction fees. Trading AVL against USDT opens doors to speculate on the growth and adoption of this innovative blockchain. USDT (Tether): Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, providing a stable base currency for trading. Pairing AVL with USDT allows traders to easily measure and manage their positions in a familiar fiat-equivalent currency. Bybit Exchange: Bybit is renowned for its robust trading platform, user-friendly interface, and a wide range of crypto derivatives products. Launching the AVL/USDT perpetual contract on Bybit ensures traders will have access to reliable infrastructure and advanced trading tools. Why Trade AVL/USDT Perpetual Contract? Unlocking the Potential So, why should traders be excited about the AVL/USDT perpetual contract ? The answer lies in the unique benefits it brings to the table: Leverage Opportunities: Perpetual contracts inherently offer leverage, allowing traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital. This can amplify both potential profits and losses. For those experienced in leverage trading , the AVL/USDT pair on Bybit presents a fresh opportunity to apply their skills. Hedging Strategies: The AVL/USDT perpetual contract can be used as a hedging instrument. For instance, if you hold AVL in your portfolio, you could open a short position on the perpetual contract to mitigate potential price downturns in the spot market. 24/7 Trading: The cryptocurrency market operates around the clock. Perpetual contracts enable you to trade AVL/USDT anytime, capitalizing on market movements whenever they occur, regardless of traditional market hours. Price Discovery: The perpetual contract market contributes to price discovery for Avalanche. Increased trading activity and liquidity in the AVL/USDT perpetual contract can lead to more efficient and accurate price reflection for AVL. Diversification of Trading Portfolio: Adding the AVL/USDT perpetual contract to your trading portfolio diversifies your exposure within the crypto market. This can potentially reduce overall risk by spreading investments across different assets. Navigating the Terrain: Challenges and Considerations in Avalanche Trading While the AVL/USDT perpetual contract offers exciting prospects, it’s crucial to acknowledge the associated challenges and trade responsibly: Volatility: The cryptocurrency market, including Avalanche, is known for its volatility. Price swings can be significant and rapid. Traders engaging in Avalanche trading , especially with leverage, must be prepared for potential market fluctuations. Liquidation Risk: Leverage trading amplifies both gains and losses. If the market moves against your position, there’s a risk of liquidation, where your position is automatically closed to prevent further losses. Understanding and managing liquidation risk is paramount when trading perpetual contracts. Funding Rates: Perpetual contracts employ a mechanism called funding rates to keep the contract price anchored to the spot market price. Traders need to be aware of funding rates, as they can either pay or receive funding depending on market conditions and their position (long or short). Market Research: Successful Avalanche trading requires thorough market research and analysis. Understanding Avalanche’s fundamentals, technical indicators, and market sentiment is crucial for making informed trading decisions. Platform Familiarity: Before diving into trading the AVL/USDT perpetual contract , it’s essential to familiarize yourself with the Bybit platform, its trading tools, and risk management features. Practice trading in a demo account can be beneficial for beginners. Actionable Insights: How to Prepare for AVL/USDT Perpetual Contract Trading Ready to take advantage of the AVL/USDT perpetual contract launch on Bybit? Here are some actionable insights to help you prepare: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on Bybit’s official announcements for the exact launch date and time of the AVL/USDT perpetual contract . Follow BWE News and other reputable crypto news sources for updates. Research Avalanche: Deepen your understanding of Avalanche, its technology, ecosystem, and potential growth drivers. This knowledge will be invaluable in making informed trading decisions for Avalanche trading . Learn Perpetual Contract Trading: If you’re new to perpetual contracts or leverage trading , take the time to educate yourself. Numerous resources are available online, including Bybit’s own educational materials. Develop a Trading Strategy: Don’t trade impulsively. Develop a well-defined trading strategy that outlines your entry and exit points, risk management rules, and position sizing for the AVL/USDT perpetual contract . Start Small: When you begin trading the AVL/USDT perpetual contract , start with smaller positions to get comfortable with the market dynamics and the platform. Gradually increase your position size as you gain experience and confidence. Conclusion: Embrace the Future of Avalanche Trading on Bybit The launch of the AVL/USDT perpetual contract on Bybit marks an exciting step forward for both Avalanche and the broader crypto trading community. It opens up new avenues for traders to engage with AVL, leveraging its potential through perpetual contracts.

This borrowed capital is secured by the trader’s existing assets, known as margin. Margin trading can amplify both profits and losses, making it a powerful tool that requires careful risk management. Cross Margin vs. Isolated Margin: Key Differences Binance offers two types of margin trading modes: Feature Cross Margin Isolated Margin Margin Pool Shares margin across all cross margin positions. Margin is allocated to individual trading pairs. Liquidation Risk All cross margin positions can be liquidated if the total margin level falls below the maintenance margin level. Only the isolated margin position is at risk of liquidation. Other positions are unaffected. Risk Management Potentially higher risk if multiple positions are held, but can be more capital-efficient if managed well. Lower risk per individual trade, easier to manage risk per position. Use Case Suitable for traders who hedge positions or have a diversified portfolio and want to optimize capital utilization. Suitable for traders who want to limit risk to a specific trade and have more control over individual position risk. For KAITO traders, this means they can choose the margin mode that best suits their trading strategy and risk tolerance. Whether you prefer the capital efficiency of cross margin or the controlled risk of isolated margin, Binance provides the tools to trade KAITO on margin.

Speaking at CPAC in Washington D.C., Saylor advised the U.S. government to purchase 20% of Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) supply for the much-anticipated national strategic reserve. “There’s only room for one nation-state to buy 20% of the Bitcoin network,” Saylor said, adding that he “thinks it should be and will be the United States.” U.S. authorities would have to buy 3.9 million Bitcoin in addition to its current 207,000 BTC trove to realize Saylor’s vision. That endeavor would cost $392 billion at today’s prices. You might also like: Strategy misses weekly Bitcoin scoop for the second time The U.S. Senate is considering a more conservative approach.

At CPAC, Saylor reiterated that the U.S. must be the nation to capture 20% of the Bitcoin network: “It’s a way for us to enrich ourselves and emerge as a creditor nation in a matter of a decade. It’s also a way for us to ensure we’re the economic leaders in cyberspace for the next 100 years.” Saylor explained that U.S. adoption of BTC will drive a sovereign rush for the asset among both allies and rivals alike.

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, safeguarding your assets is paramount. Imagine trading spot and derivatives with the peace of mind that your funds are held in ultra-secure custody, away from exchange-related risks. This is now a reality for Deribit traders thanks to a groundbreaking partnership between crypto custody giants BitGo and Copper. Let’s dive into how this collaboration is revolutionizing crypto custody and settlement for institutional and sophisticated traders. What is Driving the Demand for Enhanced Crypto Custody Solutions? The cryptocurrency market, while brimming with opportunities, also presents unique security challenges. Exchange hacks, regulatory uncertainties, and the inherent risks of holding large sums of digital assets on exchanges are constant concerns. For institutional investors and professional traders, these risks are amplified. They require robust, institutional-grade crypto custody solutions that go beyond the standard exchange offerings. This demand has spurred innovation in the custody space, leading to solutions like the BitGo and Copper partnership with Deribit. Consider these key factors driving the need for advanced custody: Security Breaches: History is replete with examples of cryptocurrency exchange hacks resulting in significant losses. Off-exchange custody mitigates this risk by keeping assets away from potential exchange vulnerabilities. Regulatory Compliance: Institutional investors often face stringent regulatory requirements regarding asset custody. Independent, regulated custodians like BitGo Trust are essential for meeting these obligations. Counterparty Risk Reduction: Relying solely on an exchange for custody exposes traders to counterparty risk. Dedicated custody solutions diversify this risk. Operational Efficiency: While security is crucial, efficiency in trading and settlement is equally important. Solutions that offer both security and seamless operations are highly sought after. BitGo and Copper: A Powerhouse Partnership for Secure Settlement BitGo and Copper are joining forces to enhance crypto security for Deribit traders. Enter BitGo and Copper, two leading names in the crypto custody space, joining forces to address these very concerns for Deribit users. BitGo, known for its institutional-grade custody solutions, and Copper, with its innovative ClearLoop network, are providing an off-exchange settlement solution that promises to enhance both security and efficiency. This partnership allows Deribit traders to: Trade on Deribit: Access Deribit’s extensive suite of spot and derivatives products. Maintain Secure Custody: Keep their assets securely held with BitGo Trust or within Copper’s ClearLoop network, rather than directly on the exchange. Instant Settlement: Benefit from near-instantaneous trade settlement without the delays and complexities of on-chain transactions. Understanding Secure Settlement: How Does it Work? The core of this innovation lies in the concept of secure settlement . Traditional exchange trading often requires pre-funding accounts, meaning assets are held on the exchange before trading even begins. This model, while convenient, introduces custody risks. Secure settlement , particularly in the off-exchange context, aims to decouple trading from custody. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how BitGo and Copper’s secure settlement solution works for Deribit traders: Custody Setup: Traders establish accounts with either BitGo Trust or utilize Copper’s ClearLoop network to securely hold their cryptocurrency assets. Trading on Deribit: Traders execute trades on the Deribit exchange as usual. Off-Exchange Settlement: Instead of assets moving on-chain for each trade settlement, the ClearLoop network (by Copper) facilitates instant, off-exchange settlement. This is achieved through a secure messaging and settlement infrastructure that updates balances in custody accounts in real-time. Asset Security: Throughout the trading process, the underlying assets remain in the secure custody of BitGo Trust or within the Copper ecosystem, minimizing exchange-related risks. This process significantly reduces the need to move assets on-chain for every trade, leading to faster settlement times and lower transaction costs, while maintaining a high level of security. The Benefits of BitGo and Copper’s Secure Settlement for Deribit Traders The collaboration between BitGo and Copper brings a multitude of benefits to Deribit traders, particularly those who prioritize security and efficiency: Benefit Description Enhanced Security Assets are held in regulated, institutional-grade custody solutions (BitGo Trust or Copper), significantly reducing exchange counterparty risk and vulnerability to exchange hacks. Instant Settlement Trades are settled almost instantaneously via Copper’s ClearLoop network, eliminating settlement delays associated with traditional on-chain transactions. Improved Capital Efficiency Faster settlement cycles can improve capital efficiency, allowing traders to redeploy capital more quickly. Reduced Transaction Costs Off-exchange settlement minimizes on-chain transaction fees, potentially lowering overall trading costs. Institutional-Grade Solution The partnership provides an institutional-grade custody and settlement framework, appealing to professional traders and institutions. Deribit Exchange: A Prime Platform for Advanced Crypto Trading Deribit is a leading Deribit exchange specializing in cryptocurrency derivatives trading, particularly options and futures. It has become a go-to platform for sophisticated traders seeking to manage risk, speculate on price movements, and access advanced trading instruments in the crypto market. Deribit’s focus on derivatives makes it a platform where security and efficient settlement are particularly critical, given the complex strategies often employed by its users. The integration with BitGo and Copper further solidifies Deribit’s commitment to providing a secure and robust trading environment. Navigating the Future of Crypto Trading with Secure Solutions As the cryptocurrency market matures and attracts greater institutional participation, the demand for secure and efficient trading infrastructure will only intensify. Solutions like the BitGo and Copper secure settlement offering for Deribit are at the forefront of this evolution. They represent a significant step towards bridging the gap between the innovative world of crypto trading and the stringent security and operational requirements of institutional finance. By prioritizing security without compromising on trading efficiency, this partnership sets a new standard for how cryptocurrency exchanges and custody providers can collaborate to build a more robust and trustworthy ecosystem. This initiative is more than just a technological upgrade; it’s a strategic move towards fostering greater confidence and wider adoption of cryptocurrency trading, especially among institutional players who are increasingly interested in the digital asset space but remain cautious about security risks. The ability to trade on a leading platform like Deribit while leveraging the robust crypto custody services of BitGo and the innovative settlement technology of Copper offers a compelling value proposition in today’s market. In conclusion, the partnership between BitGo, Copper, and Deribit marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of secure settlement in the cryptocurrency market. By combining institutional-grade custody with seamless off-exchange settlement, they are not only enhancing security and efficiency for Deribit traders but also paving the way for a more secure and mature crypto trading landscape. This is a development that should be welcomed by anyone serious about the long-term growth and stability of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto experts predict that sub-$0.001 coins with strong ecosystems and real-world utility, like BeerBear, could see significant growth in 2025. Table of Contents The market landscape for sub-$0.001 coins What sets BeerBear apart? Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with investors and analysts looking for the next high-potential project. Low-cap and sub-$0.001 tokens often generate interest due to their accessibility and potential for growth. As 2025 progresses, experts are evaluating the prospects of emerging tokens, particularly those with structured ecosystems, utility-driven mechanics, and transparent growth models. Among these, BeerBear is gaining attention as a project with unique engagement features and a structured presale model that sets it apart. The market landscape for sub-$0.001 coins Historically, low-cap cryptocurrencies have been attractive to early adopters looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu started with low valuations before gaining mainstream popularity through community engagement and viral marketing. However, market conditions have changed, and projects now require more than just hype to sustain long-term growth. Industry analysts suggest that in 2025, successful sub-$0.001 coins will need to offer more than just speculative value. Ecosystem development, real-world use cases, and strong community support are expected to be key factors in determining which tokens stand out. While some projects rely solely on meme culture, others, like BeerBear, introduce additional developments. What sets BeerBear apart? BeerBear is structured around a play-to-earn gaming ecosystem that integrates blockchain technology to enhance user engagement. It provides interactive opportunities for users to participate in gameplay and earn rewards. The “Bar Brawl” beat ‘em up game allows players to earn in-game tokens and NFTs, adding an extra layer of utility to the ecosystem. Another major differentiator is BeerBear’s progressive pricing model. The token started its presale at $0.0004, with incremental increases planned until the final presale price of $0.0020. This structured approach provides transparency while rewarding early participants. Additionally, BeerBear’s Beer Points system incentivizes user participation by allowing accumulated points to be exchanged for in-game upgrades, NFTs, and community-driven perks. You might also like: Understanding the growth potential of a $0.0005 coin by March 2025 Security, transparency, and market viability Security remains a significant factor when evaluating low-cap tokens, as investors seek reassurance against potential risks. BeerBear has completed three independent security audits, reinforcing its credibility within the space. Many sub-$0.001 projects lack this level of verification, making BeerBear stand out as a project committed to transparency and reliability. Market experts highlight that in 2025, low-cap projects that emphasize clear governance structures and security measures will have a stronger chance of maintaining long-term viability. As regulatory scrutiny increases, projects with structured compliance and decentralized decision-making models will likely attract more sustained interest. Potential growth drivers in 2025 The continued expansion of play-to-earn gaming could be a key driver for BeerBear’s success. As blockchain gaming gains mainstream adoption, tokens with built-in gaming utilities may experience increased demand. Additionally, community engagement will be a crucial factor, as decentralized governance and token-based reward systems tend to create stronger retention rates among participants. Market conditions and external factors, such as broader cryptocurrency adoption and investor sentiment will also play a role. As the demand for interactive blockchain projects continues to grow, BeerBear’s combination of gaming and structured incentives positions it as a contender in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion As analysts assess the potential of sub-$0.001 coins in 2025, projects with clear value propositions and security measures stand out from purely speculative assets. BeerBear’s integration of play-to-earn gaming, progressive token distribution, and community-driven rewards make it a notable project within this category. While its long-term trajectory will depend on adoption and market trends, its structured approach and commitment to engagement set it apart from many low-cap tokens.

You’re not alone. Major players in the financial world are also watching closely, and their observations are quite telling. Recently, S&P Global Ratings, a leading credit rating agency, shed light on a significant roadblock: the murky waters of regulation. Let’s dive into why they believe stablecoin regulation is the linchpin for widespread adoption in the United States and what this means for the future of crypto. Why Stablecoin Regulation is the Key to US Adoption S&P Global Ratings has pinpointed a critical issue hindering the growth of stablecoins in the U.S. According to their recent analysis reported by CoinDesk, the absence of clear and comprehensive crypto regulation is the primary barrier preventing broader acceptance, especially among institutional investors. This isn’t just about playing by the rules; it’s about building trust and fostering an environment where large financial institutions feel comfortable entering the stablecoin space. Think of it like this: imagine building a house on shaky foundations. Would you feel secure? Probably not. Similarly, without a solid regulatory framework, institutions perceive stablecoins as too risky for large-scale integration into their operations. This hesitation is understandable given the potential for financial instability and lack of investor protection in unregulated markets. The Current Regulatory Landscape: A Barrier to US Stablecoin Adoption The current regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. is fragmented and, to put it mildly, unclear. This ambiguity creates significant challenges for US stablecoin adoption : Uncertainty for Issuers: Stablecoin issuers are unsure about which agencies have jurisdiction and what rules they need to comply with. This lack of clarity stifles innovation and investment. Risk Aversion from Institutions: Large financial institutions are generally risk-averse. Regulatory uncertainty amplifies perceived risks associated with stablecoins, making them less appealing for investment or integration into traditional financial systems. Limited Institutional Use Cases: Without regulatory clarity, the potential use cases for stablecoins in institutional settings remain limited. Areas like cross-border payments, treasury management, and decentralized finance (DeFi) integration are all held back. How Crypto Regulation Can Unlock Institutional Crypto Adoption S&P’s report isn’t all doom and gloom. In fact, it points towards a powerful catalyst for growth: regulation itself. The firm anticipates that once clear and comprehensive crypto regulation is established, stablecoin adoption will surge. This regulatory clarity will act as a green light for institutional investors, paving the way for significant market expansion. Here’s how effective regulation can transform the stablecoin landscape: Building Trust and Confidence: Clear rules and oversight will build trust in stablecoins as reliable digital assets. This trust is essential for attracting institutional capital. Encouraging Institutional Investment: Regulatory certainty reduces perceived risk, making stablecoins more attractive for institutional portfolios. Pension funds, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries could begin to allocate capital to regulated stablecoins. Expanding Use Cases: With a solid regulatory foundation, new and innovative use cases for stablecoins will emerge, particularly in areas like payments, remittances, and DeFi. Leveling the Playing Field: Fair and consistent regulation can create a level playing field for all stablecoin issuers, fostering healthy competition and innovation. The Reshaping of the Stablecoin Industry: A Shift Towards Regulation S&P predicts that the introduction of robust digital asset regulation will not only boost adoption but also reshape the stablecoin industry itself. We can expect to see a shift towards regulated stablecoins as users and institutions gravitate towards assets that offer greater security and compliance. This shift could lead to: Dominance of Regulated Stablecoins: Regulated stablecoins, issued by entities compliant with established frameworks, are likely to become the dominant force in the market. Increased Scrutiny on Unregulated Stablecoins: Unregulated or loosely regulated stablecoins may face increased scrutiny and potentially lose market share as users prioritize safety and compliance. Consolidation in the Market: The cost of compliance might lead to consolidation in the stablecoin market, with fewer, larger, and more regulated players emerging. Consider the potential impact on traditional finance. Imagine a future where large corporations use regulated stablecoins for instant global payments, or where DeFi protocols seamlessly integrate with traditional financial institutions through compliant stablecoin bridges. This future, while still developing, becomes significantly more plausible with the right regulatory framework. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? For crypto enthusiasts and investors, S&P’s analysis provides valuable insights: Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: Keep a close watch on regulatory developments in the U.S. and globally. Changes in regulation will directly impact the stablecoin market. Focus on Regulated Stablecoins: As the market evolves, consider focusing on stablecoins that are operating within clear regulatory frameworks. These are likely to be more sustainable and trustworthy in the long run. Understand Institutional Adoption: Pay attention to signals of institutional adoption of stablecoins. Increased institutional involvement will be a strong indicator of market maturity and growth. Advocate for Sensible Regulation: Engage in discussions and advocate for sensible and balanced regulation that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and the financial system. Conclusion: Regulation as the Catalyst for Stablecoin Revolution S&P Global Ratings has delivered a clear message: stablecoin regulation is not just a hurdle to overcome but a crucial catalyst for unlocking the full potential of stablecoins in the U.S. The lack of clear rules is currently holding back US stablecoin adoption , particularly among institutions. However, the anticipation is palpable. Once effective crypto regulation is in place, we can expect a significant surge in adoption, reshaping the industry and opening doors for institutional crypto to flourish. The future of stablecoins in the U.S., and potentially globally, hinges on the evolution of digital asset regulation . It’s time for regulators to provide the clarity the market desperately needs to unleash the stablecoin revolution.

What started as internet jokes are now serious business. A groundbreaking report from Asia-based Web3 research firm, Tiger Research, has dropped a bombshell: memecoins have evolved from mere speculative assets into crucial players in the cryptocurrency arena. They’re not just a sideshow anymore; they’re fundamentally reshaping how exchanges operate and where liquidity flows. Let’s dive deep into this fascinating shift and explore what it means for the future of crypto trading . The Rise of Memecoins as Key Crypto Trading Assets Tiger Research’s latest report shines a spotlight on the undeniable ascent of memecoins . No longer relegated to the fringes of the crypto world, these digital tokens, often inspired by internet memes and viral trends, are now considered core trading assets. This isn’t just about fleeting hype; it’s a structural change impacting the very fabric of crypto markets . The report emphasizes that memecoins are now significant drivers of market liquidity . This means they are attracting substantial capital and trading volume, influencing price movements across the broader crypto ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of the key takeaways: Liquidity Magnet: Memecoins are drawing in significant liquidity, impacting trading volumes on both decentralized and centralized exchanges. Market Structure Shift: Their rise is causing noticeable changes in market dynamics, influencing trading strategies and investment patterns. Beyond Speculation: Memecoins are moving beyond pure speculation, becoming integral to the functioning of crypto exchanges and market flows. This transformation signals a maturation of the memecoin space, moving it away from a niche corner of the internet and into the heart of crypto finance. But what’s driving this surge? DEX Market Share Revolution: Raydium Takes on Uniswap One of the most striking revelations in the Tiger Research report is the dramatic shift in DEX market share . Solana-based Raydium has surged ahead, overtaking the previously dominant Uniswap. This isn’t just a minor reshuffling; it’s a significant power shift in the decentralized exchange landscape. What’s behind Raydium’s meteoric rise? According to the report, the answer lies in two key factors: Lower Fees: Raydium offers significantly lower transaction fees compared to Uniswap, making it more attractive for high-volume traders and those sensitive to gas costs. Faster Transactions: Built on the Solana blockchain, Raydium boasts lightning-fast transaction speeds, a crucial advantage in the fast-paced world of crypto trading, especially for memecoins known for their volatility. This competition highlights the evolving nature of the DEX space, where efficiency and cost-effectiveness are becoming increasingly critical for attracting users and market share. Raydium’s success story is a testament to the growing importance of speed and affordability in decentralized finance. CEXs Embrace Memecoins: Binance, Gate.io, and MEXC Join the Frenzy The memecoin phenomenon isn’t limited to decentralized exchanges. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) are also jumping on the bandwagon, recognizing the immense retail interest and potential market liquidity that memecoins bring. Exchanges like Binance, Gate.io, and MEXC have been actively expanding their memecoin listings. Why are these major CEXs embracing what was once considered a risky and unserious asset class? Attracting Retail Liquidity: Memecoins are incredibly popular with retail investors. Listing them is a strategic move to attract and retain a large user base and boost trading volumes. Capitalizing on Trends: CEXs are adept at identifying and capitalizing on emerging crypto trends. The memecoin surge is too significant to ignore, and listing them allows exchanges to tap into this lucrative market segment. Competitive Edge: In a highly competitive CEX landscape, offering a wider range of assets, including popular memecoins, can provide a crucial competitive advantage. This widespread adoption by CEXs further solidifies memecoins’ position as legitimate crypto trading assets, moving them further into the mainstream crypto consciousness. The Dark Side of the Meme: Rug Pulls and Insider Trading Risks However, the rapid rise of memecoins is not without its shadows. The Tiger Research report also highlights the significant risks associated with this asset class, particularly unethical practices such as rug pulls and insider trading. The decentralized and often unregulated nature of memecoin projects makes them vulnerable to scams. Rug pulls , where developers abandon a project after raising significant funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens, are a major concern. Similarly, insider trading , where individuals with privileged information profit at the expense of ordinary investors, is another prevalent risk. The report points to events like the LIBRA scandal as a stark reminder of these dangers. Such incidents can lead to sharp declines in trading volumes and erode investor confidence, particularly in the DEX space. Navigating the memecoin market requires caution and awareness of these inherent risks. Memecoins: More Than Just Jokes – Proxy Assets and Cultural Trends Despite the risks, memecoins are evolving beyond simple speculative vehicles. They are increasingly being used as proxy assets tied to influential figures, social movements, and cultural trends. This is a fascinating development, suggesting that memecoins are tapping into deeper social and cultural currents. Think of memecoins linked to popular internet personalities, trending memes, or even political figures. These tokens become a way for communities to express support, engage in shared experiences, and even participate in a form of collective financial expression. This phenomenon is shaping a new intersection of culture and finance within the crypto markets . Key Takeaways: Aspect Description Evolving Asset Class Memecoins are transitioning from speculative jokes to key trading assets. Liquidity Drivers They significantly contribute to market liquidity and influence trading dynamics. DEX Competition Raydium’s rise highlights the importance of low fees and fast transactions in DEXs. CEX Adoption Major CEXs are listing memecoins to attract retail liquidity and capitalize on trends. Risks Remain Rug pulls and insider trading are serious concerns in the memecoin space. Cultural Significance Memecoins are becoming proxy assets linked to culture and social movements. Conclusion: The Unstoppable Meme Coin Revolution? The Tiger Research report paints a compelling picture of the evolving crypto landscape, where memecoins are no longer a laughing matter but a serious force to be reckoned with. They are driving market liquidity , reshaping DEX market share , and attracting attention from major CEXs. While risks like rug pulls and insider trading persist, the cultural and financial significance of memecoins is undeniable.

Whispers from the regulatory front suggest that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is gearing up to drop some much-anticipated guidance on cryptocurrency staking. If you’re involved in crypto, especially if you’re staking your digital assets, this is news you absolutely cannot afford to ignore. Let’s dive into what we know and what this could mean for you. Why is SEC Staking Guidance on the Horizon? According to a recent update from Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett on X (formerly Twitter), the SEC’s interest in crypto staking is intensifying. It’s not just a casual glance either; the agency has reportedly been actively seeking industry input to understand the diverse landscape of staking. This includes various staking types and the benefits they offer to the crypto ecosystem and individual users. Think of it as the SEC doing its homework, trying to get a handle on a rapidly evolving aspect of the digital asset space. The buzz is that this period of information gathering is nearing its end, and we can expect the SEC to release formal SEC staking guidance in the near future. This anticipation isn’t based on mere speculation. Sources indicate that SEC staff members have been deeply engaged with the topic, even participating in industry webinars to get a first-hand understanding of the current staking environment. This proactive approach suggests that the SEC is taking a serious and informed approach to regulating crypto staking . What Exactly is Crypto Staking and Why Does it Matter? For those newer to the crypto scene, let’s quickly break down what staking is and why it’s become such a hot topic. In simple terms, staking is akin to earning interest on your cryptocurrency holdings. Instead of just holding your coins in a wallet, you can ‘stake’ them to support the operations of a blockchain network. In return, you earn rewards, often in the form of more of the same cryptocurrency. Here’s a simplified look at how it works: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Networks: Staking is primarily associated with blockchains that use a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Examples include Ethereum (since its transition), Cardano, Solana, and many others. Validating Transactions: By staking your crypto, you’re essentially participating in the network’s validation process. Your staked assets help to secure the network and verify transactions. Earning Rewards: As a reward for your contribution, the network distributes newly minted coins or transaction fees to stakers, proportional to the amount they’ve staked. Passive Income: Staking offers a way to generate passive income from your crypto holdings without needing to actively trade. Why is it important? Staking is crucial for the functionality and security of many modern blockchain networks. It incentivizes users to participate in network operations, decentralizes power, and reduces energy consumption compared to older mechanisms like Proof-of-Work (used by Bitcoin). Its growing popularity and significance in the crypto ecosystem is likely a key reason for the SEC’s increasing scrutiny and the need for clear staking regulation . Why is the SEC Focusing on Staking Now? The SEC’s interest in crypto staking isn’t entirely out of the blue. Several factors likely contribute to this increased attention: Investor Protection: The SEC’s primary mandate is to protect investors. With the rise of staking platforms and services, there’s a need to ensure that these are operating transparently and fairly, without misleading or harming investors. Securities Classification: A central question is whether staked crypto assets should be classified as securities. If staking is deemed to involve an investment contract where users expect profits based on the efforts of others (the ‘Howey Test’), it could fall under SEC jurisdiction. Industry Growth and Risks: The rapid growth of the crypto staking industry, coupled with potential risks like smart contract vulnerabilities, rug pulls, and centralized staking services, necessitates regulatory oversight. Precedent Setting: The SEC’s actions in the crypto space are often precedent-setting. Guidance on staking will likely influence how other jurisdictions approach crypto regulation and set the tone for future SEC actions regarding digital assets . What Might the SEC Staking Guidance Look Like? Potential Scenarios While we’re still waiting for the official SEC staking guidance , we can speculate on some potential directions based on the agency’s past actions and the information gathered. Here are a few possibilities: Scenario Potential Implications Impact on Users Staking as a Security: SEC classifies certain staking activities, especially those offered by centralized platforms, as securities. Stricter registration and compliance requirements for staking providers. Potential need for staking platforms to register with the SEC. Increased compliance costs could lead to some platforms exiting the US market. Users might see changes in service offerings and KYC/AML requirements. Distinction between Staking Types: Guidance differentiates between different types of staking (e.g., solo staking vs. staking pools, custodial vs. non-custodial). Tailored regulations based on risk profiles of different staking methods. Less burdensome rules for decentralized or non-custodial staking. More clarity for users and providers on compliant staking practices. Potential for innovation within defined regulatory boundaries. Focus on Disclosure and Transparency: Guidance emphasizes the need for clear disclosures from staking providers regarding risks, fees, and rewards. Increased transparency in the staking industry. Users will have better information to make informed decisions. Users benefit from greater transparency and reduced information asymmetry. May lead to more responsible staking practices. Enforcement Actions: Alongside guidance, the SEC may initiate enforcement actions against staking platforms deemed to be operating in violation of securities laws. Increased legal scrutiny and potential penalties for non-compliant platforms. May lead to greater caution and compliance focus in the industry. Users should be wary of platforms with questionable compliance records. Emphasis on choosing reputable and compliant staking providers. Navigating the Future of Crypto Staking: Actionable Insights So, what should you do to prepare for the upcoming SEC staking guidance ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and updates from reputable sources like Fox Business, crypto news outlets, and legal experts. Understanding the nuances of the evolving regulatory landscape is crucial. Understand Staking Types: Familiarize yourself with different staking methods (solo, pool, custodial, non-custodial). Consider the risks and rewards associated with each and how they might be viewed under potential regulations. Choose Compliant Platforms: If you use staking platforms, prioritize those that demonstrate a commitment to compliance and transparency. Look for platforms that are proactive in addressing regulatory concerns. Diversify Your Staking: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your staking across different assets and platforms to mitigate potential risks associated with regulatory changes or platform-specific issues. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re heavily involved in crypto staking or run a staking-related business, consider consulting with legal and financial professionals to ensure you’re prepared for potential regulatory changes. The Road Ahead for Digital Assets and Staking Regulation The upcoming SEC staking guidance is a significant moment for the crypto industry. It represents a crucial step in defining the regulatory framework for digital assets and, specifically, the rapidly growing staking sector. While the exact nature of the guidance remains to be seen, it’s clear that the SEC is taking a proactive and informed approach. This guidance has the potential to shape the future of staking in the U.S. and potentially influence global regulatory trends. For crypto users and businesses alike, staying informed, being prepared, and prioritizing compliance will be key to navigating this evolving landscape successfully. The industry input sought by the SEC suggests a willingness to understand the complexities of staking, which is a positive sign.

This Bitcoin acts as collateral for the loan. Loan Origination: Based on the value of your Bitcoin collateral, you are granted a loan. The loan amount is typically a percentage of the Bitcoin’s value, known as the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. Loan Terms: You agree to loan terms, including interest rates, repayment schedule, and loan duration. Repayment: You repay the loan according to the agreed terms. Once the loan is repaid, your Bitcoin collateral is released back to you. Margin Calls (Important to Understand): If the price of Bitcoin drops significantly, the value of your collateral decreases. To maintain the LTV ratio, you might receive a margin call, requiring you to deposit more Bitcoin or repay a portion of the loan to avoid liquidation of your collateral. Benefits of Choosing Bitcoin-Backed Lending Beyond the core advantages, Bitcoin-backed lending offers a range of compelling benefits: Faster Access to Funds: Compared to traditional loans, crypto loans can often be processed much faster, providing quicker access to the liquidity you need. No Credit Checks (Often): Many crypto lending platforms, including potentially this new Onramp and Arch service, may not require stringent credit checks, making it accessible to a broader range of borrowers. The collateral itself is the primary security. Flexibility: Loan terms can be flexible, with varying durations and repayment options to suit individual needs. Diversification Opportunities: Accessing liquidity without selling Bitcoin allows you to diversify your investment portfolio. You can use the borrowed funds to invest in other assets while still holding onto your BTC. Navigating the Landscape of Crypto Loans: Potential Challenges While crypto loans are incredibly promising, it’s essential to be aware of potential challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a double-edged sword. While price appreciation benefits you, significant price drops can trigger margin calls and potential liquidation of your collateral if you can’t meet them. Interest Rates: Interest rates on crypto loans can sometimes be higher than traditional loans, reflecting the perceived risk and novelty of the market. It’s crucial to compare rates and understand the total cost of borrowing. Platform Risk: Choosing a reputable and secure platform like Onramp and Arch is paramount. However, risks associated with any lending platform, such as security breaches or platform failures, should always be considered. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto lending is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the operation and terms of these services. Is Bitcoin-Backed Lending Right For You? Actionable Insights BTC lending can be a powerful tool, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. Consider these points to determine if it aligns with your financial goals: Long-Term Bitcoin Belief: If you are a strong believer in Bitcoin’s long-term value and want to maintain your holdings, this service is highly relevant. Liquidity Needs: If you have a need for funds but don’t want to sell your Bitcoin, Bitcoin-backed lending provides a viable alternative. Risk Tolerance: Understand the volatility risks associated with Bitcoin and the potential for margin calls. Ensure you are comfortable with these risks. Financial Planning: Carefully assess your financial situation and ensure you can comfortably repay the loan according to the agreed terms. The Future of Crypto Lending is Here The partnership between Onramp and Arch marks a significant step forward in making Bitcoin-backed lending more accessible and mainstream. This innovative service empowers Bitcoin holders to unlock the value of their assets without relinquishing ownership, paving the way for a more flexible and efficient crypto financial ecosystem. As the crypto market matures, expect to see more sophisticated and user-friendly services like this emerge, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and the exciting world of digital assets.

40612655,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132354,1740095622,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Move: ECB Exploring Blockchain Payment System – A Digital Euro Future?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ecb-blockchain-payment-system/,"Exciting news is brewing in the financial world! The European Central Bank (ECB), a major player in global finance, is stepping into the innovative realm of blockchain technology. Imagine a world where your everyday transactions are powered by the same tech behind cryptocurrencies, but managed by your central bank. Sounds intriguing, right? Let’s dive into what this groundbreaking exploration by the ECB could mean for the future of payments and the potential rise of a digital euro. Why is the ECB Exploring a Blockchain Payment System? The ECB’s interest in a blockchain payment system signals a significant shift in how central banks are viewing this technology. For years, blockchain has been primarily associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, institutions like the ECB are recognizing its potential to revolutionize traditional finance. But what exactly is driving this exploration? Efficiency and Speed: Traditional payment systems can be slow and involve multiple intermediaries. Blockchain, with its decentralized and automated nature, promises faster and more efficient transactions. Reduced Costs: By streamlining processes and eliminating middlemen, a blockchain-based system could significantly lower the costs associated with payments. Enhanced Security: Blockchain’s cryptographic security features offer robust protection against fraud and cyber threats, making transactions more secure. Innovation and Future-Proofing: The ECB is likely looking to stay ahead of the curve in financial innovation. Exploring blockchain allows them to understand and potentially lead the future of payment technologies. The Potential Benefits of a Blockchain-Based Payment System The advantages of the ECB adopting a blockchain payment system are numerous and could impact various aspects of the European economy. Let’s break down some key benefits: Benefit Description Faster Transactions Blockchain can process payments much faster than traditional banking systems, potentially enabling near-instantaneous transactions. Lower Transaction Fees By cutting out intermediaries, blockchain systems can significantly reduce transaction fees, benefiting both consumers and businesses. Increased Transparency Blockchain provides a transparent and auditable record of transactions, enhancing trust and accountability within the financial system. Financial Inclusion Blockchain-based systems can potentially reach underserved populations, providing access to financial services for those currently excluded. Programmable Money Blockchain allows for the creation of programmable money, enabling automated payments and smart contracts for complex financial operations. Is a Digital Euro on the Horizon? The ECB’s exploration of a blockchain payment system naturally raises questions about the future of the euro and the possibility of a digital euro . While this exploration doesn’t explicitly confirm the imminent launch of a digital euro, it strongly suggests that the ECB is seriously considering digital currencies as part of its future strategy. A central bank digital currency (CBDC), like a digital euro, could leverage blockchain technology to offer a digital form of central bank money directly to citizens and businesses. This move aligns with global trends as many central banks worldwide are researching and experimenting with CBDCs. The potential for a digital euro to enhance the Eurozone’s financial infrastructure, compete with private cryptocurrencies, and improve monetary policy implementation is significant. Challenges and Considerations for Blockchain Adoption by the ECB While the potential of a blockchain payment system is exciting, the ECB must navigate several challenges and considerations before widespread adoption becomes a reality: Scalability: Blockchain networks need to handle a massive volume of transactions efficiently to support a major economy like the Eurozone. Regulation and Compliance: Clear regulatory frameworks are essential to ensure the legal and compliant operation of a blockchain-based payment system. This includes addressing anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) requirements. Privacy Concerns: Balancing transparency with user privacy is crucial. The design of the system must address how personal and transaction data will be protected. Interoperability: The new system needs to be interoperable with existing financial infrastructure and systems to ensure a smooth transition and integration. Cybersecurity Risks: While blockchain is secure, vulnerabilities can still exist. Robust cybersecurity measures are paramount to protect the system from attacks. Cryptocurrency Adoption and the ECB’s Stance The ECB’s move into blockchain also occurs against the backdrop of growing cryptocurrency adoption globally. While the ECB has maintained a cautious stance on decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, their exploration of blockchain technology indicates a nuanced approach. They seem to recognize the underlying technology’s value while seeking to maintain control and stability within the regulated financial system. This exploration could be seen as a strategic move to harness the innovation of blockchain while mitigating the risks associated with unregulated cryptocurrencies. By developing its own blockchain-based payment system, the ECB could potentially offer a secure and regulated digital alternative, influencing the future landscape of cryptocurrency adoption and digital finance in Europe. Conclusion: A Transformative Step Towards Digital Finance? The ECB’s exploration of a blockchain-based payment system is undoubtedly a transformative step. It signifies a growing recognition of blockchain’s potential to reshape the financial world. While challenges remain, this initiative could pave the way for a more efficient, secure, and innovative payment landscape in Europe. The journey towards a potential digital euro and the broader integration of blockchain into mainstream finance is underway, and the world is watching closely. This is not just about payments; it’s about reimagining the future of money itself.

40612766,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132355,1740095709,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"HUGE Crypto Gains: Investors Averaged $5,482 Profit in 2024 – Shocking Report Reveals",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-investor-profits-2024-report/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The latest CoinLedger report is out, and it paints a seriously rosy picture for crypto investors in 2024. After navigating the choppy waters of the previous year, it seems the tide has turned, bringing a wave of crypto gains that are making headlines. Forget pocket change – we’re talking about an average realized gain of $5,482 per investor. That’s a significant jump from the $887.60 seen in 2023! Ready to dive into the details of this exciting surge and understand what fueled this impressive comeback? Explosive Growth in Crypto Investor Profits: What Sparked the Surge? The numbers speak for themselves: a massive leap in investor profits compared to the previous year. But what exactly triggered this financial fireworks display? CoinLedger points to a key catalyst: renewed market enthusiasm following the U.S. presidential election. It appears the political landscape played a significant role in reigniting investor confidence and injecting fresh energy into the crypto market. This positive sentiment created a fertile ground for growth, allowing investors to reap substantial rewards. Let’s break down the key factors contributing to this impressive upturn: Post-Election Market Optimism: The resolution of political uncertainty often brings stability and renewed confidence in financial markets, and cryptocurrency is no exception. Increased Adoption: Continued mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies is likely playing a role, with more individuals and institutions entering the market. Positive Market Sentiment: A general shift towards positive sentiment in the crypto space, potentially driven by factors like regulatory clarity in some regions and technological advancements. This combination of factors created a perfect storm for investor profits , resulting in the impressive gains reported by CoinLedger. Bitcoin’s Reign Continues: Still the King of Crypto Holdings Bitcoin Dominance in Crypto Portfolios Despite the ever-evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency world, one thing remains constant: Bitcoin’s dominance. The CoinLedger report reaffirms that bitcoin continues to be the most-held asset among crypto investors. This isn’t surprising, given Bitcoin’s status as the original cryptocurrency and its established track record. It remains a cornerstone of many crypto portfolios, valued for its store of value proposition and brand recognition. However, the report also highlights an interesting contrast. While Bitcoin leads in holdings, Ethereum (ETH) emerged as the leader in unrealized losses. This suggests a more complex picture beneath the surface. While investors hold onto their Bitcoin, perhaps for long-term gains, Ethereum’s price fluctuations might be causing more unrealized losses in the short term. It’s crucial to remember that unrealized losses are simply paper losses – they only become realized when an asset is sold at a loss. Emerging Stars: SUPER and HYPE Lead Unrealized Gains While established cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, the crypto market is also a breeding ground for innovation and new projects. CoinLedger’s report shines a spotlight on some of these rising stars, revealing that newer tokens like SUPER and HYPE posted the largest unrealized gains. This is exciting news for those who are always on the lookout for the next big thing in crypto. Tokens like SUPER and HYPE, often associated with newer blockchain projects or trends, demonstrate the potential for explosive growth within the crypto space. However, it’s important to approach these newer tokens with caution. While the potential for high gains is there, so is the risk. Thorough research and understanding of the project behind these tokens are crucial before investing. Key takeaway: Don’t just focus on the established giants. Keep an eye on emerging tokens like SUPER and HYPE – they might just be the hidden gems in the crypto universe. But always remember to do your due diligence! Coinbase Takes the Crown: The Go-To Exchange for Tax Reporting The crypto landscape is not just about asset performance; it’s also about the infrastructure that supports it. Exchanges play a vital role in facilitating crypto trading and investment. According to CoinLedger’s findings, Coinbase Exchange has overtaken Binance as the most-used exchange for tax reporting purposes. This shift could be attributed to several factors: Regulatory Scrutiny: Binance has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in various jurisdictions, which might be prompting users to favor exchanges with a stronger regulatory standing like Coinbase. User-Friendliness for Tax Reporting: Coinbase may offer more user-friendly tools and resources for tax reporting compared to Binance, making it a preferred choice for users navigating the complexities of crypto taxes. U.S. Investor Base: Coinbase has a strong presence in the U.S. market, and with the U.S. presidential election being a key factor in market enthusiasm, it’s plausible that increased activity from U.S. investors is contributing to Coinbase’s rise in tax reporting usage. Ledger, a popular hardware wallet provider, maintained its lead in wallet imports for tax reporting. This highlights the continued importance of hardware wallets for secure crypto storage and the growing need for seamless tax reporting solutions within the crypto ecosystem. Navigating Crypto Taxes: Actionable Insights for Investors The CoinLedger report underscores the increasing importance of tax reporting in the crypto world. With greater adoption and regulatory attention, understanding and complying with crypto tax obligations is no longer optional – it’s essential. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors to navigate the tax landscape effectively: Track Your Transactions Diligently: Keep meticulous records of all your crypto transactions, including buys, sells, trades, and transfers. This is crucial for accurate tax reporting. Utilize Tax Reporting Tools: Consider using crypto tax software like CoinLedger to automate the process of calculating your tax liabilities. These tools can significantly simplify tax reporting. Understand Tax Regulations: Familiarize yourself with the crypto tax regulations in your jurisdiction. Tax rules can vary significantly from country to country. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re unsure about any aspect of crypto taxes, don’t hesitate to consult with a qualified tax professional who specializes in cryptocurrency. Tax reporting in the crypto space might seem daunting, but with the right tools and knowledge, it can be managed effectively. Staying compliant is not just about avoiding penalties; it’s about participating responsibly in the evolving crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A Promising Outlook for Crypto Investors The CoinLedger report paints an encouraging picture for crypto investors in 2024. The significant surge in average realized gains, driven by renewed market enthusiasm, signals a positive shift in the crypto landscape. While bitcoin remains the dominant asset, the rise of newer tokens and the evolving dynamics of exchanges like Coinbase highlight the dynamism and constant change within the crypto market. As the crypto space matures, tax reporting and regulatory compliance will become increasingly important. Investors who stay informed, utilize available tools, and seek professional guidance when needed will be best positioned to thrive in this exciting and ever-evolving world of digital assets. The investor profits of 2024 are a testament to the potential of cryptocurrency, and suggest a bright future for those who navigate this space wisely.

These include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies globally remains a key concern for institutions. Clarity and consistent regulations are crucial for broader adoption. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market can be a deterrent for risk-averse institutional investors. Risk management strategies and long-term perspectives are essential. Custodial Solutions and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of digital assets is paramount for institutions. Robust and regulated custodial solutions are necessary. Education and Understanding: A deeper understanding of cryptocurrency technology and markets is needed within traditional financial institutions to facilitate informed investment decisions. Actionable Insights: Embracing the NEAR Opportunity For institutional investors considering dipping their toes into the crypto waters, the NEAR Adoption Fund presents a compelling opportunity. Here are some actionable insights: Due Diligence on NEAR Protocol: Conduct thorough research on NEAR’s technology, ecosystem, and long-term potential.

As interest in decentralized commerce builds, Web3Bay remains one of the projects with strong potential for future expansion. Cardano (ADA) Poised for Breakout as Market Sentiment Shifts Cardano (ADA) is displaying strong signals of a potential breakout, fueling speculation among traders. Analysts note that ADA’s price trends mirror past patterns that led to major rallies. On-chain data reveals a rise in transaction volume and large investor accumulation, strengthening positive market sentiment. Meanwhile, key support levels remain intact, reinforcing stability despite market fluctuations. Technical indicators, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Averages, point to increasing momentum, with ADA approaching a crucial resistance zone. A successful breakout could open the door for notable gains. At the same time, Cardano’s expanding ecosystem is adding to overall investor confidence. Despite the bullish signals, traders remain alert as Bitcoin’s movement and broader market conditions influence ADA’s path. While the potential for a rally remains strong, volatility persists. Therefore, traders are closely watching key price levels for possible fluctuations in the coming weeks. Dogecoin’s Journey to $2: Experts See Bullish Potential Despite a 40% drop since mid-January, analysts maintain that Dogecoin still has strong bullish potential. Trader Alan points to past trends where temporary declines were followed by massive price jumps, calling this period the “DOGE season.” He suggests that if history repeats itself, Dogecoin could reach $2.2, referring to its 8,800% surge in 2017-2018 and an even larger 28,000% spike in 2020-2021. Another analyst, Javon Marks, also believes a $2 target is achievable. Key factors fueling this prediction include increased adoption, strong market sentiment, and expectations of future integrations. However, despite Dogecoin’s history of sudden price spikes, achieving this goal depends on sustained interest and bullish market conditions. At the same time, experts warn that Dogecoin’s price movements remain unpredictable. Still, if momentum builds, Dogecoin could experience another rapid climb. The next few months will be crucial in determining whether Dogecoin can surpass its previous all-time highs. Wrapping Up! As Web3Bay continues attracting major buyers, Cardano edges closer to a breakout, and Dogecoin eyes another rally, competition in the crypto space remains fierce. Each project brings unique strengths—Web3Bay’s focus on decentralized shopping , Cardano’s growing ecosystem, and Dogecoin’s strong support base. However, Web3Bay’s structure makes it stand out, providing a more scalable and efficient model that addresses key issues seen in other networks. While short-term market trends fuel speculation, long-term success depends on adoption and usability.

40613151,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132364,1740096038,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Vitalik Buterin’s Powerful Endorsement: Argentina’s Ethereum Community Shines Amid Meme Coin Frenzy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/vitalik-buterin-argentina-ethereum-community/,"In the electrifying world of cryptocurrency, where meme coins can momentarily steal the spotlight, it’s the robust foundations of genuine innovation and community that truly matter. Recently, amidst the buzz surrounding Argentina’s presidential meme coin, LIBRA, Ethereum’s co-founder, the visionary Vitalik Buterin, stepped forward to illuminate a different narrative – the remarkable strength and dedication of the Argentina Ethereum community . His words, delivered via X (formerly Twitter), served as a powerful reminder of where true value lies in the crypto ecosystem: in the builders, the educators, and the communities that are shaping the future of decentralized technology. Why Vitalik Buterin is Praising the Argentina Ethereum Community Right Now? The crypto sphere is no stranger to fleeting trends and viral sensations. The recent emergence of LIBRA, a meme coin associated with Argentina’s presidential landscape, captured significant attention, particularly within the country. While meme coins can be entertaining and generate short-term excitement, Vitalik Buterin astutely redirected the focus to something far more enduring and impactful: the Argentina Ethereum community . Buterin’s message wasn’t just a casual mention; it was a deliberate and heartfelt acknowledgment. He specifically called out the “amazing builders” within Argentina who have been instrumental in the growth and evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem. This wasn’t about dismissing the meme coin phenomenon, but rather using it as a pivotal moment to highlight the deeper, more meaningful contributions emanating from Argentina. Here’s a breakdown of why Buterin’s praise is so significant: Recognition of Real Contribution: Buterin’s words serve as a powerful validation for the hard work and dedication of Argentinian developers, enthusiasts, and educators who are actively building on Ethereum. Shifting Focus from Hype to Substance: In a market often swayed by hype, Buterin’s statement brings attention back to the fundamental value creation happening within the Ethereum ecosystem. Encouragement for Continued Growth: His message acts as a catalyst, inspiring the Ethereum community in Argentina to continue their impactful work and to see temporary distractions as opportunities for growth. Global Perspective: Buterin’s mention underscores the global nature of the Ethereum community and acknowledges the vital role that regions like Latin America, and specifically Argentina, play in the broader crypto narrative. The Vibrant Argentina Ethereum Community: What Makes it Stand Out? Argentina, like many nations in Latin America, has seen a burgeoning interest in cryptocurrency. Several factors contribute to the dynamism of the Ethereum community in Argentina: Economic Context: Argentina has faced significant economic challenges, including inflation and currency devaluation. In this environment, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum can present themselves as attractive alternatives for savings and transactions. This economic backdrop fuels interest and adoption. Tech-Savvy Population: Argentina boasts a highly educated and tech-forward population. This translates to a strong pool of talent capable of understanding and contributing to complex technologies like blockchain and Ethereum. Grassroots Community Building: The Argentinian crypto community is known for its grassroots, bottom-up approach. Enthusiasts have actively organized meetups, workshops, and online forums, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment. Developer Talent: Latin America, including Argentina, is increasingly recognized as a hub for software development talent. This technical expertise is crucial for building and innovating within the Ethereum ecosystem. Examples of Argentinian contributions to the Ethereum space might include local Ethereum meetups and conferences, open-source projects developed by Argentinian developers, and Argentinian startups building on Ethereum. While specific examples weren’t mentioned in the original prompt, further research would likely reveal concrete instances of Argentinian innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. LIBRA Meme Coin Hype: A Setback or a Chance for Crypto Education? The rise of LIBRA, the presidential meme coin in Argentina, is a fascinating case study. It highlights the power of virality and the often unpredictable nature of crypto markets. However, as Vitalik Buterin pointed out, these moments of hype can also serve as crucial inflection points. Instead of viewing the meme coin frenzy as a discouragement, Buterin frames it as a “call for better crypto education .” Here’s why this perspective is so vital: Understanding the Underlying Technology: Meme coins, by their nature, often lack fundamental utility or technological innovation. The LIBRA hype underscores the need for broader public understanding of the difference between speculative assets and projects with real technological underpinnings like Ethereum. Risk Awareness: Meme coins are notoriously volatile and carry significant risk. Education is crucial to ensure individuals understand these risks before investing, preventing potential financial harm. Promoting Responsible Engagement: Crypto education empowers individuals to engage with the crypto space responsibly and critically, moving beyond just chasing quick gains to understanding the long-term potential of blockchain technology. Building a Sustainable Ecosystem: A well-educated crypto community is essential for the long-term health and sustainability of the entire ecosystem. It fosters informed participation, responsible innovation, and reduces susceptibility to speculative bubbles. Buterin’s call to action is clear: use moments like the meme coin hype to double down on crypto education efforts. This includes educating the public about blockchain technology, the principles of decentralized finance (DeFi), the importance of security, and the risks and rewards associated with different types of crypto assets. Investing in Crypto Education: Unlocking Argentina and Latin America’s Potential Vitalik Buterin’s optimism about Argentina and Latin America’s ongoing impact in the crypto space is deeply rooted in the region’s potential and the proactive steps being taken by its communities. Investing in crypto education is not just about mitigating risks; it’s about unlocking immense opportunities. Here are actionable insights for fostering better crypto education in Argentina and beyond: Area Actionable Insights Educational Institutions Integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency education into curricula at universities, colleges, and even high schools. Offer courses, workshops, and seminars on blockchain technology, cryptography, and decentralized applications. Community Initiatives Support and expand grassroots educational initiatives led by crypto communities. Organize free workshops, meetups, and online resources. Create mentorship programs to guide newcomers. Government and Policy Makers Develop public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Support research and development in the blockchain space. Create clear and sensible regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation while protecting consumers. Industry Collaboration Foster collaboration between crypto companies and educational institutions to develop practical training programs and internships. Industry experts can contribute valuable real-world insights to educational efforts. Accessible Resources Create and translate high-quality educational materials into local languages. Ensure resources are accessible online and offline, catering to diverse learning styles and levels of technical understanding. By prioritizing crypto education , Argentina and Latin America can solidify their position as key contributors to the global crypto revolution. A well-informed populace will be better equipped to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology, participate in decentralized economies, and drive innovation in the years to come. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Argentina’s Ethereum Community Vitalik Buterin’s praise for the Argentina Ethereum community is more than just a pat on the back; it’s a powerful endorsement of the talent, dedication, and potential within the region. Amidst the fleeting hype of meme coins and market fluctuations, Buterin’s message serves as a vital reminder of the enduring importance of community, education, and genuine technological advancement. Argentina’s vibrant Ethereum community , fueled by passionate builders and a growing ecosystem, is poised to continue making significant contributions to the crypto space, proving that true value lies not in fleeting trends, but in sustained effort and collective growth. The future for Argentina and Latin America in the crypto world looks incredibly bright, powered by informed communities and innovative spirit.

Recent news from the Federal Reserve is sending ripples across the economic landscape. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic has reiterated his expectation for two interest rate cuts in 2025. While this might sound like distant future talk, it holds significant implications for today’s investment decisions, particularly in the crypto space. Let’s dive into what Bostic’s forecast means and how it could impact your financial strategies. Why Are Fed Rate Cuts in 2025 Generating Buzz? The Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates are pivotal moments for the global economy. These decisions influence borrowing costs, inflation, and overall economic growth. When a prominent figure like Raphael Bostic, President of the Atlanta Fed, speaks about future rate cuts, the market listens intently. His recent statement, reaffirming his projection for two rate cuts in 2025, comes amidst a backdrop of considerable economic outlook uncertainty. But why is this forecast noteworthy? Sign of Potential Easing: Rate cuts are generally seen as a signal that the Fed is moving towards easing monetary policy. This usually happens when the economy shows signs of slowing down, or when inflation is trending towards the desired target. Impact on Borrowing Costs: Lower interest rates can reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially stimulating economic activity. Market Sentiment Booster: For investors, especially in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, the prospect of lower rates can be a positive catalyst, often leading to increased investment and market optimism. However, Bostic also emphasized the significant economic uncertainty that could alter this outlook. This caveat is crucial. It means that while two rate cuts are currently projected, the actual economic conditions in 2025 will ultimately dictate the Fed’s actions. Understanding the Current Economic Climate To truly grasp the significance of Bostic’s comments, it’s important to understand the current economic climate. We are navigating a complex scenario characterized by: Persistent Inflation: While inflation has cooled down from its peak, it remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The stickiness of inflation is a major concern, influencing the Fed’s cautious approach. Labor Market Strength: The labor market has remained surprisingly robust, with low unemployment rates. This strength can contribute to inflationary pressures, making the Fed’s job of controlling inflation more challenging. Global Economic Headwinds: Geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and varying economic performances across different regions add layers of complexity to the global economic picture. How Do Fed Rate Cuts Influence Financial Markets? The anticipation of Fed rate cuts , even a year out, can have immediate and projected impacts on various segments of the financial markets . Let’s break down some key areas: Stock Market: Historically, rate cuts are often seen as positive for the stock market. Lower rates can reduce borrowing costs for companies, potentially boosting earnings and making stocks more attractive compared to bonds. Bond Market: Bond yields tend to move in the same direction as the Fed’s policy rate. Therefore, expected rate cuts usually lead to lower bond yields, which can increase bond prices. Cryptocurrency Market: The crypto market, known for its high volatility, can be particularly sensitive to changes in monetary policy. Lower interest rates can reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like cryptocurrencies, potentially driving investment into this sector. Forex Market: Rate cuts can weaken the domestic currency as lower rates make the currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns. However, it’s crucial to remember that the impact is not always straightforward and can be influenced by numerous other factors, including overall economic sentiment and global events. The Crypto Angle: What Does This Mean for Digital Assets? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, the prospect of interest rate cuts is often viewed with optimism. Here’s why: Increased Liquidity: Lower rates can inject more liquidity into the market. Some of this liquidity may find its way into higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. Reduced Borrowing Costs for Crypto Firms: Crypto companies and projects that rely on borrowing may benefit from reduced interest expenses, fostering growth and innovation. Investment Appeal: In a low-rate environment, the allure of potentially higher returns from cryptocurrencies becomes stronger compared to traditional fixed-income investments. Hedge Against Inflation (Debatable): While the narrative of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge is debated, some investors see cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class that could perform well in an environment where traditional currencies might be devalued due to inflationary pressures (though this is complex and not always a direct correlation). However, it’s not all smooth sailing. The crypto market is also influenced by its own set of factors, including regulatory developments, technological advancements, and market sentiment. Therefore, while rate cuts can be a tailwind, they are just one piece of the puzzle. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Investors Given the economic uncertainty highlighted by Bostic, and the anticipation of Fed rate cuts in 2025, what should investors, especially those in the crypto space, consider? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of economic data releases, Fed communications, and global economic developments. Economic conditions can change rapidly, and staying informed is crucial for making timely investment decisions. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains a cornerstone of sound investment strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Risk Management: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and while the potential for high returns is there, so is the risk of significant losses. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on long-term investment goals rather than getting swayed by short-term market fluctuations. Rate cuts in 2025 are still a future projection and the market can react in unpredictable ways in the short run. Due Diligence: Whether you are investing in traditional assets or cryptocurrencies, always conduct thorough research and due diligence. Understand the assets you are investing in and the factors that can influence their performance. The Road Ahead: Cautious Optimism? Raphael Bostic’s reiteration of two rate cuts in 2025 provides a glimpse into the Federal Reserve’s current thinking. While the forecast offers a sense of cautious optimism for financial markets and potentially the crypto sector, the emphasis on economic uncertainty is a crucial reminder. The actual path of interest rates will depend heavily on how the economy evolves over the next year and a half. For investors, this means staying vigilant, adaptable, and well-informed. The future remains dynamic, and navigating it successfully requires a balanced approach of hope and prudence.

Ready to dive into the details of this innovative financial product? What is the Franklin Templeton EZPZ ETP? The Franklin Templeton EZPZ ETP is designed as a straightforward and accessible way for investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Instead of directly purchasing and managing Bitcoin and Ethereum, investors can now invest in an ETP that tracks the performance of these digital assets. The initial composition of the EZPZ ETP reflects the current dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the crypto market, allocating approximately 87% to Bitcoin and 13% to Ethereum based on their respective market capitalizations. This allocation strategy aims to mirror the prevailing trends and investor interest within the cryptocurrency landscape. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key features: Effortless Exposure: Gain exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum without the need for crypto wallets, private keys, or direct exchange interactions. Market-Reflective Composition: Initially weighted 87% Bitcoin and 13% Ethereum, mirroring market capitalization. Potential for Expansion: Future inclusion of other digital assets is anticipated, pending regulatory approvals, suggesting dynamic portfolio evolution. Institutional Backing: Launched by Franklin Templeton, a globally recognized and trusted asset manager, adding credibility and security. Why Choose a Bitcoin Ethereum ETP like EZPZ? Investing in cryptocurrencies can seem daunting for newcomers. The technicalities of wallets, exchanges, and security concerns can be significant hurdles. This is where a Bitcoin Ethereum ETP like EZPZ shines. It simplifies the process, offering a regulated and familiar investment vehicle. But what are the specific advantages? Let’s explore the benefits of investing in a Crypto ETP through a table: Benefit Description Simplified Access ETPs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible through brokerage accounts, eliminating the need for specialized crypto exchange accounts. Reduced Complexity Investors avoid the complexities of managing crypto wallets, private keys, and security protocols associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership. Regulatory Compliance ETPs are typically regulated financial products, offering a layer of investor protection and transparency compared to unregulated direct crypto investments. Diversification Potential Provides diversification within a traditional investment portfolio by adding exposure to the digital asset class. Liquidity ETPs offer liquidity as they can be bought and sold easily during exchange trading hours, similar to stocks. The Allure of Digital Asset Exposure: What’s the Big Deal? The buzz around Digital Asset Exposure is undeniable. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have captured global attention due to their potential for high growth and disruptive innovation. But why are institutional investors like Franklin Templeton increasingly interested in providing access to this asset class? Here’s why Digital Asset Exposure is becoming increasingly crucial for modern investment portfolios: Growth Potential: Cryptocurrencies, despite volatility, have shown significant growth potential over the long term, attracting investors seeking high returns. Innovation and Disruption: The underlying blockchain technology is revolutionizing various industries, and cryptocurrencies are at the forefront of this technological shift. Inflation Hedge: Some investors view Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as potential hedges against inflation, diversifying away from traditional assets. Institutional Adoption: Increasing institutional adoption signals growing confidence and maturity in the cryptocurrency market, further legitimizing the asset class. Portfolio Diversification: Adding digital assets can enhance portfolio diversification, potentially reducing overall risk and improving risk-adjusted returns. Looking Ahead: The Future of EZPZ and Crypto ETPs Franklin Templeton’s launch of EZPZ ETP signals a significant step forward in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency investments. The potential inclusion of additional digital assets in the future highlights the dynamic nature of this product and its adaptability to the evolving crypto landscape.

What could the future hold for Crypto ETPs like EZPZ? Expansion of Asset Coverage: We might see EZPZ and similar ETPs expanding to include a wider range of cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering more diversified exposure. Thematic ETPs: Future ETPs could focus on specific themes within the crypto space, such as DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), or Metaverse-related assets. Increased Competition: The success of EZPZ is likely to attract more traditional financial institutions to launch similar products, fostering competition and innovation in the ETP market. Lower Fees: Increased competition could also drive down management fees associated with ETPs, making them even more attractive to investors. Global Availability: As regulatory landscapes evolve globally, we can expect to see wider availability of crypto ETPs across different regions, increasing accessibility for investors worldwide. Actionable Insights: Is EZPZ ETP Right for You? The Franklin Templeton EZPZ ETP presents an intriguing option for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum in a simplified and regulated manner. However, like any investment, it’s crucial to consider whether it aligns with your individual financial goals and risk tolerance. Here are some actionable insights to help you decide: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Ensure you understand the risks involved and that your risk tolerance aligns with investing in digital assets, even through an ETP. Consider Your Investment Goals: Determine if crypto exposure fits into your overall investment strategy and goals. Are you looking for long-term growth, diversification, or speculative opportunities? Research ETP Details: Thoroughly review the prospectus and details of the EZPZ ETP, including fees, tracking methodology, and any specific risks associated with the product. Compare with Alternatives: Explore other options for crypto exposure, such as direct cryptocurrency ownership or other crypto investment products, to make an informed decision. Consult a Financial Advisor: If you are unsure whether EZPZ ETP is suitable for you, seek advice from a qualified financial advisor who can assess your individual circumstances and provide personalized recommendations. Conclusion: A Simplified Gateway to Crypto? Franklin Templeton’s EZPZ ETP marks an exciting development, potentially simplifying the entry point for investors interested in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. By offering a regulated, accessible, and market-representative product, EZPZ could pave the way for broader adoption of digital assets within mainstream investment portfolios. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, innovative products like EZPZ ETP will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping the future of finance and investment.

This Pattern Signal SHIB New All-Time High,https://coingape.com/can-shiba-inu-price-surge-422-this-pattern-signal-shib-new-all-time-high/,"Shiba Inu price has recently broken out of a Falling Wedge pattern, a formation commonly recognized as a bullish reversal signal in technical analysis. The pattern is characterized by a downward consolidation with lower highs and lower lows, which eventually leads to a meme coin rally breakout. Shiba Inu Price Breaks Out of Falling Wedge Formation According to analyst Bezos Crypto , Shiba Inu price has completed a breakout from a Falling Wedge, a pattern associated with strong upward movements. This formation often indicates a trend reversal, with SHIB price action shifting from a downtrend to an uptrend. In previous instances, similar setups have led to substantial gains for SHIB, fueling optimism among traders and investors. The breakout is accompanied by a noticeable increase in trading volume, suggesting strong participation from investors. Volume confirmation is a crucial aspect of validating the meme coin rally, as it indicates growing buying interest. If Shiba Inu price maintains its momentum, it could reach the projected price target of $0.00008841, reflecting a 422% increase. Meanwhile, most recently, SHIB whales have triggered volatility by offloading 2.1 trillion tokens, adding uncertainty to price action. The sudden transaction, valued at $32.55 million, has raised concerns over potential selling pressure. Bitcoin’s Influence on SHIB and Technical Analysis More so, Bitcoin price trend, plays a crucial role in determining the trajectory of Shiba Inu price. Historically, altcoins such as SHIB have exhibited strong price movements during Bitcoin’s bullish phases. When Bitcoin consolidates or trends higher, altcoins often benefit from increased market liquidity and positive sentiment. On the same note, other technical aspects also align with the bullish narrative, as various technicals suggest upcoming meme coin rally. AO is shifting the momentum from the red bars, to green bars which depict a bullish reversal. AO, which measures market momentum, suggests that selling pressure is fading, and buyers are beginning to gain control. In addition, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator gives buying signal, because the MACD line has crossed the signal line. This crossover is an indication that the trend is moving towards the buyers end hence conforming a bullish trend. Source: TradingView More so, the histogram bars, which represent the difference between the MACD and signal lines, have turned green, reinforcing the strengthening bullish sentiment. If this trend continues, it could indicate a strong upward movement in SHIB price to a new all-time high. Risk Considerations Ahead of The Meme Coin Rally While the bullish scenario for Shiba Inu price remains strong, traders remain cautious about potential volatility. Price movements in the cryptocurrency market can be influenced by external factors, including regulatory news, and shifts in investor sentiment. A retracement or a retest of the breakout zone is possible before further upside continuation. Key resistance levels to monitor include $0.000030, $0.000050, and the previous all-time high near $0.00008841. On the downside, support levels at $0.000020 and $0.000015 could act as critical zones if a pullback occurs. Also, a recent report revealed that top meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin and Floki Inu, are at risk to declining futures open interest. The data also indicates that SHIB’s futures Open Interest has dropped by 74.41% and DOGE by 58.45% which shows a decreased trader interest. The post Can Shiba Inu Price Surge 422%?

Until now, Cohen exclusively followed the official GameStop handle, but as of today, he has added Bitcoin Magazine to his follow list. This comes on the heels of a much-discussed photograph that surfaced two weeks ago showing Cohen with Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). 👀 Go on king 👑 https://t.co/ApTV3WwTaj — David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) February 20, 2025 Will Gamestop Buy Bitcoin? GameStop has periodically found itself at the center of Bitcoin-related conjecture, particularly since the pandemic era “meme stock” phenomenon. At that time, a theory posted on Wall Street Bets—a popular Reddit forum—proposed that the gaming retailer, viewed by many as a relic of brick-and-mortar retail, was primed for a turnaround. Widespread retail buying propelled the share price upward, challenging major hedge funds that had shorted the stock. The resulting clash was widely likened to a “David vs. Goliath” scenario. The Bitcoin connection emerged as the pandemic-driven mania intersected with discourse on decentralized finance. Some observers drew parallels between the grassroots support for GameStop and the way Bitcoin was embraced as a hedge against systemic corruption in traditional finance. Since then, theories have circulated that GameStop could adopt a corporate Bitcoin strategy, potentially mirroring MicroStrategy’s aggressive move into BTC. Two weeks ago, Cohen posted a photo on X in which he appeared alongside Michael Saylor, as reported by Bitcoinist. Given Saylor’s reputation as a high-profile advocate for corporate BTC treasury strategies—he spearheads the acquisition of nearly 500,000 BTC at Strategy—many in the Bitcoin sphere speculated that Cohen might be seeking Saylor’s counsel. However, caution soon followed. According to two unnamed sources cited by CNBC, Saylor has no direct involvement in any potential GameStop plan to buy Bitcoin. The rumors remain just that: speculation that has yet to be confirmed by either Cohen or GameStop. Fueling these rumors is the fact that GameStop reported having around $4.616 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of October 31, 2024. Tim Kotzman, host of “The Bitcoin Treasuries Podcast,” recently highlighted GameStop’s investment policy that grants Cohen “the authority to invest in cryptocurrencies without requiring shareholder or board approval.” “If GameStop $GME were to invest its $4.6 billion cash reserves into BTC, it would acquire approximately 48,000 BTC,” wrote analyst Han Akamatsu on X, noting that such a position would make GameStop the second-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, surpassing MARA Holdings but still behind Strategy. However, such predictions are heavily speculative. GameStop has dabbled in NFTs and blockchain projects in the past, but there is no official indication that the company is imminently acquiring Bitcoin. At press time, BTC traded at $97,708.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Inmortal tells his 229,400 followers on the social media platform X that LINK may increase by more than 194% its current value by early next year. “Green for buying, red for selling. This trade requires: 2/100 IQ. 100/100 patience .

Next up, the trader predicts that top digital assets will see big rallies in the coming months. “I think most underestimate the power of buying spot here on some majors. Easy 2x in three months. Buy, wait, wait, wait, sell.” Lastly, the trader says that Ethereum ( ETH ) may take off on a series of rallies and surpass the $4,800 level by May. “This is how my dream looks like.

Big platforms control pricing, take high fees from sellers, and collect user data without consent. Many businesses struggle under strict platform rules, while buyers end up paying more due to price manipulation and hidden charges. Instead of a free market, a few large companies set the terms and push their own interests, leaving both sellers and buyers with limited choices. Web3Bay is changing this system by cutting out middlemen and using blockchain for secure, direct transactions. Unlike traditional platforms, Web3Bay operates on community-driven smart contracts, ensuring fair pricing and transparency. With over $1.5 million raised in its presale and more than 360 million tokens sold, Web3Bay is proving that online shopping can be fairer and more accessible. The Flaws of Today’s E-Commerce Platforms Large e-commerce platforms hold too much power, setting high transaction fees that can reach 30%, reducing sellers’ profits. To gain visibility, businesses must pay for advertising, making it hard for small sellers to compete. This system favors companies that can afford high ad budgets while pushing independent businesses into obscurity. Buyers also face challenges. Online stores use personal data for targeted ads rather than fair pricing. Hidden costs, ranking manipulations, and misleading product reviews create an unfair shopping experience. Consumers often pay inflated prices due to aggressive advertising and pricing algorithms that favor profits over value. Environmental concerns add to the problem. Fast shipping increases packaging waste and carbon emissions, while return rates of 25-30% further impact sustainability. These platforms prioritize profit over fair commerce, leaving both sellers and buyers with limited choices and higher costs. Web3Bay is working to change this by putting control back in the hands of users, not corporations. How Web3Bay Offers a Better E-Commerce Solution Web3Bay eliminates middlemen using blockchain-powered smart contracts. Buyers and sellers interact directly, avoiding commission-based pricing that increases costs. This structure ensures businesses keep more of their earnings while offering better deals to consumers. A major advantage of Web3Bay is its community governance. Unlike traditional marketplaces where a central company controls policies, Web3Bay allows 3BAY token holders to vote on key decisions. This means no unexpected fee hikes or rule changes favoring large companies. Web3Bay also prioritizes security and user privacy. Unlike mainstream platforms that track users across websites, Web3Bay does not collect personal data for advertising. Payments are secured through cryptocurrency, reducing fraud risks and unnecessary processing fees. With transactions recorded on an unchangeable blockchain ledger, buyers and sellers can trust the transparency of every purchase. By addressing these core issues, Web3Bay is making online shopping fairer and more cost-effective for everyone involved. Web3Bay’s Presale Growth and 3BAY Token System Web3Bay’s presale has gained strong traction, showing the rising demand for decentralized e-commerce. Funds Raised: Over $1.5 million collected so far. Tokens Sold: More than 360 million 3BAY tokens were distributed. Current Presale Stage: Stage 4, with a price of $0.004562625 per token. Total Presale Stages: 28, with prices increasing as each stage progresses. Projected Launch Price: $0.1959 per 3BAY token. Unlike platforms that rely on high fees and advertising, Web3Bay’s token model is built for sustainability. Holding 3BAY tokens offers benefits like discounted purchases, staking rewards, and voting power in governance decisions. There are no hidden charges or expensive memberships—users gain direct advantages by being part of the ecosystem. With presale funding surpassing $1 million, Web3Bay is drawing attention from people looking for fairer, more cost-effective online shopping. The projected 6,430% return from the first to the last presale stage shows the strong potential for early adopters. Web3Bay is Shaping the Future of Online Shopping Web3Bay is not just another shopping platform—it’s a step toward honest, user-driven commerce. By removing unfair fees and protecting user data, it provides an open and fair space for both buyers and sellers. Businesses can operate with fewer restrictions, and consumers get transparent pricing with full control over their transactions. With presale demand rising, Web3Bay is proving that decentralized e-commerce is the way forward. As the platform transitions to full DAO governance, it will continue leading the shift toward fair, user-first online shopping. For those seeking a fairer way to shop and sell online, Web3Bay offers a solution built on transparency and user control.

HBAR price analysis reveals the token’s struggle after a significant 26% decline, with indicators suggesting ongoing market volatility. Concurrently, the PEPE coin price prediction remains speculative as it floats in oversold conditions. While certain cryptocurrencies face hurdles, BlockDAG’s mobile mining ecosystem is flourishing. Over 500,000 users on the X1 App and 200,000 on the TG Tap game illustrate a booming demand for BlockDAG (BDAG) . Its presale has expanded rapidly, bolstering claims that BDAG is the best crypto to mine, especially with forecasts of its value reaching $1 post-exchange listing. HBAR Price Analysis: Uncertainty Prevails Following Sharp Downturn Recent HBAR price analysis highlights a tumultuous phase for Hedera’s token, which has seen a steep 26% drop, breaking its prior bullish momentum. This decline has introduced a sense of uncertainty among traders, as evidenced by a fluctuating funding rate. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also dipped to its lowest in three months, indicating a surge in selling pressure. While there is support at $0.25, the prospects of recovery will hinge on a shift in market dynamics favoring buyers. Traders are now eyeing a potential surge past the $0.33 mark to restore confidence and propel an upward trajectory. PEPE Coin Price Prediction: Anticipating a Market Turnaround? PEPE coin’s price prediction remains uncertain as it struggles to rebound from a substantial 62% fall over the recent months. Now trading at $0.0000095, PEPE has hit what many consider oversold levels on the Stochastic RSI, historically a precursor to robust recoveries. Observers have noted that similar past conditions have catalyzed significant rallies. If this trend repeats, PEPE might experience a noteworthy resurgence shortly. Nonetheless, the future of PEPE coin price prediction also heavily depends on broader economic factors, including ongoing US-China trade tensions, which continue to sway investor sentiment and market stability. BlockDAG Mining Explosion: X1 App Reaches 500K Users, TG Tap Nears 200K BlockDAG’s approach to mobile mining is capturing widespread attention, as evidenced by the half-million users on the X1 App and nearly 200,000 on the TG Tap game . This surge underscores a shift from traditional, complex mining setups to a more accessible, mobile-based model. BDAG mining offers an alternative to the expensive, high-energy setups of the past. Users can now mine BDAG with simple taps on their smartphones, highlighting BDAG as one of the best cryptos to mine for those seeking to engage in crypto accumulation without technical complexities. The X1 App facilitates passive mining on both iOS and Android , running quietly in the background with minimal energy consumption. Meanwhile, TG Tap offers a dynamic, game-based experience on Telegram, where users earn Tap Points through engaging gameplay, later converting to BDAG. Both methods are designed for simplicity, with referral systems that enhance earnings potential by encouraging user-involved expansion. As these mined coins prepare to enter the market, with BDAG’s presale already amassing over $196.7M and an impressive 2380% price increase since its initial offering, the question looms: What will happen when these coins debut on exchanges? With BDAG’s value poised to climb, those mining now are positioned to benefit from significant gains as demand grows and supply tightens, affirming BDAG’s status as the best crypto to mine in an increasingly competitive market. Summing Up! HBAR’s path to recovery is clouded with challenges, with resistance at $0.33 marking a critical juncture according to the latest price analysis. Traders are advised to remain vigilant as they await signs of a bullish reversal. Meanwhile, PEPE’s potential for a comeback is intriguing yet dependent on external market forces. BlockDAG’s mining innovation continues to draw vast numbers of users, with its presale success and anticipated market value increase suggesting a bright future. As the market evolves, BDAG solidifies its position as the best crypto to mine , potentially offering lucrative returns as it gears up for its market debut.

The admission of an XRP-spot ETF application by the SEC has stoked conjecture about the future of XRP. According to some experts, the XRP price prediction is $10 if institutional interest and legislative efforts keep increasing as the price is hovering at $2.70 and gaining speed. Though Remittix (RTX) is the one to keep an eye on in 2025, Ripple (XRP) has significant long-term potential. Its creative crypto-to-fiat conversion mechanism will fundamentally rethink current cross-border transactions. Read on to get more information about the token. XRP Price Prediction: Could SEC’s ETF Acknowledgment Push Ripple to $10? Friday, February 14 saw a significant advancement in the US XRP-spot ETF movement. Officially beginning the review process for yet another XRP-spot ETF, the SEC accepted the 19b-4 application from 21 Shares . This, along with the SEC’s approval of Grayscale’s application, suggested a prospective change in XRP’s perspective by authorities, triggering a positive XRP price prediction. Investors are awaiting SEC rulings on identical petitions from Bitwise, Canary Funds, and WisdomTree. Should the SEC revoke its appeal and authorize an XRP-spot ETF, XRP demand might surge dramatically. Ripple has expanded its footprint in the US after the July 2023 decision on XRP sales, therefore raising XRP’s awareness. Furthermore, very important for XRP’s market behavior might be a possible interface with SWIFT. An XRP-spot ETF might draw institutional players seeking crypto with practical use. Posting his XRP price prediction on X, crypto expert and multimedia producer ALLINCRYPTO anticipates XRP to maybe reach $10 in 2025. His XRP price prediction is fueled by the recent SEC ETF acknowledgment. Remittix Is Poised For A Massive Rally Providing fast and reasonably priced cross-border solutions, Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by aggregating FIAT transactions with blockchain technologies. Supported by more than forty cryptocurrencies like Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the site provides rapid translations into FIAT currencies like USD and GBP, therefore enabling simple bank account deposits. By supporting over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ FIAT currencies, so simplifying world trade with its wide range of possibilities. Remittix is the better alternative to conventional payment providers like Stripe and Wise as a link between crypto and FIAT, both crypto-exclusive systems like Coinbase Wallet and Remittix guarantees accessibility and inclusivity for companies and people by supporting over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ FIAT currencies, so simplifying world trade. Notable also is the platform’s open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over absurd rates of exchange of conventional banks. In the payments industry, remittix is revolutionary since this approach guarantees that the whole amount transferred reaches the recipient, therefore addressing unethical activity all too often. At $0.0628 in the presale stage, the RTX coin offers a good investment potential. Forecasts reveal an interesting rise; demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions is generating a 25 x multiplier in the presale phase and over 1,500 % increases following launch.

This latest product, listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange on Thursday, expands the asset manager’s digital asset offerings after it launched its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year. EZPZ ETF offers low-cost Bitcoin and Ethereum exposure The EZPZ ETF follows the price movements of Bitcoin and Ethereum according to CF Benchmarks’ Institutional Digital Asset Index, which seeks the two most compliant cryptocurrencies under international financial law. Rather than focus on a single asset, the index distributes investments in accordance with market capitalization, with 82% of an investment in EZPZ exposed to Bitcoin while the remaining 18% is correlated to Ethereum’s price movement. EZPZ, for its part, has an expense ratio of 0.19%, making it one of the cheapest cryptocurrency investment offerings on the market. Roger Bayston, Franklin Templeton’s head of digital assets, said the firm aimed to make digital asset exposure more available to everyday investors. Bayston said in a press release that blockchains are becoming powerhouses for today’s and tomorrow’s information and data economy. He noted that they are bringing EZPZ to market as a simple, low-cost way to gain exposure to this now large and significant asset class. Franklin Templeton expands crypto efforts but trails industry giants in AUM Franklin Templeton’s entry into cryptocurrency continues to grow. While its Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) has $708 million in assets under management (AUM)—ranking ninth out of 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs—it lags far behind the $56.6 billion in AUM for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). Franklin Templeton’s Ethereum ETF (EZET) is seventh in its category, with $34 million in AUM. The asset management company actively engages with the crypto community even though it still substantially trails competitors in AUM. The firm’s digital assets division shared a lighthearted image earlier this week on X featuring Benjamin Franklin donning a hat that looks like a McDonald’s uniform. The image referred to a common Crypto Twitter meme about traders struggling in such difficult market conditions. The caption said, “Putting the fries in the bag.” Franklin Templeton is one of several large asset managers on the march into digital assets. Competitors like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have been eyeing spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs with growing investor interest. Institutional adoption of crypto is still on the rise. Earlier this month, Mubadala Investment Company — Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund — reported it had acquired $436 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, indicating increased interest from international financial institutions. With Franklin Templeton making strides in the digital assets space, EZPZ serves as a strategic growth opportunity to provide investors with diversified exposures to cryptocurrencies in a cost-efficient structure that is ideal for investors looking for long-term crypto investment without direct ownership headaches.

This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Peanut the Squirrel, and Shiba Inu. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Burn – The Secret to Its Skyrocketing Value The Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) burn mechanism is fueling an intense demand. Unlike traditional presales, unsold tokens are permanently burned every week, making APC scarcer with each phase. After the presale ends, any remaining tokens will be eliminated, cementing its deflationary nature. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo Coin’s burn strategy ensures long-term sustainability and exponential price appreciation. With fewer tokens in circulation, demand is expected to soar – and so will the potential gains. The project’s unique model has already attracted investors looking for the best crypto to invest in for massive returns. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Blizzard Bay Presale – Don’t Miss Out! Arctic Pablo Coin meme coin presale has now reached Blizzard Bay, its 11th phase, marking another milestone in its thrilling presale journey.

With over $1.44 million already raised, the excitement is at an all-time high. As Arctic Pablo ventures into its next location, prices will rise again. The question is—how long before the window closes? Investors keen on maximizing gains are jumping in now before the next wave of increases. Peanut the Squirrel Unveils Its Long-Awaited Staking Feature Peanut the Squirrel is shaking up the meme coin space with its latest move—staking rewards! The project recently announced that holders can now stake their tokens and earn impressive APYs. This new feature is designed to reward long-term believers in the project while stabilizing token supply. With staking now live, Peanut the Squirrel is expected to see an uptick in demand as investors look for passive income opportunities. Shiba Inu’s Latest Whale Accumulation Sparks Buzz Shiba Inu is back in the spotlight after a massive whale accumulation. A recent on-chain report revealed that a crypto whale scooped up billions of SHIB tokens, fueling speculation of an impending price surge. Historically, such large transactions have preceded bullish rallies, and the Shiba Inu community is buzzing with anticipation. As SHIB continues to expand its ecosystem, investors are closely watching for its next big move. The Final Verdict – Which Crypto Holds the Greatest Potential? All three projects—Arctic Pablo Coin, Peanut the Squirrel, and Shiba Inu—are making waves, but only one stands out as the best crypto to invest in right now. With its unique presale structure, aggressive burn mechanism, and insane ROI potential, Arctic Pablo Coin is leading the charge.

BTC’s high dominance usually signals that altcoin season is upon us. The crypto market has witnessed a spectacular run since Trump’s US election victory and inauguration. Overwhelming bullish sentiment following the US election and inauguration of Donald Trump has triggered massive gains. Bitcoin (BTC) smashed its all-time high many times, peaking at $109,114 on January 20. While the market has corrected since, BTC trades around the $98,000 price point, suggesting it could make a run for the elusive $100,000 again. Altcoin Battle Continues But Makes Significant Gains in the Past Week Meanwhile, BTC remains the undisputed leader of the crypto world and maintains its reputation as the most trusted digital asset. As the dominant store of value, BTC is the go-to choice for institutional investors, and spot BTC ETFs witness record inflows. While BTC asserts its position as the top investment choice, many altcoins have surpassed its profit potential. We are approaching the peak of Bitcoin’s dominance following its halving event, and investors are turning their attention to smaller assets, indicating the start of the altcoin season. BTC’s dominance is currently 60.27%, ETH’s dominance measures 10.2%, and other altcoins measure 29.3%. Cardano (ADA) Gains Along with Other High-Profile Altcoins Cardano (ADA) has been one of the top performers in the past year, gaining nearly 30%. It is trading for $0.79 and has gained 2.75% in the past day. ADA skyrocketed after Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed plans to help shape US crypto policy under Donald Trump’s administration. Cardano (ADA) is a dynamic crypto market player prized for its robust fundamentals and innovative approach to blockchain. Cardano’s recent surge in interest stems from its active community and continued improvements to its infrastructure. Investors are optimistic about Cardano's potential in the bull run, fueled by its unique features and unrelenting commitment to academic research. With an emphasis on security and scalability, Cardano is well-positioned for future growth, making it a prime investment opportunity. As more and more projects build on the Cardano blockchain, demand for Cardano (ADA) is expected to rise, solidifying its already strong market position. Dogecoin (DOGE) Loses Momentum Despite Musk and Trump’s DOGE Success in the US Dogecoin (DOGE) has undoubtedly followed BTC’s trajectory since Donald Trump secured the presidential victory. Despite reaching a noteworthy price after Trump’s involvement, DOGE stumbled significantly after President Trump’s inauguration. The OG memecoin is the largest by market cap and is the 8th largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $37 billion. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man with a net worth exceeding $400 billion, is the CEO of Tesla, owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and one of the president’s closest confidants and most prominent supporters. Musk recently joined the Trump campaign and was integral to Trump’s victory. Since the Trump administration stepped into office, DOGE, which Musk has led, unearthed significant government overspending and identified enormous funds allocated to foreign projects that have not helped the US in any way except by increasing the US’s economic deficit to $32 trillion. Husky Inu (HINU) Presale Soars Amid President Trump’s Incredible First Days Back in Office Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest members of the Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by harnessing the power of this popular blockchain. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $711,000, with numbers rapidly rising as the new Commander-in-Chief continues to make waves in Washington, DC. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently priced at $0.01 during the opening phase of its presale, is rapidly gaining momentum as investors shift focus toward high-growth opportunities. With over 75% of its initial presale stage already sold and $831,568.80 raised in a matter of days, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself not just as a competitor but as a potential disruptor aiming to outpace established tokens like Solana (SOL). Mutuum Finance Presale Rises Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has sparked intense interest since launching the first phase of its presale, attracting 1,500 holders in days. Priced at $0.01, the token offers a rare entry point for investors seeking exponential gains. Early participants stand to realize a guaranteed 600% return once MUTM hits its launch price of $0.06, a figure already locked in by the project’s structured presale model. Beyond this immediate upside, analysts tracking the project’s roadmap are forecasting a surge to $1 in 2025, translating to a 100x gain from current levels. The presale’s rapid progress, driven by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique value proposition, highlights a growing appetite for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that merge utility with investor incentives. As Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) grapple with incremental growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche as a low-cost, high-reward alternative. To fuel presale participation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $100,000 giveaway, distributing prizes across 10 lucky holders. The campaign, detailed on the project’s official channels, underscores its community-driven ethos. A Dual-Market Lending Ecosystem Central to Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal is its decentralized lending protocol, which enables peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. The P2C model allows users to deposit assets like USDT into liquidity pools, earning passive income through adjustable interest rates tied to market demand. Borrowers, meanwhile, can leverage crypto holdings such as Ethereum (ETH) as collateral to secure loans without liquidating their positions, a feature that maintains portfolio exposure while unlocking liquidity. The P2P marketplace further diversifies opportunities by enabling direct negotiations between users, bypassing traditional liquidity pools. Every transaction operates under audited smart contracts, ensuring security and transparency. This dual approach not only broadens accessibility but also drives consistent platform engagement, a critical factor for sustaining MUTM’s long-term value. Price Stability Through Strategic Mechanisms Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is tackling one of DeFi’s persistent challenges, volatility, through an innovative buy-and-distribute system. A portion of platform fees will automatically purchase MUTM tokens from the open market, redistributing them to stakers. This mechanism creates recurring demand for the token, effectively cushioning against price dips and fostering gradual appreciation. Combined with plans to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building an ecosystem designed for both stability and growth. Adding to the momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced a beta version of its platform will go live alongside its exchange debut. This strategic move ensures immediate utility upon launch, a contrast to projects that delay product rollouts. Users can start lending, borrowing, and staking from day one, accelerating adoption and liquidity. Such operational readiness is resonating with investors who prioritize tangible use cases over speculative hype. As Cardano (ADA) eyes $1 on the back of institutional interest and Solana (SOL) battles network congestion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a fresh narrative: a DeFi project built for rapid scaling, backed by mechanisms that prioritize investor returns. Early movers today could secure not just short-term gains but a stake in a platform poised to redefine decentralized lending. The crypto market is no stranger to breakout stars, but few combine Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s affordability, utility, and growth potential. With Phase 1 selling out faster than anticipated and analysts aligning around a $1 target, now’s the best time to get involved.

Its presale success has shown strong interest from buyers, raising over $1.4 million as of February 14, 2025, with 360 million 3BAY tokens already sold. The presale is in Stage 4, with each token priced at $0.004562625. Analysts expect a strong rise in value, with the launch price projected at $0.1959, potentially giving early buyers a 4,000% increase. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that charge high fees and rely on middlemen, Web3Bay offers a different approach. It allows direct buying and selling through smart contracts, making transactions safer and more transparent. This system reduces fraud risks and attracts both crypto users and businesses looking for a fairer online marketplace. The global online shopping industry is expected to go beyond $8 trillion by 2027, and blockchain technology is improving transaction security and efficiency. While platforms like Amazon and eBay dominate, they lack decentralization, making Web3Bay’s model stand out. More businesses are now looking for lower fees and easier global payments through digital currencies, boosting demand for decentralized marketplaces.

New partnerships with online businesses and blockchain firms will help Web3Bay grow faster. Q2 2025 – Staking Rewards & Market Expansion Users holding 3BAY tokens will be able to earn rewards by staking them. More uses for the 3BAY token will be introduced within the marketplace, leading to higher demand and price steadiness. Collaboration with blockchain companies to improve cross-chain support. Q3 2025 – Moving to Community Governance Web3Bay will introduce a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), allowing the community to take part in decision-making. Token holders will have voting rights on key platform changes, security updates, and future features. This shift ensures long-term decentralization and user-driven growth. Q4 2025 – NFT Marketplace & Full Launch Web3Bay will launch its NFT marketplace, where users can buy, sell, and trade digital collectibles. Final security checks and the full launch of the online marketplace. Expansion into cross-border trade, making global transactions smooth and efficient. What’s Ahead for Web3Bay Users? With a clear strategy and strong presale backing, Web3Bay is in a good position to bring blockchain and online shopping together. Here’s why buyers and users should follow Web3Bay’s journey: Strong Growth Possibility: Early 3BAY holders could see major returns as demand increases after launch. Useful Features: Unlike projects based only on speculation, Web3Bay’s platform is designed for real-world use, making it more sustainable. Secure & Transparent Transactions: Removing middlemen leads to lower costs, better privacy, and safer payments.

This price lag has been compounded by a slowdown in bullish sentiment among investors and a slowing euphoria regarding the crypto-positive influences of Trump’s new administration in the US. Despite this rally slowdown, technical analysis continues to support a bullish long-term outlook for Bitcoin. The current stagnation appears to be a re-accumulation phase for bullish investors; a pattern observed multiple times before major upward moves this cycle. Furthermore, analysis shows that the USDT dominance is going to play a crucial role in triggering the next Bitcoin rally toward $150,000. Bitcoin’s Re-Accumulation Phase And The Role Of USDT Dominance According to a technical analyst (TradingShot) on the TradingView platform, Bitcoin is currently exhibiting an interesting accumulation trend alongside the USDT dominance. The USDT dominance reflects the percentage of the total crypto market capitalization in USDT, indicating whether traders favor stablecoins over riskier crypto assets. A high USDT dominance typically signals low buying pressure in cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a declining USDT dominance often suggests that traders are rotating funds back into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly PPO Turns Red At $102,000, What It Means For The Bull Market Interestingly, the USDT dominance has had a crucial simultaneous occurrence with Bitcoin’s preparations for rallies this cycle. Two notable re-accumulation periods have occurred after Bitcoin bottomed in November 2022, with each leading to significant price rallies. The first accumulation period spanned from January 2023 to March 2023, while the second occurred between November 2023 and February 2024. Both of these re-accumulation phases took place at the 0.5 Fibonacci extension level from an earlier accumulation phase. Additionally, these phases shared common characteristics, including a peaking 1-day RSI structure in the USDT dominance chart and a pullback in the Dollar Index (DXY). Now, Bitcoin appears to be mirroring the same conditions again, with USDT dominance and the DXY pulling back with the current re-accumulation phase, which has been playing out since December 2024. If the pattern continues to unfold as expected, this could indicate that Bitcoin is on the verge of its next major rally. USDT To Send BTC To $150,000 If Bitcoin follows the pattern observed in previous rallies this cycle with the USDT dominance to the core, the re-accumulation phase could end within the next one or two weeks and eventually cause another rally to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Unravels 157-Day Fractal Similar To Last Cycle, Why A Surge To $169,000 Is Possible In terms of a target, the analyst noted a potential $150,000 target for the Bitcoin price, at least before another major correction and a subsequent accumulation phase. However, Bitcoin must overcome key resistance levels, particularly the psychological $100,000 mark, which has served as a major hurdle in recent weeks. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $97,175, up by 1.6% in the past 24 hours. A move to $150,000 will represent a 54% increase from the current price.

Analysts are pointing to some red flags like big holders dumping their stash and charts looking more like a rollercoaster than a steady climb. PEPE price prediction is now a hot topic, with many expecting a dip, given the coin’s known wild price swings. The worry is that if the big fish start selling off their PEPE, the smaller players might follow, pushing the price down even further . Tech indicators aren’t painting a rosy picture either, showing signs of a weakening grip on support levels. While PEPE has had its moments of glory, the current consensus leans towards a correction phase. Investors are advised to keep an eye out and weigh the risks before diving in. Panshibi (SHIBI): The Underdog Crypto Poised for a Financial Leap While PEPE is wrestling with its ups and downs, along comes the fresh face, Panshibi (SHIBI), catching everyone’s eye with talks of huge potential. This panda-themed token isn’t just adorable; it’s clever too, leveraging awesome branding and meme magic to make its mark. Analysts are whispering about a potential 100x surge after launch, positioning it as one of the best crypto to invest in for those looking for the next big thing. Here’s the deal: Panshibi (SHIBI), a meme coin leveraging panda-themed branding and viral trends, has been making waves in the cryptocurrency market. As of today, Panshibi is currently in its presale phase, with the token priced at $0.005 and set to increase to $0.006 soon. The listing price is projected to be $0.026. The presale has already raised over $1M, which is 20.63% of the target. The project aims to attract investors excited about niche cryptocurrency projects and meme-driven trends. Panshibi focuses on transparent pricing, future exchange listings, and community engagement. This shift towards newer tokens like Panshibi suggests that investors are looking for fresh opportunities rather than sticking with established names like PEPE. Meme coins live off hype, and those that can get ahead of the wave of community interest often come out on top. Investor Strategies Amidst Market Fluctuations The PEPE price prediction gurus start sounding the alarm, you know it’s time to get your head in the game. Folks aren’t just sitting on their hands; they’re moving their cash from PEPE to greener pastures like Panshibi, looking for those gems before they hit the jackpot. In the world of crypto, especially with meme coins like PEPE, timing is everything – you need to jump on opportunities before they are known all over social media. Panshibi’s presale? It’s like stumbling upon a goldmine. They’ve got this whole roadmap laid out, not just about making a bank but about building something real with the community. Shifting Trends: From Old Meme Coins to New Opportunities If you’re on the hunt for the top crypto to invest in, keeping tabs on Panshibi’s journey is just smart money. The trend’s clear as day: with PEPE price prediction signaling uncertainty, the cash is flowing from the old meme coins to the ones with new stories and strong backing. Diversifying and nailing the timing, that’s secret sauce, helping us navigate this wild crypto ride, balancing the thrill of possible gains with the rollercoaster of risks. As we witness this paradigm shift in the crypto market, it’s essential to stay informed and agile, ready to grab emerging opportunities that could define the next generation of digital wealth.

The listing creates the requisite trading framework for the fund while waiting on approval from the U.S Securities Exchange Commission. DTCC also facilitates the clearing and settlement of securities transactions in the U.S., and accordingly, its listing is rather a preparatory step. DTCC listing does not mean that the security has sought approval from the SEC; however, it will enable the market players to expect considerable trading. Canary Capital first applied for a Litecoin ETF in October 2024. Other firms like Grayscale and CoinShares have also filed similar applications to the one submitted to the SEC. However, Canary’s filing is still likely to be the first decision made by the SEC on its filing. Favorable Outlook for Litecoin ETFs Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart also believe that the chance of a Litecoin ETF’s approval is rather high. They pointed out that Litecoin is compliant with some regulatory criteria, given that Litecoin is already recognized as a commodity by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This classification enhances the ETF’s argument in relation to other applications for funds of other digital assets with legal ambiguity. As we reported on Wednesday, the SEC confirmed a separate filing of the Nasdaq exchange to list a Litecoin ETF by CoinShares. The agency is now seeking public comments on the Nasdaq rule changes, which is in line with the regulation’s approval process. The rise in demand for Litecoin ETFs may be attributed to a common phenomenon of growing institutional investment in cryptocurrencies. A spot Litecoin ETF means traditional investors can invest in this digital currency without having to deal with direct custody or on-chain transactions. Litecoin’s price has surged over 100% since the first ETF filing was submitted to the SEC. According to CoinGecko data, the asset is currently trading around $130, reflecting a 2% gain in the past hour. Since the first ETF filing was submitted to the SEC, Litecoin’s price has increased by more than 100%. According to CoinGecko, the asset is hovering at $130 and has risen 2% in the last hour. Pundits are expecting a major boost in the ETF if the SEC ratifies the decision. Market analyst Crypto Surf has supported Litecoin in reaching $5,000 in the current cycle based on the symmetrical triangle breakout from the six-month chart. Such a transition would mean an increase of its market capitalization by almost 40 times, raising it to $ 377 billion based on the circulating supply. Source: TradingView Another crypto analyst, Professor Moriarty, noted that Litecoin has created a bull flag on the daily chart and broken out from a key resistance level. If the asset stays above this line, $218 could be the next level that might be achieved.

The department has been collecting lists of probationary employees at the Pentagon, pushing people like Jesse Watters to speak on behalf of military veterans. War veterans face a different threat at home After facing and surviving hellish battlefields, military veterans are now facing the new threat of cost-cutting layoffs. The Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, aims to slash $1T in federal spending by July 2026. A significant portion of these cost slashes have targeted probationary employees. Probationary employees are individuals who have not yet completed their initial period of federal service. This group of individuals includes military veterans who are attempting to start their second careers within federal agencies. Jesse Watters, who previously applauded the work of the DOGE, calling Elon Musk “a corporate turnaround artist” made a heartfelt appeal on Wednesday’s episode of “The Five” asking Elon Musk and DOGE officials to rethink their strategy. The Fox News host apparently made the plea because of a close friend. Watters claimed his friend is a decorated 20-year military veteran who recently joined the Pentagon and is now at risk of losing his job and chance at a federal position. Watters especially highlighted the injustice of the Musk-led team’s strategy, stating in his argument that veterans who have “put their lives on the line” should not be the first to face layoffs. Business Insider reports that many military veterans like Watters’ friend are feeling confused, desperate, and terrified at the possibility of being affected by the DOGE budget cuts. DOGE strategies continue to make headlines While the objective of DOGE is to eliminate wasteful spending and enhance governmental efficiency, its methods seem to lack nuance. According to a post on DOGE’s X account, the agency’s officials have been looking into the Department of Defense for areas where they can “save taxpayer dollars and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse,” but targeting probationary employees fails to consider individual contributions and the responsibility of the government toward its veterans. “This guy is not a DEI consultant. This guy is not a climate consultant. This guy is a veteran. So when you’re talking about DOGE-ing people, veterans should get priority. Because if you’re going to go out there and kill enemies, put your life on the line for this country, you shouldn’t be in the same category as people that are doing DEI,” Watters said. Thousands of federal workers employed in probationary roles in federal agencies such as the Forest Service, the Office of Personnel Management, the Small Business Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Education, and many others have been let go. Layoffs are not all the Department of Government Efficiency has up its sleeves. There have been discussions about reallocating a portion of the savings achieved by DOGE . James Fishback proposed issuing $5,000 checks to Americans as dividends from the cost-cutting measures. Elon Musk acknowledged the proposal, indicating he would discuss it with President Trump. However, whether or not the proposal will be approved is left to be seen as it could face pushback from lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

If it happens, this could lead to large-scale institutional buying, possibly pushing SOL above $400. While this is exciting, many retail traders are focusing on an even bigger opportunity—Web3Bay. Web3Bay is gaining traction as a blockchain-powered marketplace, offering a decentralized alternative to Amazon and eBay. Instead of relying on institutional investors to lift asset prices, Web3Bay’s early buyers are securing strong positions before it reach exchanges. With its presale surpassing $1.50 million and 360 million coins sold, Web3Bay is on track to bring major changes to online commerce. Solana’s ETF approval could bring steady price gains, but Web3Bay’s early-stage value and real-world use case make it one of the most attractive crypto projects in 2025. Solana ETF Speculation: Can SOL Reach $400? Solana is known for its high efficiency, leading decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume with $5.1 billion in daily transactions. Its fast processing and scalability have made it a top choice for DeFi platforms, NFT markets, and meme coin traders, solidifying its position as a leading Layer-1 blockchain. A major driver of Solana’s growth in 2025 is the possibility of a spot ETF approval, which would allow traditional investors to gain SOL exposure without direct holdings. If approved, institutional demand is expected to increase significantly, with predictions that SOL could surpass $250 in the short term and potentially hit $350–$400 if demand grows stronger by year-end. Technical signals are mixed, with an RSI of 56 suggesting moderate bullish momentum, while an ADX of 15 indicates market consolidation. However, recent $16 million inflows show renewed interest in SOL, and ETF approval could spark a major rally. While Solana’s ETF potential is drawing attention, some traders are seeking faster and higher returns in newer blockchain projects with strong utility. That’s where Web3Bay comes in. Web3Bay’s 4200% Growth Target: The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce While Solana’s progress depends on institutional backing, Web3Bay is showing how blockchain can create a better online shopping system. Unlike platforms that charge high fees and limit transactions, Web3Bay enables direct transactions between buyers and sellers, giving users full control over their purchases. Web3Bay’s presale is already performing well, with over $1.50 million raised and 360 million coins sold. Its current price of $0.00456 is set to rise to $0.1959 at launch, meaning early adopters could see a 4200% increase. Unlike speculative meme coins, Web3Bay is tackling a trillion-dollar online commerce industry, offering real-world value. This blockchain-based platform is gaining attention because it directly addresses common problems in online shopping. High fees, restricted payment methods, and centralized control have long been issues for buyers and sellers. Web3Bay eliminates these problems by using smart contract escrow, ensuring secure payments. It also accepts both crypto and fiat, making it easier for users to adopt. With features like staking rewards, DAO governance, and a user-controlled marketplace, Web3Bay is not just another presale—it represents a shift in how people buy and sell online. As interest in decentralized platforms grows, Web3Bay is set to be a major part of the next phase of blockchain adoption. Solana’s Institutional Appeal vs. Web3Bay’s Rapid Growth Opportunity The choice is clear—Solana is a strong, well-established blockchain with ETF-driven growth potential, while Web3Bay offers a chance for higher early-stage gains. If the Solana ETF is approved, it could push SOL to higher levels, but Web3Bay’s decentralized platform is entering one of the fastest-growing areas of blockchain. With its presale still open, Web3Bay is attracting early adopters before it gets listed on major exchanges. Those who see the potential of blockchain-powered e-commerce are securing 3BAY coins at the lowest prices available. Solana’s ETF approval may take months, and while it offers long-term potential, Web3Bay presents a more immediate and high-growth opportunity for those willing to get in early. Will you wait for Solana’s ETF approval, or will you take advantage of Web3Bay before it rises in value?

Just four weeks ago, its share stood at 25.5%, with Blur dominating the space. The Block reports that this surge coincides with OpenSea’s long-awaited announcement of its native token, SEA, on Feb. 13. Since the token reveal, OpenSea’s daily trading volume has skyrocketed, averaging $17.4 million, nearly five times its pre-announcement average of $3.47 million. The number of daily transactions also more than doubled, jumping from 6,100 to 14,700 trades. The bulk of this growth came in the past week, as OpenSea’s market share spiked from 42.4% to 71.5%, largely at Blur’s expense . OpenSea has encountered obstacles in its incentive rollout, despite the momentum. After users accused the platform of promoting wash trading and giving fee production precedence over actual ecosystem engagement, it recently suspended its XP-based incentives system. Devin Finzer, CEO of OpenSea, recognized the criticism and said the team is reassessing its strategy even though liquidity incentives are still crucial.

In addition, XP multipliers are available for those who’ve held top-volume NFT collections for more than three months. Although information about the SEA token is still limited, OpenSea has stated that U.S. users are eligible for the airdrop and that allocation will be based on past platform activity, which could potentially compensate traders who were active during the 2021 NFT bull run.

The maximum supply of Pi is 100 billion, with about 9.7 billion currently in circulation. However, after hitting ATHs above $2, the price has now crashed and is trading at $0.78. Down by more than 55%, Pi’s price is fluctuating, and people are selling aggressively. Looking ahead, OKX has listed Pi, but Binance, the leading exchange, has not yet done so. Binance has stated that they will only list Pi if it meets certain criteria, which it hasn’t done yet. However, once these criteria are met, Binance is likely to list Pi, potentially driving the price higher. The future of Pi Network is uncertain, but some believe it has the potential to create significant returns. Analyst Kim Wong took to social media and wrote, “Trading in Pi is disappointing as pioneers keep selling and buy orders are small ( highest 1K Pi, on average a few hundred Pi). No big capital is insight. However, this can also be look at as positive, as sellers exhausted, and buyers jump in, price should go back up again.” “No matter what, what is important is PI network has successfully open its network to the world and as people understand the power of Pi Network, price will go up when big capital jump in. Hold your precious Pi coins,” he added. According to the founders, the Pi Network ecosystem is designed to be fully functional and user-friendly, accessible through the Pi Browser. This interface allows seamless navigation, enabling a single sign-on for Pioneers across all Pi apps. It also supports secure in-app payments through the Pi Wallet app and facilitates the visibility and sharing of Pi Web 3 apps via Web 2 browsers. This creates a loop where Pi’s millions of users can support the network’s growth by sharing apps. While developer tools are crucial, mass adoption depends on developers creating real utilities and businesses providing genuine use cases for the Pioneer community.

Dogecoin drops 32%, Double top signals more decline ahead Dogecoin (DOGE) has dropped 32% this month, now trading at $0.25. Analysts spot a Double Top pattern, a bearish sign that could push prices lower. Key resistance is at $0.2560, while support sits at $0.22, and a deeper level is between $0.176 and $0.18. Technical signals are mixed. The RSI shows weakness, while the TD Sequential hints at a bounce. DOGE has climbed above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, but it still struggles to break key levels. A move past $0.2620 could flip momentum, but failure may send it toward $0.2350. As Dogecoin stalls, 1Fuel (OFT) is surging up 80% in presale, offering real-world blockchain solutions while DOGE fights to regain strength. Avalanche struggles below $25 amid market uncertainty Avalanche (AVAX) is facing heavy resistance at $25, struggling to regain momentum after a 38% drop this month. Analysts warn that if AVAX fails to flip $34.50 into support, it could see another 5% decline. However, if buyers step in, a 17% recovery remains possible. Technical indicators remain bearish. RSI signals selling pressure, and moving averages confirm a strong downtrend. Institutional investors remain cautiously optimistic, but AVAX must break resistance to regain strength. A prolonged consolidation could lead investors to look elsewhere for higher returns. However, the surging 1Fuel (OFT) is already up 80% in presale with a clear uptrend, unlike Avalanche’s uncertain price action. 1Fuel (OFT) presale surges 80%, Could a 120x rally be next? 1Fuel (OFT) is catching fire in Stage 4 of its presale, with its price already up around 80%, climbing from $0.01 to $0.018. Investors have poured in over $2.25 million, and with demand rising, many are betting on a massive breakout once the token hits exchanges. The core feature that sets 1Fuel apart is its one-click cross-chain transactions, eliminating the headache of switching between wallets and paying high network fees. It also comes with a privacy mixer to keep transactions anonymous and cold storage solutions to keep assets safe from hackers. These features aren’t just hype—they solve real problems. The project isn’t slowing down. A P2P exchange, AI-powered trading tools, and crypto debit cards are all on the roadmap, making 1Fuel more than just another presale token. With a tier-one exchange listing expected soon, early investors are positioning themselves for major gains. With analysts eyeing a 120x surge, 1Fuel is proving that innovation is the future of crypto. While others chase short-term pumps, this project is building for real adoption. Final thoughts As Dogecoin predictions say a struggle with resistance and Avalanche remains stuck below key levels, the market is shifting toward projects that offer real solutions instead of speculation. Investors are looking for security, efficiency, and ease of use. However, 1Fuel (OFT) is leading this change, offering one-click cross-chain transactions, built-in privacy, and secure cold storage. With its presale nearly sold out and major developments ahead, its growth potential is hard to ignore. This is the last chance to grab 1Fuel at its lowest price.

ETH is gaining pace and an upside break above $2,755 could trigger bullish moves. Ethereum is still showing positive signs above the $2,650 zone. The price is trading above $2,720 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is following a key rising channel with support at $2,725 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,755 and $2,800. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price remained supported above the $2,550 level and recently started a decent upward move, but it underperformed Bitcoin . ETH gained pace above the $2,650 and $2,660 resistance levels. The price even cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,845 swing high to the $2,604 low.

With strong presale momentum and rising demand, 1Fuel is shaping up to be a major player in decentralized finance. Over $2 million have been raised in ICO funding, and experts project a 100x growth upon launch. Let’s see why analysts believe it has sky-high potential, possibly reaching 100x growth upon launch. A Closer Look at Pepe Price Movements Pepe’s (PEPE) current price is $0.000009199. This shows a 6.32% decline in the last 24 hours. The Pepe price has experienced a 65% decline from its December highs. However, it is now stabilizing around a key support level at $0.000010. Despite this adjustment, PEPE’s market capitalization remains at roughly $3.85 billion. This figure keeps it firmly in the spotlight among meme coins. Market watchers remain divided about PEPE’s price future. Forecasts for 2025 run between $0.00002 and $0.00008, and they depend on a shift in market sentiment. However, its sustained lack of tangible use cases could pose risks for investors seeking reliable, long-term gains. Also, stories such as a PEPE holder losing $135,000 to a malicious transaction underscore the unpredictability and potential dangers surrounding meme tokens. In light of these developments, many investors are now investigating alternatives like 1Fuel’s ICO, which combines cutting-edge functionality with a clear growth plan. Why Analysts believe 1Fuel has Sky-High Potential 1Fuel (OFT) centers around genuine utility and concrete innovation. Built on cross-chain asset management, 1Fuel’s technology enables effortless one-click swaps across various blockchain networks. This design aims to simplify decentralized finance (DeFi) usage by removing the usual hurdles involved in juggling multiple wallets and platforms, making crypto transactions smoother for a broader audience. Early results from 1Fuel’s ICO have been impressive, with total contributions exceeding $2 million thus far. Now in its fourth presale stage, 1Fuel tokens can be purchased at $0.018 each, and early buyers receive a 20% bonus on their acquisitions. Enthusiasm for DeFi’s user-friendly solutions appears to be fueling 1Fuel’s strong fundraising campaign, reflecting a wider appetite for blockchain projects that blend convenience and efficiency. Artificial intelligence (AI) features also come into play within 1Fuel’s platform, optimizing trading activities for its user base. The inclusion of privacy mixers helps increase anonymity, while a staking program offering up to 30% APR entices participants to remain active within the network. 1Fuel’s tokenomics allocates 50% of the entire token supply to the presale, with the rest designated for community programs, liquidity reserves, ecosystem rewards, and team expansion. By ensuring robust community support and designing for stable, long-term utility, 1Fuel is positioning itself as a force to be reckoned with in the DeFi market. PEPE’s daily price swings still garner attention from opportunistic traders. Yet, for those who prefer investments underpinned by clear objectives and technological advantages, 1Fuel’s ICO presents an intriguing alternative. With the token’s presale in full motion, there is a limited window for investors to enter before 1Fuel secures more widespread exchange listings. The rise of dynamic projects like 1Fuel shows a new wave of blockchain innovation grounded in real-world problem-solving.

The listing , which showed up on DTCC late Thursday Feb. 20, does not guarantee regulatory approval but signals that the necessary infrastructure for trading is being put in place. The DTCC serves as a key clearing and settlement provider for U.S. securities, listing both active ETFs and pre-launch funds awaiting approval. Ultimately, the ETF still requires approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before it can begin trading. Canary Capital initially filed for its Litecoin ( LTC ) ETF in October 2024, ahead of similar applications from Grayscale and CoinShares. If approved, it would be the first U.S. spot ETF for a cryptocurrency beyond Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), potentially paving the way for additional altcoin-based ETFs.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently shared his thoughts through a post on X. Balchunas believes there is a 90% likelihood that the Litecoin spot ETF would be approved. He has previously expressed optimism about the possibility of other altcoin ETFs like Ripple ( XRP ) and Solana ( SOL ) getting approved in 2025.

Speaking at CPAC 2025 , Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), told an audience packed with investors and conservative leaders that the US has a unique opportunity to own 20% of Bitcoin’s total supply—but only if it acts now. “The US could own 20% of the network like that—for free,” Saylor said on stage. “The dollar would strengthen, the nation would be enriched, and we could generate a $50 trillion to $80 trillion benefit for the United States.” He didn’t mince words. The race for Bitcoin dominance is underway, and in Saylor’s view, there’s only room for one country to take the lead. Bitcoin is America’s next Alaska Saylor compared Bitcoin’s potential strategic value to some of the biggest territorial acquisitions in US history. “This nation became great because of the Louisiana Purchase,” he said, referring to the 1803 deal where the US bought a third of its current landmass from France for what now seems like pocket change. He didn’t stop there. “Then we bought Texas and California from Mexico. Then Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million. Back then, they called it ‘Seward’s Folly.’ But Alaska alone has generated trillions in economic value. What we’re looking at now is the same play—but in cyberspace.” For Saylor, Bitcoin is the new frontier, and the US must claim its stake before rival nations do. “All the Chinese money, the Russian money, the European money—it’s all flowing into cyberspace. The 21st century economy will be built on digital property, and Bitcoin is the foundation.” Saylor argued that America’s financial dominance depends on whether it secures a Bitcoin reserve before other global powers step in. “The Saudis, the Russians, the Chinese, the Europeans—if any of them move first, they’ll get 20% of the network and lock the US out of the future financial system,” he warned. “There’s only room for one country to do this. And it has to be us.” Trump is paying attention Saylor’s push for a US Bitcoin reserve isn’t just theoretical—it’s gaining political momentum. He claimed that the idea is already on the radar of Washington’s power players, including Donald Trump. “President Trump understands the value of property. He understands the value of owning something no one else can take from you,” Saylor said. At a recent event in Miami, Trump spoke about Bitcoin’s role in the US economy, fueling speculation that his administration could make a major move on digital assets. “If we do this now, we erase the national debt, we flip the US into a creditor nation within a decade, and we dominate the digital economy for the next 100 years,” Saylor explained. He also hinted that behind closed doors, discussions are already happening. “There’s an appreciation of Bitcoin’s power throughout the Cabinet, the House, and the Senate,” he said. “There’s going to be a political process to build consensus, but this is happening.” Bitcoin is the strongest asset in the world Saylor laid out why he believes Bitcoin is the only asset worth holding. “It’s the most powerful digital network in the world. It’s the only thing you can own that no government, company, or institution can corrupt,” he said. “No one can print more of it, freeze it, tax it away, or seize it.” He described Bitcoin as ‘economic armor’, protecting individuals and nations alike from financial instability. “You put on this armor, and no one can debank you. No one can steal your savings through inflation. No one can shut you out of the economy,” he said. For Saylor, the US dollar and Bitcoin don’t have to compete—they can work together. “If we integrate Bitcoin into the national reserve, we strengthen the dollar,” he said. “We attract global capital instead of watching it leave. We anchor US financial power in a system that no one else can control.” Saylor says the future is digital, and the US must own it Saylor didn’t shy away from how fast the world is changing. “The 21st-century economy isn’t going to be banks moving money once a day. It’s going to be a billion computers processing transactions at the speed of light,” he said. “The money of the future isn’t going to be sitting in a bank account waiting for an approval—it’s going to be moving across a decentralized network at all times.” He criticized the outdated financial system, saying it isn’t built for the future. “Right now, I have to approve my wire transfers manually. I have to get on the phone and explain why I’m moving my own money,” he said. “That’s a joke in a world where AI is making millions of calculations per second. The system is broken.” He then pointed to Bitcoin’s unstoppable nature. “There’s no middleman, no gatekeeper, no bureaucratic approval process,” he said. “If the US doesn’t own this space, someone else will.” Only one nation can take 20%—who will it be? Saylor made his final argument crystal clear: If the US doesn’t act, another nation will beat them to it. “There is only room for one country to buy 20% of the network,” he said. “And once that happens, it’s over.” He outlined a simple scenario: “If we take 4 to 6 million Bitcoin, we pay off the entire US national debt. We turn America into a financial superpower in a decade. We own the future of digital assets. And we do it before another country beats us to it.” For Saylor, the risk isn’t investing in Bitcoin—it’s waiting too long. “This is the greatest financial opportunity of our time,” he said. “Either we secure our place as the world’s digital superpower, or we watch someone else do it.” As CPAC wrapped up, Saylor left his audience with one final thought. “Bitcoin is the Manifest Destiny of cyberspace,” he said. “And the nation that owns it will own the future.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-21 03:35:22

This move marks the beginning of a 240-day review period, during which the agency will decide whether to approve or reject the application. Grayscale’s XRP ETF Filing Under SEC Review The SEC’s review process for Grayscale’s proposed XRP ETF formally started after its posting on the Federal Register. The agency now has until October 18, 2025, to make a decision. The process includes a 21-day public comment period, allowing stakeholders to submit feedback. Afterward, the SEC will analyze the proposal and assess market risks, investor protections, and compliance with securities laws. XRP’s legal classification remains a key factor in the ETF’s approval amid speculations of a Ripple vs SEC lawsuit pause . The SEC has previously sued Ripple Labs over whether XRP should be classified as a security, and the case remains unresolved. The regulator has generally been more cautious with altcoin ETFs compared to Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns over market manipulation. XRP Price To Breach $3 Resistance XRP’s price has reacted positively to the ETF developments, with traders anticipating a potential breakout. The token is currently testing key resistance levels, with analysts watching for a move beyond $3.00. Some believe that clearing this level could signal a larger rally. Crypto traders have shared insights on XRP’s price movement. “XRP continues to hold inside a corrective channel, which is typical for a Wave 4,” CasiTrades posted on X projecting an all-time high looming. Another trader, Dark Defender, suggested that the XRP price could move toward $2.77 before testing $3. Market sentiment has also been influenced by speculation about major financial institutions using XRP for transactions. Reports suggest that Bank of America may be leveraging XRP for internal payments, though no official confirmation has been provided. US SEC’s Stance on Crypto Regulation The SEC has been reviewing multiple XRP ETF applications alongside Grayscale’s filing. On February 19, the agency acknowledged applications from asset managers CoinShares, Canary, and WisdomTree. These applications were submitted through exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe BZX. The SEC’s approach to crypto regulation has come under scrutiny in recent months. Under the current administration, the agency temporarily paused its lawsuit against Binance , leading some analysts to believe that regulatory pressure on crypto firms may ease. Consequently, investors are hopeful that this shift could work in Ripple’s favor which may boost XRP price to a new ATH. President Donald Trump’s administration has been viewed as more crypto-friendly, and his recent social media activity has fueled optimism. He shared an article discussing Ripple Labs’ expansion in the U.S., which noted that XRP saw a price surge following the 2024 presidential election. XRP ETF Approval Odds The chances of an XRP ETF approval have risen on Polymarket, where betting odds currently stand at 81%. Concurrently, Brazil recently became the first country to approve an XRP spot ETF, adding to the growing demand for institutional investment in the asset which may push the XRP price to a new ATH. Despite the optimism, some analysts urge caution. Azura CEO Jackson Denka noted that XRP has historically experienced rapid price increases followed by steep declines. “Until we see real adoption and actual progress of their blockchain, it is hard to make the claim that this price is sustainable,” Denka said.

The “Create/Redeem” section is marked as “Y,” part of the standard process when preparing a new ETF. However, SEC approval remains pending.

Such a proposal was well-received by the President of Argentina, Javier Milei, who showed anticipation of the event. Buterin has, in the past, considered Argentina to be one of the best examples of mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. He noted that due to the economic status of the country, blockchain and digital assets are not merely get-rich rituals. In response to the recent LIBRA controversy, Buterin remains optimistic about Argentina’s potential as the blockchain hub. “The energy and determination to build on Argentina’s current momentum and use crypto and other new technologies to build a prosperous 21st-century society is real. The recent news should be taken not as a reason to give up, but rather as an example of why education is so important.” – Buterin. However, Buterin still sees hope for Argentina to contribute to the Ethereum ecosystem even after the LIBRA incident. He said that regional entrepreneurs have played their part in advancing the use of blockchain technology. The decision to host Devconnect in Argentina is an intention of nurturing the growth of the community even further. Milei did not directly answer Buterin’s comments on LIBRA, but he responded nevertheless. He welcomed the idea of hosting the Devconnect, describing it as a privilege and opportunity for Argentina. MUCHAS GRACIAS @VitalikButerin POR TUS PALABRAS SOBRE EL TALENTO ARGENTINO!!! Sería un honor que Argentina sea sede de Devconnect. Coincido que sería una gran oportunidad para nuestro país. VIVA LA LIBERTAD CARAJO…!!! https://t.co/INh1S8MpkQ — Javier Milei (@JMilei) February 20, 2025 Milei faces scrutiny over LIBRA collapse The LIBRA cryptocurrency, which Milei mentioned in a now-deleted social media post, skyrocketed and subsequently plunged. This led to huge losses to investors, leading to allegations of a ‘rug pull’. Milei later defended that he worked ‘in good faith’ and compared investors’ losses to the risks of gambling. Speaking to Argentine news channel Todo Noticias, Milei clarified that he never promoted it, stating, “I didn’t promote it, I merely shared it.”. The presidential office has since said the Anti-Corruption Office will investigate the matter to determine whether the law was violated. There have been increasing complaints of political influence in the emerging cryptocurrencies. Buterin recently also criticized political meme coins, describing them as rigs for unfair political influence. Although he has not stated anything about Milei being affiliated with LIBRA on such projects, his stance remains very clear. Buterin’s stance on crypto ethics During an AMA session recently conducted, Buterin raised some concerns regarding the ethics of the crypto space. He explained that he feels frustrated with the increasing popularity of blockchain gambling and said that he would quit if the community continues to support what he regards as a ‘moral reversal.’ He reaffirmed his commitment to the Ethereum community’s vision and called upon developers to work only on projects that have ethical and social relevance. However, Buterin also noted that the Ethereum Foundation might become more involved in dictating the responsible direction in which this ecosystem will go.

While Shiba Inu’s decline might lead to a decline in investor sentiment toward the meme coin space as a whole, experts believe that there could be an upside. With so many new altcoins emerging in the market, experts believe that Shiba Inu’s dip could give rising stars like PropiChain a chance to shine this quarter. The PropiChain project opens doors of opportunities for investors in the market to leverage real-world assets. Find out why PropiChain has an edge in the market amidst Shiba Inu’s price decline. Shiba Inu Whales Slow Down For the month of February, Shiba Inu’s price has remained stagnant due to the mixed sentiment from investors. The bullish and bearish performance of Shiba Inu’s price has left many investors confused about the project’s future prospects. Already, there has been a reduction in whale activity on the platform as many large-scale investors have reduced their exposure to Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu has been down over 2.4% within the past week, signaling the project’s bearish position in the market. However, analysts say that new opportunities like PCHAIN have an edge over Shiba Inu because of its real-world applicability and benefits. PropiChain: Transforming Property Ownership Through Blockchain Technology It’s the dream of many to become landowners; just picture yourself being the proud owner of a high-end suburban estate. Yet, this dream seems like an impossibility for many due to how expensive it can be to own landed property, but PropiChain is the project that changes this narrative. The PropiChain project offers investors, whether small or large-scale, the opportunity to own fractions of real estate investments through the aid of AI and blockchain technology. Through PropiChain’s distinct technology, bullish investors gain easy access to life-changing wealth; hence, experts believe this project could rival top players like Shiba Inu. One of the major benefits of the PropiChain platform is its asset tokenization model, which allows you to own a portion of prime real estate. So, just imagine having shared ownership of a multi-billion dollar property with PropiChain; you don’t have to worry about the costs because these properties are broken down into affordable tokens. Therefore, if you wish to buy a luxury apartment worth $10 million, you can split your payment into $10,000 tokens and hold a stake in this property for just $1,000. Therefore, rather than making a complete investment into an asset, you can purchase fractional shares instead. Furthermore, by acquiring micro shares in the PropiChain ecosystem, you can begin to receive rental income while also gaining from the appreciation of the property. What’s more exciting is that you don’t have to do it alone; the PropiChain platform allows you to collaborate with other investors by merging your funds to acquire larger properties. With PropiChain, the limitations that are often associated with traditional investment platforms are eliminated; hence, it has an edge over key players like Shiba Inu. Beyond fractional ownership, PropiChain equips traders with AI-powered tools to promote smarter investment decisions. These AI tools are designed to study market trends, target high-potential opportunities, and personalize users’ investing experience. Furthermore, the automated trading function helps you complete your housing deals even while you’re away, thus enhancing user experience. The PropiChain project further enhances its appeal through a thorough security audit carried out by BlockAudit, a certified smart contract auditor. Why PCHAIN Is A Top Pick Among Investors Amidst Shiba Inu’s struggles, PropiChain has stolen the spotlight because of its tangible solutions, which make it a more appealing choice. The PropiChain presale is in round 2, and each token is priced at $0.011. Already, over $1.2 million has been raised, with over 62% of the tokens allocated to this round purchased by savvy investors. The PropiChain project emerges as a top choice among traders who want to expand their portfolio with tangible and long-lasting assets; hence, its presale is a gateway for many. Analysts believe that once PCHAIN launches officially, early investors will receive over 1000% ROI.

Goldman Sachs, one of the most influential financial firms, has increased its Ethereum ETF holdings by 2,000%, bringing its total ETH exposure to $476 million. At the same time, its Bitcoin ETF holdings have surged 114%, now exceeding $1.5 billion. This level of institutional participation was unheard of just a few years ago. Major firms once dismissed cryptocurrencies as risky, but now they are investing billions in BTC and ETH, backing spot ETFs that bring large-scale liquidity to the market. As financial institutions increase their involvement, cryptocurrency is shifting from being a niche interest to a serious asset class. The market is now influenced by long-term capital instead of short-term hype, shaping the future of digital assets. This optimistic outlook is paving the way for the next group of standout cryptocurrencies, extending beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. New blockchain projects that provide real utility are drawing significant investor interest, with Web3Bay leading as a prominent example. The Rise of Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs: What It Means for the Crypto Market Bitcoin is currently valued at around $96,000, reflecting a 41% increase in Q4 2024, as institutional buying continues to grow. With major firms now holding billions in Bitcoin ETFs, analysts predict BTC could soon cross $100K, possibly reaching $150K in 2025. Ethereum is also gaining traction among institutional investors. Trading at $2,680 with a 26% rise in Q4, ETH is expected to outperform BTC in 2025. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have all introduced Ethereum ETFs, leading to an influx of institutional funds. If this trend holds, Ethereum’s price could climb to $4,000–$5,000 by mid-2025. However, while Bitcoin and Ethereum are leading institutional adoption, they may no longer provide the highest growth potential. Investors looking for major returns are shifting focus to projects that merge blockchain with practical applications, and Web3Bay is one such project. Web3Bay: A New Opportunity in February 2025 Web3Bay is not just another digital project—it brings decentralized commerce into the spotlight. While platforms like Amazon and eBay dominate online shopping, Web3Bay offers a blockchain-based alternative, removing middlemen and providing direct control to buyers and sellers. The timing is crucial. As institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum grows, the entire crypto space is becoming more widely accepted. This positive trend is fueling interest in early-stage projects, and Web3Bay is one of the most talked-about options. Key figures highlight its momentum: Over $1.50 million is raised in presale. 360 million coins already purchased by buyers. Presale price: $0.00456, with an expected launch price of $0.1959, offering a 4200% potential increase. Web3Bay is more than a concept—it provides real solutions within a trillion-dollar industry. Using blockchain technology, it enables direct transactions, lower costs, stronger privacy, and complete purchase control—features missing from traditional platforms. Why Web3Bay Could Be a Strong Option in a Growing Market A common mistake people make during strong market cycles is buying assets that have already increased in price. Bitcoin and Ethereum will likely continue rising, but their highest growth phases are past. The best time to invest is before a project gains mainstream attention—this is why Web3Bay is attracting interest now. With large-scale investors moving into the crypto sector, the demand for blockchain-based solutions is rising. Those who bought Ethereum in 2016 or Solana in 2020 saw substantial profits—Web3Bay presents a similar opportunity for early buyers. If you missed Bitcoin at $1,000 or Ethereum at $100, this could be a similar chance. The Web3Bay presale is currently active, but the supply is decreasing fast. As Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs gain attention, upcoming projects like Web3Bay are also drawing interest. The presale price will rise soon—will you secure your position early, or will you watch from the sidelines?

Pi, the popular tap-to-earn token, was trading at $0.7290 on Friday morning, much lower than Thursday’s high of $2. So, what next for the Pi coin price in the coming years? Pi Network mainnet launch Pi, one of the most popular players in the crypto industry, launched its mainnet on Thursday. The mainnet launch happened after six years when the network remained under development and the pioneers mined millions of tokens. It remained in an enclosed mainnet for over three years. Therefore, the Pi Network mainnet launch was notable because it allowed these pioneers to cash out and true believers to hold the token. The mainnet launch was well-received as many mainstream exchanges decided to list it on the first day. According to CoinMarketCap , most of the Pi Network volume happened on Gate.io, followed by Bitget and OKX. Popular American exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken are yet to list it. Binance, on the other hand, is set to list the Pi coin next week after users overwhelmingly voted to allow it to be listed in the network. Pi Network has become one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the industry. It has a market cap of over $4.2 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $66 billion. That FDV would make it the sixth-biggest player in the sector. Why Pi coin price crashed There are three main reasons why the Pi coin price crashed after the mainnet launch on Thursday . First, Pi coin plunged because many pioneers decided to sell their holdings as soon as it was humanly possible. Historically, many holders of similar tokens tend to sell when the airdrop happens. Most recently, it has happened among popular tap-to-earn tokens like Hamster Kombat , Tapswap, and Catizen. The urgency to sell was more intense since many Pi Network pioneers have been disappointed with the project, especially because of its mainnet launch delays. This also explains why only about 10.1 million pioneers migrated their tokens to the mainnet, a big drop from the 50 million pioneers it had at its top. Second, the Pi coin price crashed because many pioneers have seen other popular new airdrops crash. All popular “to earn” tokens have crashed over the years. This includes play-to-earn tokens like Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), and Gala Games (GALA). It also includes other tap-to-earn tokens like Hamster Kombat, Tapswap, Catizen, DOGS, and Notcoin. Move-to-earn tokens like Sweat Economy and StepN have also plunged. Third, the Pi Network price plunged because of the ongoing crypto bear market. The crypto fear and greed index has moved to the fear zone as most cryptocurrency prices have crashed. Therefore, there are usually high odds that a cryptocurrency will crash if it is launched during a crypto bear market. Pi Network price forecast 2025 to 2026 So, what next for the Pi Network price in 2025 and 2030? There are two prominent schools of thought about this. One camp argues that Pi Network is the next Bitcoin because of its popularity. It predicts that the Pi price will eventually surge from the current $0.6693 to over $100,000 over time. The other camp argues that the Pi Network price will crash over time now that the incentive to mine it has ended. I believe that the Pi Network outlook for between 2025 and 2030 is bearish because of the past performance of other “to earn” tokens. Pi team argues that the ecosystem growth will help to offset this. However, the risk is tha this much-touted ecosystem growth will not happen after all. This is in line with our last Pi forecast .

The firm revealed it recently bought an additional 68.59 BTC for $6.6 million at an average price of $96,335. 0.01% of Total Bitcoin Supply In a February 20 X post , the company highlighted that its BTC reserves now make up “0.01% of total Bitcoin supply.” The Japanese investment firm has been rapidly increasing its Bitcoin holdings as part of its treasury operations. According to its “Bitcoin Plan,” shared on January 28, Metaplanet aims to reach 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026. The outfit has significantly increased its purchases of the number one cryptocurrency since mid-2024 when it started using it as a way to protect against inflation. This latest acquisition comes shortly after a previous one earlier this week, where the firm bought 269.43 BTC worth $25.6 million, bringing its total holdings to 2,031 BTC. Before that, Metaplanet had made several other purchases, including its largest one to date in December 2024, when it obtained nearly 620 BTC worth $60.6 million. CEO Simon Gerovich has said that adopting the Bitcoin Standard has been a game-changer, helping establish Metaplanet as Tokyo’s top BTC-focused company. Over the past year, its stock price has surged by more than 4,000%. Additionally, the firm is set to be included in the MSCI Japan Index on February 28, a move expected to attract more investors. Capital Market Activities Metaplanet has been growing its reserves through its Bitcoin Treasury Operations, which officially became a business line on December 18, 2024. The company has been funding these purchases using capital market activities and its revenue. In line with this, its Board of Directors has approved several financial moves. On January 28, 2025, it issued 21 million stock acquisition rights to EVO FUND in five tranches with an adjustable exercise price. On February 10, it also issued zero-coupon bonds worth 4 billion yen to EVO FUND, with the money set aside to buy Bitcoin.

The price is still showing positive signs and might aim for a move above the $2.750 resistance zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.620 level. The price is now trading above $2.620 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.720 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.720 resistance zone. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price remained supported above the $2.550 level. It formed a base and started a strong increase above the $2.62 resistance zone, outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price cleared the $2.650 and $2.680 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.8320 swing high to the $2.470 low. However, the bears were active near the $2.750 resistance zone. They protected a close above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.8320 swing high to the $2.470 low. The price is now moving lower below $2.70. The price is now trading above $2.720 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.720 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.720 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.750 level. The next resistance is $2.80. A clear move above the $2.80 resistance might send the price toward the $2.850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.920 resistance or even $2.950 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.720 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.650 level. The next major support is near the $2.60 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.60 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.550 support. The next major support sits near the $2.50 zone.

In his first interview from prison that was released on Thursday, Sam called his trial rigged, accused Biden’s Department of Justice (DOJ) of political interference, and even said that his 25-year prison sentence was a targeted takedown. Sam, who once funneled millions into Democratic campaigns, now says he was secretly supporting Republicans too, but his GOP donations were hidden from public view. He claims his prosecution was orchestrated because of his financial ties to conservative politicians, something he says was “starting to come out” just before he was indicted. “Not being able to just Google something is one of the worst parts of this,” Sam said in his interview. Sam says his case was political, blames Biden’s DOJ for targeting him Speaking from inside the Manhattan Detention Center, Sam accused Judge Lewis Kaplan, the man who sentenced him, of bias. He compared his situation to Trump’s legal battles, saying Kaplan was part of a larger network of judges that Trump’s incoming DOJ considers corrupt. “Trump had a lot of frustrations with Kaplan,” Sam said. “I certainly did as well.” SBF claimed Kaplan made rulings that directly helped the prosecution, including allowing the DOJ to falsely tell the jury that all of FTX’s customers lost everything, while barring Sam’s defense from arguing the opposite. “The jury was told something that was just not true, and Kaplan blocked us from correcting it,” Sam said. He also took direct aim at Danielle Sassoon, the lead prosecutor in his case, who later resigned instead of dismissing a separate corruption case involving New York City Mayor Eric Adams. SBF implied that her sudden departure raises questions about how she handled his case. “My prosecutor has been in the news recently for tussles with Trump’s DOJ,” he said, referring to the growing power struggle between Trump’s legal team and Biden’s remaining prosecutors. Sam believes his case is a perfect example of political weaponization. He pointed to sentencing disparities, claiming that another FTX executive—a Republican who took a plea deal—got a much harsher punishment than three Democrats who also pleaded guilty. “There was a lot of explicit politicization going on,” Sam said. “Threats were made. A Republican congressional candidate was told his wife would be indicted if he didn’t play along with Biden’s DOJ.” Sam claims crypto industry was targeted While mainstream media reports painted SBF as a Democratic megadonor, he now says that’s only half the story. According to him, he was quietly funneling millions into Republican campaigns and conservative causes, but doing so in secret. “It’s sometimes framed in the press that I was giving an extraordinary amount to Democrats, and that Republican donations were just an afterthought,” Sam said . “That’s not true. The Republican side was way bigger than people realized.” Sam says his stance on crypto policy played a major role in his downfall. He spent years lobbying in Washington, working with legislators, regulators, and even the White House. But instead of finding bipartisan allies, he says he became increasingly frustrated with the Biden administration, which he described as being “incredibly destructive” toward crypto. “The Democratic Party was becoming anti-crypto, and I was trying to stop it,” SBF said. “I spent years in D.C. trying to work across the aisle to prevent draconian measures against the industry. But Biden’s administration was impossible to work with.” He believes the government wanted a scapegoat, and he became the easiest target. SBF reiterates that FTX was always solvent, blames bankruptcy lawyers Sam is still maintaining that FTX wasn’t bankrupt when he was forced out. He blames the collapse on outside intervention, saying his company had enough money to fully repay customers before a group of lawyers took control. “There were enough assets to pay everyone back in full in November 2022,” Sam said. “If these debtors hadn’t stepped in, customers wouldn’t have waited two and a half years to get their money.” Sam says the bankruptcy team running FTX misled the public, initially claiming there were only $1 billion in assets, when in reality, they eventually found $15 billion. He says the numbers magically kept increasing over time, proving that the company was never actually insolvent. “At first, they said there was $1 billion. Then a few months later, they found $5 billion. Then it was $7 billion, then $13 billion, then $15 billion,” SBF said. “They just kept pretending there wasn’t money there.” Sam believes that instead of letting him fix the liquidity crisis, the government and bankruptcy lawyers froze everything, leaving FTX customers stranded. “All they had to do was let me run the company for another few weeks,” Sam said. “The money was already there. They chose to sit on their hands for years instead.” SBF defends his business model, says no fraud took place Sam once again denied the fact that he stole customer funds, saying FTX’s structure was always based on borrowing and margin trading. He described FTX’s finances as no different from a bank run, where liquidity temporarily dries up, but assets remain intact. “Most of FTX’s customers traded on margin, which means they borrowed money to buy crypto,” SBF said. “When people do that, the exchange doesn’t hold one-to-one reserves of every deposit. That’s how every trading platform works.” He says his biggest mistake was giving up control of FTX, rather than fighting back against the bankruptcy takeover. “The single biggest mistake I made was backing down in November 2022,” Sam said. “I should have never let these lawyers take over. They spent years lying to customers, telling them there was no money left, when they knew that wasn’t true.” Sam also argued that intent matters in fraud cases, saying that FTX was never in a position where it couldn’t repay customers. He compared it to banks or investment funds that move money around while remaining solvent. “If a company is totally insolvent—like owes ten times what it has—that’s fraud,” Sam said. “But that wasn’t us. FTX always had more assets than liabilities.” Despite being behind bars, SBF said he still believes crypto isn’t going anywhere, and he expects more politicians to get involved. When asked about Trump’s recent meme coin, he said he wasn’t surprised. “Politicians are dipping their toes into crypto,” Sam said. “That’s only going to increase over time.” Asked whether he had any plans if he were to get out of prison, Sam refused to speculate. “I try not to think about it too much right now because there’s nothing I can do, I mean right now I’ve got 20-something years left on my sentence,” he said in the interview. But despite it all, SBF remains focused on one thing—his appeal. “We have oral arguments coming up in the next three to six months,” Sam said. “The odds are always stacked against you in federal court, but I’m cautiously optimistic.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|FTX,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-21 04:19:31

Digital assets, once perceived as speculative investments, are now gaining traction as a legitimate medium of exchange. Businesses across diverse sectors adopt cryptocurrencies for payments, while blockchain technology continues to disrupt traditional processes, offering unparalleled transparency and efficiency. As more individuals embrace the convenience of cryptocurrencies, the demand for tools that facilitate their use in everyday transactions has surged. Among these tools, cryptocurrency cards have become one of the most practical solutions, allowing users to seamlessly integrate digital assets into their daily lives. Cryptocurrency Debit Card and Its Working Principle A cryptocurrency debit card operates much like a traditional debit card, but with one key distinction: it connects directly to a cryptocurrency wallet rather than a conventional bank account. This innovation enables users to spend their digital assets on goods and services, making cryptocurrency more accessible and usable in the real world. Here’s a closer look at how a crypto card works: Linking to a wallet. Users first need to link their cryptocurrency wallet to the card. Wallets can be funded through various means, including SEPA transfers, allowing users to buy Bitcoin with SEPA on supported platforms and then load their crypto card for everyday transactions. Most issuers provide an easy-to-use mobile app or web interface for this purpose. The wallet serves as the source of funds for transactions. Real-time conversion. When a user swipes their card or uses it online, the system instantly converts the cryptocurrency to fiat currency. This conversion occurs at the prevailing exchange rate, ensuring merchants receive payments in their preferred currency. Seamless payments. The card operates on global payment networks such as Visa or Mastercard, allowing it to be used anywhere these networks are accepted. This makes a cryptocurrency debit card a versatile tool for shopping, dining, travel, and more. Security features. Many providers incorporate advanced security measures, including two-factor authentication, encryption, and the ability to lock or freeze the card via a mobile app. These features provide users with confidence in the safety of their funds. The integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional payment infrastructure has significantly lowered the barriers to using digital assets. Whether it’s purchasing groceries or booking a vacation, a crypto card makes it possible to harness the power of blockchain technology in everyday life. How to Get a Crypto Card? The process of obtaining a cryptocurrency card has been streamlined by major providers, making it accessible even for individuals who are new to the crypto space. Here are the detailed steps: Select a card provider. Research reputable companies offering cryptocurrency debit cards. Each provider has its own set of features, including cashback rates, supported cryptocurrencies, and additional perks. Choose one that aligns with your needs and preferences. Complete the KYC process. To ensure compliance with regulations and enhance security, most providers require users to complete a know-your-customer (KYC) process. This typically involves submitting identification documents and proof of address. Fund your wallet. Once your account is verified, transfer cryptocurrency to the wallet associated with the card. Providers often support popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins like USDT or USDC. Order the physical card. After funding your wallet, request your crypto card through the provider’s platform. Physical cards are delivered to your address, while virtual cards are instantly available for online transactions. Activate the card. Activate your card using the mobile app or online platform provided by the issuer. You can then start using it for purchases, withdrawals, or online payments. A Cryptocurrency Card with Cashback and Their Benefits for Everyday Use One of the standout features of a crypto card is its ability to reward users with cashback on purchases. A crypto card with cashback not only incentivizes spending but also helps users grow their cryptocurrency holdings passively. Here are some key advantages of using a Bitcoin card or other cryptocurrency cards for daily transactions: Cashback rewards. Depending on the provider, cashback rates can range from 1% to as high as 10%, depending on the type of card and membership tier. For example, Crypto.com offers tiered cashback rates based on the amount of CRO staked by the user, while the WhiteBIT Nova card offers up to 10% cashback in BTC and zero fees. The rewards are usually credited in the form of cryptocurrency, allowing users to reinvest, stake, or save them for future use. Global usability. Crypto cards are accepted worldwide wherever Visa or Mastercard is supported. This makes them ideal for frequent travelers or individuals who shop internationally. Diverse spending options. Whether you’re buying groceries, dining out, booking flights, or subscribing to online services, a cryptocurrency card can handle all these transactions seamlessly. Enhanced financial benefits. Some providers offer additional perks, such as discounts on streaming subscriptions, access to airport lounges, or priority customer support. These benefits make crypto cards not just a financial tool but a lifestyle accessory. Transparency and control. With a dedicated mobile app, users can track their spending in real time, set budgets, and monitor rewards. This level of transparency is particularly appealing to individuals who want greater control over their finances. Low transaction costs. Compared to traditional banking services, transactions with a cryptocurrency debit card often come with reduced fees. Using a crypto card simplifies the way digital assets are integrated into daily life. From earning rewards to managing finances more effectively, these cards offer a comprehensive solution for individuals looking to maximize the utility of their cryptocurrencies. The introduction of cryptocurrency cards marks a significant milestone in the journey toward mainstream adoption of digital assets. By combining the familiarity of traditional payment methods with the flexibility and innovation of blockchain technology, these cards have become an indispensable tool for crypto enthusiasts. Whether you’re looking to spend Bitcoin on daily expenses, enjoy the perks of a crypto card with cashback, or streamline your financial management, the possibilities are virtually endless. By embracing these innovative solutions, individuals can unlock the true potential of their digital assets and at the same time contribute to the ongoing growth and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the global economy.

Timing is everything in the crypto world, and the right presale can turn small investments into massive gains. While the market sees constant shifts, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making waves with its deflationary model, while GALA and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) introduce major updates. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is currently in its Blizzard Bay presale phase, offering early buyers an incredible entry point before launch. Meanwhile, GALA continues to push forward with ecosystem advancements, and ICP is making headlines with its latest blockchain developments. This article covers the latest updates on all three projects: Arctic Pablo Coin, GALA, and ICP. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Model: A Scarcity-Driven Approach Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) brings a powerful deflationary mechanism to the table. Its token burn strategy permanently removes unsold tokens from circulation every week during the presale. Once the presale ends, any remaining supply will also be burned, reducing total supply and driving long-term value. Built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), these transactions ensure transparency and verifiability. Beyond its deflationary nature, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale structure is entirely unique. Unlike traditional tiered phases, APC’s meme coin presale is location-based, simulating Arctic Pablo’s global journey. This approach adds an exciting dynamic, creating urgency as it moves from one location to another. With no rigid stages, each stop introduces new opportunities for investors. Blizzard Bay Presale: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Biggest Opportunity Yet Arctic Pablo Coin has now arrived at Blizzard Bay, its 11th location, following an astonishingly rapid journey through nine previous destinations in under a month. Currently, 1 APC is available for just $0.000059, with an anticipated 12,618.77% ROI from Blizzard Bay to its official launch price of $0.008. This presale has already attracted immense attention, raising over $1.44 million so far. The momentum is only growing, and as Arctic Pablo moves forward, prices will continue to rise. Securing tokens at Blizzard Bay’s price level could be the best crypto investment decision before the next increase. Staking, Rewards, and Exclusive Perks for Early Buyers Investors in Arctic Pablo Coin can stake their APC tokens during the presale and earn an APY of 66%, maximizing their holdings before the token even launches. Additionally, referral incentives allow users to earn rewards by introducing others to the project. Community competitions also provide extra chances to win APC tokens or USD rewards. GALA’s Latest Ecosystem Expansion: New Partnerships and Game Releases GALA is making headlines with its latest ecosystem expansion, strengthening its gaming and entertainment presence. The team has announced a strategic partnership with major blockchain developers to enhance Web3 gaming experiences. Additionally, GALA is set to release a highly anticipated new game, further solidifying its reputation as a pioneer in the decentralized gaming industry. With increasing adoption, GALA’s roadmap suggests continued growth and innovation in the space. Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) Introduces Smart Contract Upgrades Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is pushing forward with blockchain advancements, recently launching a groundbreaking smart contract upgrade that significantly boosts efficiency and scalability. This update aims to enhance DeFi applications and enable more seamless interactions on the ICP network. As the blockchain space evolves, ICP’s latest innovation positions it as a strong contender in the decentralized computing sector. The Final Word: Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out With Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary model, unique presale structure, and massive ROI potential, it stands out as the best crypto to invest in right now. While GALA and ICP bring exciting developments to their respective ecosystems, Arctic Pablo Coin’s Blizzard Bay presale presents a rare opportunity to secure tokens at an extremely low entry point. As the project moves forward, each phase will bring higher prices—making now the perfect time to invest. Don’t miss out on this promising presale before Arctic Pablo moves to its next location! For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why is Arctic Pablo Coin considered the best crypto to invest in right now? Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary token burn, high staking rewards, and unique presale structure provide early investors with significant advantages, including a projected 12,618.77% ROI from Blizzard Bay to launch price. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale work? Instead of traditional tiered phases, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale progresses through global locations. Each new location brings an increased price, making earlier entries more rewarding. What is the staking APY for Arctic Pablo Coin? During the presale, investors can stake their tokens and earn a 66% APY , adding extra value before the token officially launches. What recent developments has GALA introduced? GALA has expanded its ecosystem with new partnerships and an upcoming game release, strengthening its position in blockchain gaming. How is Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) evolving? ICP recently launched a major smart contract upgrade, improving efficiency and scalability for DeFi applications and decentralized services. The post Is This the Best Crypto to Invest in?

On February 20, it passed through Utah’s Revenue and Taxation Committee in a 4-2-1 vote. After the second and third reading in the Senate, a final Senate vote will be made. The final step will be Republican Governor Spencer Cox’s signature, which isn’t much of a hurdle at that point. According to Utah’s Bitcoin reserve bill , a qualifying digital asset must have an average market cap of $500 billion over the past calendar year. At the current point in time, Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that qualifies. Ethereum briefly crossed $500 billion between October and December 2021 but did not stay above it for long. The bill also grants the state treasurer the authority to stake the assets, raising the possibility of including proof-of-stake currencies, such as Ethereum, in the future. All four senators who voted in favor of HB230 were Republicans, while one Republican and one Democrat voted against it, and one senator was absent. The measure further allows the state treasurer to invest up to 5% in digital assets across five accounts, including the General Fund Budget, Income Tax Fund Budget, and State Disaster Recovery accounts.

He made it clear that Bybit will not list scams. Meanwhile, the Pi Network token price is already struggling after its launch, with the Pi coin’s price dropping below $1, marking a 100% decline . Ben Zhou Rejects Pi Network The launch of Pi Network on February 20 has sparked excitement among its community, as supporters eagerly await its listing on major crypto exchanges. Perhaps, not all platforms are open to the idea. A week ago, Ben Zhou shared on X that he was invited to join Pi Network but turned it down, calling the offer “ridiculous.” He explained that during his time in forex trading, he often dealt with people trying to get their money back, and he wanted to avoid such issues in the crypto world. His remarks made it clear that he did not trust the project and preferred to stay away from it. His strong rejection of the Pi Network led to backlash from the Pi community supporters, with some accusing Bybit of losing relevance in the crypto industry. Others claimed that Bybit had applied to list Pi but was rejected. However, Zhou quickly denied these allegations and set the record straight. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today 21-Feb : Pi Network News, XRP ETF Approval , Story (IP) Price Rally and More , Ben Challenges Pi Network on Scam Claims In response to the criticism, Ben Zhou did not hold back.

As the Pi Network community continues to push for legitimacy, it remains to be seen how other exchanges will respond. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Pi’s price has been fluctuating significantly and at press time, it has fallen below $1. This volatility has led to an aggressive selling trend among holders. One user, based in the UK, has questioned whether regulations could be a factor in these sudden changes, asking why such withdrawal issues are happening now. The cause of the fluctuations and suspension of withdrawals is still unclear, but regulatory concerns might be playing a role in the uncertain market conditions. Users Report Issues on Bitget and OKX In addition to price concerns, a number of Pi Network users have reported difficulties with exchanges such as bitget bitget - bd@bitget.com Centralised Exchange and OKX. One user mentioned they deposited 1,500 Pi into Bitget, only to find the tokens stuck on the platform. Others have raised similar concerns on social media, prompting inquiries to Pi Core Team for an explanation. For those using OKX, the platform has suspended Pi withdrawals for over 24 hours, as reported by another user. Frustrated by the suspension, a user contacted OKX support and was advised to provide their unique ID and email address to initiate the return process. While the user requested a deposit refund and received an email in response, there is still no confirmation of when the withdrawals will be restored. Bitget responded to the mail and wrote , “Greetings from Bitget. We would like to inform you that your request is currently in the process of being handled and it has been escalated to the relevant team to expedite the process. Please be assured that your request is our top priority at the moment. We kindly request your understanding and patience. Once again, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Bitcoin (BTC) price crossed the $98K level on Friday, whereas Ethereum (ETH) traded above the $2,700 level. Simultaneously, Solana traded above the $170 mark, indicating leading coins saw growing market support. However, XRP has lost nearly 2% over the past day and is below the $2.7 level. Notably, the recently launched Story (IP) token skyshot in value, emerging as the day’s top market gainer. Mentioned below are some of the latest market updates and how the leading crypto prices have been delivering in the past 24 hours. Crypto Market Today: How Are BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP Performing? It’s worth noting that the global crypto market cap was up nearly 1% from yesterday, sitting at $3.23 trillion. Further, the total market volume in the past 24 hours rose by nearly 8% to $90.13 billion. In line with this stat, BTC, ETH, and SOL traded in the green as of press time. Bitcoin Price Claims $98K BTC price gained over 1% in the past 24 hours, closing in at $98,220. The flagship crypto’s intraday low and high were $96,805.78 and $98,767.19, respectively. Notably, Bitcoin’s market dominance rose by 0.23% to 60.31% today, indicating that the altcoin sector encountered more volatility. ETH Price Jumps Marginally ETH price witnessed a highly turbulent action over the past day and rested at $2,748 as of press time, up 0.2%. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were recorded to be $2,708.22 and $2,770.03, respectively. Notably, Ethereum’s dominance slipped to 10.25% today, per CoinMarketCap data. ETH price faces vital resistance at $2,800, a break above which could propel further gains. XRP Price Slips However, XRP price dropped over 2% in the past 24 hours and is currently sitting at $2.65. The Ripple-backed asset hit an intraday bottom and peak of $2.64 and $2.74, respectively. Notably, the odds of an XRP ETF have further risen as Grayscale’s filing enters SEC review mode. Given that the approval is secured ahead, the price could leverage considerable bullish support and pump. SOL Price Springs SOL price witnessed a slight uptick of 0.5% intraday and is currently trading at $174.55. The coin hit a low and high of $170.99 and $176.59 in the past 24 hours.

Although a strategic Bitcoin reserve bill is looming in the U.S. and numerous altcoin ETF-related filings have been made, whale accumulations & prices are stagnant. Crypto market analyst Ali Martinez further revealed on X that the recent BTC accumulation trend score signaled whales are either distributing or not accumulating.

33767162,[object Object],1740114352,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,US SEC Launches New Unit To Protect Investors From Crypto And AI Fraud,https://bitcoinist.com/us-sec-unit-protect-investors-crypto-and-ai-fraud/,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced on Monday the establishment of the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit (CETU), aimed to combat misconduct in the crypto and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors. SEC’s Strategic Move To Combat Cyber Misconduct According to an official release from the SEC, the CETU will replace the previous Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit and will be led by Laura D’Allaird. The unit will consist of approximately 30 specialized attorneys and fraud experts drawn from various SEC offices, bringing a wealth of experience in fintech and cybersecurity to the forefront of regulatory efforts . Acting SEC Chairman Mark T. Uyeda emphasized the importance of this new unit, stating that it will complement the work of the Crypto Task Force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce. Chair Uyeda noted that the CETU’s mission is not only to protect investors but also to promote capital formation and market efficiency, thereby fostering an environment conducive to innovation. The CETU will focus on a variety of priority areas concerning cyber-related misconduct. This includes addressing fraudulent activities that utilize advanced technologies such as AI and machine learning , as well as investigating schemes that employ social media platforms, the dark web, or deceptive websites. The unit will also target hacking incidents aimed at acquiring material nonpublic information and will combat unauthorized access and manipulation of retail brokerage accounts. Additionally, the CETU will investigate fraudulent practices involving blockchain technology and crypto assets while ensuring that regulated entities adhere to existing cybersecurity rules and monitoring public issuers for misleading cybersecurity disclosures. Steps To Enhance Crypto Oversight This initiative follows the SEC’s earlier establishment of the crypto task force on January 21, 2025. Under the leadership of Commissioner Hester Peirce, the Task Force aims to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto assets, signaling a proactive approach by the SEC to engage more meaningfully with the sector. Commissioner Peirce has noted that the success of the Task Force hinges on collaboration with a diverse range of stakeholders, including investors, industry participants, and academics. She urged members of the crypto community to actively participate in discussions and provide input through various channels, such as public comments and roundtables. The SEC’s dual approach, combining the efforts of the newly formed CETU and the crypto task force, marks a pivotal shift in regulatory oversight under the new President Donald Trump administration, which aims to clarify regulatory boundaries, establish feasible registration paths, and ensure sensible disclosure frameworks.

DOGE is now consolidating and struggling to clear the $0.2550 resistance. DOGE price started a fresh decline below the $0.270 and $0.2620 levels. The price is trading below the $0.2580 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.2540 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another increase if it clears the $0.2550 and $0.2620 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Struggles To Gain Pace Dogecoin price started a fresh decline below the $0.2750 zone, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE dipped below the $0.270 and $0.2620 support levels. It even spiked below $0.2550. A low was formed at $0.2420 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2830 swing high to the $0.2420 low. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.2540 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. However, the pair is struggling to settle above the $0.2550 resistance level. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.2540 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2550 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2625 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2830 swing high to the $0.2420 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.2720 level. A close above the $0.2720 resistance might send the price toward the $0.300 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.320 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.3420. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2550 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2500 level. The next major support is near the $0.2450 level. The main support sits at $0.2420. If there is a downside break below the $0.2420 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.2350 level or even $0.2220 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.

Currently, four buzzing cryptocurrencies being eyed by investors are Pi Network (PI), Solana (SOL), XRP, and the rapidly emerging Remittix (RTX). These assets stand out due to developments in the network, growing adoption, and impressive price swings. While Pi Network stays on its path to the full mainnet launch, Solana (SOL) has resisted the storm of market fluctuations. Regulation changes have turned XRP into a household name globally, while Remittix (RTX) has stolen the limelight in the cross-border payments landscape. Pi Network: Will the Mainnet Finally Launch? Since its inception, the Pi Network (PI) has maintained a devout following, with users eagerly awaiting the mainnet launch. While originally marketed as a mobile mining project, PI has never been listed on a major exchange, leading to user anxieties about when they might trade their tokens. The demand for a PI mainnet launch keeps growing, as many people think this will give the PI holders a chance to exchange their tokens for actual assets like SOL and XRP. Nevertheless, some investors treat things cautiously without an official date being finalized. Still, market enthusiasts speculate that PI could become one of the most significant cryptocurrency releases in modern times. Solana (SOL) Holds Strong Amid Market Fluctuations SOL has become one of the strongest crypto assets and falls even the least when the market declines. Thanks to its very fast transaction speeds and low fees, it is regarded as the cornerstone for DeFi and NFT ecosystems. The growing number of developers tend towards Solana because it is cheaper than Ethereum and has scalable solutions. Market analysts believe SOL is reaching its lowest point, but it could rise as buying demands increase. Strong fundamentals keep Solana inscribed as a key altcoin for all watchers and investors. XRP Gains Momentum as Legal Uncertainty Clears Fresh victories attained on the legal front have burned new confidence in XRP, widening its adoption across the globe. The company continues to expand its partnership with financial institutions, thus growing XRP’s potential in global payments. As speculative assets dominate most cryptocurrencies, one of the outstanding characteristics of XRP is the real-world utility exhibited in international money transfers. For instance, analysts have predicted that the price could test new all-time highs if market sentiment improves, driven by increased institutional interest and growing consumer demand. Remittix (RTX): The Rising Star in Cross-Border Payments Remittix (RTX) is increasingly gaining attention as a great contender in the payment sector, directly competing with XRP, SOL, and PI. RTX is hell-bent on transforming cross-border transactions swiftly and cost-effectively, far beyond traditional remittance services. In contrast to PI, which is still awaiting its mainnet launch, or XRP, which has been through a series of legal gauntlets, RTX has had real-world adoption. Businesses searching for better payment solutions are getting on the RTX train, clinching a stronger foothold. At its presale price of $0.0628, RTX raised over $12.3 million and is fast-trending with retail and institutional investors. Its infrastructure runs on a blockchain that enables instant and cheap transactions, thus appealing to the attention of financial institutions worldwide. Many people expect RTX to be one of the biggest breakout tokens in 2025. Which Crypto Holds the Most Potential? As the crypto market keeps changing, each project, PI, SOL, XRP, and Remittix offers specific advantages. In high anticipation of their mainnet launch, PI Network would remain at that time while Solana continues to reign in DeFi. Because of regulatory clarity, XRP has enjoyed some advantages, whilst Remittix is remarkable as an up-and-coming company in payments. Investors are now shifting their focus from speculation to real-world uses; many would provide Remittix as a practical example. As such, it is not unreasonable to expect SOL, XRP, and RTX to continue to prosper in the emerging crypto space with their ample fundamentals. For those seeking to cash in on the next wave of crypto innovation, monitoring these best-in-class assets might prove a worthwhile strategy.

The selling pressure comes with huge trading activity as daily trading volumes surge to more than $1.2 billion. Pi Coin Sees Major Pump and Dump Pi Coin, the native cryptocurrency of the Pi Network faces a major pump-and-dump as it currently trades around $0.70 falling more than 65% from its peak of $2.0 Investors’ euphoria surrounding the mainnet launch seems to be waning fast. Even as of the current price of $0.70, the Pi Network pegs a market cap of $4.45 billion. With more than 10 million users, the Pi Network has achieved significant market following. following the mainnet launch, a total of 1 billion from the total 9.7 billion PI tokens are available initially. The remaining tokens will be locked in user wallets and unlocked over a period of time. Although some market analysts have turned bullish, investors should be careful while taking fresh bets and look for any potential signs of trend reversal. Will Binance and Coinbase Listing lead to Trend Reversal? Despite the current Pi Coin price fall , the optimism surrounding the recovery remains high. Some market analysts believe that this would not be the right time to sell at the bottom considering that the daily trading volumes have remained robust at more than $1.2 billion. Some of the global crypto exchanges like OKX and CoinDCX have already extended support to Pi coin. Furthermore, the industry has been pushing to bring the Pi Network’s native crypto token to top exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Binance and Coinbase, being among the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, offer access to a vast user base and high trading volumes. This increased liquidity can make Pi Coin more attractive to traders and investors. Besides, it will further boost the credibility of the crypto asset among retail investors. $PI network chart dosen't look bad at all are you selling the bottom?

In a statement shared on social media, LightYear said : “The only narrative I really hated about yesterday’s listing of Pi was that of people having cheap access to accumulate what we paid for with our time, for many years.” The sentiment highlights concerns among long-term supporters of the Pi Network, who believe the listing undermines the project’s core narrative of valuing time and attention The post Pi Coin Price Crashes 50%, What Shall Investors Do Next? appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News,EN,0,0,TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-02-21 05:12:58

He accused the Democrats of “treason.” He addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference, pledging to slash government spending and endorsing an audit of the Federal Reserve . Musk, now seen as President Donald Trump’s most influential adviser, slammed Biden’s immigration policies and specifically blasted an app that allowed one million people to enter the United States on two-year work permits. Earlier, he met Argentine President Javier Milei, who handed him the chainsaw engraved with “Viva la libertad, carajo,” or “Long live liberty, d*mn it.” Musk dubbed it “the chainsaw for bureaucracy.” He also joked that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele was concerned for his safety.

The cryptocurrency is currently facing significant resistance between the $2.65 and $2.80 levels. This suggests the price could continue to struggle around these points in the short term. XRP has erased the majority of the gains made in the seven days. The broader market sentiment also remains mixed, with Bitcoin struggling to break above the crucial $98k mark and Ethereum is also stuck below the $3000 mark. Support Levels to Watch On the downside, support can be found around the $2.50 level. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World , a drop below this could lead to further support between $2.25 and $2.30. These levels are important to monitor as they may indicate where price stability could form if the bearish trend continues. Resistance Beyond $2.80 Should XRP break above the $2.80 resistance level, additional resistance is expected around the $3 mark, followed by another resistance zone near $3.20. Possible Bullish Cup and Handle Pattern If XRP manages a confirmed breakout above $2.80, there’s potential for a short-term cup and handle pattern to form on the daily timeframe. If validated, this pattern could signal a higher low and indicate a bullish shift in market sentiment. A breakout could result in significant bullish momentum over the next few days or weeks. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Rival Stellar (XLM) at a Critical Level, Will Price Soar or Crash? , Short-Term Analysis: Bullish Divergence On the 2-hour chart, XRP has recently shown a bullish divergence , the opposite of the previous bearish divergence that led to a pullback.

The three day outflows started with $61.4 million on Feb. 18, followed by $71.07 million on Feb. 19. However, on Feb. 20, net outflows surged to $364.93 million, according to data from SoSoValue. This marks the most significant single-day decline in the three days. BlackRock’s IBIT experienced the largest single-day withdrawal, losing $112.05 million. The next biggest outflows were $98.3 million from ARK Invest’s ARKB and $89.24 million from Fidelity’s FBTC. With $33.5 million in outflows, Grayscale’s GBTC continued its outflow streak following its conversion from a trust structure. Interestingly, Bitwise’s BITB had inflows of $24.1 million, while VanEck’s HODL witnessed a slight gain of $4.18 million.

However, institutional demand seems to be growing. The recent $436.9 million investment in BlackRock’s IBIT by Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala Investment Company, shows long-term confidence. In addition, Barclays has also revealed a $131 million investment in IBIT as of Q4 2024 in its Feb.13 form 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher noted that as markets factored in early demand from ETF approvals and euphoria surrounding Trump, inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs have decreased. Investors are currently waiting for the next significant catalyst to push prices higher, as a large portion of that purchasing pressure has already been realized. ETF flows for $BTC and $ETH are clearly slowing down since the election pumps. 📉 It makes sense when you realize that markets are forward-looking, and the bulk of ETF buyers were front-running all the positive news from Trump taking office. With all that demand pulled forward,… pic.twitter.com/S7WqQFluaC — Miles Deutscher (@milesdeutscher) February 20, 2025 Uncertainty has also increased as a result of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’s delayed introduction. Many investors had anticipated it would take place soon after Donald Trump took office and possibly spur new institutional inflows. Despite the outflows, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable at $98,000, up 1% over the last day. Long-term demand from institutions is a crucial aspect to monitor, according to analysts, as it might help sustain Bitcoin’s momentum in the coming months.

The New York-based firm confirmed the restart in a Thursday statement. Last week, the asset manager paused engagements with the corporate sector temporarily, and announced the restart this week. According to BlackRock, this temporary hold allowed the world’s largest asset manager to assess rules that place stricter requirements on firms aiming to influence the conduct of companies in which they invest. “We are complying with the new requirements including by highlighting our role as a ‘passive’ investor at the start of each engagement,” the company said. “BlackRock does not use engagement as a way to control publicly traded companies.” The SEC, now under new leadership since President Donald Trump took office, issued guidance that could treat investors seeking to shape environmental, social, or political matters more like activist hedge funds. These changes mean that asset managers may face more extensive disclosure and regulatory scrutiny if they push for specific corporate actions.

A: NO If the price of Bitcoin crashes I will back up the… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 20, 2025 Kiyosaki Warning Signs Kiyosaki warns that the global financial system is at present unstable, citing rising inflation, excessive government debt, and increasing layoffs as warning signs of a major economic downturn. He believes that the rich are getting richer due to a financial system built on “fake money,” which drives asset prices higher while making life more expensive for the poor and middle class. He has repeatedly argued that fiat currency is being devalued, pushing essential goods and services out of reach for many people. Kiyosaki to Stick with Bitcoin Unlike traditional investors who may panic during downturns, Kiyosaki sees a market crash as an opportunity. He clarified that he will not sell his Bitcoin, gold, or silver —assets he considers “real money.” Instead, he plans to “back up the truck,” meaning he will buy more if prices drop significantly. His stance urges investors to rethink their financial strategies in the face of increasing market volatility. While he has less faith in the dollar he sees Bitcoin as the only hope in this financial crisis. Ray Dalio’s ‘Debt Death Spiral’ Warning On the other side, Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has also raised similar alarms about the U.S. economy, warning that it is headed toward a dangerous “debt death spiral.” He believes that the government is borrowing at an unsustainable rate, which could trigger a crisis if investors lose confidence and offload U.S. debt. With interest payments nearing $1 trillion annually, the government’s ability to fund essential services is becoming more constrained. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin’s Netflow Trends Suggest $100K Target May Be Delayed: Here’s What It Means , In short, he means , that when a country has too much debt, the problem spreads like a domino effect. First, businesses struggle with debt, then the government takes on more, and eventually, the central bank has to step in. People start to panic and try to get rid of their debt investments, like selling bonds or pulling money from banks, because they fear losing money. This rush to sell makes borrowing more expensive (higher interest rates), making it even harder for the government and businesses to pay back what they owe. To stop everything from collapsing, central banks usually pump more money into the system to keep things running. But this comes with a big risk—it can make money less valuable, leading to inflation. If not managed properly, this cycle can spiral out of control, creating a major financial crisis. Dalio argues that the U.S. must reduce its deficit to 3% of GDP—what he calls the “3% solution.” Without decisive action, he warns, the economy could spiral into chaos. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Amidst market volatility and rising negative altcoin sentiment, investors are eyeing lucrative investment projects like 1Fuel to maximize their profits. 1Fuel is a promising project that has fascinated investors through its impressive performance. The innovative altcoin has already raised over $2.2 million in its presale. As it continues to gain momentum, experts believe 1Fuel could surge to 100x and become the next crypto success story. Hedera (HBAR) dips amidst intense selling pressure Hedera has been facing significant resistance since the beginning of this year. The infamous altcoin is currently priced at $0.21, declining by around 6.19% from last week’s price. Experts attribute HBAR’s recent downtrend to a broader negative market sentiment around altcoins. Additionally, Hedera’s increasing selling pressure is also a vital contributor to the bearish movement. Hedera’s Long/Short Ratio shows that 56.5% of its taker volume consists of sellers, which indicates that the bears are gradually taking control. However, despite Hedera’s recent performance, experts are still optimistic about its future. Coinbase has recently launched Solana and Hedera Futures contracts for US traders, which might cause an upsurge in the altcoin’s price. As Hedera struggles, investors search for alternative high-yield projects like 1Fuel to 100x their profits. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) plunges as Bears take over Pepe Unchained was launched back in December 2024 and quickly gained traction in the meme coin market. However, the PEPU token is currently facing significant losses. As of February 19, Pepe Unchained’s price is hovering around the $0.0073 mark, plummeting by over 22% from its last week price. Experts link the PEPU token’s recent downtrend to diminishing investor confidence and a wider negative sentiment around altcoins. On top of this, the PEPU token’s weekly MACD 12,26 and EMA 10 levels also point towards continued bearish activity. However, despite the recent decline, experts believe that Pepe Unchained might recover, as the altcoin has recently launched its Pump Pad . This launch allows the PEPU token to offer blazingly fast transaction speed at just a fraction of a cost while also taking the benefit of Ethereum’s superior security. As the PEPU token plummets, investors are shifting focus towards 1Fuel, a promising investment project with the potential to deliver 100x gains. 1Fuel (OFT) ignites investors’ interest by promising 100x returns The HBAR price declines, while Pepe Unchained gains bearish momentum, at the same time, 1Fuel emerges as a lucrative investment option. The upcoming crypto wallet is all set to revolutionize conventional trading. 1Fuel aims to streamline the trading process, enabling users to transfer their assets across multiple blockchains with just a single click on their device. In line with this vision, 1Fuel will introduce its P2P exchange. This decentralized exchange would allow users to securely trade multiple assets directly with other users. Besides making the trading process easier, 1Fuel prioritizes user security through its Inbuilt Mixer feature. This feature would anonymize user financial activities and make them untraceable by blending them with other similar transactions. 1Fuel’s cold storage also serves a similar function by protecting user assets through military-grade cold storage. With its enticing features and attractive presale metrics, 1Fuel is poised to revolutionize the crypto market. Final Thoughts Hedera and Pepe Unchained are facing substantial resistance, while 1Fuel is positioned to dominate the crypto market through its cutting-edge technology and attractive features. With over $2.2 million raised in its presale and the potential to deliver 100x gains, 1Fuel is stealing the limelight. Get 100x returns by grabbing OFT tokens now before they explode in value!

Musk has previously called for more scrutiny of the Fed’s activities, and an audit could possibly help pinpoint and implement cost-cutting measures that previous administrations overlooked. Musk is considering auditing the Federal Reserve and Fort Knox At the CPAC stage, Musk made a dramatic entrance, sporting sunglasses and a black MAGA hat while throwing his fists in the air. Later, he was joined on stage by President Javier Milei of Argentina, who presented him with a chainsaw, a symbol of his government’s crackdown on excessive spending, which Musk called “the chainsaw for bureaucracy.” Then, in an onstage interview with Rob Schmitt of Newsmax, a conservative news and opinion cable channel, Musk teased his plans to audit the Federal Reserve. However, he did not give much detail on when or how he would look into the Fed. On X, he also wrote , “All aspects of the government must be fully transparent and accountable to the people. No exceptions, including, if not especially, the Federal Reserve.” Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve does have all its yearly financial audits posted online. Musk also said he wants to confirm the gold reserves in Fort Knox, Kentucky, an idea originally proposed by President Donald Trump. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg on Thursday that Fort Knox’s gold reserves are audited annually, adding that all the gold is accounted for. Musk and Trump are thinking of giving payouts to Americans The Tesla CEO, speaking at the CPAC conference, argued that all the money saved from DOGE’s cost-cutting program could be distributed to the public. He said that the money taken away from “destructive” things in the country and organizations that resent the people would be given back, calling it “the spoils of battle.” On Wednesday, Trump had made a similar statement at the FII Priority Summit, saying they are thinking of paying 20% of DOGE’s savings directly to Americans and another 20% to help clear the country’s debt. When asked about the wasteful spending in the federal budget, Musk compared it to being in a room where the walls, roof, and floor are all targets, and so you just need to close your eyes and choose any direction. So far, DOGE has claimed that it has saved up to $55 billion by renegotiating contracts and leases, canceling grants, selling assets, slashing staff, cutting regulatory costs, and fraud detection. Nonetheless, the agency and Trump are facing harsh criticism over multiple violations. Musk recently came under fire for infringing on privacy laws, and now Trump is being criticized for trying to cut budgets on spending already approved by Congress.

President Donald Trump’s confirmation of a long-awaited audit of Fort Knox’s gold reserves has driven speculation on prediction markets, while his return to office has also fueled a surge in Bitcoin and broader crypto adoption. In Australia, however, public sentiment remains divided on Trump’s impact on the digital asset space, with crypto investors viewing his policies more favorably than non-investors. As discussions around financial accountability and digital currencies gain momentum, both initiatives highlight the evolving intersection of traditional and decentralized finance. Donald Trump’s Presidential Win Sends Crypto Markets Surging, But Australians Remain Divided on His Impact Donald Trump’s return to the White House has triggered a massive rally in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin soaring over 40% since his election on Nov. 5. However, while global markets embrace his pro-crypto stance, a recent survey suggests Australians are not as convinced about his positive influence on the industry. According to a survey conducted by Australian cryptocurrency exchange Independent Reserve, only 31% of Australians believe Trump is good for the crypto sector, while 8% say he is bad for it. A significant 60% of respondents remained neutral, suggesting a lack of strong sentiment on his policies or their potential effects on digital assets. However, the survey revealed a stark contrast between crypto investors and non-investors in their perceptions of Trump. Among those who actively invest in cryptocurrency, 50% viewed Trump favorably regarding his impact on the industry, while 44% remained neutral and only 6% had a negative outlook. In contrast, only 20% of non-crypto investors saw Trump as a positive influence, while 10% expressed negative views. This suggests that those with financial exposure to the crypto market are more optimistic about the regulatory and economic changes his administration may bring. The survey found that the most committed crypto investors—those investing AU$10,000 ($6,400) per month—had no negative views on Trump , further showing the belief that his policies will drive greater adoption and innovation in the sector. Independent Reserve CEO Adrian Przelozny attributes this optimism to Trump’s perceived pro-crypto stance. “There is widespread anticipation that his pro-crypto policies will foster innovation and broader adoption of digital assets,” he said. The findings of the Independent Reserve survey align with a separate YouGov poll commissioned by Swyftx, which revealed that 59% of Australian crypto investors are more likely to vote for a pro-crypto candidate in the upcoming federal election. With an estimated 2 million Australians holding digital assets, this emerging voting bloc could play a decisive role in the country’s political landscape. Australia’s federal election, set to take place by May 17, is expected to be tightly contested between the ruling center-left Labor government and the center-right opposition. The political discourse surrounding cryptocurrency regulation is heating up, with both sides making promises to address the industry’s growing concerns. Challenges Facing the Australian Crypto Industry Despite growing adoption, the Australian cryptocurrency industry still faces hurdles. Independent Reserve reported that nearly 20% of survey respondents experienced restrictions from their banks when attempting to buy crypto or faced delays in processing payments to exchanges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a major concern. While the Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, concluded a consultation on a crypto framework in late 2023, there is no clear timeline for legislation. This lack of regulatory clarity has been criticized by the opposition, with Shadow Assistant Treasurer Luke Howarth stating that the Labor government has “left much-needed regulation in the bottom drawer.” “If we are fortunate enough to form [a] government, the [center-right] Coalition will work quickly to put in place fit-for-purpose regulation which keeps Australia up with the rest of the world and provides much-needed regulatory certainty,” Howarth added. Australia’s crypto adoption has reached an all-time high since Independent Reserve began conducting its annual survey in 2019. Nearly one-third of respondents now report that they own or have previously owned digital assets, marking a 16 percentage point increase in six years. However, for the industry to thrive, policymakers will need to address the regulatory ambiguity and banking challenges that investors continue to face. With Trump’s pro-crypto stance influencing global markets, and Australia’s own elections approaching, the country finds itself at a crossroads in shaping the future of its digital asset sector. Trump’s Push for Fort Knox Gold Audit Sparks Surge in Prediction Markets In other Trump news, the likelihood of a long-awaited audit of the Fort Knox gold reserves by May 2025 has surged dramatically on cryptocurrency-based prediction markets following the US President’s confirmation of his administration’s intent to conduct the review. During a flight to Washington on Feb. 19, Trump made a public statement confirming that his administration is planning an official visit to the Fort Knox vaults to verify the presence and quantity of gold reserves. His remarks, reported by the Associated Press, have reignited interest in a subject that has long been debated by financial analysts, libertarians, and crypto enthusiasts alike. “We’re going to go into Fort Knox to make sure the gold is there,” Trump declared. His statement reaffirmed an initiative that initially gained traction through the libertarian financial blog ZeroHedge, later supported by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Trump’s statement had an immediate impact on prediction markets, particularly on the cryptocurrency-based betting platform Polymarket. Since Polymarket listed its Fort Knox-related markets on Feb. 17, speculation over the audit has intensified. Following Trump’s announcement, the odds of an audit occurring before May 2025 surged past 70%, climbing from 55% just a day earlier. In addition to speculation about whether the audit will occur, another Polymarket market is focused on whether missing gold reserves will be uncovered. At present, the market assigns a 17% probability that the audit will reveal discrepancies in Fort Knox’s gold holdings. Kalshi, another prediction market platform, is reportedly preparing to launch its own Fort Knox-related betting markets. The last time an official audit of Fort Knox’s gold reserves took place was in 1974, meaning that for nearly five decades, the true status of the nation’s gold holdings has remained largely unknown to the public. Concerns about the integrity of the reserves have fueled conspiracy theories and calls for greater transparency. Trump’s latest remarks appear to mark his first public statement on Fort Knox’s reserves since being sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Jan. 20. While he did not explicitly mention concerns over potential missing gold, his tone suggested that his administration is taking the matter seriously. “If the gold isn’t there, we’re going to be very upset,” Trump warned. He further expressed hope that “everything is fine with Fort Knox,” avoiding direct speculation but indicating that a discovery of missing assets could have significant repercussions. Trump’s push for an audit has been met with enthusiastic support from the cryptocurrency community, which has long argued that Bitcoin offers a more transparent and verifiable alternative to gold. Unlike gold reserves, Bitcoin holdings can be audited in real-time via its blockchain, eliminating concerns about potential manipulation or fraud. Many crypto analysts view the audit initiative as an indirect endorsement of Bitcoin’s strengths. If the audit were to uncover discrepancies or a lack of transparency in Fort Knox’s reserves, it could further reinforce Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized and tamper-proof asset class. Regulatory and Political Implications With the federal government grappling with inflation concerns and economic uncertainty, an audit of the nation’s gold reserves could be seen as an effort to restore confidence in America’s financial stability. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a known advocate for financial transparency and digital assets, has also voiced support for the audit. She believes that verifying the nation’s gold holdings is crucial in shaping future economic policies and addressing inflation-related concerns. Meanwhile, opposition voices are questioning whether Trump’s push for an audit is a political maneuver or a genuine attempt to ensure economic accountability. Critics argue that the audit could be used to shift attention away from other pressing economic issues and serve as a tool for political posturing. As speculation continues to mount, all eyes will be on whether the audit actually takes place and what its findings might reveal. If the reserves are fully intact, it could put to rest decades of speculation. However, if discrepancies are found, it could have far-reaching implications for US financial policy and the global economy. With Polymarket odds now reflecting a strong likelihood of an audit occurring before May 2025, and additional betting markets poised to launch, the coming months will likely see heightened discussions around gold, inflation, and the future of financial transparency in the United States. For now, Trump’s commitment to auditing Fort Knox has injected fresh energy into financial and crypto communities alike, as they await further details on what could be one of the most significant gold reserve audits in modern history.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-21 06:00:00

Scammers can easily steal money from unwary investors as AI-powered scams are getting harder to identify. Fraudsters are using AI technology to develop increasingly realistic phishing attacks, deepfake movies, and automated trading bots that are intended to deceive customers. How AI Is Being Used in Crypto Scams AI enables many more ways of scamming, making scammers more efficient and nearly untraceable: among the most common scams enabled by AI are: Deepfake Scams – AI-generated videos and voice recordings make it look as if someone the public knows, like their chief executive officer, is going along and endorsing an imaginary scheme. Phishing Attacks – Bot-generated e-mails and websites create an illusion to users as if real, tricking them into trading their private keys or passwords. Fake Trading Bots – These represent AI bots claiming to be giving higher returns, only to pillage user deposits. Rug Pull Schemes – Crafted stunningly believable whitepapers and marketing collateral to lure investors into fake crypto projects. Automated Scam Calls and Texts – AI-generated text and voice messages can lure people to send money or to share personal information. Real-World Examples of AI Crypto Scams AI-powered scams have already cost investors millions of dollars. Here are a few notable examples: Scam Type Description Impact Deepfake CEO Fraud Scammers used AI to mimic a CEO’s voice, tricking employees into sending funds. $35 million lost AI Phishing Emails Emails generated by AI convinced investors to enter private keys on fake sites. Thousands lost daily Fake Trading Bots Users deposited funds into AI-powered bots that never actually traded. Millions stolen Why AI Makes Crypto Scams More Dangerous AI allows scammers to personalize attacks, making them more believable. Traditional phishing scams often contain errors that alert users to potential fraud. However, AI-generated messages are grammatically perfect and tailored to the victim’s interests. This makes it much harder to identify scams before falling victim to them. Deepfake technology is another major concern. Scammers can create realistic videos of well-known figures promoting fake crypto projects. Even experienced investors may struggle to distinguish between real and fake endorsements. Automated AI bots are also a growing threat. The bots can flood social media platforms with fake reviews and complimentary remarks about alleged crypto scams and make it complicated for users to differentiate between real and scam. How to Protect Yourself from AI-Powered Crypto Scams It is true that even today, with ever-increasing sophistication, there are some ways to keep crypto assets secure. Follow certain guidelines that ensure maximum safety for your crypto assets: Source Verification – Always check the authenticity of messages, emails, or social media posts before taking any action. Never Click on Suspicious Links – It is best not to click on links sent or listed by an unknown source, especially those asking for personal or financial information. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) – Insetting 2FA on all crypto exchanges and wallets secures an additional layer. Check Official Websites – Always verify project details from the official website instead of trusting social media posts or emails. Be Skeptical of High Returns – If an investment sounds too good to be true, it likely is. Research Before Investing – Look up reviews, whitepapers, and community discussions before putting money into any project. Use Reputable Exchanges – Stick to well-known and regulated crypto exchanges to reduce the risk of fraud. The Future of AI and Crypto Security Scams will become smarter with the advancement of AI technology. However, AI can also be used in good ways. For instance, blockchain companies are now working on developing an AI-powered toolbox for fraud detection. This tool will track suspicious transactions while a human could verify identity through AI to prevent identity theft. It is being ensured that governments and regulatory bodies share this vision. There will be stricter policies and stricter security measures in place to guard investors against these emerging threats. AI has become a greater threat to crypto scams and harder to detect as well. Such scams must be taken very seriously by investors. With the use of AI, scammer frauds become convincing frauds; verifying all the info will help avoid such losses.",Reviews|Crypto Scams|Deepfake Scams|Growing|Rug Pull,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-02-21 06:04:21

While Layer 2 solutions, like the Lightning Network, improve speed and scalability, the base layer, or Layer 1, offers security and decentralization. However, Layer 3 has emerged as a result of conversations over the future of Bitcoin. However, what is Layer 3 and how does it advance current technology? Understanding Bitcoin’s Layered Architecture Bitcoin operates on a layered structure to handle different aspects of its network. Here is a breakdown of the layers: Layer Function Example Layer 1 Main blockchain for security and transactions Bitcoin blockchain Layer 2 Enhances scalability and transaction speed Lightning Network Layer 3 Adds applications and smart contract capabilities Emerging projects Each layer builds on the previous one, solving specific challenges while maintaining Bitcoin’s decentralized nature. The Role of the Lightning Network (Layer 2) The Lightning Network was introduced to address Bitcoin’s scalability problem. It enables off-chain transactions, reducing congestion on the main blockchain. With Lightning, users can conduct microtransactions with minimal fees and almost instant confirmation times. However, it has some limitations: Setting up payment channels can be complex. Liquidity constraints can lead to failed transactions. Privacy concerns exist since transactions can be traced through certain nodes. Because of these limitations, a number of discussions have arisen over a new layer to scale up functionality further. What is Bitcoin’s Layer 3? It’s a new concept: another enhancement in functionality for Bitcoin that will not cost much regarding security and decentralization. Precisely, it would focus on: Smart contracts : allowing programmable transactions just like in Ethereum; Scalability enhancements: regarding efficiency in application operations running atop Bitcoin; Interoperability : including the ability of Bitcoin to function with other blockchains and financial systems. Privacy and Security : Providing stronger encryption methods for transactions. While Layer 3 is still in development, it could significantly expand Bitcoin’s use cases beyond simple payments. Potential Use Cases of Layer 3 If successfully implemented, Layer 3 could open up various possibilities, including: Use Case Description Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Creating lending, borrowing, and yield farming on Bitcoin NFTs on Bitcoin Enabling the creation and transfer of digital assets Gaming and Metaverse Supporting Bitcoin-based in-game economies Cross-Chain Transactions Allowing seamless transfers between Bitcoin and other blockchains Privacy Solutions Improving transaction confidentiality beyond current levels These applications could make Bitcoin more than just a store of value, turning it into a fully functional ecosystem. Projects Exploring Layer 3 Solutions Several projects and developers are already working on Layer 3 solutions. Some of the key initiatives include: RGB Protocol : A smart contract system designed for Bitcoin and Lightning Network. Taro : A protocol that enables the issuance of assets on Bitcoin. OmniBOLT : A platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Lightning Network. While these are early-stage projects, they highlight the potential of Layer 3 in transforming Bitcoin’s capabilities. Challenges and Considerations Despite its potential, Layer 3 faces several challenges: Security Risks : Adding more layers increases the attack surface. Decentralization Concerns : Some solutions might introduce centralization points. Adoption and Development : Without widespread adoption, Layer 3 may struggle to gain traction. Regulatory Issues : Governments may impose stricter regulations on advanced Bitcoin functionalities. Only when these challenges are overcome, will success be realized for Layer 3. Layer 3, in the evolution of Bitcoin, will go further by integrating smart contracts into the network to ensure scalability and interoperability. Though still very much in their infancy, this might unlock many new use cases beyond Bitcoin’s currently narrow function as digital gold. In constant development, Layer 3 could be Bitcoin’s future and, to a broader degree, realign how bitcoin will fit within the global monetary system.",Reviews|LIGHTNING NETWORK,EN,0,0,BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-02-21 06:04:48

This week’s expiry event is smaller than last week’s and one of the tiniest of the year, which means there will be virtually no impact on spot markets, which have been range-bound for most of the week. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.75, meaning that there are slightly more call (long) contracts expiring than puts (shorts). Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, still remains highest at the $120,000 strike price, which is $1.8 billion, according to Deribit. There is also around $1.2 billion in OI at the $110,000 strike price, as derivatives traders continue to speculate that BTC prices will rise in the longer term. Earlier this week, crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said sentiment was “cautiously bearish,” with low volatility frustrating traders. “Next week’s options priced at 40% volatility again with front-month contracts falling below, indicating potential market weakness,” it added. Deribit concurred in its weekly Insights report, stating, “Strong directional sentiment in derivatives markets has waned in response to the largely sideways moves in spot [markets] over the last two weeks.” Funding rates for both majors, BTC and ETH, remain close to zero after Ether saw a strong negative spike earlier in the month, it reported before adding that volatility in Ethereum retains a premium over Bitcoin. Bitcoin OI by expiry. Source: Deribit Around 153,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring today, with a notional value of $420 million and a put/call ratio of 0.48. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $2 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Markets have shown minor gains towards the end of the week, with total capitalization reaching $3.35 trillion. However, zooming out, they still remain at the lower bounds of a three-month sideways trading channel. Bitcoin hit an intraday and two-week high of $98,750 during early trading in Asia on Friday morning. However, it faced resistance there, as it has done twice before, and pulled back slightly at the time of writing. Ethereum has been a little choppier over the past 24 hours, spiking to $2,767 before pulling back to $2,744 at the time of writing. ETH has been trading sideways since it dumped below $3,000 in early February. The altcoins were generally in the green this Friday morning, with larger gains for Solana , Sui, Avalanche, and Litecoin as ETF hope grows.
