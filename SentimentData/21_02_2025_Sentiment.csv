Among the heavy hitters, three projects stand out: Qubetics, Polkadot, and Astra. Each one brings its own unique value proposition to the table, from blockchain interoperability and high scalability to seamless cross-chain transactions. With digital finance gaining rapid traction, these projects have the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems while offering massive growth opportunities for early adopters. While Polkadot has established itself as a formidable force in the blockchain interoperability arena, Astra is catching the attention of investors with its focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized applications (dApps). However, it’s Qubetics that seems poised to take the industry by storm. With an innovative non-custodial multi-chain wallet and a groundbreaking partnership with 1inch, Qubetics is making waves in the decentralized finance ecosystem. This article will dive deep into each of these projects, exploring how they work and why they may just be the best cryptos to invest in today for exponential returns. Qubetics, in particular, offers real-world solutions that its predecessors—such as Polkadot and Astra—have yet to fully address. By combining the best features of blockchain technology with cutting-edge wallet solutions, Qubetics has positioned itself as a leader in the DeFi space. Whether you’re a business, professional, or individual, Qubetics is creating a platform where the barriers to seamless blockchain transactions are broken down, and users can unlock the full potential of their digital assets. Qubetics: Leading the Charge in Blockchain Innovation When it comes to the best cryptos to invest in today for exponential return potential, Qubetics ($TICS) should be at the top of your list. The project is revolutionizing the blockchain and digital finance landscape with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet , strategic partnerships, and advanced transaction capabilities. Currently in its 22nd presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $13.4 million and sold more than 481 million tokens to over 20,600 holders. The ongoing presale offers tokens at $0.08073 each, with projections indicating massive returns—up to 18,480% after the mainnet launch. One of the standout features of Qubetics is its non-custodial multi-chain wallet. This wallet offers users an unmatched level of security and flexibility, allowing them to manage multiple cryptocurrencies across different blockchains in a single, easy-to-use interface. By integrating cross-chain functionality, the Qubetics wallet ensures that users can seamlessly swap assets without the need for intermediaries. This opens up a world of possibilities for businesses and individuals alike, making it a valuable tool for anyone involved in the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance. Qubetics’ partnership with SWFT Blockchain is also a game-changer. Together, they are introducing next-gen wallet innovation that brings lightning-fast transactions across multiple blockchains.

40609952,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132182,1740093380,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exclusive: Kraken’s Ambitious $5 Billion Play to Dominate Crypto Options Market with Deribit Acquisition?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/kraken-deribit-acquisition-talks/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The rumor mill is buzzing, and it’s a big one. Whispers of a potential mega-deal are circulating, suggesting that crypto giant Kraken Exchange might be in serious talks to acquire Deribit, a leading cryptocurrency options exchange. Despite some reports suggesting the deal was off the table, CoinDesk has reported that discussions are still ongoing. Could this be a game-changer for the crypto options market ? Let’s dive into what we know. Is a Kraken – Deribit Deal Really on the Cards? Unveiling the Crypto Exchange Acquisition Buzz The crypto world is no stranger to acquisitions, but a potential merger of this magnitude is noteworthy. According to reports from CoinDesk and Bloomberg, Kraken is indeed engaging with Deribit for a possible acquisition. Deribit, known for its robust crypto options trading platform, is also reportedly working with FT Partners to evaluate bids, with a staggering valuation of $4 billion to $5 billion, or even higher, being floated. Adding fuel to the fire, a second source has indicated that Coinbase Exchange, another major player in the crypto space, has also expressed interest in acquiring Deribit. Imagine the implications! While Kraken and Deribit have remained tight-lipped, declining to comment, and Coinbase has yet to respond, the silence itself speaks volumes. Why is Deribit a Prize Catch in the Crypto Options Market? Deribit has carved a niche for itself as a premier platform for crypto options trading . But what makes it so attractive to giants like Kraken and Coinbase? Here’s a quick rundown: Market Leader in Options: Deribit is arguably the leading exchange for crypto options, commanding a significant share of the market. Acquiring Deribit instantly grants a dominant position in this lucrative segment. Sophisticated Platform: Deribit boasts a sophisticated trading platform with advanced features and a wide array of options contracts, appealing to professional traders and institutions. Institutional Appeal: As institutional interest in crypto derivatives grows, Deribit’s established platform and reputation make it a highly desirable asset for exchanges looking to cater to this burgeoning market segment. High Trading Volume: Deribit consistently demonstrates high trading volumes, indicating strong user engagement and platform utility. Kraken Exchange Eyeing Expansion: What’s the Strategic Rationale Behind a Deribit Acquisition? For Kraken, acquiring Deribit would be a strategic masterstroke, significantly bolstering its position in the competitive crypto exchange landscape. Let’s consider the potential benefits for Kraken Exchange : Benefit Description Instant Options Market Dominance Acquiring Deribit would catapult Kraken into a leading position in the crypto options market overnight, a segment where it currently has a less prominent presence. Diversification of Revenue Streams Options trading generates significant revenue through trading fees. Adding Deribit’s platform would diversify Kraken’s revenue streams beyond spot trading and futures. Attracting Institutional Investors Deribit’s institutional-grade platform would enhance Kraken’s appeal to institutional investors seeking sophisticated crypto derivatives products. Competitive Edge Against Rivals In a fiercely competitive market, acquiring Deribit would give Kraken a significant competitive advantage against rivals like Coinbase and Binance, particularly in the derivatives space. Coinbase Exchange’s Interest: A Battle for Crypto Options Supremacy? The reported interest from Coinbase Exchange adds another layer of intrigue to this potential acquisition saga. Coinbase, known for its user-friendly platform and strong retail base, is also clearly eyeing the lucrative crypto options market. If Coinbase were to enter the bidding, it could trigger a competitive battle, potentially driving up Deribit’s valuation even further. Coinbase’s motivation might stem from a desire to expand its product offerings and capture a larger share of the derivatives market. Acquiring Deribit would provide Coinbase with a ready-made, highly respected options platform, accelerating its entry into this complex but profitable market segment. Challenges and Considerations in a Crypto Exchange Acquisition of This Scale While the potential benefits are substantial, a Deribit acquisition , particularly at a valuation of $4-5 billion, is not without its challenges and considerations: Regulatory Hurdles: Crypto acquisitions are increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny. Both Kraken and Deribit would need to navigate complex regulatory landscapes to secure approvals for such a deal. Integration Complexities: Integrating two large and complex platforms like Kraken and Deribit would be a significant undertaking, requiring careful planning and execution to ensure a smooth transition and avoid disruptions. Valuation Justification: A $4-5 billion valuation is hefty, even in the crypto world. The acquiring exchange would need to justify this valuation based on projected revenue growth and synergies. Market Volatility: The crypto market is known for its volatility. Market downturns could impact the perceived value of the acquisition and the performance of the combined entity. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for Crypto Traders and Investors? For crypto traders and investors, the potential acquisition of Deribit by Kraken (or Coinbase) could have several implications: Expanded Options Trading Access: If Kraken acquires Deribit, users of Kraken may gain access to Deribit’s extensive suite of crypto options products directly through the Kraken platform. Platform Enhancements: Integration of Deribit’s technology could lead to enhanced options trading features and functionalities on the acquiring exchange’s platform. Increased Market Liquidity: A combined entity could potentially lead to increased liquidity in the crypto options market, benefiting traders with tighter spreads and better execution. Potential for New Products: The acquisition could pave the way for the development of innovative new crypto derivatives products and services. The Future of Crypto Options Trading: A Bold Move or a Risky Bet? The potential crypto exchange acquisition of Deribit by Kraken, or the interest from Coinbase, signals a significant maturation of the crypto market and a growing focus on derivatives, particularly options. Whether this deal materializes remains to be seen, but the very fact that these discussions are taking place underscores the immense value and potential of the crypto options market. A successful acquisition could reshape the competitive landscape and further propel the growth of crypto derivatives trading. Keep a close watch on this developing story – it could be a pivotal moment for the future of crypto trading.

Bybit, a leading cryptocurrency exchange, has just announced the upcoming launch of the AVL/USDT perpetual contract. This exciting news, first reported by BWE News Telegram channel, signals a significant expansion in trading opportunities for Avalanche (AVL) enthusiasts and the broader crypto community. Are you prepared to explore the potential of AVL/USDT perpetual contract trading on Bybit? What is the Buzz About the AVL/USDT Perpetual Contract on Bybit? The introduction of the AVL/USDT perpetual contract on Bybit is more than just another listing. It represents a strategic move by the exchange to cater to the growing demand for diverse trading instruments and to further solidify its position in the competitive crypto derivatives market. For traders, this means access to a new avenue for participating in the Avalanche ecosystem, leveraging its price movements against the stability of USDT. Let’s break down what makes this launch noteworthy: Perpetual Contracts: Unlike traditional futures contracts with expiry dates, perpetual contracts, like the new AVL/USDT perpetual contract , allow traders to hold positions indefinitely. This feature is particularly attractive for those looking to capitalize on long-term trends or engage in continuous trading strategies. Avalanche (AVL): Avalanche is a high-performance, scalable, and customizable blockchain platform known for its speed and low transaction fees. Trading AVL against USDT opens doors to speculate on the growth and adoption of this innovative blockchain. USDT (Tether): Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, providing a stable base currency for trading. Pairing AVL with USDT allows traders to easily measure and manage their positions in a familiar fiat-equivalent currency. Bybit Exchange: Bybit is renowned for its robust trading platform, user-friendly interface, and a wide range of crypto derivatives products. Launching the AVL/USDT perpetual contract on Bybit ensures traders will have access to reliable infrastructure and advanced trading tools. Why Trade AVL/USDT Perpetual Contract? Unlocking the Potential So, why should traders be excited about the AVL/USDT perpetual contract ? The answer lies in the unique benefits it brings to the table: Leverage Opportunities: Perpetual contracts inherently offer leverage, allowing traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital. This can amplify both potential profits and losses. For those experienced in leverage trading , the AVL/USDT pair on Bybit presents a fresh opportunity to apply their skills. Hedging Strategies: The AVL/USDT perpetual contract can be used as a hedging instrument. For instance, if you hold AVL in your portfolio, you could open a short position on the perpetual contract to mitigate potential price downturns in the spot market. 24/7 Trading: The cryptocurrency market operates around the clock. Perpetual contracts enable you to trade AVL/USDT anytime, capitalizing on market movements whenever they occur, regardless of traditional market hours. Price Discovery: The perpetual contract market contributes to price discovery for Avalanche. Increased trading activity and liquidity in the AVL/USDT perpetual contract can lead to more efficient and accurate price reflection for AVL. Diversification of Trading Portfolio: Adding the AVL/USDT perpetual contract to your trading portfolio diversifies your exposure within the crypto market. This can potentially reduce overall risk by spreading investments across different assets. Navigating the Terrain: Challenges and Considerations in Avalanche Trading While the AVL/USDT perpetual contract offers exciting prospects, it’s crucial to acknowledge the associated challenges and trade responsibly: Volatility: The cryptocurrency market, including Avalanche, is known for its volatility. Price swings can be significant and rapid. Traders engaging in Avalanche trading , especially with leverage, must be prepared for potential market fluctuations. Liquidation Risk: Leverage trading amplifies both gains and losses. If the market moves against your position, there’s a risk of liquidation, where your position is automatically closed to prevent further losses. Understanding and managing liquidation risk is paramount when trading perpetual contracts. Funding Rates: Perpetual contracts employ a mechanism called funding rates to keep the contract price anchored to the spot market price. Traders need to be aware of funding rates, as they can either pay or receive funding depending on market conditions and their position (long or short). Market Research: Successful Avalanche trading requires thorough market research and analysis. Understanding Avalanche’s fundamentals, technical indicators, and market sentiment is crucial for making informed trading decisions. Platform Familiarity: Before diving into trading the AVL/USDT perpetual contract , it’s essential to familiarize yourself with the Bybit platform, its trading tools, and risk management features. Practice trading in a demo account can be beneficial for beginners. Actionable Insights: How to Prepare for AVL/USDT Perpetual Contract Trading Ready to take advantage of the AVL/USDT perpetual contract launch on Bybit? Here are some actionable insights to help you prepare: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on Bybit’s official announcements for the exact launch date and time of the AVL/USDT perpetual contract . Follow BWE News and other reputable crypto news sources for updates. Research Avalanche: Deepen your understanding of Avalanche, its technology, ecosystem, and potential growth drivers. This knowledge will be invaluable in making informed trading decisions for Avalanche trading . Learn Perpetual Contract Trading: If you’re new to perpetual contracts or leverage trading , take the time to educate yourself. Numerous resources are available online, including Bybit’s own educational materials. Develop a Trading Strategy: Don’t trade impulsively. Develop a well-defined trading strategy that outlines your entry and exit points, risk management rules, and position sizing for the AVL/USDT perpetual contract . Start Small: When you begin trading the AVL/USDT perpetual contract , start with smaller positions to get comfortable with the market dynamics and the platform. Gradually increase your position size as you gain experience and confidence. Conclusion: Embrace the Future of Avalanche Trading on Bybit The launch of the AVL/USDT perpetual contract on Bybit marks an exciting step forward for both Avalanche and the broader crypto trading community. It opens up new avenues for traders to engage with AVL, leveraging its potential through perpetual contracts.

This borrowed capital is secured by the trader’s existing assets, known as margin. Margin trading can amplify both profits and losses, making it a powerful tool that requires careful risk management. Cross Margin vs. Isolated Margin: Key Differences Binance offers two types of margin trading modes: Feature Cross Margin Isolated Margin Margin Pool Shares margin across all cross margin positions. Margin is allocated to individual trading pairs. Liquidation Risk All cross margin positions can be liquidated if the total margin level falls below the maintenance margin level. Only the isolated margin position is at risk of liquidation. Other positions are unaffected. Risk Management Potentially higher risk if multiple positions are held, but can be more capital-efficient if managed well. Lower risk per individual trade, easier to manage risk per position. Use Case Suitable for traders who hedge positions or have a diversified portfolio and want to optimize capital utilization. Suitable for traders who want to limit risk to a specific trade and have more control over individual position risk. For KAITO traders, this means they can choose the margin mode that best suits their trading strategy and risk tolerance. Whether you prefer the capital efficiency of cross margin or the controlled risk of isolated margin, Binance provides the tools to trade KAITO on margin.

Speaking at CPAC in Washington D.C., Saylor advised the U.S. government to purchase 20% of Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) supply for the much-anticipated national strategic reserve. “There’s only room for one nation-state to buy 20% of the Bitcoin network,” Saylor said, adding that he “thinks it should be and will be the United States.” U.S. authorities would have to buy 3.9 million Bitcoin in addition to its current 207,000 BTC trove to realize Saylor’s vision. That endeavor would cost $392 billion at today’s prices. You might also like: Strategy misses weekly Bitcoin scoop for the second time The U.S. Senate is considering a more conservative approach.

At CPAC, Saylor reiterated that the U.S. must be the nation to capture 20% of the Bitcoin network: “It’s a way for us to enrich ourselves and emerge as a creditor nation in a matter of a decade. It’s also a way for us to ensure we’re the economic leaders in cyberspace for the next 100 years.” Saylor explained that U.S. adoption of BTC will drive a sovereign rush for the asset among both allies and rivals alike.

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, safeguarding your assets is paramount. Imagine trading spot and derivatives with the peace of mind that your funds are held in ultra-secure custody, away from exchange-related risks. This is now a reality for Deribit traders thanks to a groundbreaking partnership between crypto custody giants BitGo and Copper. Let’s dive into how this collaboration is revolutionizing crypto custody and settlement for institutional and sophisticated traders. What is Driving the Demand for Enhanced Crypto Custody Solutions? The cryptocurrency market, while brimming with opportunities, also presents unique security challenges. Exchange hacks, regulatory uncertainties, and the inherent risks of holding large sums of digital assets on exchanges are constant concerns. For institutional investors and professional traders, these risks are amplified. They require robust, institutional-grade crypto custody solutions that go beyond the standard exchange offerings. This demand has spurred innovation in the custody space, leading to solutions like the BitGo and Copper partnership with Deribit. Consider these key factors driving the need for advanced custody: Security Breaches: History is replete with examples of cryptocurrency exchange hacks resulting in significant losses. Off-exchange custody mitigates this risk by keeping assets away from potential exchange vulnerabilities. Regulatory Compliance: Institutional investors often face stringent regulatory requirements regarding asset custody. Independent, regulated custodians like BitGo Trust are essential for meeting these obligations. Counterparty Risk Reduction: Relying solely on an exchange for custody exposes traders to counterparty risk. Dedicated custody solutions diversify this risk. Operational Efficiency: While security is crucial, efficiency in trading and settlement is equally important. Solutions that offer both security and seamless operations are highly sought after. BitGo and Copper: A Powerhouse Partnership for Secure Settlement BitGo and Copper are joining forces to enhance crypto security for Deribit traders. Enter BitGo and Copper, two leading names in the crypto custody space, joining forces to address these very concerns for Deribit users. BitGo, known for its institutional-grade custody solutions, and Copper, with its innovative ClearLoop network, are providing an off-exchange settlement solution that promises to enhance both security and efficiency. This partnership allows Deribit traders to: Trade on Deribit: Access Deribit’s extensive suite of spot and derivatives products. Maintain Secure Custody: Keep their assets securely held with BitGo Trust or within Copper’s ClearLoop network, rather than directly on the exchange. Instant Settlement: Benefit from near-instantaneous trade settlement without the delays and complexities of on-chain transactions. Understanding Secure Settlement: How Does it Work? The core of this innovation lies in the concept of secure settlement . Traditional exchange trading often requires pre-funding accounts, meaning assets are held on the exchange before trading even begins. This model, while convenient, introduces custody risks. Secure settlement , particularly in the off-exchange context, aims to decouple trading from custody. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how BitGo and Copper’s secure settlement solution works for Deribit traders: Custody Setup: Traders establish accounts with either BitGo Trust or utilize Copper’s ClearLoop network to securely hold their cryptocurrency assets. Trading on Deribit: Traders execute trades on the Deribit exchange as usual. Off-Exchange Settlement: Instead of assets moving on-chain for each trade settlement, the ClearLoop network (by Copper) facilitates instant, off-exchange settlement. This is achieved through a secure messaging and settlement infrastructure that updates balances in custody accounts in real-time. Asset Security: Throughout the trading process, the underlying assets remain in the secure custody of BitGo Trust or within the Copper ecosystem, minimizing exchange-related risks. This process significantly reduces the need to move assets on-chain for every trade, leading to faster settlement times and lower transaction costs, while maintaining a high level of security. The Benefits of BitGo and Copper’s Secure Settlement for Deribit Traders The collaboration between BitGo and Copper brings a multitude of benefits to Deribit traders, particularly those who prioritize security and efficiency: Benefit Description Enhanced Security Assets are held in regulated, institutional-grade custody solutions (BitGo Trust or Copper), significantly reducing exchange counterparty risk and vulnerability to exchange hacks. Instant Settlement Trades are settled almost instantaneously via Copper’s ClearLoop network, eliminating settlement delays associated with traditional on-chain transactions. Improved Capital Efficiency Faster settlement cycles can improve capital efficiency, allowing traders to redeploy capital more quickly. Reduced Transaction Costs Off-exchange settlement minimizes on-chain transaction fees, potentially lowering overall trading costs. Institutional-Grade Solution The partnership provides an institutional-grade custody and settlement framework, appealing to professional traders and institutions. Deribit Exchange: A Prime Platform for Advanced Crypto Trading Deribit is a leading Deribit exchange specializing in cryptocurrency derivatives trading, particularly options and futures. It has become a go-to platform for sophisticated traders seeking to manage risk, speculate on price movements, and access advanced trading instruments in the crypto market. Deribit’s focus on derivatives makes it a platform where security and efficient settlement are particularly critical, given the complex strategies often employed by its users. The integration with BitGo and Copper further solidifies Deribit’s commitment to providing a secure and robust trading environment. Navigating the Future of Crypto Trading with Secure Solutions As the cryptocurrency market matures and attracts greater institutional participation, the demand for secure and efficient trading infrastructure will only intensify. Solutions like the BitGo and Copper secure settlement offering for Deribit are at the forefront of this evolution. They represent a significant step towards bridging the gap between the innovative world of crypto trading and the stringent security and operational requirements of institutional finance. By prioritizing security without compromising on trading efficiency, this partnership sets a new standard for how cryptocurrency exchanges and custody providers can collaborate to build a more robust and trustworthy ecosystem. This initiative is more than just a technological upgrade; it’s a strategic move towards fostering greater confidence and wider adoption of cryptocurrency trading, especially among institutional players who are increasingly interested in the digital asset space but remain cautious about security risks. The ability to trade on a leading platform like Deribit while leveraging the robust crypto custody services of BitGo and the innovative settlement technology of Copper offers a compelling value proposition in today’s market. In conclusion, the partnership between BitGo, Copper, and Deribit marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of secure settlement in the cryptocurrency market. By combining institutional-grade custody with seamless off-exchange settlement, they are not only enhancing security and efficiency for Deribit traders but also paving the way for a more secure and mature crypto trading landscape. This is a development that should be welcomed by anyone serious about the long-term growth and stability of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto experts predict that sub-$0.001 coins with strong ecosystems and real-world utility, like BeerBear, could see significant growth in 2025. Table of Contents The market landscape for sub-$0.001 coins What sets BeerBear apart? Conclusion The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, with investors and analysts looking for the next high-potential project. Low-cap and sub-$0.001 tokens often generate interest due to their accessibility and potential for growth. As 2025 progresses, experts are evaluating the prospects of emerging tokens, particularly those with structured ecosystems, utility-driven mechanics, and transparent growth models. Among these, BeerBear is gaining attention as a project with unique engagement features and a structured presale model that sets it apart. The market landscape for sub-$0.001 coins Historically, low-cap cryptocurrencies have been attractive to early adopters looking for high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu started with low valuations before gaining mainstream popularity through community engagement and viral marketing. However, market conditions have changed, and projects now require more than just hype to sustain long-term growth. Industry analysts suggest that in 2025, successful sub-$0.001 coins will need to offer more than just speculative value. Ecosystem development, real-world use cases, and strong community support are expected to be key factors in determining which tokens stand out. While some projects rely solely on meme culture, others, like BeerBear, introduce additional developments. What sets BeerBear apart? BeerBear is structured around a play-to-earn gaming ecosystem that integrates blockchain technology to enhance user engagement. It provides interactive opportunities for users to participate in gameplay and earn rewards. The “Bar Brawl” beat ‘em up game allows players to earn in-game tokens and NFTs, adding an extra layer of utility to the ecosystem. Another major differentiator is BeerBear’s progressive pricing model. The token started its presale at $0.0004, with incremental increases planned until the final presale price of $0.0020. This structured approach provides transparency while rewarding early participants. Additionally, BeerBear’s Beer Points system incentivizes user participation by allowing accumulated points to be exchanged for in-game upgrades, NFTs, and community-driven perks. You might also like: Understanding the growth potential of a $0.0005 coin by March 2025 Security, transparency, and market viability Security remains a significant factor when evaluating low-cap tokens, as investors seek reassurance against potential risks. BeerBear has completed three independent security audits, reinforcing its credibility within the space. Many sub-$0.001 projects lack this level of verification, making BeerBear stand out as a project committed to transparency and reliability. Market experts highlight that in 2025, low-cap projects that emphasize clear governance structures and security measures will have a stronger chance of maintaining long-term viability. As regulatory scrutiny increases, projects with structured compliance and decentralized decision-making models will likely attract more sustained interest. Potential growth drivers in 2025 The continued expansion of play-to-earn gaming could be a key driver for BeerBear’s success. As blockchain gaming gains mainstream adoption, tokens with built-in gaming utilities may experience increased demand. Additionally, community engagement will be a crucial factor, as decentralized governance and token-based reward systems tend to create stronger retention rates among participants. Market conditions and external factors, such as broader cryptocurrency adoption and investor sentiment will also play a role. As the demand for interactive blockchain projects continues to grow, BeerBear’s combination of gaming and structured incentives positions it as a contender in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion As analysts assess the potential of sub-$0.001 coins in 2025, projects with clear value propositions and security measures stand out from purely speculative assets. BeerBear’s integration of play-to-earn gaming, progressive token distribution, and community-driven rewards make it a notable project within this category. While its long-term trajectory will depend on adoption and market trends, its structured approach and commitment to engagement set it apart from many low-cap tokens.

You’re not alone. Major players in the financial world are also watching closely, and their observations are quite telling. Recently, S&P Global Ratings, a leading credit rating agency, shed light on a significant roadblock: the murky waters of regulation. Let’s dive into why they believe stablecoin regulation is the linchpin for widespread adoption in the United States and what this means for the future of crypto. Why Stablecoin Regulation is the Key to US Adoption S&P Global Ratings has pinpointed a critical issue hindering the growth of stablecoins in the U.S. According to their recent analysis reported by CoinDesk, the absence of clear and comprehensive crypto regulation is the primary barrier preventing broader acceptance, especially among institutional investors. This isn’t just about playing by the rules; it’s about building trust and fostering an environment where large financial institutions feel comfortable entering the stablecoin space. Think of it like this: imagine building a house on shaky foundations. Would you feel secure? Probably not. Similarly, without a solid regulatory framework, institutions perceive stablecoins as too risky for large-scale integration into their operations. This hesitation is understandable given the potential for financial instability and lack of investor protection in unregulated markets. The Current Regulatory Landscape: A Barrier to US Stablecoin Adoption The current regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. is fragmented and, to put it mildly, unclear. This ambiguity creates significant challenges for US stablecoin adoption : Uncertainty for Issuers: Stablecoin issuers are unsure about which agencies have jurisdiction and what rules they need to comply with. This lack of clarity stifles innovation and investment. Risk Aversion from Institutions: Large financial institutions are generally risk-averse. Regulatory uncertainty amplifies perceived risks associated with stablecoins, making them less appealing for investment or integration into traditional financial systems. Limited Institutional Use Cases: Without regulatory clarity, the potential use cases for stablecoins in institutional settings remain limited. Areas like cross-border payments, treasury management, and decentralized finance (DeFi) integration are all held back. How Crypto Regulation Can Unlock Institutional Crypto Adoption S&P’s report isn’t all doom and gloom. In fact, it points towards a powerful catalyst for growth: regulation itself. The firm anticipates that once clear and comprehensive crypto regulation is established, stablecoin adoption will surge. This regulatory clarity will act as a green light for institutional investors, paving the way for significant market expansion. Here’s how effective regulation can transform the stablecoin landscape: Building Trust and Confidence: Clear rules and oversight will build trust in stablecoins as reliable digital assets. This trust is essential for attracting institutional capital. Encouraging Institutional Investment: Regulatory certainty reduces perceived risk, making stablecoins more attractive for institutional portfolios. Pension funds, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries could begin to allocate capital to regulated stablecoins. Expanding Use Cases: With a solid regulatory foundation, new and innovative use cases for stablecoins will emerge, particularly in areas like payments, remittances, and DeFi. Leveling the Playing Field: Fair and consistent regulation can create a level playing field for all stablecoin issuers, fostering healthy competition and innovation. The Reshaping of the Stablecoin Industry: A Shift Towards Regulation S&P predicts that the introduction of robust digital asset regulation will not only boost adoption but also reshape the stablecoin industry itself. We can expect to see a shift towards regulated stablecoins as users and institutions gravitate towards assets that offer greater security and compliance. This shift could lead to: Dominance of Regulated Stablecoins: Regulated stablecoins, issued by entities compliant with established frameworks, are likely to become the dominant force in the market. Increased Scrutiny on Unregulated Stablecoins: Unregulated or loosely regulated stablecoins may face increased scrutiny and potentially lose market share as users prioritize safety and compliance. Consolidation in the Market: The cost of compliance might lead to consolidation in the stablecoin market, with fewer, larger, and more regulated players emerging. Consider the potential impact on traditional finance. Imagine a future where large corporations use regulated stablecoins for instant global payments, or where DeFi protocols seamlessly integrate with traditional financial institutions through compliant stablecoin bridges. This future, while still developing, becomes significantly more plausible with the right regulatory framework. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? For crypto enthusiasts and investors, S&P’s analysis provides valuable insights: Stay Informed on Regulatory Developments: Keep a close watch on regulatory developments in the U.S. and globally. Changes in regulation will directly impact the stablecoin market. Focus on Regulated Stablecoins: As the market evolves, consider focusing on stablecoins that are operating within clear regulatory frameworks. These are likely to be more sustainable and trustworthy in the long run. Understand Institutional Adoption: Pay attention to signals of institutional adoption of stablecoins. Increased institutional involvement will be a strong indicator of market maturity and growth. Advocate for Sensible Regulation: Engage in discussions and advocate for sensible and balanced regulation that fosters innovation while protecting consumers and the financial system. Conclusion: Regulation as the Catalyst for Stablecoin Revolution S&P Global Ratings has delivered a clear message: stablecoin regulation is not just a hurdle to overcome but a crucial catalyst for unlocking the full potential of stablecoins in the U.S. The lack of clear rules is currently holding back US stablecoin adoption , particularly among institutions. However, the anticipation is palpable. Once effective crypto regulation is in place, we can expect a significant surge in adoption, reshaping the industry and opening doors for institutional crypto to flourish. The future of stablecoins in the U.S., and potentially globally, hinges on the evolution of digital asset regulation . It’s time for regulators to provide the clarity the market desperately needs to unleash the stablecoin revolution.

What started as internet jokes are now serious business. A groundbreaking report from Asia-based Web3 research firm, Tiger Research, has dropped a bombshell: memecoins have evolved from mere speculative assets into crucial players in the cryptocurrency arena. They’re not just a sideshow anymore; they’re fundamentally reshaping how exchanges operate and where liquidity flows. Let’s dive deep into this fascinating shift and explore what it means for the future of crypto trading . The Rise of Memecoins as Key Crypto Trading Assets Tiger Research’s latest report shines a spotlight on the undeniable ascent of memecoins . No longer relegated to the fringes of the crypto world, these digital tokens, often inspired by internet memes and viral trends, are now considered core trading assets. This isn’t just about fleeting hype; it’s a structural change impacting the very fabric of crypto markets . The report emphasizes that memecoins are now significant drivers of market liquidity . This means they are attracting substantial capital and trading volume, influencing price movements across the broader crypto ecosystem. Here’s a breakdown of the key takeaways: Liquidity Magnet: Memecoins are drawing in significant liquidity, impacting trading volumes on both decentralized and centralized exchanges. Market Structure Shift: Their rise is causing noticeable changes in market dynamics, influencing trading strategies and investment patterns. Beyond Speculation: Memecoins are moving beyond pure speculation, becoming integral to the functioning of crypto exchanges and market flows. This transformation signals a maturation of the memecoin space, moving it away from a niche corner of the internet and into the heart of crypto finance. But what’s driving this surge? DEX Market Share Revolution: Raydium Takes on Uniswap One of the most striking revelations in the Tiger Research report is the dramatic shift in DEX market share . Solana-based Raydium has surged ahead, overtaking the previously dominant Uniswap. This isn’t just a minor reshuffling; it’s a significant power shift in the decentralized exchange landscape. What’s behind Raydium’s meteoric rise? According to the report, the answer lies in two key factors: Lower Fees: Raydium offers significantly lower transaction fees compared to Uniswap, making it more attractive for high-volume traders and those sensitive to gas costs. Faster Transactions: Built on the Solana blockchain, Raydium boasts lightning-fast transaction speeds, a crucial advantage in the fast-paced world of crypto trading, especially for memecoins known for their volatility. This competition highlights the evolving nature of the DEX space, where efficiency and cost-effectiveness are becoming increasingly critical for attracting users and market share. Raydium’s success story is a testament to the growing importance of speed and affordability in decentralized finance. CEXs Embrace Memecoins: Binance, Gate.io, and MEXC Join the Frenzy The memecoin phenomenon isn’t limited to decentralized exchanges. Centralized exchanges (CEXs) are also jumping on the bandwagon, recognizing the immense retail interest and potential market liquidity that memecoins bring. Exchanges like Binance, Gate.io, and MEXC have been actively expanding their memecoin listings. Why are these major CEXs embracing what was once considered a risky and unserious asset class? Attracting Retail Liquidity: Memecoins are incredibly popular with retail investors. Listing them is a strategic move to attract and retain a large user base and boost trading volumes. Capitalizing on Trends: CEXs are adept at identifying and capitalizing on emerging crypto trends. The memecoin surge is too significant to ignore, and listing them allows exchanges to tap into this lucrative market segment. Competitive Edge: In a highly competitive CEX landscape, offering a wider range of assets, including popular memecoins, can provide a crucial competitive advantage. This widespread adoption by CEXs further solidifies memecoins’ position as legitimate crypto trading assets, moving them further into the mainstream crypto consciousness. The Dark Side of the Meme: Rug Pulls and Insider Trading Risks However, the rapid rise of memecoins is not without its shadows. The Tiger Research report also highlights the significant risks associated with this asset class, particularly unethical practices such as rug pulls and insider trading. The decentralized and often unregulated nature of memecoin projects makes them vulnerable to scams. Rug pulls , where developers abandon a project after raising significant funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens, are a major concern. Similarly, insider trading , where individuals with privileged information profit at the expense of ordinary investors, is another prevalent risk. The report points to events like the LIBRA scandal as a stark reminder of these dangers. Such incidents can lead to sharp declines in trading volumes and erode investor confidence, particularly in the DEX space. Navigating the memecoin market requires caution and awareness of these inherent risks. Memecoins: More Than Just Jokes – Proxy Assets and Cultural Trends Despite the risks, memecoins are evolving beyond simple speculative vehicles. They are increasingly being used as proxy assets tied to influential figures, social movements, and cultural trends. This is a fascinating development, suggesting that memecoins are tapping into deeper social and cultural currents. Think of memecoins linked to popular internet personalities, trending memes, or even political figures. These tokens become a way for communities to express support, engage in shared experiences, and even participate in a form of collective financial expression. This phenomenon is shaping a new intersection of culture and finance within the crypto markets . Key Takeaways: Aspect Description Evolving Asset Class Memecoins are transitioning from speculative jokes to key trading assets. Liquidity Drivers They significantly contribute to market liquidity and influence trading dynamics. DEX Competition Raydium’s rise highlights the importance of low fees and fast transactions in DEXs. CEX Adoption Major CEXs are listing memecoins to attract retail liquidity and capitalize on trends. Risks Remain Rug pulls and insider trading are serious concerns in the memecoin space. Cultural Significance Memecoins are becoming proxy assets linked to culture and social movements. Conclusion: The Unstoppable Meme Coin Revolution? The Tiger Research report paints a compelling picture of the evolving crypto landscape, where memecoins are no longer a laughing matter but a serious force to be reckoned with. They are driving market liquidity , reshaping DEX market share , and attracting attention from major CEXs. While risks like rug pulls and insider trading persist, the cultural and financial significance of memecoins is undeniable.

Whispers from the regulatory front suggest that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is gearing up to drop some much-anticipated guidance on cryptocurrency staking. If you’re involved in crypto, especially if you’re staking your digital assets, this is news you absolutely cannot afford to ignore. Let’s dive into what we know and what this could mean for you. Why is SEC Staking Guidance on the Horizon? According to a recent update from Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett on X (formerly Twitter), the SEC’s interest in crypto staking is intensifying. It’s not just a casual glance either; the agency has reportedly been actively seeking industry input to understand the diverse landscape of staking. This includes various staking types and the benefits they offer to the crypto ecosystem and individual users. Think of it as the SEC doing its homework, trying to get a handle on a rapidly evolving aspect of the digital asset space. The buzz is that this period of information gathering is nearing its end, and we can expect the SEC to release formal SEC staking guidance in the near future. This anticipation isn’t based on mere speculation. Sources indicate that SEC staff members have been deeply engaged with the topic, even participating in industry webinars to get a first-hand understanding of the current staking environment. This proactive approach suggests that the SEC is taking a serious and informed approach to regulating crypto staking . What Exactly is Crypto Staking and Why Does it Matter? For those newer to the crypto scene, let’s quickly break down what staking is and why it’s become such a hot topic. In simple terms, staking is akin to earning interest on your cryptocurrency holdings. Instead of just holding your coins in a wallet, you can ‘stake’ them to support the operations of a blockchain network. In return, you earn rewards, often in the form of more of the same cryptocurrency. Here’s a simplified look at how it works: Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Networks: Staking is primarily associated with blockchains that use a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Examples include Ethereum (since its transition), Cardano, Solana, and many others. Validating Transactions: By staking your crypto, you’re essentially participating in the network’s validation process. Your staked assets help to secure the network and verify transactions. Earning Rewards: As a reward for your contribution, the network distributes newly minted coins or transaction fees to stakers, proportional to the amount they’ve staked. Passive Income: Staking offers a way to generate passive income from your crypto holdings without needing to actively trade. Why is it important? Staking is crucial for the functionality and security of many modern blockchain networks. It incentivizes users to participate in network operations, decentralizes power, and reduces energy consumption compared to older mechanisms like Proof-of-Work (used by Bitcoin). Its growing popularity and significance in the crypto ecosystem is likely a key reason for the SEC’s increasing scrutiny and the need for clear staking regulation . Why is the SEC Focusing on Staking Now? The SEC’s interest in crypto staking isn’t entirely out of the blue. Several factors likely contribute to this increased attention: Investor Protection: The SEC’s primary mandate is to protect investors. With the rise of staking platforms and services, there’s a need to ensure that these are operating transparently and fairly, without misleading or harming investors. Securities Classification: A central question is whether staked crypto assets should be classified as securities. If staking is deemed to involve an investment contract where users expect profits based on the efforts of others (the ‘Howey Test’), it could fall under SEC jurisdiction. Industry Growth and Risks: The rapid growth of the crypto staking industry, coupled with potential risks like smart contract vulnerabilities, rug pulls, and centralized staking services, necessitates regulatory oversight. Precedent Setting: The SEC’s actions in the crypto space are often precedent-setting. Guidance on staking will likely influence how other jurisdictions approach crypto regulation and set the tone for future SEC actions regarding digital assets . What Might the SEC Staking Guidance Look Like? Potential Scenarios While we’re still waiting for the official SEC staking guidance , we can speculate on some potential directions based on the agency’s past actions and the information gathered. Here are a few possibilities: Scenario Potential Implications Impact on Users Staking as a Security: SEC classifies certain staking activities, especially those offered by centralized platforms, as securities. Stricter registration and compliance requirements for staking providers. Potential need for staking platforms to register with the SEC. Increased compliance costs could lead to some platforms exiting the US market. Users might see changes in service offerings and KYC/AML requirements. Distinction between Staking Types: Guidance differentiates between different types of staking (e.g., solo staking vs. staking pools, custodial vs. non-custodial). Tailored regulations based on risk profiles of different staking methods. Less burdensome rules for decentralized or non-custodial staking. More clarity for users and providers on compliant staking practices. Potential for innovation within defined regulatory boundaries. Focus on Disclosure and Transparency: Guidance emphasizes the need for clear disclosures from staking providers regarding risks, fees, and rewards. Increased transparency in the staking industry. Users will have better information to make informed decisions. Users benefit from greater transparency and reduced information asymmetry. May lead to more responsible staking practices. Enforcement Actions: Alongside guidance, the SEC may initiate enforcement actions against staking platforms deemed to be operating in violation of securities laws. Increased legal scrutiny and potential penalties for non-compliant platforms. May lead to greater caution and compliance focus in the industry. Users should be wary of platforms with questionable compliance records. Emphasis on choosing reputable and compliant staking providers. Navigating the Future of Crypto Staking: Actionable Insights So, what should you do to prepare for the upcoming SEC staking guidance ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and updates from reputable sources like Fox Business, crypto news outlets, and legal experts. Understanding the nuances of the evolving regulatory landscape is crucial. Understand Staking Types: Familiarize yourself with different staking methods (solo, pool, custodial, non-custodial). Consider the risks and rewards associated with each and how they might be viewed under potential regulations. Choose Compliant Platforms: If you use staking platforms, prioritize those that demonstrate a commitment to compliance and transparency. Look for platforms that are proactive in addressing regulatory concerns. Diversify Your Staking: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Diversify your staking across different assets and platforms to mitigate potential risks associated with regulatory changes or platform-specific issues. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re heavily involved in crypto staking or run a staking-related business, consider consulting with legal and financial professionals to ensure you’re prepared for potential regulatory changes. The Road Ahead for Digital Assets and Staking Regulation The upcoming SEC staking guidance is a significant moment for the crypto industry. It represents a crucial step in defining the regulatory framework for digital assets and, specifically, the rapidly growing staking sector. While the exact nature of the guidance remains to be seen, it’s clear that the SEC is taking a proactive and informed approach. This guidance has the potential to shape the future of staking in the U.S. and potentially influence global regulatory trends. For crypto users and businesses alike, staying informed, being prepared, and prioritizing compliance will be key to navigating this evolving landscape successfully. The industry input sought by the SEC suggests a willingness to understand the complexities of staking, which is a positive sign.

This Bitcoin acts as collateral for the loan. Loan Origination: Based on the value of your Bitcoin collateral, you are granted a loan. The loan amount is typically a percentage of the Bitcoin’s value, known as the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. Loan Terms: You agree to loan terms, including interest rates, repayment schedule, and loan duration. Repayment: You repay the loan according to the agreed terms. Once the loan is repaid, your Bitcoin collateral is released back to you. Margin Calls (Important to Understand): If the price of Bitcoin drops significantly, the value of your collateral decreases. To maintain the LTV ratio, you might receive a margin call, requiring you to deposit more Bitcoin or repay a portion of the loan to avoid liquidation of your collateral. Benefits of Choosing Bitcoin-Backed Lending Beyond the core advantages, Bitcoin-backed lending offers a range of compelling benefits: Faster Access to Funds: Compared to traditional loans, crypto loans can often be processed much faster, providing quicker access to the liquidity you need. No Credit Checks (Often): Many crypto lending platforms, including potentially this new Onramp and Arch service, may not require stringent credit checks, making it accessible to a broader range of borrowers. The collateral itself is the primary security. Flexibility: Loan terms can be flexible, with varying durations and repayment options to suit individual needs. Diversification Opportunities: Accessing liquidity without selling Bitcoin allows you to diversify your investment portfolio. You can use the borrowed funds to invest in other assets while still holding onto your BTC. Navigating the Landscape of Crypto Loans: Potential Challenges While crypto loans are incredibly promising, it’s essential to be aware of potential challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a double-edged sword. While price appreciation benefits you, significant price drops can trigger margin calls and potential liquidation of your collateral if you can’t meet them. Interest Rates: Interest rates on crypto loans can sometimes be higher than traditional loans, reflecting the perceived risk and novelty of the market. It’s crucial to compare rates and understand the total cost of borrowing. Platform Risk: Choosing a reputable and secure platform like Onramp and Arch is paramount. However, risks associated with any lending platform, such as security breaches or platform failures, should always be considered. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for crypto lending is still evolving. Changes in regulations could impact the operation and terms of these services. Is Bitcoin-Backed Lending Right For You? Actionable Insights BTC lending can be a powerful tool, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. Consider these points to determine if it aligns with your financial goals: Long-Term Bitcoin Belief: If you are a strong believer in Bitcoin’s long-term value and want to maintain your holdings, this service is highly relevant. Liquidity Needs: If you have a need for funds but don’t want to sell your Bitcoin, Bitcoin-backed lending provides a viable alternative. Risk Tolerance: Understand the volatility risks associated with Bitcoin and the potential for margin calls. Ensure you are comfortable with these risks. Financial Planning: Carefully assess your financial situation and ensure you can comfortably repay the loan according to the agreed terms. The Future of Crypto Lending is Here The partnership between Onramp and Arch marks a significant step forward in making Bitcoin-backed lending more accessible and mainstream. This innovative service empowers Bitcoin holders to unlock the value of their assets without relinquishing ownership, paving the way for a more flexible and efficient crypto financial ecosystem. As the crypto market matures, expect to see more sophisticated and user-friendly services like this emerge, further bridging the gap between traditional finance and the exciting world of digital assets.

40612655,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132354,1740095622,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Move: ECB Exploring Blockchain Payment System – A Digital Euro Future?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ecb-blockchain-payment-system/,"Exciting news is brewing in the financial world! The European Central Bank (ECB), a major player in global finance, is stepping into the innovative realm of blockchain technology. Imagine a world where your everyday transactions are powered by the same tech behind cryptocurrencies, but managed by your central bank. Sounds intriguing, right? Let’s dive into what this groundbreaking exploration by the ECB could mean for the future of payments and the potential rise of a digital euro. Why is the ECB Exploring a Blockchain Payment System? The ECB’s interest in a blockchain payment system signals a significant shift in how central banks are viewing this technology. For years, blockchain has been primarily associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Now, institutions like the ECB are recognizing its potential to revolutionize traditional finance. But what exactly is driving this exploration? Efficiency and Speed: Traditional payment systems can be slow and involve multiple intermediaries. Blockchain, with its decentralized and automated nature, promises faster and more efficient transactions. Reduced Costs: By streamlining processes and eliminating middlemen, a blockchain-based system could significantly lower the costs associated with payments. Enhanced Security: Blockchain’s cryptographic security features offer robust protection against fraud and cyber threats, making transactions more secure. Innovation and Future-Proofing: The ECB is likely looking to stay ahead of the curve in financial innovation. Exploring blockchain allows them to understand and potentially lead the future of payment technologies. The Potential Benefits of a Blockchain-Based Payment System The advantages of the ECB adopting a blockchain payment system are numerous and could impact various aspects of the European economy. Let’s break down some key benefits: Benefit Description Faster Transactions Blockchain can process payments much faster than traditional banking systems, potentially enabling near-instantaneous transactions. Lower Transaction Fees By cutting out intermediaries, blockchain systems can significantly reduce transaction fees, benefiting both consumers and businesses. Increased Transparency Blockchain provides a transparent and auditable record of transactions, enhancing trust and accountability within the financial system. Financial Inclusion Blockchain-based systems can potentially reach underserved populations, providing access to financial services for those currently excluded. Programmable Money Blockchain allows for the creation of programmable money, enabling automated payments and smart contracts for complex financial operations. Is a Digital Euro on the Horizon? The ECB’s exploration of a blockchain payment system naturally raises questions about the future of the euro and the possibility of a digital euro . While this exploration doesn’t explicitly confirm the imminent launch of a digital euro, it strongly suggests that the ECB is seriously considering digital currencies as part of its future strategy. A central bank digital currency (CBDC), like a digital euro, could leverage blockchain technology to offer a digital form of central bank money directly to citizens and businesses. This move aligns with global trends as many central banks worldwide are researching and experimenting with CBDCs. The potential for a digital euro to enhance the Eurozone’s financial infrastructure, compete with private cryptocurrencies, and improve monetary policy implementation is significant. Challenges and Considerations for Blockchain Adoption by the ECB While the potential of a blockchain payment system is exciting, the ECB must navigate several challenges and considerations before widespread adoption becomes a reality: Scalability: Blockchain networks need to handle a massive volume of transactions efficiently to support a major economy like the Eurozone. Regulation and Compliance: Clear regulatory frameworks are essential to ensure the legal and compliant operation of a blockchain-based payment system. This includes addressing anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) requirements. Privacy Concerns: Balancing transparency with user privacy is crucial. The design of the system must address how personal and transaction data will be protected. Interoperability: The new system needs to be interoperable with existing financial infrastructure and systems to ensure a smooth transition and integration. Cybersecurity Risks: While blockchain is secure, vulnerabilities can still exist. Robust cybersecurity measures are paramount to protect the system from attacks. Cryptocurrency Adoption and the ECB’s Stance The ECB’s move into blockchain also occurs against the backdrop of growing cryptocurrency adoption globally. While the ECB has maintained a cautious stance on decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, their exploration of blockchain technology indicates a nuanced approach. They seem to recognize the underlying technology’s value while seeking to maintain control and stability within the regulated financial system. This exploration could be seen as a strategic move to harness the innovation of blockchain while mitigating the risks associated with unregulated cryptocurrencies. By developing its own blockchain-based payment system, the ECB could potentially offer a secure and regulated digital alternative, influencing the future landscape of cryptocurrency adoption and digital finance in Europe. Conclusion: A Transformative Step Towards Digital Finance? The ECB’s exploration of a blockchain-based payment system is undoubtedly a transformative step. It signifies a growing recognition of blockchain’s potential to reshape the financial world. While challenges remain, this initiative could pave the way for a more efficient, secure, and innovative payment landscape in Europe. The journey towards a potential digital euro and the broader integration of blockchain into mainstream finance is underway, and the world is watching closely. This is not just about payments; it’s about reimagining the future of money itself.

40612766,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132355,1740095709,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"HUGE Crypto Gains: Investors Averaged $5,482 Profit in 2024 – Shocking Report Reveals",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-investor-profits-2024-report/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The latest CoinLedger report is out, and it paints a seriously rosy picture for crypto investors in 2024. After navigating the choppy waters of the previous year, it seems the tide has turned, bringing a wave of crypto gains that are making headlines. Forget pocket change – we’re talking about an average realized gain of $5,482 per investor. That’s a significant jump from the $887.60 seen in 2023! Ready to dive into the details of this exciting surge and understand what fueled this impressive comeback? Explosive Growth in Crypto Investor Profits: What Sparked the Surge? The numbers speak for themselves: a massive leap in investor profits compared to the previous year. But what exactly triggered this financial fireworks display? CoinLedger points to a key catalyst: renewed market enthusiasm following the U.S. presidential election. It appears the political landscape played a significant role in reigniting investor confidence and injecting fresh energy into the crypto market. This positive sentiment created a fertile ground for growth, allowing investors to reap substantial rewards. Let’s break down the key factors contributing to this impressive upturn: Post-Election Market Optimism: The resolution of political uncertainty often brings stability and renewed confidence in financial markets, and cryptocurrency is no exception. Increased Adoption: Continued mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies is likely playing a role, with more individuals and institutions entering the market. Positive Market Sentiment: A general shift towards positive sentiment in the crypto space, potentially driven by factors like regulatory clarity in some regions and technological advancements. This combination of factors created a perfect storm for investor profits , resulting in the impressive gains reported by CoinLedger. Bitcoin’s Reign Continues: Still the King of Crypto Holdings Bitcoin Dominance in Crypto Portfolios Despite the ever-evolving landscape of the cryptocurrency world, one thing remains constant: Bitcoin’s dominance. The CoinLedger report reaffirms that bitcoin continues to be the most-held asset among crypto investors. This isn’t surprising, given Bitcoin’s status as the original cryptocurrency and its established track record. It remains a cornerstone of many crypto portfolios, valued for its store of value proposition and brand recognition. However, the report also highlights an interesting contrast. While Bitcoin leads in holdings, Ethereum (ETH) emerged as the leader in unrealized losses. This suggests a more complex picture beneath the surface. While investors hold onto their Bitcoin, perhaps for long-term gains, Ethereum’s price fluctuations might be causing more unrealized losses in the short term. It’s crucial to remember that unrealized losses are simply paper losses – they only become realized when an asset is sold at a loss. Emerging Stars: SUPER and HYPE Lead Unrealized Gains While established cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, the crypto market is also a breeding ground for innovation and new projects. CoinLedger’s report shines a spotlight on some of these rising stars, revealing that newer tokens like SUPER and HYPE posted the largest unrealized gains. This is exciting news for those who are always on the lookout for the next big thing in crypto. Tokens like SUPER and HYPE, often associated with newer blockchain projects or trends, demonstrate the potential for explosive growth within the crypto space. However, it’s important to approach these newer tokens with caution. While the potential for high gains is there, so is the risk. Thorough research and understanding of the project behind these tokens are crucial before investing. Key takeaway: Don’t just focus on the established giants. Keep an eye on emerging tokens like SUPER and HYPE – they might just be the hidden gems in the crypto universe. But always remember to do your due diligence! Coinbase Takes the Crown: The Go-To Exchange for Tax Reporting The crypto landscape is not just about asset performance; it’s also about the infrastructure that supports it. Exchanges play a vital role in facilitating crypto trading and investment. According to CoinLedger’s findings, Coinbase Exchange has overtaken Binance as the most-used exchange for tax reporting purposes. This shift could be attributed to several factors: Regulatory Scrutiny: Binance has faced increased regulatory scrutiny in various jurisdictions, which might be prompting users to favor exchanges with a stronger regulatory standing like Coinbase. User-Friendliness for Tax Reporting: Coinbase may offer more user-friendly tools and resources for tax reporting compared to Binance, making it a preferred choice for users navigating the complexities of crypto taxes. U.S. Investor Base: Coinbase has a strong presence in the U.S. market, and with the U.S. presidential election being a key factor in market enthusiasm, it’s plausible that increased activity from U.S. investors is contributing to Coinbase’s rise in tax reporting usage. Ledger, a popular hardware wallet provider, maintained its lead in wallet imports for tax reporting. This highlights the continued importance of hardware wallets for secure crypto storage and the growing need for seamless tax reporting solutions within the crypto ecosystem. Navigating Crypto Taxes: Actionable Insights for Investors The CoinLedger report underscores the increasing importance of tax reporting in the crypto world. With greater adoption and regulatory attention, understanding and complying with crypto tax obligations is no longer optional – it’s essential. Here are some actionable insights for crypto investors to navigate the tax landscape effectively: Track Your Transactions Diligently: Keep meticulous records of all your crypto transactions, including buys, sells, trades, and transfers. This is crucial for accurate tax reporting. Utilize Tax Reporting Tools: Consider using crypto tax software like CoinLedger to automate the process of calculating your tax liabilities. These tools can significantly simplify tax reporting. Understand Tax Regulations: Familiarize yourself with the crypto tax regulations in your jurisdiction. Tax rules can vary significantly from country to country. Seek Professional Advice: If you’re unsure about any aspect of crypto taxes, don’t hesitate to consult with a qualified tax professional who specializes in cryptocurrency. Tax reporting in the crypto space might seem daunting, but with the right tools and knowledge, it can be managed effectively. Staying compliant is not just about avoiding penalties; it’s about participating responsibly in the evolving crypto ecosystem. Conclusion: A Promising Outlook for Crypto Investors The CoinLedger report paints an encouraging picture for crypto investors in 2024. The significant surge in average realized gains, driven by renewed market enthusiasm, signals a positive shift in the crypto landscape. While bitcoin remains the dominant asset, the rise of newer tokens and the evolving dynamics of exchanges like Coinbase highlight the dynamism and constant change within the crypto market. As the crypto space matures, tax reporting and regulatory compliance will become increasingly important. Investors who stay informed, utilize available tools, and seek professional guidance when needed will be best positioned to thrive in this exciting and ever-evolving world of digital assets. The investor profits of 2024 are a testament to the potential of cryptocurrency, and suggest a bright future for those who navigate this space wisely.

These include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies globally remains a key concern for institutions. Clarity and consistent regulations are crucial for broader adoption. Market Volatility: The inherent volatility of the crypto market can be a deterrent for risk-averse institutional investors. Risk management strategies and long-term perspectives are essential. Custodial Solutions and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of digital assets is paramount for institutions. Robust and regulated custodial solutions are necessary. Education and Understanding: A deeper understanding of cryptocurrency technology and markets is needed within traditional financial institutions to facilitate informed investment decisions. Actionable Insights: Embracing the NEAR Opportunity For institutional investors considering dipping their toes into the crypto waters, the NEAR Adoption Fund presents a compelling opportunity. Here are some actionable insights: Due Diligence on NEAR Protocol: Conduct thorough research on NEAR’s technology, ecosystem, and long-term potential.

As interest in decentralized commerce builds, Web3Bay remains one of the projects with strong potential for future expansion. Cardano (ADA) Poised for Breakout as Market Sentiment Shifts Cardano (ADA) is displaying strong signals of a potential breakout, fueling speculation among traders. Analysts note that ADA’s price trends mirror past patterns that led to major rallies. On-chain data reveals a rise in transaction volume and large investor accumulation, strengthening positive market sentiment. Meanwhile, key support levels remain intact, reinforcing stability despite market fluctuations. Technical indicators, including the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Averages, point to increasing momentum, with ADA approaching a crucial resistance zone. A successful breakout could open the door for notable gains. At the same time, Cardano’s expanding ecosystem is adding to overall investor confidence. Despite the bullish signals, traders remain alert as Bitcoin’s movement and broader market conditions influence ADA’s path. While the potential for a rally remains strong, volatility persists. Therefore, traders are closely watching key price levels for possible fluctuations in the coming weeks. Dogecoin’s Journey to $2: Experts See Bullish Potential Despite a 40% drop since mid-January, analysts maintain that Dogecoin still has strong bullish potential. Trader Alan points to past trends where temporary declines were followed by massive price jumps, calling this period the “DOGE season.” He suggests that if history repeats itself, Dogecoin could reach $2.2, referring to its 8,800% surge in 2017-2018 and an even larger 28,000% spike in 2020-2021. Another analyst, Javon Marks, also believes a $2 target is achievable. Key factors fueling this prediction include increased adoption, strong market sentiment, and expectations of future integrations. However, despite Dogecoin’s history of sudden price spikes, achieving this goal depends on sustained interest and bullish market conditions. At the same time, experts warn that Dogecoin’s price movements remain unpredictable. Still, if momentum builds, Dogecoin could experience another rapid climb. The next few months will be crucial in determining whether Dogecoin can surpass its previous all-time highs. Wrapping Up! As Web3Bay continues attracting major buyers, Cardano edges closer to a breakout, and Dogecoin eyes another rally, competition in the crypto space remains fierce. Each project brings unique strengths—Web3Bay’s focus on decentralized shopping , Cardano’s growing ecosystem, and Dogecoin’s strong support base. However, Web3Bay’s structure makes it stand out, providing a more scalable and efficient model that addresses key issues seen in other networks. While short-term market trends fuel speculation, long-term success depends on adoption and usability.

40613151,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132364,1740096038,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Vitalik Buterin’s Powerful Endorsement: Argentina’s Ethereum Community Shines Amid Meme Coin Frenzy,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/vitalik-buterin-argentina-ethereum-community/,"In the electrifying world of cryptocurrency, where meme coins can momentarily steal the spotlight, it’s the robust foundations of genuine innovation and community that truly matter. Recently, amidst the buzz surrounding Argentina’s presidential meme coin, LIBRA, Ethereum’s co-founder, the visionary Vitalik Buterin, stepped forward to illuminate a different narrative – the remarkable strength and dedication of the Argentina Ethereum community . His words, delivered via X (formerly Twitter), served as a powerful reminder of where true value lies in the crypto ecosystem: in the builders, the educators, and the communities that are shaping the future of decentralized technology. Why Vitalik Buterin is Praising the Argentina Ethereum Community Right Now? The crypto sphere is no stranger to fleeting trends and viral sensations. The recent emergence of LIBRA, a meme coin associated with Argentina’s presidential landscape, captured significant attention, particularly within the country. While meme coins can be entertaining and generate short-term excitement, Vitalik Buterin astutely redirected the focus to something far more enduring and impactful: the Argentina Ethereum community . Buterin’s message wasn’t just a casual mention; it was a deliberate and heartfelt acknowledgment. He specifically called out the “amazing builders” within Argentina who have been instrumental in the growth and evolution of the Ethereum ecosystem. This wasn’t about dismissing the meme coin phenomenon, but rather using it as a pivotal moment to highlight the deeper, more meaningful contributions emanating from Argentina. Here’s a breakdown of why Buterin’s praise is so significant: Recognition of Real Contribution: Buterin’s words serve as a powerful validation for the hard work and dedication of Argentinian developers, enthusiasts, and educators who are actively building on Ethereum. Shifting Focus from Hype to Substance: In a market often swayed by hype, Buterin’s statement brings attention back to the fundamental value creation happening within the Ethereum ecosystem. Encouragement for Continued Growth: His message acts as a catalyst, inspiring the Ethereum community in Argentina to continue their impactful work and to see temporary distractions as opportunities for growth. Global Perspective: Buterin’s mention underscores the global nature of the Ethereum community and acknowledges the vital role that regions like Latin America, and specifically Argentina, play in the broader crypto narrative. The Vibrant Argentina Ethereum Community: What Makes it Stand Out? Argentina, like many nations in Latin America, has seen a burgeoning interest in cryptocurrency. Several factors contribute to the dynamism of the Ethereum community in Argentina: Economic Context: Argentina has faced significant economic challenges, including inflation and currency devaluation. In this environment, cryptocurrencies like Ethereum can present themselves as attractive alternatives for savings and transactions. This economic backdrop fuels interest and adoption. Tech-Savvy Population: Argentina boasts a highly educated and tech-forward population. This translates to a strong pool of talent capable of understanding and contributing to complex technologies like blockchain and Ethereum. Grassroots Community Building: The Argentinian crypto community is known for its grassroots, bottom-up approach. Enthusiasts have actively organized meetups, workshops, and online forums, fostering a collaborative and supportive environment. Developer Talent: Latin America, including Argentina, is increasingly recognized as a hub for software development talent. This technical expertise is crucial for building and innovating within the Ethereum ecosystem. Examples of Argentinian contributions to the Ethereum space might include local Ethereum meetups and conferences, open-source projects developed by Argentinian developers, and Argentinian startups building on Ethereum. While specific examples weren’t mentioned in the original prompt, further research would likely reveal concrete instances of Argentinian innovation within the Ethereum ecosystem. LIBRA Meme Coin Hype: A Setback or a Chance for Crypto Education? The rise of LIBRA, the presidential meme coin in Argentina, is a fascinating case study. It highlights the power of virality and the often unpredictable nature of crypto markets. However, as Vitalik Buterin pointed out, these moments of hype can also serve as crucial inflection points. Instead of viewing the meme coin frenzy as a discouragement, Buterin frames it as a “call for better crypto education .” Here’s why this perspective is so vital: Understanding the Underlying Technology: Meme coins, by their nature, often lack fundamental utility or technological innovation. The LIBRA hype underscores the need for broader public understanding of the difference between speculative assets and projects with real technological underpinnings like Ethereum. Risk Awareness: Meme coins are notoriously volatile and carry significant risk. Education is crucial to ensure individuals understand these risks before investing, preventing potential financial harm. Promoting Responsible Engagement: Crypto education empowers individuals to engage with the crypto space responsibly and critically, moving beyond just chasing quick gains to understanding the long-term potential of blockchain technology. Building a Sustainable Ecosystem: A well-educated crypto community is essential for the long-term health and sustainability of the entire ecosystem. It fosters informed participation, responsible innovation, and reduces susceptibility to speculative bubbles. Buterin’s call to action is clear: use moments like the meme coin hype to double down on crypto education efforts. This includes educating the public about blockchain technology, the principles of decentralized finance (DeFi), the importance of security, and the risks and rewards associated with different types of crypto assets. Investing in Crypto Education: Unlocking Argentina and Latin America’s Potential Vitalik Buterin’s optimism about Argentina and Latin America’s ongoing impact in the crypto space is deeply rooted in the region’s potential and the proactive steps being taken by its communities. Investing in crypto education is not just about mitigating risks; it’s about unlocking immense opportunities. Here are actionable insights for fostering better crypto education in Argentina and beyond: Area Actionable Insights Educational Institutions Integrate blockchain and cryptocurrency education into curricula at universities, colleges, and even high schools. Offer courses, workshops, and seminars on blockchain technology, cryptography, and decentralized applications. Community Initiatives Support and expand grassroots educational initiatives led by crypto communities. Organize free workshops, meetups, and online resources. Create mentorship programs to guide newcomers. Government and Policy Makers Develop public awareness campaigns to educate citizens about cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Support research and development in the blockchain space. Create clear and sensible regulatory frameworks that encourage innovation while protecting consumers. Industry Collaboration Foster collaboration between crypto companies and educational institutions to develop practical training programs and internships. Industry experts can contribute valuable real-world insights to educational efforts. Accessible Resources Create and translate high-quality educational materials into local languages. Ensure resources are accessible online and offline, catering to diverse learning styles and levels of technical understanding. By prioritizing crypto education , Argentina and Latin America can solidify their position as key contributors to the global crypto revolution. A well-informed populace will be better equipped to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology, participate in decentralized economies, and drive innovation in the years to come. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Argentina’s Ethereum Community Vitalik Buterin’s praise for the Argentina Ethereum community is more than just a pat on the back; it’s a powerful endorsement of the talent, dedication, and potential within the region. Amidst the fleeting hype of meme coins and market fluctuations, Buterin’s message serves as a vital reminder of the enduring importance of community, education, and genuine technological advancement. Argentina’s vibrant Ethereum community , fueled by passionate builders and a growing ecosystem, is poised to continue making significant contributions to the crypto space, proving that true value lies not in fleeting trends, but in sustained effort and collective growth. The future for Argentina and Latin America in the crypto world looks incredibly bright, powered by informed communities and innovative spirit.

Recent news from the Federal Reserve is sending ripples across the economic landscape. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic has reiterated his expectation for two interest rate cuts in 2025. While this might sound like distant future talk, it holds significant implications for today’s investment decisions, particularly in the crypto space. Let’s dive into what Bostic’s forecast means and how it could impact your financial strategies. Why Are Fed Rate Cuts in 2025 Generating Buzz? The Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates are pivotal moments for the global economy. These decisions influence borrowing costs, inflation, and overall economic growth. When a prominent figure like Raphael Bostic, President of the Atlanta Fed, speaks about future rate cuts, the market listens intently. His recent statement, reaffirming his projection for two rate cuts in 2025, comes amidst a backdrop of considerable economic outlook uncertainty. But why is this forecast noteworthy? Sign of Potential Easing: Rate cuts are generally seen as a signal that the Fed is moving towards easing monetary policy. This usually happens when the economy shows signs of slowing down, or when inflation is trending towards the desired target. Impact on Borrowing Costs: Lower interest rates can reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially stimulating economic activity. Market Sentiment Booster: For investors, especially in riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, the prospect of lower rates can be a positive catalyst, often leading to increased investment and market optimism. However, Bostic also emphasized the significant economic uncertainty that could alter this outlook. This caveat is crucial. It means that while two rate cuts are currently projected, the actual economic conditions in 2025 will ultimately dictate the Fed’s actions. Understanding the Current Economic Climate To truly grasp the significance of Bostic’s comments, it’s important to understand the current economic climate. We are navigating a complex scenario characterized by: Persistent Inflation: While inflation has cooled down from its peak, it remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The stickiness of inflation is a major concern, influencing the Fed’s cautious approach. Labor Market Strength: The labor market has remained surprisingly robust, with low unemployment rates. This strength can contribute to inflationary pressures, making the Fed’s job of controlling inflation more challenging. Global Economic Headwinds: Geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, and varying economic performances across different regions add layers of complexity to the global economic picture. How Do Fed Rate Cuts Influence Financial Markets? The anticipation of Fed rate cuts , even a year out, can have immediate and projected impacts on various segments of the financial markets . Let’s break down some key areas: Stock Market: Historically, rate cuts are often seen as positive for the stock market. Lower rates can reduce borrowing costs for companies, potentially boosting earnings and making stocks more attractive compared to bonds. Bond Market: Bond yields tend to move in the same direction as the Fed’s policy rate. Therefore, expected rate cuts usually lead to lower bond yields, which can increase bond prices. Cryptocurrency Market: The crypto market, known for its high volatility, can be particularly sensitive to changes in monetary policy. Lower interest rates can reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like cryptocurrencies, potentially driving investment into this sector. Forex Market: Rate cuts can weaken the domestic currency as lower rates make the currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns. However, it’s crucial to remember that the impact is not always straightforward and can be influenced by numerous other factors, including overall economic sentiment and global events. The Crypto Angle: What Does This Mean for Digital Assets? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, the prospect of interest rate cuts is often viewed with optimism. Here’s why: Increased Liquidity: Lower rates can inject more liquidity into the market. Some of this liquidity may find its way into higher-risk, higher-reward assets like cryptocurrencies. Reduced Borrowing Costs for Crypto Firms: Crypto companies and projects that rely on borrowing may benefit from reduced interest expenses, fostering growth and innovation. Investment Appeal: In a low-rate environment, the allure of potentially higher returns from cryptocurrencies becomes stronger compared to traditional fixed-income investments. Hedge Against Inflation (Debatable): While the narrative of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge is debated, some investors see cryptocurrencies as an alternative asset class that could perform well in an environment where traditional currencies might be devalued due to inflationary pressures (though this is complex and not always a direct correlation). However, it’s not all smooth sailing. The crypto market is also influenced by its own set of factors, including regulatory developments, technological advancements, and market sentiment. Therefore, while rate cuts can be a tailwind, they are just one piece of the puzzle. Navigating Uncertainty: Actionable Insights for Investors Given the economic uncertainty highlighted by Bostic, and the anticipation of Fed rate cuts in 2025, what should investors, especially those in the crypto space, consider? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of economic data releases, Fed communications, and global economic developments. Economic conditions can change rapidly, and staying informed is crucial for making timely investment decisions. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification remains a cornerstone of sound investment strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different asset classes to mitigate risk. Risk Management: Understand your risk tolerance and invest accordingly. The crypto market is inherently volatile, and while the potential for high returns is there, so is the risk of significant losses. Long-Term Perspective: Focus on long-term investment goals rather than getting swayed by short-term market fluctuations. Rate cuts in 2025 are still a future projection and the market can react in unpredictable ways in the short run. Due Diligence: Whether you are investing in traditional assets or cryptocurrencies, always conduct thorough research and due diligence. Understand the assets you are investing in and the factors that can influence their performance. The Road Ahead: Cautious Optimism? Raphael Bostic’s reiteration of two rate cuts in 2025 provides a glimpse into the Federal Reserve’s current thinking. While the forecast offers a sense of cautious optimism for financial markets and potentially the crypto sector, the emphasis on economic uncertainty is a crucial reminder. The actual path of interest rates will depend heavily on how the economy evolves over the next year and a half. For investors, this means staying vigilant, adaptable, and well-informed. The future remains dynamic, and navigating it successfully requires a balanced approach of hope and prudence.

Ready to dive into the details of this innovative financial product? What is the Franklin Templeton EZPZ ETP? The Franklin Templeton EZPZ ETP is designed as a straightforward and accessible way for investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Instead of directly purchasing and managing Bitcoin and Ethereum, investors can now invest in an ETP that tracks the performance of these digital assets. The initial composition of the EZPZ ETP reflects the current dominance of Bitcoin and Ethereum in the crypto market, allocating approximately 87% to Bitcoin and 13% to Ethereum based on their respective market capitalizations. This allocation strategy aims to mirror the prevailing trends and investor interest within the cryptocurrency landscape. Here’s a quick breakdown of the key features: Effortless Exposure: Gain exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum without the need for crypto wallets, private keys, or direct exchange interactions. Market-Reflective Composition: Initially weighted 87% Bitcoin and 13% Ethereum, mirroring market capitalization. Potential for Expansion: Future inclusion of other digital assets is anticipated, pending regulatory approvals, suggesting dynamic portfolio evolution. Institutional Backing: Launched by Franklin Templeton, a globally recognized and trusted asset manager, adding credibility and security. Why Choose a Bitcoin Ethereum ETP like EZPZ? Investing in cryptocurrencies can seem daunting for newcomers. The technicalities of wallets, exchanges, and security concerns can be significant hurdles. This is where a Bitcoin Ethereum ETP like EZPZ shines. It simplifies the process, offering a regulated and familiar investment vehicle. But what are the specific advantages? Let’s explore the benefits of investing in a Crypto ETP through a table: Benefit Description Simplified Access ETPs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible through brokerage accounts, eliminating the need for specialized crypto exchange accounts. Reduced Complexity Investors avoid the complexities of managing crypto wallets, private keys, and security protocols associated with direct cryptocurrency ownership. Regulatory Compliance ETPs are typically regulated financial products, offering a layer of investor protection and transparency compared to unregulated direct crypto investments. Diversification Potential Provides diversification within a traditional investment portfolio by adding exposure to the digital asset class. Liquidity ETPs offer liquidity as they can be bought and sold easily during exchange trading hours, similar to stocks. The Allure of Digital Asset Exposure: What’s the Big Deal? The buzz around Digital Asset Exposure is undeniable. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have captured global attention due to their potential for high growth and disruptive innovation. But why are institutional investors like Franklin Templeton increasingly interested in providing access to this asset class? Here’s why Digital Asset Exposure is becoming increasingly crucial for modern investment portfolios: Growth Potential: Cryptocurrencies, despite volatility, have shown significant growth potential over the long term, attracting investors seeking high returns. Innovation and Disruption: The underlying blockchain technology is revolutionizing various industries, and cryptocurrencies are at the forefront of this technological shift. Inflation Hedge: Some investors view Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as potential hedges against inflation, diversifying away from traditional assets. Institutional Adoption: Increasing institutional adoption signals growing confidence and maturity in the cryptocurrency market, further legitimizing the asset class. Portfolio Diversification: Adding digital assets can enhance portfolio diversification, potentially reducing overall risk and improving risk-adjusted returns. Looking Ahead: The Future of EZPZ and Crypto ETPs Franklin Templeton’s launch of EZPZ ETP signals a significant step forward in the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency investments. The potential inclusion of additional digital assets in the future highlights the dynamic nature of this product and its adaptability to the evolving crypto landscape.

What could the future hold for Crypto ETPs like EZPZ? Expansion of Asset Coverage: We might see EZPZ and similar ETPs expanding to include a wider range of cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, offering more diversified exposure. Thematic ETPs: Future ETPs could focus on specific themes within the crypto space, such as DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), or Metaverse-related assets. Increased Competition: The success of EZPZ is likely to attract more traditional financial institutions to launch similar products, fostering competition and innovation in the ETP market. Lower Fees: Increased competition could also drive down management fees associated with ETPs, making them even more attractive to investors. Global Availability: As regulatory landscapes evolve globally, we can expect to see wider availability of crypto ETPs across different regions, increasing accessibility for investors worldwide. Actionable Insights: Is EZPZ ETP Right for You? The Franklin Templeton EZPZ ETP presents an intriguing option for investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum in a simplified and regulated manner. However, like any investment, it’s crucial to consider whether it aligns with your individual financial goals and risk tolerance. Here are some actionable insights to help you decide: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Ensure you understand the risks involved and that your risk tolerance aligns with investing in digital assets, even through an ETP. Consider Your Investment Goals: Determine if crypto exposure fits into your overall investment strategy and goals. Are you looking for long-term growth, diversification, or speculative opportunities? Research ETP Details: Thoroughly review the prospectus and details of the EZPZ ETP, including fees, tracking methodology, and any specific risks associated with the product. Compare with Alternatives: Explore other options for crypto exposure, such as direct cryptocurrency ownership or other crypto investment products, to make an informed decision. Consult a Financial Advisor: If you are unsure whether EZPZ ETP is suitable for you, seek advice from a qualified financial advisor who can assess your individual circumstances and provide personalized recommendations. Conclusion: A Simplified Gateway to Crypto? Franklin Templeton’s EZPZ ETP marks an exciting development, potentially simplifying the entry point for investors interested in the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. By offering a regulated, accessible, and market-representative product, EZPZ could pave the way for broader adoption of digital assets within mainstream investment portfolios. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, innovative products like EZPZ ETP will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping the future of finance and investment.

This Pattern Signal SHIB New All-Time High,https://coingape.com/can-shiba-inu-price-surge-422-this-pattern-signal-shib-new-all-time-high/,"Shiba Inu price has recently broken out of a Falling Wedge pattern, a formation commonly recognized as a bullish reversal signal in technical analysis. The pattern is characterized by a downward consolidation with lower highs and lower lows, which eventually leads to a meme coin rally breakout. Shiba Inu Price Breaks Out of Falling Wedge Formation According to analyst Bezos Crypto , Shiba Inu price has completed a breakout from a Falling Wedge, a pattern associated with strong upward movements. This formation often indicates a trend reversal, with SHIB price action shifting from a downtrend to an uptrend. In previous instances, similar setups have led to substantial gains for SHIB, fueling optimism among traders and investors. The breakout is accompanied by a noticeable increase in trading volume, suggesting strong participation from investors. Volume confirmation is a crucial aspect of validating the meme coin rally, as it indicates growing buying interest. If Shiba Inu price maintains its momentum, it could reach the projected price target of $0.00008841, reflecting a 422% increase. Meanwhile, most recently, SHIB whales have triggered volatility by offloading 2.1 trillion tokens, adding uncertainty to price action. The sudden transaction, valued at $32.55 million, has raised concerns over potential selling pressure. Bitcoin’s Influence on SHIB and Technical Analysis More so, Bitcoin price trend, plays a crucial role in determining the trajectory of Shiba Inu price. Historically, altcoins such as SHIB have exhibited strong price movements during Bitcoin’s bullish phases. When Bitcoin consolidates or trends higher, altcoins often benefit from increased market liquidity and positive sentiment. On the same note, other technical aspects also align with the bullish narrative, as various technicals suggest upcoming meme coin rally. AO is shifting the momentum from the red bars, to green bars which depict a bullish reversal. AO, which measures market momentum, suggests that selling pressure is fading, and buyers are beginning to gain control. In addition, Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator gives buying signal, because the MACD line has crossed the signal line. This crossover is an indication that the trend is moving towards the buyers end hence conforming a bullish trend. Source: TradingView More so, the histogram bars, which represent the difference between the MACD and signal lines, have turned green, reinforcing the strengthening bullish sentiment. If this trend continues, it could indicate a strong upward movement in SHIB price to a new all-time high. Risk Considerations Ahead of The Meme Coin Rally While the bullish scenario for Shiba Inu price remains strong, traders remain cautious about potential volatility. Price movements in the cryptocurrency market can be influenced by external factors, including regulatory news, and shifts in investor sentiment. A retracement or a retest of the breakout zone is possible before further upside continuation. Key resistance levels to monitor include $0.000030, $0.000050, and the previous all-time high near $0.00008841. On the downside, support levels at $0.000020 and $0.000015 could act as critical zones if a pullback occurs. Also, a recent report revealed that top meme coins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin and Floki Inu, are at risk to declining futures open interest. The data also indicates that SHIB’s futures Open Interest has dropped by 74.41% and DOGE by 58.45% which shows a decreased trader interest. The post Can Shiba Inu Price Surge 422%?

Until now, Cohen exclusively followed the official GameStop handle, but as of today, he has added Bitcoin Magazine to his follow list. This comes on the heels of a much-discussed photograph that surfaced two weeks ago showing Cohen with Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). 👀 Go on king 👑 https://t.co/ApTV3WwTaj — David Bailey🇵🇷 $0.85mm/btc is the floor (@DavidFBailey) February 20, 2025 Will Gamestop Buy Bitcoin? GameStop has periodically found itself at the center of Bitcoin-related conjecture, particularly since the pandemic era “meme stock” phenomenon. At that time, a theory posted on Wall Street Bets—a popular Reddit forum—proposed that the gaming retailer, viewed by many as a relic of brick-and-mortar retail, was primed for a turnaround. Widespread retail buying propelled the share price upward, challenging major hedge funds that had shorted the stock. The resulting clash was widely likened to a “David vs. Goliath” scenario. The Bitcoin connection emerged as the pandemic-driven mania intersected with discourse on decentralized finance. Some observers drew parallels between the grassroots support for GameStop and the way Bitcoin was embraced as a hedge against systemic corruption in traditional finance. Since then, theories have circulated that GameStop could adopt a corporate Bitcoin strategy, potentially mirroring MicroStrategy’s aggressive move into BTC. Two weeks ago, Cohen posted a photo on X in which he appeared alongside Michael Saylor, as reported by Bitcoinist. Given Saylor’s reputation as a high-profile advocate for corporate BTC treasury strategies—he spearheads the acquisition of nearly 500,000 BTC at Strategy—many in the Bitcoin sphere speculated that Cohen might be seeking Saylor’s counsel. However, caution soon followed. According to two unnamed sources cited by CNBC, Saylor has no direct involvement in any potential GameStop plan to buy Bitcoin. The rumors remain just that: speculation that has yet to be confirmed by either Cohen or GameStop. Fueling these rumors is the fact that GameStop reported having around $4.616 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of October 31, 2024. Tim Kotzman, host of “The Bitcoin Treasuries Podcast,” recently highlighted GameStop’s investment policy that grants Cohen “the authority to invest in cryptocurrencies without requiring shareholder or board approval.” “If GameStop $GME were to invest its $4.6 billion cash reserves into BTC, it would acquire approximately 48,000 BTC,” wrote analyst Han Akamatsu on X, noting that such a position would make GameStop the second-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, surpassing MARA Holdings but still behind Strategy. However, such predictions are heavily speculative. GameStop has dabbled in NFTs and blockchain projects in the past, but there is no official indication that the company is imminently acquiring Bitcoin. At press time, BTC traded at $97,708.

In a new strategy session, pseudonymous crypto trader Inmortal tells his 229,400 followers on the social media platform X that LINK may increase by more than 194% its current value by early next year. “Green for buying, red for selling. This trade requires: 2/100 IQ. 100/100 patience .

Next up, the trader predicts that top digital assets will see big rallies in the coming months. “I think most underestimate the power of buying spot here on some majors. Easy 2x in three months. Buy, wait, wait, wait, sell.” Lastly, the trader says that Ethereum ( ETH ) may take off on a series of rallies and surpass the $4,800 level by May. “This is how my dream looks like.

Big platforms control pricing, take high fees from sellers, and collect user data without consent. Many businesses struggle under strict platform rules, while buyers end up paying more due to price manipulation and hidden charges. Instead of a free market, a few large companies set the terms and push their own interests, leaving both sellers and buyers with limited choices. Web3Bay is changing this system by cutting out middlemen and using blockchain for secure, direct transactions. Unlike traditional platforms, Web3Bay operates on community-driven smart contracts, ensuring fair pricing and transparency. With over $1.5 million raised in its presale and more than 360 million tokens sold, Web3Bay is proving that online shopping can be fairer and more accessible. The Flaws of Today’s E-Commerce Platforms Large e-commerce platforms hold too much power, setting high transaction fees that can reach 30%, reducing sellers’ profits. To gain visibility, businesses must pay for advertising, making it hard for small sellers to compete. This system favors companies that can afford high ad budgets while pushing independent businesses into obscurity. Buyers also face challenges. Online stores use personal data for targeted ads rather than fair pricing. Hidden costs, ranking manipulations, and misleading product reviews create an unfair shopping experience. Consumers often pay inflated prices due to aggressive advertising and pricing algorithms that favor profits over value. Environmental concerns add to the problem. Fast shipping increases packaging waste and carbon emissions, while return rates of 25-30% further impact sustainability. These platforms prioritize profit over fair commerce, leaving both sellers and buyers with limited choices and higher costs. Web3Bay is working to change this by putting control back in the hands of users, not corporations. How Web3Bay Offers a Better E-Commerce Solution Web3Bay eliminates middlemen using blockchain-powered smart contracts. Buyers and sellers interact directly, avoiding commission-based pricing that increases costs. This structure ensures businesses keep more of their earnings while offering better deals to consumers. A major advantage of Web3Bay is its community governance. Unlike traditional marketplaces where a central company controls policies, Web3Bay allows 3BAY token holders to vote on key decisions. This means no unexpected fee hikes or rule changes favoring large companies. Web3Bay also prioritizes security and user privacy. Unlike mainstream platforms that track users across websites, Web3Bay does not collect personal data for advertising. Payments are secured through cryptocurrency, reducing fraud risks and unnecessary processing fees. With transactions recorded on an unchangeable blockchain ledger, buyers and sellers can trust the transparency of every purchase. By addressing these core issues, Web3Bay is making online shopping fairer and more cost-effective for everyone involved. Web3Bay’s Presale Growth and 3BAY Token System Web3Bay’s presale has gained strong traction, showing the rising demand for decentralized e-commerce. Funds Raised: Over $1.5 million collected so far. Tokens Sold: More than 360 million 3BAY tokens were distributed. Current Presale Stage: Stage 4, with a price of $0.004562625 per token. Total Presale Stages: 28, with prices increasing as each stage progresses. Projected Launch Price: $0.1959 per 3BAY token. Unlike platforms that rely on high fees and advertising, Web3Bay’s token model is built for sustainability. Holding 3BAY tokens offers benefits like discounted purchases, staking rewards, and voting power in governance decisions. There are no hidden charges or expensive memberships—users gain direct advantages by being part of the ecosystem. With presale funding surpassing $1 million, Web3Bay is drawing attention from people looking for fairer, more cost-effective online shopping. The projected 6,430% return from the first to the last presale stage shows the strong potential for early adopters. Web3Bay is Shaping the Future of Online Shopping Web3Bay is not just another shopping platform—it’s a step toward honest, user-driven commerce. By removing unfair fees and protecting user data, it provides an open and fair space for both buyers and sellers. Businesses can operate with fewer restrictions, and consumers get transparent pricing with full control over their transactions. With presale demand rising, Web3Bay is proving that decentralized e-commerce is the way forward. As the platform transitions to full DAO governance, it will continue leading the shift toward fair, user-first online shopping. For those seeking a fairer way to shop and sell online, Web3Bay offers a solution built on transparency and user control.

HBAR price analysis reveals the token’s struggle after a significant 26% decline, with indicators suggesting ongoing market volatility. Concurrently, the PEPE coin price prediction remains speculative as it floats in oversold conditions. While certain cryptocurrencies face hurdles, BlockDAG’s mobile mining ecosystem is flourishing. Over 500,000 users on the X1 App and 200,000 on the TG Tap game illustrate a booming demand for BlockDAG (BDAG) . Its presale has expanded rapidly, bolstering claims that BDAG is the best crypto to mine, especially with forecasts of its value reaching $1 post-exchange listing. HBAR Price Analysis: Uncertainty Prevails Following Sharp Downturn Recent HBAR price analysis highlights a tumultuous phase for Hedera’s token, which has seen a steep 26% drop, breaking its prior bullish momentum. This decline has introduced a sense of uncertainty among traders, as evidenced by a fluctuating funding rate. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also dipped to its lowest in three months, indicating a surge in selling pressure. While there is support at $0.25, the prospects of recovery will hinge on a shift in market dynamics favoring buyers. Traders are now eyeing a potential surge past the $0.33 mark to restore confidence and propel an upward trajectory. PEPE Coin Price Prediction: Anticipating a Market Turnaround? PEPE coin’s price prediction remains uncertain as it struggles to rebound from a substantial 62% fall over the recent months. Now trading at $0.0000095, PEPE has hit what many consider oversold levels on the Stochastic RSI, historically a precursor to robust recoveries. Observers have noted that similar past conditions have catalyzed significant rallies. If this trend repeats, PEPE might experience a noteworthy resurgence shortly. Nonetheless, the future of PEPE coin price prediction also heavily depends on broader economic factors, including ongoing US-China trade tensions, which continue to sway investor sentiment and market stability. BlockDAG Mining Explosion: X1 App Reaches 500K Users, TG Tap Nears 200K BlockDAG’s approach to mobile mining is capturing widespread attention, as evidenced by the half-million users on the X1 App and nearly 200,000 on the TG Tap game . This surge underscores a shift from traditional, complex mining setups to a more accessible, mobile-based model. BDAG mining offers an alternative to the expensive, high-energy setups of the past. Users can now mine BDAG with simple taps on their smartphones, highlighting BDAG as one of the best cryptos to mine for those seeking to engage in crypto accumulation without technical complexities. The X1 App facilitates passive mining on both iOS and Android , running quietly in the background with minimal energy consumption. Meanwhile, TG Tap offers a dynamic, game-based experience on Telegram, where users earn Tap Points through engaging gameplay, later converting to BDAG. Both methods are designed for simplicity, with referral systems that enhance earnings potential by encouraging user-involved expansion. As these mined coins prepare to enter the market, with BDAG’s presale already amassing over $196.7M and an impressive 2380% price increase since its initial offering, the question looms: What will happen when these coins debut on exchanges? With BDAG’s value poised to climb, those mining now are positioned to benefit from significant gains as demand grows and supply tightens, affirming BDAG’s status as the best crypto to mine in an increasingly competitive market. Summing Up! HBAR’s path to recovery is clouded with challenges, with resistance at $0.33 marking a critical juncture according to the latest price analysis. Traders are advised to remain vigilant as they await signs of a bullish reversal. Meanwhile, PEPE’s potential for a comeback is intriguing yet dependent on external market forces. BlockDAG’s mining innovation continues to draw vast numbers of users, with its presale success and anticipated market value increase suggesting a bright future. As the market evolves, BDAG solidifies its position as the best crypto to mine , potentially offering lucrative returns as it gears up for its market debut.

The admission of an XRP-spot ETF application by the SEC has stoked conjecture about the future of XRP. According to some experts, the XRP price prediction is $10 if institutional interest and legislative efforts keep increasing as the price is hovering at $2.70 and gaining speed. Though Remittix (RTX) is the one to keep an eye on in 2025, Ripple (XRP) has significant long-term potential. Its creative crypto-to-fiat conversion mechanism will fundamentally rethink current cross-border transactions. Read on to get more information about the token. XRP Price Prediction: Could SEC’s ETF Acknowledgment Push Ripple to $10? Friday, February 14 saw a significant advancement in the US XRP-spot ETF movement. Officially beginning the review process for yet another XRP-spot ETF, the SEC accepted the 19b-4 application from 21 Shares . This, along with the SEC’s approval of Grayscale’s application, suggested a prospective change in XRP’s perspective by authorities, triggering a positive XRP price prediction. Investors are awaiting SEC rulings on identical petitions from Bitwise, Canary Funds, and WisdomTree. Should the SEC revoke its appeal and authorize an XRP-spot ETF, XRP demand might surge dramatically. Ripple has expanded its footprint in the US after the July 2023 decision on XRP sales, therefore raising XRP’s awareness. Furthermore, very important for XRP’s market behavior might be a possible interface with SWIFT. An XRP-spot ETF might draw institutional players seeking crypto with practical use. Posting his XRP price prediction on X, crypto expert and multimedia producer ALLINCRYPTO anticipates XRP to maybe reach $10 in 2025. His XRP price prediction is fueled by the recent SEC ETF acknowledgment. Remittix Is Poised For A Massive Rally Providing fast and reasonably priced cross-border solutions, Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by aggregating FIAT transactions with blockchain technologies. Supported by more than forty cryptocurrencies like Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the site provides rapid translations into FIAT currencies like USD and GBP, therefore enabling simple bank account deposits. By supporting over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ FIAT currencies, so simplifying world trade with its wide range of possibilities. Remittix is the better alternative to conventional payment providers like Stripe and Wise as a link between crypto and FIAT, both crypto-exclusive systems like Coinbase Wallet and Remittix guarantees accessibility and inclusivity for companies and people by supporting over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ FIAT currencies, so simplifying world trade. Notable also is the platform’s open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over absurd rates of exchange of conventional banks. In the payments industry, remittix is revolutionary since this approach guarantees that the whole amount transferred reaches the recipient, therefore addressing unethical activity all too often. At $0.0628 in the presale stage, the RTX coin offers a good investment potential. Forecasts reveal an interesting rise; demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions is generating a 25 x multiplier in the presale phase and over 1,500 % increases following launch.

This latest product, listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange on Thursday, expands the asset manager’s digital asset offerings after it launched its spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year. EZPZ ETF offers low-cost Bitcoin and Ethereum exposure The EZPZ ETF follows the price movements of Bitcoin and Ethereum according to CF Benchmarks’ Institutional Digital Asset Index, which seeks the two most compliant cryptocurrencies under international financial law. Rather than focus on a single asset, the index distributes investments in accordance with market capitalization, with 82% of an investment in EZPZ exposed to Bitcoin while the remaining 18% is correlated to Ethereum’s price movement. EZPZ, for its part, has an expense ratio of 0.19%, making it one of the cheapest cryptocurrency investment offerings on the market. Roger Bayston, Franklin Templeton’s head of digital assets, said the firm aimed to make digital asset exposure more available to everyday investors. Bayston said in a press release that blockchains are becoming powerhouses for today’s and tomorrow’s information and data economy. He noted that they are bringing EZPZ to market as a simple, low-cost way to gain exposure to this now large and significant asset class. Franklin Templeton expands crypto efforts but trails industry giants in AUM Franklin Templeton’s entry into cryptocurrency continues to grow. While its Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) has $708 million in assets under management (AUM)—ranking ninth out of 11 U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs—it lags far behind the $56.6 billion in AUM for BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT). Franklin Templeton’s Ethereum ETF (EZET) is seventh in its category, with $34 million in AUM. The asset management company actively engages with the crypto community even though it still substantially trails competitors in AUM. The firm’s digital assets division shared a lighthearted image earlier this week on X featuring Benjamin Franklin donning a hat that looks like a McDonald’s uniform. The image referred to a common Crypto Twitter meme about traders struggling in such difficult market conditions. The caption said, “Putting the fries in the bag.” Franklin Templeton is one of several large asset managers on the march into digital assets. Competitors like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have been eyeing spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs with growing investor interest. Institutional adoption of crypto is still on the rise. Earlier this month, Mubadala Investment Company — Abu Dhabi’s sovereign wealth fund — reported it had acquired $436 million worth of shares in BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF, indicating increased interest from international financial institutions. With Franklin Templeton making strides in the digital assets space, EZPZ serves as a strategic growth opportunity to provide investors with diversified exposures to cryptocurrencies in a cost-efficient structure that is ideal for investors looking for long-term crypto investment without direct ownership headaches.

This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Peanut the Squirrel, and Shiba Inu. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Burn – The Secret to Its Skyrocketing Value The Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) burn mechanism is fueling an intense demand. Unlike traditional presales, unsold tokens are permanently burned every week, making APC scarcer with each phase. After the presale ends, any remaining tokens will be eliminated, cementing its deflationary nature. Built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo Coin’s burn strategy ensures long-term sustainability and exponential price appreciation. With fewer tokens in circulation, demand is expected to soar – and so will the potential gains. The project’s unique model has already attracted investors looking for the best crypto to invest in for massive returns. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Blizzard Bay Presale – Don’t Miss Out! Arctic Pablo Coin meme coin presale has now reached Blizzard Bay, its 11th phase, marking another milestone in its thrilling presale journey.

With over $1.44 million already raised, the excitement is at an all-time high. As Arctic Pablo ventures into its next location, prices will rise again. The question is—how long before the window closes? Investors keen on maximizing gains are jumping in now before the next wave of increases. Peanut the Squirrel Unveils Its Long-Awaited Staking Feature Peanut the Squirrel is shaking up the meme coin space with its latest move—staking rewards! The project recently announced that holders can now stake their tokens and earn impressive APYs. This new feature is designed to reward long-term believers in the project while stabilizing token supply. With staking now live, Peanut the Squirrel is expected to see an uptick in demand as investors look for passive income opportunities. Shiba Inu’s Latest Whale Accumulation Sparks Buzz Shiba Inu is back in the spotlight after a massive whale accumulation. A recent on-chain report revealed that a crypto whale scooped up billions of SHIB tokens, fueling speculation of an impending price surge. Historically, such large transactions have preceded bullish rallies, and the Shiba Inu community is buzzing with anticipation. As SHIB continues to expand its ecosystem, investors are closely watching for its next big move. The Final Verdict – Which Crypto Holds the Greatest Potential? All three projects—Arctic Pablo Coin, Peanut the Squirrel, and Shiba Inu—are making waves, but only one stands out as the best crypto to invest in right now. With its unique presale structure, aggressive burn mechanism, and insane ROI potential, Arctic Pablo Coin is leading the charge.

BTC’s high dominance usually signals that altcoin season is upon us. The crypto market has witnessed a spectacular run since Trump’s US election victory and inauguration. Overwhelming bullish sentiment following the US election and inauguration of Donald Trump has triggered massive gains. Bitcoin (BTC) smashed its all-time high many times, peaking at $109,114 on January 20. While the market has corrected since, BTC trades around the $98,000 price point, suggesting it could make a run for the elusive $100,000 again. Altcoin Battle Continues But Makes Significant Gains in the Past Week Meanwhile, BTC remains the undisputed leader of the crypto world and maintains its reputation as the most trusted digital asset. As the dominant store of value, BTC is the go-to choice for institutional investors, and spot BTC ETFs witness record inflows. While BTC asserts its position as the top investment choice, many altcoins have surpassed its profit potential. We are approaching the peak of Bitcoin’s dominance following its halving event, and investors are turning their attention to smaller assets, indicating the start of the altcoin season. BTC’s dominance is currently 60.27%, ETH’s dominance measures 10.2%, and other altcoins measure 29.3%. Cardano (ADA) Gains Along with Other High-Profile Altcoins Cardano (ADA) has been one of the top performers in the past year, gaining nearly 30%. It is trading for $0.79 and has gained 2.75% in the past day. ADA skyrocketed after Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed plans to help shape US crypto policy under Donald Trump’s administration. Cardano (ADA) is a dynamic crypto market player prized for its robust fundamentals and innovative approach to blockchain. Cardano’s recent surge in interest stems from its active community and continued improvements to its infrastructure. Investors are optimistic about Cardano's potential in the bull run, fueled by its unique features and unrelenting commitment to academic research. With an emphasis on security and scalability, Cardano is well-positioned for future growth, making it a prime investment opportunity. As more and more projects build on the Cardano blockchain, demand for Cardano (ADA) is expected to rise, solidifying its already strong market position. Dogecoin (DOGE) Loses Momentum Despite Musk and Trump’s DOGE Success in the US Dogecoin (DOGE) has undoubtedly followed BTC’s trajectory since Donald Trump secured the presidential victory. Despite reaching a noteworthy price after Trump’s involvement, DOGE stumbled significantly after President Trump’s inauguration. The OG memecoin is the largest by market cap and is the 8th largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $37 billion. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man with a net worth exceeding $400 billion, is the CEO of Tesla, owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and one of the president’s closest confidants and most prominent supporters. Musk recently joined the Trump campaign and was integral to Trump’s victory. Since the Trump administration stepped into office, DOGE, which Musk has led, unearthed significant government overspending and identified enormous funds allocated to foreign projects that have not helped the US in any way except by increasing the US’s economic deficit to $32 trillion. Husky Inu (HINU) Presale Soars Amid President Trump’s Incredible First Days Back in Office Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest members of the Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by harnessing the power of this popular blockchain. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $711,000, with numbers rapidly rising as the new Commander-in-Chief continues to make waves in Washington, DC. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM), currently priced at $0.01 during the opening phase of its presale, is rapidly gaining momentum as investors shift focus toward high-growth opportunities. With over 75% of its initial presale stage already sold and $831,568.80 raised in a matter of days, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself not just as a competitor but as a potential disruptor aiming to outpace established tokens like Solana (SOL). Mutuum Finance Presale Rises Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has sparked intense interest since launching the first phase of its presale, attracting 1,500 holders in days. Priced at $0.01, the token offers a rare entry point for investors seeking exponential gains. Early participants stand to realize a guaranteed 600% return once MUTM hits its launch price of $0.06, a figure already locked in by the project’s structured presale model. Beyond this immediate upside, analysts tracking the project’s roadmap are forecasting a surge to $1 in 2025, translating to a 100x gain from current levels. The presale’s rapid progress, driven by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique value proposition, highlights a growing appetite for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that merge utility with investor incentives. As Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) grapple with incremental growth, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche as a low-cost, high-reward alternative. To fuel presale participation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $100,000 giveaway, distributing prizes across 10 lucky holders. The campaign, detailed on the project’s official channels, underscores its community-driven ethos. A Dual-Market Lending Ecosystem Central to Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal is its decentralized lending protocol, which enables peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. The P2C model allows users to deposit assets like USDT into liquidity pools, earning passive income through adjustable interest rates tied to market demand. Borrowers, meanwhile, can leverage crypto holdings such as Ethereum (ETH) as collateral to secure loans without liquidating their positions, a feature that maintains portfolio exposure while unlocking liquidity. The P2P marketplace further diversifies opportunities by enabling direct negotiations between users, bypassing traditional liquidity pools. Every transaction operates under audited smart contracts, ensuring security and transparency. This dual approach not only broadens accessibility but also drives consistent platform engagement, a critical factor for sustaining MUTM’s long-term value. Price Stability Through Strategic Mechanisms Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is tackling one of DeFi’s persistent challenges, volatility, through an innovative buy-and-distribute system. A portion of platform fees will automatically purchase MUTM tokens from the open market, redistributing them to stakers. This mechanism creates recurring demand for the token, effectively cushioning against price dips and fostering gradual appreciation. Combined with plans to launch an overcollateralized stablecoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building an ecosystem designed for both stability and growth. Adding to the momentum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has announced a beta version of its platform will go live alongside its exchange debut. This strategic move ensures immediate utility upon launch, a contrast to projects that delay product rollouts. Users can start lending, borrowing, and staking from day one, accelerating adoption and liquidity. Such operational readiness is resonating with investors who prioritize tangible use cases over speculative hype. As Cardano (ADA) eyes $1 on the back of institutional interest and Solana (SOL) battles network congestion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a fresh narrative: a DeFi project built for rapid scaling, backed by mechanisms that prioritize investor returns. Early movers today could secure not just short-term gains but a stake in a platform poised to redefine decentralized lending. The crypto market is no stranger to breakout stars, but few combine Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s affordability, utility, and growth potential. With Phase 1 selling out faster than anticipated and analysts aligning around a $1 target, now’s the best time to get involved.

Its presale success has shown strong interest from buyers, raising over $1.4 million as of February 14, 2025, with 360 million 3BAY tokens already sold. The presale is in Stage 4, with each token priced at $0.004562625. Analysts expect a strong rise in value, with the launch price projected at $0.1959, potentially giving early buyers a 4,000% increase. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that charge high fees and rely on middlemen, Web3Bay offers a different approach. It allows direct buying and selling through smart contracts, making transactions safer and more transparent. This system reduces fraud risks and attracts both crypto users and businesses looking for a fairer online marketplace. The global online shopping industry is expected to go beyond $8 trillion by 2027, and blockchain technology is improving transaction security and efficiency. While platforms like Amazon and eBay dominate, they lack decentralization, making Web3Bay’s model stand out. More businesses are now looking for lower fees and easier global payments through digital currencies, boosting demand for decentralized marketplaces.

New partnerships with online businesses and blockchain firms will help Web3Bay grow faster. Q2 2025 – Staking Rewards & Market Expansion Users holding 3BAY tokens will be able to earn rewards by staking them. More uses for the 3BAY token will be introduced within the marketplace, leading to higher demand and price steadiness. Collaboration with blockchain companies to improve cross-chain support. Q3 2025 – Moving to Community Governance Web3Bay will introduce a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), allowing the community to take part in decision-making. Token holders will have voting rights on key platform changes, security updates, and future features. This shift ensures long-term decentralization and user-driven growth. Q4 2025 – NFT Marketplace & Full Launch Web3Bay will launch its NFT marketplace, where users can buy, sell, and trade digital collectibles. Final security checks and the full launch of the online marketplace. Expansion into cross-border trade, making global transactions smooth and efficient. What’s Ahead for Web3Bay Users? With a clear strategy and strong presale backing, Web3Bay is in a good position to bring blockchain and online shopping together. Here’s why buyers and users should follow Web3Bay’s journey: Strong Growth Possibility: Early 3BAY holders could see major returns as demand increases after launch. Useful Features: Unlike projects based only on speculation, Web3Bay’s platform is designed for real-world use, making it more sustainable. Secure & Transparent Transactions: Removing middlemen leads to lower costs, better privacy, and safer payments.

This price lag has been compounded by a slowdown in bullish sentiment among investors and a slowing euphoria regarding the crypto-positive influences of Trump’s new administration in the US. Despite this rally slowdown, technical analysis continues to support a bullish long-term outlook for Bitcoin. The current stagnation appears to be a re-accumulation phase for bullish investors; a pattern observed multiple times before major upward moves this cycle. Furthermore, analysis shows that the USDT dominance is going to play a crucial role in triggering the next Bitcoin rally toward $150,000. Bitcoin’s Re-Accumulation Phase And The Role Of USDT Dominance According to a technical analyst (TradingShot) on the TradingView platform, Bitcoin is currently exhibiting an interesting accumulation trend alongside the USDT dominance. The USDT dominance reflects the percentage of the total crypto market capitalization in USDT, indicating whether traders favor stablecoins over riskier crypto assets. A high USDT dominance typically signals low buying pressure in cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a declining USDT dominance often suggests that traders are rotating funds back into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly PPO Turns Red At $102,000, What It Means For The Bull Market Interestingly, the USDT dominance has had a crucial simultaneous occurrence with Bitcoin’s preparations for rallies this cycle. Two notable re-accumulation periods have occurred after Bitcoin bottomed in November 2022, with each leading to significant price rallies. The first accumulation period spanned from January 2023 to March 2023, while the second occurred between November 2023 and February 2024. Both of these re-accumulation phases took place at the 0.5 Fibonacci extension level from an earlier accumulation phase. Additionally, these phases shared common characteristics, including a peaking 1-day RSI structure in the USDT dominance chart and a pullback in the Dollar Index (DXY). Now, Bitcoin appears to be mirroring the same conditions again, with USDT dominance and the DXY pulling back with the current re-accumulation phase, which has been playing out since December 2024. If the pattern continues to unfold as expected, this could indicate that Bitcoin is on the verge of its next major rally. USDT To Send BTC To $150,000 If Bitcoin follows the pattern observed in previous rallies this cycle with the USDT dominance to the core, the re-accumulation phase could end within the next one or two weeks and eventually cause another rally to new all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Unravels 157-Day Fractal Similar To Last Cycle, Why A Surge To $169,000 Is Possible In terms of a target, the analyst noted a potential $150,000 target for the Bitcoin price, at least before another major correction and a subsequent accumulation phase. However, Bitcoin must overcome key resistance levels, particularly the psychological $100,000 mark, which has served as a major hurdle in recent weeks. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $97,175, up by 1.6% in the past 24 hours. A move to $150,000 will represent a 54% increase from the current price.

Analysts are pointing to some red flags like big holders dumping their stash and charts looking more like a rollercoaster than a steady climb. PEPE price prediction is now a hot topic, with many expecting a dip, given the coin’s known wild price swings. The worry is that if the big fish start selling off their PEPE, the smaller players might follow, pushing the price down even further . Tech indicators aren’t painting a rosy picture either, showing signs of a weakening grip on support levels. While PEPE has had its moments of glory, the current consensus leans towards a correction phase. Investors are advised to keep an eye out and weigh the risks before diving in. Panshibi (SHIBI): The Underdog Crypto Poised for a Financial Leap While PEPE is wrestling with its ups and downs, along comes the fresh face, Panshibi (SHIBI), catching everyone’s eye with talks of huge potential. This panda-themed token isn’t just adorable; it’s clever too, leveraging awesome branding and meme magic to make its mark. Analysts are whispering about a potential 100x surge after launch, positioning it as one of the best crypto to invest in for those looking for the next big thing. Here’s the deal: Panshibi (SHIBI), a meme coin leveraging panda-themed branding and viral trends, has been making waves in the cryptocurrency market. As of today, Panshibi is currently in its presale phase, with the token priced at $0.005 and set to increase to $0.006 soon. The listing price is projected to be $0.026. The presale has already raised over $1M, which is 20.63% of the target. The project aims to attract investors excited about niche cryptocurrency projects and meme-driven trends. Panshibi focuses on transparent pricing, future exchange listings, and community engagement. This shift towards newer tokens like Panshibi suggests that investors are looking for fresh opportunities rather than sticking with established names like PEPE. Meme coins live off hype, and those that can get ahead of the wave of community interest often come out on top. Investor Strategies Amidst Market Fluctuations The PEPE price prediction gurus start sounding the alarm, you know it’s time to get your head in the game. Folks aren’t just sitting on their hands; they’re moving their cash from PEPE to greener pastures like Panshibi, looking for those gems before they hit the jackpot. In the world of crypto, especially with meme coins like PEPE, timing is everything – you need to jump on opportunities before they are known all over social media. Panshibi’s presale? It’s like stumbling upon a goldmine. They’ve got this whole roadmap laid out, not just about making a bank but about building something real with the community. Shifting Trends: From Old Meme Coins to New Opportunities If you’re on the hunt for the top crypto to invest in, keeping tabs on Panshibi’s journey is just smart money. The trend’s clear as day: with PEPE price prediction signaling uncertainty, the cash is flowing from the old meme coins to the ones with new stories and strong backing. Diversifying and nailing the timing, that’s secret sauce, helping us navigate this wild crypto ride, balancing the thrill of possible gains with the rollercoaster of risks. As we witness this paradigm shift in the crypto market, it’s essential to stay informed and agile, ready to grab emerging opportunities that could define the next generation of digital wealth.

The listing creates the requisite trading framework for the fund while waiting on approval from the U.S Securities Exchange Commission. DTCC also facilitates the clearing and settlement of securities transactions in the U.S., and accordingly, its listing is rather a preparatory step. DTCC listing does not mean that the security has sought approval from the SEC; however, it will enable the market players to expect considerable trading. Canary Capital first applied for a Litecoin ETF in October 2024. Other firms like Grayscale and CoinShares have also filed similar applications to the one submitted to the SEC. However, Canary’s filing is still likely to be the first decision made by the SEC on its filing. Favorable Outlook for Litecoin ETFs Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart also believe that the chance of a Litecoin ETF’s approval is rather high. They pointed out that Litecoin is compliant with some regulatory criteria, given that Litecoin is already recognized as a commodity by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This classification enhances the ETF’s argument in relation to other applications for funds of other digital assets with legal ambiguity. As we reported on Wednesday, the SEC confirmed a separate filing of the Nasdaq exchange to list a Litecoin ETF by CoinShares. The agency is now seeking public comments on the Nasdaq rule changes, which is in line with the regulation’s approval process. The rise in demand for Litecoin ETFs may be attributed to a common phenomenon of growing institutional investment in cryptocurrencies. A spot Litecoin ETF means traditional investors can invest in this digital currency without having to deal with direct custody or on-chain transactions. Litecoin’s price has surged over 100% since the first ETF filing was submitted to the SEC. According to CoinGecko data, the asset is currently trading around $130, reflecting a 2% gain in the past hour. Since the first ETF filing was submitted to the SEC, Litecoin’s price has increased by more than 100%. According to CoinGecko, the asset is hovering at $130 and has risen 2% in the last hour. Pundits are expecting a major boost in the ETF if the SEC ratifies the decision. Market analyst Crypto Surf has supported Litecoin in reaching $5,000 in the current cycle based on the symmetrical triangle breakout from the six-month chart. Such a transition would mean an increase of its market capitalization by almost 40 times, raising it to $ 377 billion based on the circulating supply. Source: TradingView Another crypto analyst, Professor Moriarty, noted that Litecoin has created a bull flag on the daily chart and broken out from a key resistance level. If the asset stays above this line, $218 could be the next level that might be achieved.

The department has been collecting lists of probationary employees at the Pentagon, pushing people like Jesse Watters to speak on behalf of military veterans. War veterans face a different threat at home After facing and surviving hellish battlefields, military veterans are now facing the new threat of cost-cutting layoffs. The Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk, aims to slash $1T in federal spending by July 2026. A significant portion of these cost slashes have targeted probationary employees. Probationary employees are individuals who have not yet completed their initial period of federal service. This group of individuals includes military veterans who are attempting to start their second careers within federal agencies. Jesse Watters, who previously applauded the work of the DOGE, calling Elon Musk “a corporate turnaround artist” made a heartfelt appeal on Wednesday’s episode of “The Five” asking Elon Musk and DOGE officials to rethink their strategy. The Fox News host apparently made the plea because of a close friend. Watters claimed his friend is a decorated 20-year military veteran who recently joined the Pentagon and is now at risk of losing his job and chance at a federal position. Watters especially highlighted the injustice of the Musk-led team’s strategy, stating in his argument that veterans who have “put their lives on the line” should not be the first to face layoffs. Business Insider reports that many military veterans like Watters’ friend are feeling confused, desperate, and terrified at the possibility of being affected by the DOGE budget cuts. DOGE strategies continue to make headlines While the objective of DOGE is to eliminate wasteful spending and enhance governmental efficiency, its methods seem to lack nuance. According to a post on DOGE’s X account, the agency’s officials have been looking into the Department of Defense for areas where they can “save taxpayer dollars and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse,” but targeting probationary employees fails to consider individual contributions and the responsibility of the government toward its veterans. “This guy is not a DEI consultant. This guy is not a climate consultant. This guy is a veteran. So when you’re talking about DOGE-ing people, veterans should get priority. Because if you’re going to go out there and kill enemies, put your life on the line for this country, you shouldn’t be in the same category as people that are doing DEI,” Watters said. Thousands of federal workers employed in probationary roles in federal agencies such as the Forest Service, the Office of Personnel Management, the Small Business Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Department of Education, and many others have been let go. Layoffs are not all the Department of Government Efficiency has up its sleeves. There have been discussions about reallocating a portion of the savings achieved by DOGE . James Fishback proposed issuing $5,000 checks to Americans as dividends from the cost-cutting measures. Elon Musk acknowledged the proposal, indicating he would discuss it with President Trump. However, whether or not the proposal will be approved is left to be seen as it could face pushback from lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

If it happens, this could lead to large-scale institutional buying, possibly pushing SOL above $400. While this is exciting, many retail traders are focusing on an even bigger opportunity—Web3Bay. Web3Bay is gaining traction as a blockchain-powered marketplace, offering a decentralized alternative to Amazon and eBay. Instead of relying on institutional investors to lift asset prices, Web3Bay’s early buyers are securing strong positions before it reach exchanges. With its presale surpassing $1.50 million and 360 million coins sold, Web3Bay is on track to bring major changes to online commerce. Solana’s ETF approval could bring steady price gains, but Web3Bay’s early-stage value and real-world use case make it one of the most attractive crypto projects in 2025. Solana ETF Speculation: Can SOL Reach $400? Solana is known for its high efficiency, leading decentralized exchange (DEX) trading volume with $5.1 billion in daily transactions. Its fast processing and scalability have made it a top choice for DeFi platforms, NFT markets, and meme coin traders, solidifying its position as a leading Layer-1 blockchain. A major driver of Solana’s growth in 2025 is the possibility of a spot ETF approval, which would allow traditional investors to gain SOL exposure without direct holdings. If approved, institutional demand is expected to increase significantly, with predictions that SOL could surpass $250 in the short term and potentially hit $350–$400 if demand grows stronger by year-end. Technical signals are mixed, with an RSI of 56 suggesting moderate bullish momentum, while an ADX of 15 indicates market consolidation. However, recent $16 million inflows show renewed interest in SOL, and ETF approval could spark a major rally. While Solana’s ETF potential is drawing attention, some traders are seeking faster and higher returns in newer blockchain projects with strong utility. That’s where Web3Bay comes in. Web3Bay’s 4200% Growth Target: The Future of Decentralized E-Commerce While Solana’s progress depends on institutional backing, Web3Bay is showing how blockchain can create a better online shopping system. Unlike platforms that charge high fees and limit transactions, Web3Bay enables direct transactions between buyers and sellers, giving users full control over their purchases. Web3Bay’s presale is already performing well, with over $1.50 million raised and 360 million coins sold. Its current price of $0.00456 is set to rise to $0.1959 at launch, meaning early adopters could see a 4200% increase. Unlike speculative meme coins, Web3Bay is tackling a trillion-dollar online commerce industry, offering real-world value. This blockchain-based platform is gaining attention because it directly addresses common problems in online shopping. High fees, restricted payment methods, and centralized control have long been issues for buyers and sellers. Web3Bay eliminates these problems by using smart contract escrow, ensuring secure payments. It also accepts both crypto and fiat, making it easier for users to adopt. With features like staking rewards, DAO governance, and a user-controlled marketplace, Web3Bay is not just another presale—it represents a shift in how people buy and sell online. As interest in decentralized platforms grows, Web3Bay is set to be a major part of the next phase of blockchain adoption. Solana’s Institutional Appeal vs. Web3Bay’s Rapid Growth Opportunity The choice is clear—Solana is a strong, well-established blockchain with ETF-driven growth potential, while Web3Bay offers a chance for higher early-stage gains. If the Solana ETF is approved, it could push SOL to higher levels, but Web3Bay’s decentralized platform is entering one of the fastest-growing areas of blockchain. With its presale still open, Web3Bay is attracting early adopters before it gets listed on major exchanges. Those who see the potential of blockchain-powered e-commerce are securing 3BAY coins at the lowest prices available. Solana’s ETF approval may take months, and while it offers long-term potential, Web3Bay presents a more immediate and high-growth opportunity for those willing to get in early. Will you wait for Solana’s ETF approval, or will you take advantage of Web3Bay before it rises in value?

Just four weeks ago, its share stood at 25.5%, with Blur dominating the space. The Block reports that this surge coincides with OpenSea’s long-awaited announcement of its native token, SEA, on Feb. 13. Since the token reveal, OpenSea’s daily trading volume has skyrocketed, averaging $17.4 million, nearly five times its pre-announcement average of $3.47 million. The number of daily transactions also more than doubled, jumping from 6,100 to 14,700 trades. The bulk of this growth came in the past week, as OpenSea’s market share spiked from 42.4% to 71.5%, largely at Blur’s expense . OpenSea has encountered obstacles in its incentive rollout, despite the momentum. After users accused the platform of promoting wash trading and giving fee production precedence over actual ecosystem engagement, it recently suspended its XP-based incentives system. Devin Finzer, CEO of OpenSea, recognized the criticism and said the team is reassessing its strategy even though liquidity incentives are still crucial.

In addition, XP multipliers are available for those who’ve held top-volume NFT collections for more than three months. Although information about the SEA token is still limited, OpenSea has stated that U.S. users are eligible for the airdrop and that allocation will be based on past platform activity, which could potentially compensate traders who were active during the 2021 NFT bull run.

The maximum supply of Pi is 100 billion, with about 9.7 billion currently in circulation. However, after hitting ATHs above $2, the price has now crashed and is trading at $0.78. Down by more than 55%, Pi’s price is fluctuating, and people are selling aggressively. Looking ahead, OKX has listed Pi, but Binance, the leading exchange, has not yet done so. Binance has stated that they will only list Pi if it meets certain criteria, which it hasn’t done yet. However, once these criteria are met, Binance is likely to list Pi, potentially driving the price higher. The future of Pi Network is uncertain, but some believe it has the potential to create significant returns. Analyst Kim Wong took to social media and wrote, “Trading in Pi is disappointing as pioneers keep selling and buy orders are small ( highest 1K Pi, on average a few hundred Pi). No big capital is insight. However, this can also be look at as positive, as sellers exhausted, and buyers jump in, price should go back up again.” “No matter what, what is important is PI network has successfully open its network to the world and as people understand the power of Pi Network, price will go up when big capital jump in. Hold your precious Pi coins,” he added. According to the founders, the Pi Network ecosystem is designed to be fully functional and user-friendly, accessible through the Pi Browser. This interface allows seamless navigation, enabling a single sign-on for Pioneers across all Pi apps. It also supports secure in-app payments through the Pi Wallet app and facilitates the visibility and sharing of Pi Web 3 apps via Web 2 browsers. This creates a loop where Pi’s millions of users can support the network’s growth by sharing apps. While developer tools are crucial, mass adoption depends on developers creating real utilities and businesses providing genuine use cases for the Pioneer community.

Dogecoin drops 32%, Double top signals more decline ahead Dogecoin (DOGE) has dropped 32% this month, now trading at $0.25. Analysts spot a Double Top pattern, a bearish sign that could push prices lower. Key resistance is at $0.2560, while support sits at $0.22, and a deeper level is between $0.176 and $0.18. Technical signals are mixed. The RSI shows weakness, while the TD Sequential hints at a bounce. DOGE has climbed above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement, but it still struggles to break key levels. A move past $0.2620 could flip momentum, but failure may send it toward $0.2350. As Dogecoin stalls, 1Fuel (OFT) is surging up 80% in presale, offering real-world blockchain solutions while DOGE fights to regain strength. Avalanche struggles below $25 amid market uncertainty Avalanche (AVAX) is facing heavy resistance at $25, struggling to regain momentum after a 38% drop this month. Analysts warn that if AVAX fails to flip $34.50 into support, it could see another 5% decline. However, if buyers step in, a 17% recovery remains possible. Technical indicators remain bearish. RSI signals selling pressure, and moving averages confirm a strong downtrend. Institutional investors remain cautiously optimistic, but AVAX must break resistance to regain strength. A prolonged consolidation could lead investors to look elsewhere for higher returns. However, the surging 1Fuel (OFT) is already up 80% in presale with a clear uptrend, unlike Avalanche’s uncertain price action. 1Fuel (OFT) presale surges 80%, Could a 120x rally be next? 1Fuel (OFT) is catching fire in Stage 4 of its presale, with its price already up around 80%, climbing from $0.01 to $0.018. Investors have poured in over $2.25 million, and with demand rising, many are betting on a massive breakout once the token hits exchanges. The core feature that sets 1Fuel apart is its one-click cross-chain transactions, eliminating the headache of switching between wallets and paying high network fees. It also comes with a privacy mixer to keep transactions anonymous and cold storage solutions to keep assets safe from hackers. These features aren’t just hype—they solve real problems. The project isn’t slowing down. A P2P exchange, AI-powered trading tools, and crypto debit cards are all on the roadmap, making 1Fuel more than just another presale token. With a tier-one exchange listing expected soon, early investors are positioning themselves for major gains. With analysts eyeing a 120x surge, 1Fuel is proving that innovation is the future of crypto. While others chase short-term pumps, this project is building for real adoption. Final thoughts As Dogecoin predictions say a struggle with resistance and Avalanche remains stuck below key levels, the market is shifting toward projects that offer real solutions instead of speculation. Investors are looking for security, efficiency, and ease of use. However, 1Fuel (OFT) is leading this change, offering one-click cross-chain transactions, built-in privacy, and secure cold storage. With its presale nearly sold out and major developments ahead, its growth potential is hard to ignore. This is the last chance to grab 1Fuel at its lowest price.

ETH is gaining pace and an upside break above $2,755 could trigger bullish moves. Ethereum is still showing positive signs above the $2,650 zone. The price is trading above $2,720 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is following a key rising channel with support at $2,725 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,755 and $2,800. Ethereum Price Eyes Upside Break Ethereum price remained supported above the $2,550 level and recently started a decent upward move, but it underperformed Bitcoin . ETH gained pace above the $2,650 and $2,660 resistance levels. The price even cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,845 swing high to the $2,604 low.

With strong presale momentum and rising demand, 1Fuel is shaping up to be a major player in decentralized finance. Over $2 million have been raised in ICO funding, and experts project a 100x growth upon launch. Let’s see why analysts believe it has sky-high potential, possibly reaching 100x growth upon launch. A Closer Look at Pepe Price Movements Pepe’s (PEPE) current price is $0.000009199. This shows a 6.32% decline in the last 24 hours. The Pepe price has experienced a 65% decline from its December highs. However, it is now stabilizing around a key support level at $0.000010. Despite this adjustment, PEPE’s market capitalization remains at roughly $3.85 billion. This figure keeps it firmly in the spotlight among meme coins. Market watchers remain divided about PEPE’s price future. Forecasts for 2025 run between $0.00002 and $0.00008, and they depend on a shift in market sentiment. However, its sustained lack of tangible use cases could pose risks for investors seeking reliable, long-term gains. Also, stories such as a PEPE holder losing $135,000 to a malicious transaction underscore the unpredictability and potential dangers surrounding meme tokens. In light of these developments, many investors are now investigating alternatives like 1Fuel’s ICO, which combines cutting-edge functionality with a clear growth plan. Why Analysts believe 1Fuel has Sky-High Potential 1Fuel (OFT) centers around genuine utility and concrete innovation. Built on cross-chain asset management, 1Fuel’s technology enables effortless one-click swaps across various blockchain networks. This design aims to simplify decentralized finance (DeFi) usage by removing the usual hurdles involved in juggling multiple wallets and platforms, making crypto transactions smoother for a broader audience. Early results from 1Fuel’s ICO have been impressive, with total contributions exceeding $2 million thus far. Now in its fourth presale stage, 1Fuel tokens can be purchased at $0.018 each, and early buyers receive a 20% bonus on their acquisitions. Enthusiasm for DeFi’s user-friendly solutions appears to be fueling 1Fuel’s strong fundraising campaign, reflecting a wider appetite for blockchain projects that blend convenience and efficiency. Artificial intelligence (AI) features also come into play within 1Fuel’s platform, optimizing trading activities for its user base. The inclusion of privacy mixers helps increase anonymity, while a staking program offering up to 30% APR entices participants to remain active within the network. 1Fuel’s tokenomics allocates 50% of the entire token supply to the presale, with the rest designated for community programs, liquidity reserves, ecosystem rewards, and team expansion. By ensuring robust community support and designing for stable, long-term utility, 1Fuel is positioning itself as a force to be reckoned with in the DeFi market. PEPE’s daily price swings still garner attention from opportunistic traders. Yet, for those who prefer investments underpinned by clear objectives and technological advantages, 1Fuel’s ICO presents an intriguing alternative. With the token’s presale in full motion, there is a limited window for investors to enter before 1Fuel secures more widespread exchange listings. The rise of dynamic projects like 1Fuel shows a new wave of blockchain innovation grounded in real-world problem-solving.

The listing , which showed up on DTCC late Thursday Feb. 20, does not guarantee regulatory approval but signals that the necessary infrastructure for trading is being put in place. The DTCC serves as a key clearing and settlement provider for U.S. securities, listing both active ETFs and pre-launch funds awaiting approval. Ultimately, the ETF still requires approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before it can begin trading. Canary Capital initially filed for its Litecoin ( LTC ) ETF in October 2024, ahead of similar applications from Grayscale and CoinShares. If approved, it would be the first U.S. spot ETF for a cryptocurrency beyond Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), potentially paving the way for additional altcoin-based ETFs.

Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently shared his thoughts through a post on X. Balchunas believes there is a 90% likelihood that the Litecoin spot ETF would be approved. He has previously expressed optimism about the possibility of other altcoin ETFs like Ripple ( XRP ) and Solana ( SOL ) getting approved in 2025.

Speaking at CPAC 2025 , Saylor, the executive chairman of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), told an audience packed with investors and conservative leaders that the US has a unique opportunity to own 20% of Bitcoin’s total supply—but only if it acts now. “The US could own 20% of the network like that—for free,” Saylor said on stage. “The dollar would strengthen, the nation would be enriched, and we could generate a $50 trillion to $80 trillion benefit for the United States.” He didn’t mince words. The race for Bitcoin dominance is underway, and in Saylor’s view, there’s only room for one country to take the lead. Bitcoin is America’s next Alaska Saylor compared Bitcoin’s potential strategic value to some of the biggest territorial acquisitions in US history. “This nation became great because of the Louisiana Purchase,” he said, referring to the 1803 deal where the US bought a third of its current landmass from France for what now seems like pocket change. He didn’t stop there. “Then we bought Texas and California from Mexico. Then Alaska from Russia for $7.2 million. Back then, they called it ‘Seward’s Folly.’ But Alaska alone has generated trillions in economic value. What we’re looking at now is the same play—but in cyberspace.” For Saylor, Bitcoin is the new frontier, and the US must claim its stake before rival nations do. “All the Chinese money, the Russian money, the European money—it’s all flowing into cyberspace. The 21st century economy will be built on digital property, and Bitcoin is the foundation.” Saylor argued that America’s financial dominance depends on whether it secures a Bitcoin reserve before other global powers step in. “The Saudis, the Russians, the Chinese, the Europeans—if any of them move first, they’ll get 20% of the network and lock the US out of the future financial system,” he warned. “There’s only room for one country to do this. And it has to be us.” Trump is paying attention Saylor’s push for a US Bitcoin reserve isn’t just theoretical—it’s gaining political momentum. He claimed that the idea is already on the radar of Washington’s power players, including Donald Trump. “President Trump understands the value of property. He understands the value of owning something no one else can take from you,” Saylor said. At a recent event in Miami, Trump spoke about Bitcoin’s role in the US economy, fueling speculation that his administration could make a major move on digital assets. “If we do this now, we erase the national debt, we flip the US into a creditor nation within a decade, and we dominate the digital economy for the next 100 years,” Saylor explained. He also hinted that behind closed doors, discussions are already happening. “There’s an appreciation of Bitcoin’s power throughout the Cabinet, the House, and the Senate,” he said. “There’s going to be a political process to build consensus, but this is happening.” Bitcoin is the strongest asset in the world Saylor laid out why he believes Bitcoin is the only asset worth holding. “It’s the most powerful digital network in the world. It’s the only thing you can own that no government, company, or institution can corrupt,” he said. “No one can print more of it, freeze it, tax it away, or seize it.” He described Bitcoin as ‘economic armor’, protecting individuals and nations alike from financial instability. “You put on this armor, and no one can debank you. No one can steal your savings through inflation. No one can shut you out of the economy,” he said. For Saylor, the US dollar and Bitcoin don’t have to compete—they can work together. “If we integrate Bitcoin into the national reserve, we strengthen the dollar,” he said. “We attract global capital instead of watching it leave. We anchor US financial power in a system that no one else can control.” Saylor says the future is digital, and the US must own it Saylor didn’t shy away from how fast the world is changing. “The 21st-century economy isn’t going to be banks moving money once a day. It’s going to be a billion computers processing transactions at the speed of light,” he said. “The money of the future isn’t going to be sitting in a bank account waiting for an approval—it’s going to be moving across a decentralized network at all times.” He criticized the outdated financial system, saying it isn’t built for the future. “Right now, I have to approve my wire transfers manually. I have to get on the phone and explain why I’m moving my own money,” he said. “That’s a joke in a world where AI is making millions of calculations per second. The system is broken.” He then pointed to Bitcoin’s unstoppable nature. “There’s no middleman, no gatekeeper, no bureaucratic approval process,” he said. “If the US doesn’t own this space, someone else will.” Only one nation can take 20%—who will it be? Saylor made his final argument crystal clear: If the US doesn’t act, another nation will beat them to it. “There is only room for one country to buy 20% of the network,” he said. “And once that happens, it’s over.” He outlined a simple scenario: “If we take 4 to 6 million Bitcoin, we pay off the entire US national debt. We turn America into a financial superpower in a decade. We own the future of digital assets. And we do it before another country beats us to it.” For Saylor, the risk isn’t investing in Bitcoin—it’s waiting too long. “This is the greatest financial opportunity of our time,” he said. “Either we secure our place as the world’s digital superpower, or we watch someone else do it.” As CPAC wrapped up, Saylor left his audience with one final thought. “Bitcoin is the Manifest Destiny of cyberspace,” he said. “And the nation that owns it will own the future.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|Bitcoin|BTC,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-21 03:35:22

This move marks the beginning of a 240-day review period, during which the agency will decide whether to approve or reject the application. Grayscale’s XRP ETF Filing Under SEC Review The SEC’s review process for Grayscale’s proposed XRP ETF formally started after its posting on the Federal Register. The agency now has until October 18, 2025, to make a decision. The process includes a 21-day public comment period, allowing stakeholders to submit feedback. Afterward, the SEC will analyze the proposal and assess market risks, investor protections, and compliance with securities laws. XRP’s legal classification remains a key factor in the ETF’s approval amid speculations of a Ripple vs SEC lawsuit pause . The SEC has previously sued Ripple Labs over whether XRP should be classified as a security, and the case remains unresolved. The regulator has generally been more cautious with altcoin ETFs compared to Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns over market manipulation. XRP Price To Breach $3 Resistance XRP’s price has reacted positively to the ETF developments, with traders anticipating a potential breakout. The token is currently testing key resistance levels, with analysts watching for a move beyond $3.00. Some believe that clearing this level could signal a larger rally. Crypto traders have shared insights on XRP’s price movement. “XRP continues to hold inside a corrective channel, which is typical for a Wave 4,” CasiTrades posted on X projecting an all-time high looming. Another trader, Dark Defender, suggested that the XRP price could move toward $2.77 before testing $3. Market sentiment has also been influenced by speculation about major financial institutions using XRP for transactions. Reports suggest that Bank of America may be leveraging XRP for internal payments, though no official confirmation has been provided. US SEC’s Stance on Crypto Regulation The SEC has been reviewing multiple XRP ETF applications alongside Grayscale’s filing. On February 19, the agency acknowledged applications from asset managers CoinShares, Canary, and WisdomTree. These applications were submitted through exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe BZX. The SEC’s approach to crypto regulation has come under scrutiny in recent months. Under the current administration, the agency temporarily paused its lawsuit against Binance , leading some analysts to believe that regulatory pressure on crypto firms may ease. Consequently, investors are hopeful that this shift could work in Ripple’s favor which may boost XRP price to a new ATH. President Donald Trump’s administration has been viewed as more crypto-friendly, and his recent social media activity has fueled optimism. He shared an article discussing Ripple Labs’ expansion in the U.S., which noted that XRP saw a price surge following the 2024 presidential election. XRP ETF Approval Odds The chances of an XRP ETF approval have risen on Polymarket, where betting odds currently stand at 81%. Concurrently, Brazil recently became the first country to approve an XRP spot ETF, adding to the growing demand for institutional investment in the asset which may push the XRP price to a new ATH. Despite the optimism, some analysts urge caution. Azura CEO Jackson Denka noted that XRP has historically experienced rapid price increases followed by steep declines. “Until we see real adoption and actual progress of their blockchain, it is hard to make the claim that this price is sustainable,” Denka said.

The “Create/Redeem” section is marked as “Y,” part of the standard process when preparing a new ETF. However, SEC approval remains pending.

Such a proposal was well-received by the President of Argentina, Javier Milei, who showed anticipation of the event. Buterin has, in the past, considered Argentina to be one of the best examples of mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. He noted that due to the economic status of the country, blockchain and digital assets are not merely get-rich rituals. In response to the recent LIBRA controversy, Buterin remains optimistic about Argentina’s potential as the blockchain hub. “The energy and determination to build on Argentina’s current momentum and use crypto and other new technologies to build a prosperous 21st-century society is real. The recent news should be taken not as a reason to give up, but rather as an example of why education is so important.” – Buterin. However, Buterin still sees hope for Argentina to contribute to the Ethereum ecosystem even after the LIBRA incident. He said that regional entrepreneurs have played their part in advancing the use of blockchain technology. The decision to host Devconnect in Argentina is an intention of nurturing the growth of the community even further. Milei did not directly answer Buterin’s comments on LIBRA, but he responded nevertheless. He welcomed the idea of hosting the Devconnect, describing it as a privilege and opportunity for Argentina. MUCHAS GRACIAS @VitalikButerin POR TUS PALABRAS SOBRE EL TALENTO ARGENTINO!!! Sería un honor que Argentina sea sede de Devconnect. Coincido que sería una gran oportunidad para nuestro país. VIVA LA LIBERTAD CARAJO…!!! https://t.co/INh1S8MpkQ — Javier Milei (@JMilei) February 20, 2025 Milei faces scrutiny over LIBRA collapse The LIBRA cryptocurrency, which Milei mentioned in a now-deleted social media post, skyrocketed and subsequently plunged. This led to huge losses to investors, leading to allegations of a ‘rug pull’. Milei later defended that he worked ‘in good faith’ and compared investors’ losses to the risks of gambling. Speaking to Argentine news channel Todo Noticias, Milei clarified that he never promoted it, stating, “I didn’t promote it, I merely shared it.”. The presidential office has since said the Anti-Corruption Office will investigate the matter to determine whether the law was violated. There have been increasing complaints of political influence in the emerging cryptocurrencies. Buterin recently also criticized political meme coins, describing them as rigs for unfair political influence. Although he has not stated anything about Milei being affiliated with LIBRA on such projects, his stance remains very clear. Buterin’s stance on crypto ethics During an AMA session recently conducted, Buterin raised some concerns regarding the ethics of the crypto space. He explained that he feels frustrated with the increasing popularity of blockchain gambling and said that he would quit if the community continues to support what he regards as a ‘moral reversal.’ He reaffirmed his commitment to the Ethereum community’s vision and called upon developers to work only on projects that have ethical and social relevance. However, Buterin also noted that the Ethereum Foundation might become more involved in dictating the responsible direction in which this ecosystem will go.

While Shiba Inu’s decline might lead to a decline in investor sentiment toward the meme coin space as a whole, experts believe that there could be an upside. With so many new altcoins emerging in the market, experts believe that Shiba Inu’s dip could give rising stars like PropiChain a chance to shine this quarter. The PropiChain project opens doors of opportunities for investors in the market to leverage real-world assets. Find out why PropiChain has an edge in the market amidst Shiba Inu’s price decline. Shiba Inu Whales Slow Down For the month of February, Shiba Inu’s price has remained stagnant due to the mixed sentiment from investors. The bullish and bearish performance of Shiba Inu’s price has left many investors confused about the project’s future prospects. Already, there has been a reduction in whale activity on the platform as many large-scale investors have reduced their exposure to Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu has been down over 2.4% within the past week, signaling the project’s bearish position in the market. However, analysts say that new opportunities like PCHAIN have an edge over Shiba Inu because of its real-world applicability and benefits. PropiChain: Transforming Property Ownership Through Blockchain Technology It’s the dream of many to become landowners; just picture yourself being the proud owner of a high-end suburban estate. Yet, this dream seems like an impossibility for many due to how expensive it can be to own landed property, but PropiChain is the project that changes this narrative. The PropiChain project offers investors, whether small or large-scale, the opportunity to own fractions of real estate investments through the aid of AI and blockchain technology. Through PropiChain’s distinct technology, bullish investors gain easy access to life-changing wealth; hence, experts believe this project could rival top players like Shiba Inu. One of the major benefits of the PropiChain platform is its asset tokenization model, which allows you to own a portion of prime real estate. So, just imagine having shared ownership of a multi-billion dollar property with PropiChain; you don’t have to worry about the costs because these properties are broken down into affordable tokens. Therefore, if you wish to buy a luxury apartment worth $10 million, you can split your payment into $10,000 tokens and hold a stake in this property for just $1,000. Therefore, rather than making a complete investment into an asset, you can purchase fractional shares instead. Furthermore, by acquiring micro shares in the PropiChain ecosystem, you can begin to receive rental income while also gaining from the appreciation of the property. What’s more exciting is that you don’t have to do it alone; the PropiChain platform allows you to collaborate with other investors by merging your funds to acquire larger properties. With PropiChain, the limitations that are often associated with traditional investment platforms are eliminated; hence, it has an edge over key players like Shiba Inu. Beyond fractional ownership, PropiChain equips traders with AI-powered tools to promote smarter investment decisions. These AI tools are designed to study market trends, target high-potential opportunities, and personalize users’ investing experience. Furthermore, the automated trading function helps you complete your housing deals even while you’re away, thus enhancing user experience. The PropiChain project further enhances its appeal through a thorough security audit carried out by BlockAudit, a certified smart contract auditor. Why PCHAIN Is A Top Pick Among Investors Amidst Shiba Inu’s struggles, PropiChain has stolen the spotlight because of its tangible solutions, which make it a more appealing choice. The PropiChain presale is in round 2, and each token is priced at $0.011. Already, over $1.2 million has been raised, with over 62% of the tokens allocated to this round purchased by savvy investors. The PropiChain project emerges as a top choice among traders who want to expand their portfolio with tangible and long-lasting assets; hence, its presale is a gateway for many. Analysts believe that once PCHAIN launches officially, early investors will receive over 1000% ROI.

Goldman Sachs, one of the most influential financial firms, has increased its Ethereum ETF holdings by 2,000%, bringing its total ETH exposure to $476 million. At the same time, its Bitcoin ETF holdings have surged 114%, now exceeding $1.5 billion. This level of institutional participation was unheard of just a few years ago. Major firms once dismissed cryptocurrencies as risky, but now they are investing billions in BTC and ETH, backing spot ETFs that bring large-scale liquidity to the market. As financial institutions increase their involvement, cryptocurrency is shifting from being a niche interest to a serious asset class. The market is now influenced by long-term capital instead of short-term hype, shaping the future of digital assets. This optimistic outlook is paving the way for the next group of standout cryptocurrencies, extending beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. New blockchain projects that provide real utility are drawing significant investor interest, with Web3Bay leading as a prominent example. The Rise of Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs: What It Means for the Crypto Market Bitcoin is currently valued at around $96,000, reflecting a 41% increase in Q4 2024, as institutional buying continues to grow. With major firms now holding billions in Bitcoin ETFs, analysts predict BTC could soon cross $100K, possibly reaching $150K in 2025. Ethereum is also gaining traction among institutional investors. Trading at $2,680 with a 26% rise in Q4, ETH is expected to outperform BTC in 2025. BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have all introduced Ethereum ETFs, leading to an influx of institutional funds. If this trend holds, Ethereum’s price could climb to $4,000–$5,000 by mid-2025. However, while Bitcoin and Ethereum are leading institutional adoption, they may no longer provide the highest growth potential. Investors looking for major returns are shifting focus to projects that merge blockchain with practical applications, and Web3Bay is one such project. Web3Bay: A New Opportunity in February 2025 Web3Bay is not just another digital project—it brings decentralized commerce into the spotlight. While platforms like Amazon and eBay dominate online shopping, Web3Bay offers a blockchain-based alternative, removing middlemen and providing direct control to buyers and sellers. The timing is crucial. As institutional interest in Bitcoin and Ethereum grows, the entire crypto space is becoming more widely accepted. This positive trend is fueling interest in early-stage projects, and Web3Bay is one of the most talked-about options. Key figures highlight its momentum: Over $1.50 million is raised in presale. 360 million coins already purchased by buyers. Presale price: $0.00456, with an expected launch price of $0.1959, offering a 4200% potential increase. Web3Bay is more than a concept—it provides real solutions within a trillion-dollar industry. Using blockchain technology, it enables direct transactions, lower costs, stronger privacy, and complete purchase control—features missing from traditional platforms. Why Web3Bay Could Be a Strong Option in a Growing Market A common mistake people make during strong market cycles is buying assets that have already increased in price. Bitcoin and Ethereum will likely continue rising, but their highest growth phases are past. The best time to invest is before a project gains mainstream attention—this is why Web3Bay is attracting interest now. With large-scale investors moving into the crypto sector, the demand for blockchain-based solutions is rising. Those who bought Ethereum in 2016 or Solana in 2020 saw substantial profits—Web3Bay presents a similar opportunity for early buyers. If you missed Bitcoin at $1,000 or Ethereum at $100, this could be a similar chance. The Web3Bay presale is currently active, but the supply is decreasing fast. As Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs gain attention, upcoming projects like Web3Bay are also drawing interest. The presale price will rise soon—will you secure your position early, or will you watch from the sidelines?

Pi, the popular tap-to-earn token, was trading at $0.7290 on Friday morning, much lower than Thursday’s high of $2. So, what next for the Pi coin price in the coming years? Pi Network mainnet launch Pi, one of the most popular players in the crypto industry, launched its mainnet on Thursday. The mainnet launch happened after six years when the network remained under development and the pioneers mined millions of tokens. It remained in an enclosed mainnet for over three years. Therefore, the Pi Network mainnet launch was notable because it allowed these pioneers to cash out and true believers to hold the token. The mainnet launch was well-received as many mainstream exchanges decided to list it on the first day. According to CoinMarketCap , most of the Pi Network volume happened on Gate.io, followed by Bitget and OKX. Popular American exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken are yet to list it. Binance, on the other hand, is set to list the Pi coin next week after users overwhelmingly voted to allow it to be listed in the network. Pi Network has become one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the industry. It has a market cap of over $4.2 billion and a fully diluted valuation of $66 billion. That FDV would make it the sixth-biggest player in the sector. Why Pi coin price crashed There are three main reasons why the Pi coin price crashed after the mainnet launch on Thursday . First, Pi coin plunged because many pioneers decided to sell their holdings as soon as it was humanly possible. Historically, many holders of similar tokens tend to sell when the airdrop happens. Most recently, it has happened among popular tap-to-earn tokens like Hamster Kombat , Tapswap, and Catizen. The urgency to sell was more intense since many Pi Network pioneers have been disappointed with the project, especially because of its mainnet launch delays. This also explains why only about 10.1 million pioneers migrated their tokens to the mainnet, a big drop from the 50 million pioneers it had at its top. Second, the Pi coin price crashed because many pioneers have seen other popular new airdrops crash. All popular “to earn” tokens have crashed over the years. This includes play-to-earn tokens like Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), and Gala Games (GALA). It also includes other tap-to-earn tokens like Hamster Kombat, Tapswap, Catizen, DOGS, and Notcoin. Move-to-earn tokens like Sweat Economy and StepN have also plunged. Third, the Pi Network price plunged because of the ongoing crypto bear market. The crypto fear and greed index has moved to the fear zone as most cryptocurrency prices have crashed. Therefore, there are usually high odds that a cryptocurrency will crash if it is launched during a crypto bear market. Pi Network price forecast 2025 to 2026 So, what next for the Pi Network price in 2025 and 2030? There are two prominent schools of thought about this. One camp argues that Pi Network is the next Bitcoin because of its popularity. It predicts that the Pi price will eventually surge from the current $0.6693 to over $100,000 over time. The other camp argues that the Pi Network price will crash over time now that the incentive to mine it has ended. I believe that the Pi Network outlook for between 2025 and 2030 is bearish because of the past performance of other “to earn” tokens. Pi team argues that the ecosystem growth will help to offset this. However, the risk is tha this much-touted ecosystem growth will not happen after all. This is in line with our last Pi forecast .

The firm revealed it recently bought an additional 68.59 BTC for $6.6 million at an average price of $96,335. 0.01% of Total Bitcoin Supply In a February 20 X post , the company highlighted that its BTC reserves now make up “0.01% of total Bitcoin supply.” The Japanese investment firm has been rapidly increasing its Bitcoin holdings as part of its treasury operations. According to its “Bitcoin Plan,” shared on January 28, Metaplanet aims to reach 10,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026. The outfit has significantly increased its purchases of the number one cryptocurrency since mid-2024 when it started using it as a way to protect against inflation. This latest acquisition comes shortly after a previous one earlier this week, where the firm bought 269.43 BTC worth $25.6 million, bringing its total holdings to 2,031 BTC. Before that, Metaplanet had made several other purchases, including its largest one to date in December 2024, when it obtained nearly 620 BTC worth $60.6 million. CEO Simon Gerovich has said that adopting the Bitcoin Standard has been a game-changer, helping establish Metaplanet as Tokyo’s top BTC-focused company. Over the past year, its stock price has surged by more than 4,000%. Additionally, the firm is set to be included in the MSCI Japan Index on February 28, a move expected to attract more investors. Capital Market Activities Metaplanet has been growing its reserves through its Bitcoin Treasury Operations, which officially became a business line on December 18, 2024. The company has been funding these purchases using capital market activities and its revenue. In line with this, its Board of Directors has approved several financial moves. On January 28, 2025, it issued 21 million stock acquisition rights to EVO FUND in five tranches with an adjustable exercise price. On February 10, it also issued zero-coupon bonds worth 4 billion yen to EVO FUND, with the money set aside to buy Bitcoin.

The price is still showing positive signs and might aim for a move above the $2.750 resistance zone. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.620 level. The price is now trading above $2.620 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.720 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair might start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.720 resistance zone. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price remained supported above the $2.550 level. It formed a base and started a strong increase above the $2.62 resistance zone, outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price cleared the $2.650 and $2.680 resistance levels. There was a clear move above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.8320 swing high to the $2.470 low. However, the bears were active near the $2.750 resistance zone. They protected a close above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2.8320 swing high to the $2.470 low. The price is now moving lower below $2.70. The price is now trading above $2.720 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.720 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.720 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $2.750 level. The next resistance is $2.80. A clear move above the $2.80 resistance might send the price toward the $2.850 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.920 resistance or even $2.950 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be $3.00. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $2.720 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.650 level. The next major support is near the $2.60 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.60 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.550 support. The next major support sits near the $2.50 zone.

In his first interview from prison that was released on Thursday, Sam called his trial rigged, accused Biden’s Department of Justice (DOJ) of political interference, and even said that his 25-year prison sentence was a targeted takedown. Sam, who once funneled millions into Democratic campaigns, now says he was secretly supporting Republicans too, but his GOP donations were hidden from public view. He claims his prosecution was orchestrated because of his financial ties to conservative politicians, something he says was “starting to come out” just before he was indicted. “Not being able to just Google something is one of the worst parts of this,” Sam said in his interview. Sam says his case was political, blames Biden’s DOJ for targeting him Speaking from inside the Manhattan Detention Center, Sam accused Judge Lewis Kaplan, the man who sentenced him, of bias. He compared his situation to Trump’s legal battles, saying Kaplan was part of a larger network of judges that Trump’s incoming DOJ considers corrupt. “Trump had a lot of frustrations with Kaplan,” Sam said. “I certainly did as well.” SBF claimed Kaplan made rulings that directly helped the prosecution, including allowing the DOJ to falsely tell the jury that all of FTX’s customers lost everything, while barring Sam’s defense from arguing the opposite. “The jury was told something that was just not true, and Kaplan blocked us from correcting it,” Sam said. He also took direct aim at Danielle Sassoon, the lead prosecutor in his case, who later resigned instead of dismissing a separate corruption case involving New York City Mayor Eric Adams. SBF implied that her sudden departure raises questions about how she handled his case. “My prosecutor has been in the news recently for tussles with Trump’s DOJ,” he said, referring to the growing power struggle between Trump’s legal team and Biden’s remaining prosecutors. Sam believes his case is a perfect example of political weaponization. He pointed to sentencing disparities, claiming that another FTX executive—a Republican who took a plea deal—got a much harsher punishment than three Democrats who also pleaded guilty. “There was a lot of explicit politicization going on,” Sam said. “Threats were made. A Republican congressional candidate was told his wife would be indicted if he didn’t play along with Biden’s DOJ.” Sam claims crypto industry was targeted While mainstream media reports painted SBF as a Democratic megadonor, he now says that’s only half the story. According to him, he was quietly funneling millions into Republican campaigns and conservative causes, but doing so in secret. “It’s sometimes framed in the press that I was giving an extraordinary amount to Democrats, and that Republican donations were just an afterthought,” Sam said . “That’s not true. The Republican side was way bigger than people realized.” Sam says his stance on crypto policy played a major role in his downfall. He spent years lobbying in Washington, working with legislators, regulators, and even the White House. But instead of finding bipartisan allies, he says he became increasingly frustrated with the Biden administration, which he described as being “incredibly destructive” toward crypto. “The Democratic Party was becoming anti-crypto, and I was trying to stop it,” SBF said. “I spent years in D.C. trying to work across the aisle to prevent draconian measures against the industry. But Biden’s administration was impossible to work with.” He believes the government wanted a scapegoat, and he became the easiest target. SBF reiterates that FTX was always solvent, blames bankruptcy lawyers Sam is still maintaining that FTX wasn’t bankrupt when he was forced out. He blames the collapse on outside intervention, saying his company had enough money to fully repay customers before a group of lawyers took control. “There were enough assets to pay everyone back in full in November 2022,” Sam said. “If these debtors hadn’t stepped in, customers wouldn’t have waited two and a half years to get their money.” Sam says the bankruptcy team running FTX misled the public, initially claiming there were only $1 billion in assets, when in reality, they eventually found $15 billion. He says the numbers magically kept increasing over time, proving that the company was never actually insolvent. “At first, they said there was $1 billion. Then a few months later, they found $5 billion. Then it was $7 billion, then $13 billion, then $15 billion,” SBF said. “They just kept pretending there wasn’t money there.” Sam believes that instead of letting him fix the liquidity crisis, the government and bankruptcy lawyers froze everything, leaving FTX customers stranded. “All they had to do was let me run the company for another few weeks,” Sam said. “The money was already there. They chose to sit on their hands for years instead.” SBF defends his business model, says no fraud took place Sam once again denied the fact that he stole customer funds, saying FTX’s structure was always based on borrowing and margin trading. He described FTX’s finances as no different from a bank run, where liquidity temporarily dries up, but assets remain intact. “Most of FTX’s customers traded on margin, which means they borrowed money to buy crypto,” SBF said. “When people do that, the exchange doesn’t hold one-to-one reserves of every deposit. That’s how every trading platform works.” He says his biggest mistake was giving up control of FTX, rather than fighting back against the bankruptcy takeover. “The single biggest mistake I made was backing down in November 2022,” Sam said. “I should have never let these lawyers take over. They spent years lying to customers, telling them there was no money left, when they knew that wasn’t true.” Sam also argued that intent matters in fraud cases, saying that FTX was never in a position where it couldn’t repay customers. He compared it to banks or investment funds that move money around while remaining solvent. “If a company is totally insolvent—like owes ten times what it has—that’s fraud,” Sam said. “But that wasn’t us. FTX always had more assets than liabilities.” Despite being behind bars, SBF said he still believes crypto isn’t going anywhere, and he expects more politicians to get involved. When asked about Trump’s recent meme coin, he said he wasn’t surprised. “Politicians are dipping their toes into crypto,” Sam said. “That’s only going to increase over time.” Asked whether he had any plans if he were to get out of prison, Sam refused to speculate. “I try not to think about it too much right now because there’s nothing I can do, I mean right now I’ve got 20-something years left on my sentence,” he said in the interview. But despite it all, SBF remains focused on one thing—his appeal. “We have oral arguments coming up in the next three to six months,” Sam said. “The odds are always stacked against you in federal court, but I’m cautiously optimistic.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|FTX,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-21 04:19:31

Digital assets, once perceived as speculative investments, are now gaining traction as a legitimate medium of exchange. Businesses across diverse sectors adopt cryptocurrencies for payments, while blockchain technology continues to disrupt traditional processes, offering unparalleled transparency and efficiency. As more individuals embrace the convenience of cryptocurrencies, the demand for tools that facilitate their use in everyday transactions has surged. Among these tools, cryptocurrency cards have become one of the most practical solutions, allowing users to seamlessly integrate digital assets into their daily lives. Cryptocurrency Debit Card and Its Working Principle A cryptocurrency debit card operates much like a traditional debit card, but with one key distinction: it connects directly to a cryptocurrency wallet rather than a conventional bank account. This innovation enables users to spend their digital assets on goods and services, making cryptocurrency more accessible and usable in the real world. Here’s a closer look at how a crypto card works: Linking to a wallet. Users first need to link their cryptocurrency wallet to the card. Wallets can be funded through various means, including SEPA transfers, allowing users to buy Bitcoin with SEPA on supported platforms and then load their crypto card for everyday transactions. Most issuers provide an easy-to-use mobile app or web interface for this purpose. The wallet serves as the source of funds for transactions. Real-time conversion. When a user swipes their card or uses it online, the system instantly converts the cryptocurrency to fiat currency. This conversion occurs at the prevailing exchange rate, ensuring merchants receive payments in their preferred currency. Seamless payments. The card operates on global payment networks such as Visa or Mastercard, allowing it to be used anywhere these networks are accepted. This makes a cryptocurrency debit card a versatile tool for shopping, dining, travel, and more. Security features. Many providers incorporate advanced security measures, including two-factor authentication, encryption, and the ability to lock or freeze the card via a mobile app. These features provide users with confidence in the safety of their funds. The integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional payment infrastructure has significantly lowered the barriers to using digital assets. Whether it’s purchasing groceries or booking a vacation, a crypto card makes it possible to harness the power of blockchain technology in everyday life. How to Get a Crypto Card? The process of obtaining a cryptocurrency card has been streamlined by major providers, making it accessible even for individuals who are new to the crypto space. Here are the detailed steps: Select a card provider. Research reputable companies offering cryptocurrency debit cards. Each provider has its own set of features, including cashback rates, supported cryptocurrencies, and additional perks. Choose one that aligns with your needs and preferences. Complete the KYC process. To ensure compliance with regulations and enhance security, most providers require users to complete a know-your-customer (KYC) process. This typically involves submitting identification documents and proof of address. Fund your wallet. Once your account is verified, transfer cryptocurrency to the wallet associated with the card. Providers often support popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins like USDT or USDC. Order the physical card. After funding your wallet, request your crypto card through the provider’s platform. Physical cards are delivered to your address, while virtual cards are instantly available for online transactions. Activate the card. Activate your card using the mobile app or online platform provided by the issuer. You can then start using it for purchases, withdrawals, or online payments. A Cryptocurrency Card with Cashback and Their Benefits for Everyday Use One of the standout features of a crypto card is its ability to reward users with cashback on purchases. A crypto card with cashback not only incentivizes spending but also helps users grow their cryptocurrency holdings passively. Here are some key advantages of using a Bitcoin card or other cryptocurrency cards for daily transactions: Cashback rewards. Depending on the provider, cashback rates can range from 1% to as high as 10%, depending on the type of card and membership tier. For example, Crypto.com offers tiered cashback rates based on the amount of CRO staked by the user, while the WhiteBIT Nova card offers up to 10% cashback in BTC and zero fees. The rewards are usually credited in the form of cryptocurrency, allowing users to reinvest, stake, or save them for future use. Global usability. Crypto cards are accepted worldwide wherever Visa or Mastercard is supported. This makes them ideal for frequent travelers or individuals who shop internationally. Diverse spending options. Whether you’re buying groceries, dining out, booking flights, or subscribing to online services, a cryptocurrency card can handle all these transactions seamlessly. Enhanced financial benefits. Some providers offer additional perks, such as discounts on streaming subscriptions, access to airport lounges, or priority customer support. These benefits make crypto cards not just a financial tool but a lifestyle accessory. Transparency and control. With a dedicated mobile app, users can track their spending in real time, set budgets, and monitor rewards. This level of transparency is particularly appealing to individuals who want greater control over their finances. Low transaction costs. Compared to traditional banking services, transactions with a cryptocurrency debit card often come with reduced fees. Using a crypto card simplifies the way digital assets are integrated into daily life. From earning rewards to managing finances more effectively, these cards offer a comprehensive solution for individuals looking to maximize the utility of their cryptocurrencies. The introduction of cryptocurrency cards marks a significant milestone in the journey toward mainstream adoption of digital assets. By combining the familiarity of traditional payment methods with the flexibility and innovation of blockchain technology, these cards have become an indispensable tool for crypto enthusiasts. Whether you’re looking to spend Bitcoin on daily expenses, enjoy the perks of a crypto card with cashback, or streamline your financial management, the possibilities are virtually endless. By embracing these innovative solutions, individuals can unlock the true potential of their digital assets and at the same time contribute to the ongoing growth and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the global economy.

Timing is everything in the crypto world, and the right presale can turn small investments into massive gains. While the market sees constant shifts, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making waves with its deflationary model, while GALA and Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) introduce major updates. Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is currently in its Blizzard Bay presale phase, offering early buyers an incredible entry point before launch. Meanwhile, GALA continues to push forward with ecosystem advancements, and ICP is making headlines with its latest blockchain developments. This article covers the latest updates on all three projects: Arctic Pablo Coin, GALA, and ICP. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Model: A Scarcity-Driven Approach Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) brings a powerful deflationary mechanism to the table. Its token burn strategy permanently removes unsold tokens from circulation every week during the presale. Once the presale ends, any remaining supply will also be burned, reducing total supply and driving long-term value. Built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), these transactions ensure transparency and verifiability. Beyond its deflationary nature, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale structure is entirely unique. Unlike traditional tiered phases, APC’s meme coin presale is location-based, simulating Arctic Pablo’s global journey. This approach adds an exciting dynamic, creating urgency as it moves from one location to another. With no rigid stages, each stop introduces new opportunities for investors. Blizzard Bay Presale: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Biggest Opportunity Yet Arctic Pablo Coin has now arrived at Blizzard Bay, its 11th location, following an astonishingly rapid journey through nine previous destinations in under a month. Currently, 1 APC is available for just $0.000059, with an anticipated 12,618.77% ROI from Blizzard Bay to its official launch price of $0.008. This presale has already attracted immense attention, raising over $1.44 million so far. The momentum is only growing, and as Arctic Pablo moves forward, prices will continue to rise. Securing tokens at Blizzard Bay’s price level could be the best crypto investment decision before the next increase. Staking, Rewards, and Exclusive Perks for Early Buyers Investors in Arctic Pablo Coin can stake their APC tokens during the presale and earn an APY of 66%, maximizing their holdings before the token even launches. Additionally, referral incentives allow users to earn rewards by introducing others to the project. Community competitions also provide extra chances to win APC tokens or USD rewards. GALA’s Latest Ecosystem Expansion: New Partnerships and Game Releases GALA is making headlines with its latest ecosystem expansion, strengthening its gaming and entertainment presence. The team has announced a strategic partnership with major blockchain developers to enhance Web3 gaming experiences. Additionally, GALA is set to release a highly anticipated new game, further solidifying its reputation as a pioneer in the decentralized gaming industry. With increasing adoption, GALA’s roadmap suggests continued growth and innovation in the space. Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) Introduces Smart Contract Upgrades Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) is pushing forward with blockchain advancements, recently launching a groundbreaking smart contract upgrade that significantly boosts efficiency and scalability. This update aims to enhance DeFi applications and enable more seamless interactions on the ICP network. As the blockchain space evolves, ICP’s latest innovation positions it as a strong contender in the decentralized computing sector. The Final Word: Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out With Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary model, unique presale structure, and massive ROI potential, it stands out as the best crypto to invest in right now. While GALA and ICP bring exciting developments to their respective ecosystems, Arctic Pablo Coin’s Blizzard Bay presale presents a rare opportunity to secure tokens at an extremely low entry point. As the project moves forward, each phase will bring higher prices—making now the perfect time to invest. Don’t miss out on this promising presale before Arctic Pablo moves to its next location! For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why is Arctic Pablo Coin considered the best crypto to invest in right now? Arctic Pablo Coin’s deflationary token burn, high staking rewards, and unique presale structure provide early investors with significant advantages, including a projected 12,618.77% ROI from Blizzard Bay to launch price. How does Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale work? Instead of traditional tiered phases, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale progresses through global locations. Each new location brings an increased price, making earlier entries more rewarding. What is the staking APY for Arctic Pablo Coin? During the presale, investors can stake their tokens and earn a 66% APY , adding extra value before the token officially launches. What recent developments has GALA introduced? GALA has expanded its ecosystem with new partnerships and an upcoming game release, strengthening its position in blockchain gaming. How is Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) evolving? ICP recently launched a major smart contract upgrade, improving efficiency and scalability for DeFi applications and decentralized services. The post Is This the Best Crypto to Invest in?

On February 20, it passed through Utah’s Revenue and Taxation Committee in a 4-2-1 vote. After the second and third reading in the Senate, a final Senate vote will be made. The final step will be Republican Governor Spencer Cox’s signature, which isn’t much of a hurdle at that point. According to Utah’s Bitcoin reserve bill , a qualifying digital asset must have an average market cap of $500 billion over the past calendar year. At the current point in time, Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that qualifies. Ethereum briefly crossed $500 billion between October and December 2021 but did not stay above it for long. The bill also grants the state treasurer the authority to stake the assets, raising the possibility of including proof-of-stake currencies, such as Ethereum, in the future. All four senators who voted in favor of HB230 were Republicans, while one Republican and one Democrat voted against it, and one senator was absent. The measure further allows the state treasurer to invest up to 5% in digital assets across five accounts, including the General Fund Budget, Income Tax Fund Budget, and State Disaster Recovery accounts.

He made it clear that Bybit will not list scams. Meanwhile, the Pi Network token price is already struggling after its launch, with the Pi coin’s price dropping below $1, marking a 100% decline . Ben Zhou Rejects Pi Network The launch of Pi Network on February 20 has sparked excitement among its community, as supporters eagerly await its listing on major crypto exchanges. Perhaps, not all platforms are open to the idea. A week ago, Ben Zhou shared on X that he was invited to join Pi Network but turned it down, calling the offer “ridiculous.” He explained that during his time in forex trading, he often dealt with people trying to get their money back, and he wanted to avoid such issues in the crypto world. His remarks made it clear that he did not trust the project and preferred to stay away from it. His strong rejection of the Pi Network led to backlash from the Pi community supporters, with some accusing Bybit of losing relevance in the crypto industry. Others claimed that Bybit had applied to list Pi but was rejected. However, Zhou quickly denied these allegations and set the record straight. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto News Today 21-Feb : Pi Network News, XRP ETF Approval , Story (IP) Price Rally and More , Ben Challenges Pi Network on Scam Claims In response to the criticism, Ben Zhou did not hold back.

As the Pi Network community continues to push for legitimacy, it remains to be seen how other exchanges will respond. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Pi’s price has been fluctuating significantly and at press time, it has fallen below $1. This volatility has led to an aggressive selling trend among holders. One user, based in the UK, has questioned whether regulations could be a factor in these sudden changes, asking why such withdrawal issues are happening now. The cause of the fluctuations and suspension of withdrawals is still unclear, but regulatory concerns might be playing a role in the uncertain market conditions. Users Report Issues on Bitget and OKX In addition to price concerns, a number of Pi Network users have reported difficulties with exchanges such as bitget bitget - bd@bitget.com Centralised Exchange and OKX. One user mentioned they deposited 1,500 Pi into Bitget, only to find the tokens stuck on the platform. Others have raised similar concerns on social media, prompting inquiries to Pi Core Team for an explanation. For those using OKX, the platform has suspended Pi withdrawals for over 24 hours, as reported by another user. Frustrated by the suspension, a user contacted OKX support and was advised to provide their unique ID and email address to initiate the return process. While the user requested a deposit refund and received an email in response, there is still no confirmation of when the withdrawals will be restored. Bitget responded to the mail and wrote , “Greetings from Bitget. We would like to inform you that your request is currently in the process of being handled and it has been escalated to the relevant team to expedite the process. Please be assured that your request is our top priority at the moment. We kindly request your understanding and patience. Once again, we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused.

Bitcoin (BTC) price crossed the $98K level on Friday, whereas Ethereum (ETH) traded above the $2,700 level. Simultaneously, Solana traded above the $170 mark, indicating leading coins saw growing market support. However, XRP has lost nearly 2% over the past day and is below the $2.7 level. Notably, the recently launched Story (IP) token skyshot in value, emerging as the day’s top market gainer. Mentioned below are some of the latest market updates and how the leading crypto prices have been delivering in the past 24 hours. Crypto Market Today: How Are BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP Performing? It’s worth noting that the global crypto market cap was up nearly 1% from yesterday, sitting at $3.23 trillion. Further, the total market volume in the past 24 hours rose by nearly 8% to $90.13 billion. In line with this stat, BTC, ETH, and SOL traded in the green as of press time. Bitcoin Price Claims $98K BTC price gained over 1% in the past 24 hours, closing in at $98,220. The flagship crypto’s intraday low and high were $96,805.78 and $98,767.19, respectively. Notably, Bitcoin’s market dominance rose by 0.23% to 60.31% today, indicating that the altcoin sector encountered more volatility. ETH Price Jumps Marginally ETH price witnessed a highly turbulent action over the past day and rested at $2,748 as of press time, up 0.2%. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were recorded to be $2,708.22 and $2,770.03, respectively. Notably, Ethereum’s dominance slipped to 10.25% today, per CoinMarketCap data. ETH price faces vital resistance at $2,800, a break above which could propel further gains. XRP Price Slips However, XRP price dropped over 2% in the past 24 hours and is currently sitting at $2.65. The Ripple-backed asset hit an intraday bottom and peak of $2.64 and $2.74, respectively. Notably, the odds of an XRP ETF have further risen as Grayscale’s filing enters SEC review mode. Given that the approval is secured ahead, the price could leverage considerable bullish support and pump. SOL Price Springs SOL price witnessed a slight uptick of 0.5% intraday and is currently trading at $174.55. The coin hit a low and high of $170.99 and $176.59 in the past 24 hours. The broader market trend appears to prevent the coin from gaining further. Meme Crypto Prices Today Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) price saw a 1.5% decline in value and exchanged hands at $0.253. Similarly, SHIB price dropped 0.5% to $0.00001552. However, Pepe Coin (PEPE) jumped over 1% intraday, closing in at $0.000009722. Even FLOKI saw a pump of over 3% to $0.00009888.

Sonic (S) Price: $0.9372 24-hour Gains: 30% Sonic price rises against the backdrop of strong market technicals and rising investor support, as indicated by a weekly surge of over 75% and rising market cap, now at $2.78 billion. Maker (MKR) Price: $1,405 24-hour Gains: +18% Notably, Maker price soars against the backdrop of massive MKR burns, as per recent Whale Alert data on X. Top Loser Crypto Prices Today Bitget Token (BGB) Price: $4.65 24-hour Loss: -4% Aptos (APT) Price: $6.37 24-hour Loss: -3% Ethereum Classic Price: $20.91 24-hour Loss: +3% In conclusion, market watchers continue to extensively eye the crypto prices with uncertainty amid mixed trends. Although a strategic Bitcoin reserve bill is looming in the U.S. and numerous altcoin ETF-related filings have been made, whale accumulations & prices are stagnant. Crypto market analyst Ali Martinez further revealed on X that the recent BTC accumulation trend score signaled whales are either distributing or not accumulating. In turn, an uncertain sentiment continues to brew among traders and investors globally.

DOGE is now consolidating and struggling to clear the $0.2550 resistance. DOGE price started a fresh decline below the $0.270 and $0.2620 levels. The price is trading below the $0.2580 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.2540 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another increase if it clears the $0.2550 and $0.2620 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Struggles To Gain Pace Dogecoin price started a fresh decline below the $0.2750 zone, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE dipped below the $0.270 and $0.2620 support levels. It even spiked below $0.2550. A low was formed at $0.2420 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2830 swing high to the $0.2420 low. There was also a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $0.2540 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. However, the pair is struggling to settle above the $0.2550 resistance level. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.2540 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.2550 level. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.2625 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2830 swing high to the $0.2420 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.2720 level. A close above the $0.2720 resistance might send the price toward the $0.300 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.320 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.3420. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.2550 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.2500 level. The next major support is near the $0.2450 level. The main support sits at $0.2420. If there is a downside break below the $0.2420 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.2350 level or even $0.2220 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.

Currently, four buzzing cryptocurrencies being eyed by investors are Pi Network (PI), Solana (SOL), XRP, and the rapidly emerging Remittix (RTX). These assets stand out due to developments in the network, growing adoption, and impressive price swings. While Pi Network stays on its path to the full mainnet launch, Solana (SOL) has resisted the storm of market fluctuations. Regulation changes have turned XRP into a household name globally, while Remittix (RTX) has stolen the limelight in the cross-border payments landscape. Pi Network: Will the Mainnet Finally Launch? Since its inception, the Pi Network (PI) has maintained a devout following, with users eagerly awaiting the mainnet launch. While originally marketed as a mobile mining project, PI has never been listed on a major exchange, leading to user anxieties about when they might trade their tokens. The demand for a PI mainnet launch keeps growing, as many people think this will give the PI holders a chance to exchange their tokens for actual assets like SOL and XRP. Nevertheless, some investors treat things cautiously without an official date being finalized. Still, market enthusiasts speculate that PI could become one of the most significant cryptocurrency releases in modern times. Solana (SOL) Holds Strong Amid Market Fluctuations SOL has become one of the strongest crypto assets and falls even the least when the market declines. Thanks to its very fast transaction speeds and low fees, it is regarded as the cornerstone for DeFi and NFT ecosystems. The growing number of developers tend towards Solana because it is cheaper than Ethereum and has scalable solutions. Market analysts believe SOL is reaching its lowest point, but it could rise as buying demands increase. Strong fundamentals keep Solana inscribed as a key altcoin for all watchers and investors. XRP Gains Momentum as Legal Uncertainty Clears Fresh victories attained on the legal front have burned new confidence in XRP, widening its adoption across the globe. The company continues to expand its partnership with financial institutions, thus growing XRP’s potential in global payments. As speculative assets dominate most cryptocurrencies, one of the outstanding characteristics of XRP is the real-world utility exhibited in international money transfers. For instance, analysts have predicted that the price could test new all-time highs if market sentiment improves, driven by increased institutional interest and growing consumer demand. Remittix (RTX): The Rising Star in Cross-Border Payments Remittix (RTX) is increasingly gaining attention as a great contender in the payment sector, directly competing with XRP, SOL, and PI. RTX is hell-bent on transforming cross-border transactions swiftly and cost-effectively, far beyond traditional remittance services. In contrast to PI, which is still awaiting its mainnet launch, or XRP, which has been through a series of legal gauntlets, RTX has had real-world adoption. Businesses searching for better payment solutions are getting on the RTX train, clinching a stronger foothold. At its presale price of $0.0628, RTX raised over $12.3 million and is fast-trending with retail and institutional investors. Its infrastructure runs on a blockchain that enables instant and cheap transactions, thus appealing to the attention of financial institutions worldwide. Many people expect RTX to be one of the biggest breakout tokens in 2025. Which Crypto Holds the Most Potential? As the crypto market keeps changing, each project, PI, SOL, XRP, and Remittix offers specific advantages. In high anticipation of their mainnet launch, PI Network would remain at that time while Solana continues to reign in DeFi. Because of regulatory clarity, XRP has enjoyed some advantages, whilst Remittix is remarkable as an up-and-coming company in payments. Investors are now shifting their focus from speculation to real-world uses; many would provide Remittix as a practical example. As such, it is not unreasonable to expect SOL, XRP, and RTX to continue to prosper in the emerging crypto space with their ample fundamentals. For those seeking to cash in on the next wave of crypto innovation, monitoring these best-in-class assets might prove a worthwhile strategy.

The selling pressure comes with huge trading activity as daily trading volumes surge to more than $1.2 billion. Pi Coin Sees Major Pump and Dump Pi Coin, the native cryptocurrency of the Pi Network faces a major pump-and-dump as it currently trades around $0.70 falling more than 65% from its peak of $2.0 Investors’ euphoria surrounding the mainnet launch seems to be waning fast. Even as of the current price of $0.70, the Pi Network pegs a market cap of $4.45 billion. With more than 10 million users, the Pi Network has achieved significant market following. following the mainnet launch, a total of 1 billion from the total 9.7 billion PI tokens are available initially. The remaining tokens will be locked in user wallets and unlocked over a period of time. Although some market analysts have turned bullish, investors should be careful while taking fresh bets and look for any potential signs of trend reversal. Will Binance and Coinbase Listing lead to Trend Reversal? Despite the current Pi Coin price fall , the optimism surrounding the recovery remains high. Some market analysts believe that this would not be the right time to sell at the bottom considering that the daily trading volumes have remained robust at more than $1.2 billion. Some of the global crypto exchanges like OKX and CoinDCX have already extended support to Pi coin. Furthermore, the industry has been pushing to bring the Pi Network’s native crypto token to top exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. Binance and Coinbase, being among the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, offer access to a vast user base and high trading volumes. This increased liquidity can make Pi Coin more attractive to traders and investors. Besides, it will further boost the credibility of the crypto asset among retail investors. $PI network chart dosen't look bad at all are you selling the bottom?

In a statement shared on social media, LightYear said : “The only narrative I really hated about yesterday’s listing of Pi was that of people having cheap access to accumulate what we paid for with our time, for many years.” The sentiment highlights concerns among long-term supporters of the Pi Network, who believe the listing undermines the project’s core narrative of valuing time and attention The post Pi Coin Price Crashes 50%, What Shall Investors Do Next? appeared first on CoinGape .",24/7 Cryptocurrency News|Altcoin News,EN,0,0,TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|BNB|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinGape', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coingape,2025-02-21 05:12:58

He accused the Democrats of “treason.” He addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference, pledging to slash government spending and endorsing an audit of the Federal Reserve . Musk, now seen as President Donald Trump’s most influential adviser, slammed Biden’s immigration policies and specifically blasted an app that allowed one million people to enter the United States on two-year work permits. Earlier, he met Argentine President Javier Milei, who handed him the chainsaw engraved with “Viva la libertad, carajo,” or “Long live liberty, d*mn it.” Musk dubbed it “the chainsaw for bureaucracy.” He also joked that Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele was concerned for his safety.

The cryptocurrency is currently facing significant resistance between the $2.65 and $2.80 levels. This suggests the price could continue to struggle around these points in the short term. XRP has erased the majority of the gains made in the seven days. The broader market sentiment also remains mixed, with Bitcoin struggling to break above the crucial $98k mark and Ethereum is also stuck below the $3000 mark. Support Levels to Watch On the downside, support can be found around the $2.50 level. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World , a drop below this could lead to further support between $2.25 and $2.30. These levels are important to monitor as they may indicate where price stability could form if the bearish trend continues. Resistance Beyond $2.80 Should XRP break above the $2.80 resistance level, additional resistance is expected around the $3 mark, followed by another resistance zone near $3.20. Possible Bullish Cup and Handle Pattern If XRP manages a confirmed breakout above $2.80, there’s potential for a short-term cup and handle pattern to form on the daily timeframe. If validated, this pattern could signal a higher low and indicate a bullish shift in market sentiment.

The three day outflows started with $61.4 million on Feb. 18, followed by $71.07 million on Feb. 19. However, on Feb. 20, net outflows surged to $364.93 million, according to data from SoSoValue. This marks the most significant single-day decline in the three days. BlackRock’s IBIT experienced the largest single-day withdrawal, losing $112.05 million. The next biggest outflows were $98.3 million from ARK Invest’s ARKB and $89.24 million from Fidelity’s FBTC. With $33.5 million in outflows, Grayscale’s GBTC continued its outflow streak following its conversion from a trust structure. Interestingly, Bitwise’s BITB had inflows of $24.1 million, while VanEck’s HODL witnessed a slight gain of $4.18 million.

However, institutional demand seems to be growing.

In addition, Barclays has also revealed a $131 million investment in IBIT as of Q4 2024 in its Feb.13 form 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher noted that as markets factored in early demand from ETF approvals and euphoria surrounding Trump, inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs have decreased. Investors are currently waiting for the next significant catalyst to push prices higher, as a large portion of that purchasing pressure has already been realized. ETF flows for $BTC and $ETH are clearly slowing down since the election pumps. 📉 It makes sense when you realize that markets are forward-looking, and the bulk of ETF buyers were front-running all the positive news from Trump taking office.

Many investors had anticipated it would take place soon after Donald Trump took office and possibly spur new institutional inflows. Despite the outflows, Bitcoin’s price has remained relatively stable at $98,000, up 1% over the last day. Long-term demand from institutions is a crucial aspect to monitor, according to analysts, as it might help sustain Bitcoin’s momentum in the coming months.

The New York-based firm confirmed the restart in a Thursday statement. Last week, the asset manager paused engagements with the corporate sector temporarily, and announced the restart this week. According to BlackRock, this temporary hold allowed the world’s largest asset manager to assess rules that place stricter requirements on firms aiming to influence the conduct of companies in which they invest. “We are complying with the new requirements including by highlighting our role as a ‘passive’ investor at the start of each engagement,” the company said. “BlackRock does not use engagement as a way to control publicly traded companies.” The SEC, now under new leadership since President Donald Trump took office, issued guidance that could treat investors seeking to shape environmental, social, or political matters more like activist hedge funds. These changes mean that asset managers may face more extensive disclosure and regulatory scrutiny if they push for specific corporate actions.

In a recent tweet, he raised concerns about the possible burst of the ‘Everything Bubble,’ which could impact multiple asset classes, including stocks, bonds, real estate, gold, silver, and Bitcoin. According to Kiyosaki, 2025 could bring the worst financial crisis in history —a period he calls the “Greatest Depression.” GIANT CRASH???? If there is a giant crash…. Of the often times called “the EVERYTHING BUBBLE,” stocks and bonds, real estate, gold and silver and Bitcoin will crash with it. Q: If it crashes will I sell my Bitcoin? A: NO If the price of Bitcoin crashes I will back up the… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 20, 2025 Kiyosaki Warning Signs Kiyosaki warns that the global financial system is at present unstable, citing rising inflation, excessive government debt, and increasing layoffs as warning signs of a major economic downturn. He believes that the rich are getting richer due to a financial system built on “fake money,” which drives asset prices higher while making life more expensive for the poor and middle class. He has repeatedly argued that fiat currency is being devalued, pushing essential goods and services out of reach for many people. Kiyosaki to Stick with Bitcoin Unlike traditional investors who may panic during downturns, Kiyosaki sees a market crash as an opportunity. He clarified that he will not sell his Bitcoin, gold, or silver —assets he considers “real money.” Instead, he plans to “back up the truck,” meaning he will buy more if prices drop significantly. His stance urges investors to rethink their financial strategies in the face of increasing market volatility. While he has less faith in the dollar he sees Bitcoin as the only hope in this financial crisis. Ray Dalio’s ‘Debt Death Spiral’ Warning On the other side, Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has also raised similar alarms about the U.S. economy, warning that it is headed toward a dangerous “debt death spiral.” He believes that the government is borrowing at an unsustainable rate, which could trigger a crisis if investors lose confidence and offload U.S. debt. With interest payments nearing $1 trillion annually, the government’s ability to fund essential services is becoming more constrained. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin’s Netflow Trends Suggest $100K Target May Be Delayed: Here’s What It Means , In short, he means , that when a country has too much debt, the problem spreads like a domino effect. First, businesses struggle with debt, then the government takes on more, and eventually, the central bank has to step in. People start to panic and try to get rid of their debt investments, like selling bonds or pulling money from banks, because they fear losing money. This rush to sell makes borrowing more expensive (higher interest rates), making it even harder for the government and businesses to pay back what they owe. To stop everything from collapsing, central banks usually pump more money into the system to keep things running. But this comes with a big risk—it can make money less valuable, leading to inflation. If not managed properly, this cycle can spiral out of control, creating a major financial crisis. Dalio argues that the U.S. must reduce its deficit to 3% of GDP—what he calls the “3% solution.” Without decisive action, he warns, the economy could spiral into chaos. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Amidst market volatility and rising negative altcoin sentiment, investors are eyeing lucrative investment projects like 1Fuel to maximize their profits. 1Fuel is a promising project that has fascinated investors through its impressive performance. The innovative altcoin has already raised over $2.2 million in its presale. As it continues to gain momentum, experts believe 1Fuel could surge to 100x and become the next crypto success story. Hedera (HBAR) dips amidst intense selling pressure Hedera has been facing significant resistance since the beginning of this year. The infamous altcoin is currently priced at $0.21, declining by around 6.19% from last week’s price. Experts attribute HBAR’s recent downtrend to a broader negative market sentiment around altcoins. Additionally, Hedera’s increasing selling pressure is also a vital contributor to the bearish movement. Hedera’s Long/Short Ratio shows that 56.5% of its taker volume consists of sellers, which indicates that the bears are gradually taking control. However, despite Hedera’s recent performance, experts are still optimistic about its future. Coinbase has recently launched Solana and Hedera Futures contracts for US traders, which might cause an upsurge in the altcoin’s price. As Hedera struggles, investors search for alternative high-yield projects like 1Fuel to 100x their profits. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) plunges as Bears take over Pepe Unchained was launched back in December 2024 and quickly gained traction in the meme coin market. However, the PEPU token is currently facing significant losses. As of February 19, Pepe Unchained’s price is hovering around the $0.0073 mark, plummeting by over 22% from its last week price. Experts link the PEPU token’s recent downtrend to diminishing investor confidence and a wider negative sentiment around altcoins. On top of this, the PEPU token’s weekly MACD 12,26 and EMA 10 levels also point towards continued bearish activity. However, despite the recent decline, experts believe that Pepe Unchained might recover, as the altcoin has recently launched its Pump Pad . This launch allows the PEPU token to offer blazingly fast transaction speed at just a fraction of a cost while also taking the benefit of Ethereum’s superior security. As the PEPU token plummets, investors are shifting focus towards 1Fuel, a promising investment project with the potential to deliver 100x gains. 1Fuel (OFT) ignites investors’ interest by promising 100x returns The HBAR price declines, while Pepe Unchained gains bearish momentum, at the same time, 1Fuel emerges as a lucrative investment option. The upcoming crypto wallet is all set to revolutionize conventional trading. 1Fuel aims to streamline the trading process, enabling users to transfer their assets across multiple blockchains with just a single click on their device. In line with this vision, 1Fuel will introduce its P2P exchange. This decentralized exchange would allow users to securely trade multiple assets directly with other users. Besides making the trading process easier, 1Fuel prioritizes user security through its Inbuilt Mixer feature. This feature would anonymize user financial activities and make them untraceable by blending them with other similar transactions. 1Fuel’s cold storage also serves a similar function by protecting user assets through military-grade cold storage. With its enticing features and attractive presale metrics, 1Fuel is poised to revolutionize the crypto market. Final Thoughts Hedera and Pepe Unchained are facing substantial resistance, while 1Fuel is positioned to dominate the crypto market through its cutting-edge technology and attractive features. With over $2.2 million raised in its presale and the potential to deliver 100x gains, 1Fuel is stealing the limelight. Get 100x returns by grabbing OFT tokens now before they explode in value!

Musk has previously called for more scrutiny of the Fed’s activities, and an audit could possibly help pinpoint and implement cost-cutting measures that previous administrations overlooked. Musk is considering auditing the Federal Reserve and Fort Knox At the CPAC stage, Musk made a dramatic entrance, sporting sunglasses and a black MAGA hat while throwing his fists in the air. Later, he was joined on stage by President Javier Milei of Argentina, who presented him with a chainsaw, a symbol of his government’s crackdown on excessive spending, which Musk called “the chainsaw for bureaucracy.” Then, in an onstage interview with Rob Schmitt of Newsmax, a conservative news and opinion cable channel, Musk teased his plans to audit the Federal Reserve. However, he did not give much detail on when or how he would look into the Fed. On X, he also wrote , “All aspects of the government must be fully transparent and accountable to the people. No exceptions, including, if not especially, the Federal Reserve.” Nevertheless, the Federal Reserve does have all its yearly financial audits posted online. Musk also said he wants to confirm the gold reserves in Fort Knox, Kentucky, an idea originally proposed by President Donald Trump. However, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg on Thursday that Fort Knox’s gold reserves are audited annually, adding that all the gold is accounted for. Musk and Trump are thinking of giving payouts to Americans The Tesla CEO, speaking at the CPAC conference, argued that all the money saved from DOGE’s cost-cutting program could be distributed to the public. He said that the money taken away from “destructive” things in the country and organizations that resent the people would be given back, calling it “the spoils of battle.” On Wednesday, Trump had made a similar statement at the FII Priority Summit, saying they are thinking of paying 20% of DOGE’s savings directly to Americans and another 20% to help clear the country’s debt. When asked about the wasteful spending in the federal budget, Musk compared it to being in a room where the walls, roof, and floor are all targets, and so you just need to close your eyes and choose any direction. So far, DOGE has claimed that it has saved up to $55 billion by renegotiating contracts and leases, canceling grants, selling assets, slashing staff, cutting regulatory costs, and fraud detection. Nonetheless, the agency and Trump are facing harsh criticism over multiple violations. Musk recently came under fire for infringing on privacy laws, and now Trump is being criticized for trying to cut budgets on spending already approved by Congress.

President Donald Trump’s confirmation of a long-awaited audit of Fort Knox’s gold reserves has driven speculation on prediction markets, while his return to office has also fueled a surge in Bitcoin and broader crypto adoption. In Australia, however, public sentiment remains divided on Trump’s impact on the digital asset space, with crypto investors viewing his policies more favorably than non-investors. As discussions around financial accountability and digital currencies gain momentum, both initiatives highlight the evolving intersection of traditional and decentralized finance. Donald Trump’s Presidential Win Sends Crypto Markets Surging, But Australians Remain Divided on His Impact Donald Trump’s return to the White House has triggered a massive rally in the cryptocurrency market, with Bitcoin soaring over 40% since his election on Nov. 5. However, while global markets embrace his pro-crypto stance, a recent survey suggests Australians are not as convinced about his positive influence on the industry. According to a survey conducted by Australian cryptocurrency exchange Independent Reserve, only 31% of Australians believe Trump is good for the crypto sector, while 8% say he is bad for it. A significant 60% of respondents remained neutral, suggesting a lack of strong sentiment on his policies or their potential effects on digital assets. However, the survey revealed a stark contrast between crypto investors and non-investors in their perceptions of Trump. Among those who actively invest in cryptocurrency, 50% viewed Trump favorably regarding his impact on the industry, while 44% remained neutral and only 6% had a negative outlook. In contrast, only 20% of non-crypto investors saw Trump as a positive influence, while 10% expressed negative views. This suggests that those with financial exposure to the crypto market are more optimistic about the regulatory and economic changes his administration may bring. The survey found that the most committed crypto investors—those investing AU$10,000 ($6,400) per month—had no negative views on Trump , further showing the belief that his policies will drive greater adoption and innovation in the sector. Independent Reserve CEO Adrian Przelozny attributes this optimism to Trump’s perceived pro-crypto stance. “There is widespread anticipation that his pro-crypto policies will foster innovation and broader adoption of digital assets,” he said. The findings of the Independent Reserve survey align with a separate YouGov poll commissioned by Swyftx, which revealed that 59% of Australian crypto investors are more likely to vote for a pro-crypto candidate in the upcoming federal election. With an estimated 2 million Australians holding digital assets, this emerging voting bloc could play a decisive role in the country’s political landscape. Australia’s federal election, set to take place by May 17, is expected to be tightly contested between the ruling center-left Labor government and the center-right opposition. The political discourse surrounding cryptocurrency regulation is heating up, with both sides making promises to address the industry’s growing concerns. Challenges Facing the Australian Crypto Industry Despite growing adoption, the Australian cryptocurrency industry still faces hurdles. Independent Reserve reported that nearly 20% of survey respondents experienced restrictions from their banks when attempting to buy crypto or faced delays in processing payments to exchanges. Regulatory uncertainty remains a major concern. While the Australian government, led by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, concluded a consultation on a crypto framework in late 2023, there is no clear timeline for legislation. This lack of regulatory clarity has been criticized by the opposition, with Shadow Assistant Treasurer Luke Howarth stating that the Labor government has “left much-needed regulation in the bottom drawer.” “If we are fortunate enough to form [a] government, the [center-right] Coalition will work quickly to put in place fit-for-purpose regulation which keeps Australia up with the rest of the world and provides much-needed regulatory certainty,” Howarth added. Australia’s crypto adoption has reached an all-time high since Independent Reserve began conducting its annual survey in 2019. Nearly one-third of respondents now report that they own or have previously owned digital assets, marking a 16 percentage point increase in six years. However, for the industry to thrive, policymakers will need to address the regulatory ambiguity and banking challenges that investors continue to face. With Trump’s pro-crypto stance influencing global markets, and Australia’s own elections approaching, the country finds itself at a crossroads in shaping the future of its digital asset sector. Trump’s Push for Fort Knox Gold Audit Sparks Surge in Prediction Markets In other Trump news, the likelihood of a long-awaited audit of the Fort Knox gold reserves by May 2025 has surged dramatically on cryptocurrency-based prediction markets following the US President’s confirmation of his administration’s intent to conduct the review. During a flight to Washington on Feb. 19, Trump made a public statement confirming that his administration is planning an official visit to the Fort Knox vaults to verify the presence and quantity of gold reserves. His remarks, reported by the Associated Press, have reignited interest in a subject that has long been debated by financial analysts, libertarians, and crypto enthusiasts alike. “We’re going to go into Fort Knox to make sure the gold is there,” Trump declared. His statement reaffirmed an initiative that initially gained traction through the libertarian financial blog ZeroHedge, later supported by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Trump’s statement had an immediate impact on prediction markets, particularly on the cryptocurrency-based betting platform Polymarket. Since Polymarket listed its Fort Knox-related markets on Feb. 17, speculation over the audit has intensified. Following Trump’s announcement, the odds of an audit occurring before May 2025 surged past 70%, climbing from 55% just a day earlier. In addition to speculation about whether the audit will occur, another Polymarket market is focused on whether missing gold reserves will be uncovered. At present, the market assigns a 17% probability that the audit will reveal discrepancies in Fort Knox’s gold holdings. Kalshi, another prediction market platform, is reportedly preparing to launch its own Fort Knox-related betting markets. The last time an official audit of Fort Knox’s gold reserves took place was in 1974, meaning that for nearly five decades, the true status of the nation’s gold holdings has remained largely unknown to the public. Concerns about the integrity of the reserves have fueled conspiracy theories and calls for greater transparency. Trump’s latest remarks appear to mark his first public statement on Fort Knox’s reserves since being sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Jan. 20. While he did not explicitly mention concerns over potential missing gold, his tone suggested that his administration is taking the matter seriously. “If the gold isn’t there, we’re going to be very upset,” Trump warned. He further expressed hope that “everything is fine with Fort Knox,” avoiding direct speculation but indicating that a discovery of missing assets could have significant repercussions. Trump’s push for an audit has been met with enthusiastic support from the cryptocurrency community, which has long argued that Bitcoin offers a more transparent and verifiable alternative to gold. Unlike gold reserves, Bitcoin holdings can be audited in real-time via its blockchain, eliminating concerns about potential manipulation or fraud. Many crypto analysts view the audit initiative as an indirect endorsement of Bitcoin’s strengths. If the audit were to uncover discrepancies or a lack of transparency in Fort Knox’s reserves, it could further reinforce Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized and tamper-proof asset class. Regulatory and Political Implications With the federal government grappling with inflation concerns and economic uncertainty, an audit of the nation’s gold reserves could be seen as an effort to restore confidence in America’s financial stability. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a known advocate for financial transparency and digital assets, has also voiced support for the audit. She believes that verifying the nation’s gold holdings is crucial in shaping future economic policies and addressing inflation-related concerns. Meanwhile, opposition voices are questioning whether Trump’s push for an audit is a political maneuver or a genuine attempt to ensure economic accountability. Critics argue that the audit could be used to shift attention away from other pressing economic issues and serve as a tool for political posturing. As speculation continues to mount, all eyes will be on whether the audit actually takes place and what its findings might reveal. If the reserves are fully intact, it could put to rest decades of speculation. However, if discrepancies are found, it could have far-reaching implications for US financial policy and the global economy. With Polymarket odds now reflecting a strong likelihood of an audit occurring before May 2025, and additional betting markets poised to launch, the coming months will likely see heightened discussions around gold, inflation, and the future of financial transparency in the United States. For now, Trump’s commitment to auditing Fort Knox has injected fresh energy into financial and crypto communities alike, as they await further details on what could be one of the most significant gold reserve audits in modern history.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-21 06:00:00

Scammers can easily steal money from unwary investors as AI-powered scams are getting harder to identify. Fraudsters are using AI technology to develop increasingly realistic phishing attacks, deepfake movies, and automated trading bots that are intended to deceive customers. How AI Is Being Used in Crypto Scams AI enables many more ways of scamming, making scammers more efficient and nearly untraceable: among the most common scams enabled by AI are: Deepfake Scams – AI-generated videos and voice recordings make it look as if someone the public knows, like their chief executive officer, is going along and endorsing an imaginary scheme. Phishing Attacks – Bot-generated e-mails and websites create an illusion to users as if real, tricking them into trading their private keys or passwords. Fake Trading Bots – These represent AI bots claiming to be giving higher returns, only to pillage user deposits. Rug Pull Schemes – Crafted stunningly believable whitepapers and marketing collateral to lure investors into fake crypto projects. Automated Scam Calls and Texts – AI-generated text and voice messages can lure people to send money or to share personal information. Real-World Examples of AI Crypto Scams AI-powered scams have already cost investors millions of dollars. Here are a few notable examples: Scam Type Description Impact Deepfake CEO Fraud Scammers used AI to mimic a CEO’s voice, tricking employees into sending funds. $35 million lost AI Phishing Emails Emails generated by AI convinced investors to enter private keys on fake sites. Thousands lost daily Fake Trading Bots Users deposited funds into AI-powered bots that never actually traded. Millions stolen Why AI Makes Crypto Scams More Dangerous AI allows scammers to personalize attacks, making them more believable. Traditional phishing scams often contain errors that alert users to potential fraud. However, AI-generated messages are grammatically perfect and tailored to the victim’s interests. This makes it much harder to identify scams before falling victim to them. Deepfake technology is another major concern. Scammers can create realistic videos of well-known figures promoting fake crypto projects. Even experienced investors may struggle to distinguish between real and fake endorsements. Automated AI bots are also a growing threat. The bots can flood social media platforms with fake reviews and complimentary remarks about alleged crypto scams and make it complicated for users to differentiate between real and scam. How to Protect Yourself from AI-Powered Crypto Scams It is true that even today, with ever-increasing sophistication, there are some ways to keep crypto assets secure. Follow certain guidelines that ensure maximum safety for your crypto assets: Source Verification – Always check the authenticity of messages, emails, or social media posts before taking any action. Never Click on Suspicious Links – It is best not to click on links sent or listed by an unknown source, especially those asking for personal or financial information. Use Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) – Insetting 2FA on all crypto exchanges and wallets secures an additional layer. Check Official Websites – Always verify project details from the official website instead of trusting social media posts or emails. Be Skeptical of High Returns – If an investment sounds too good to be true, it likely is. Research Before Investing – Look up reviews, whitepapers, and community discussions before putting money into any project. Use Reputable Exchanges – Stick to well-known and regulated crypto exchanges to reduce the risk of fraud. The Future of AI and Crypto Security Scams will become smarter with the advancement of AI technology. However, AI can also be used in good ways. For instance, blockchain companies are now working on developing an AI-powered toolbox for fraud detection. This tool will track suspicious transactions while a human could verify identity through AI to prevent identity theft. It is being ensured that governments and regulatory bodies share this vision. There will be stricter policies and stricter security measures in place to guard investors against these emerging threats. AI has become a greater threat to crypto scams and harder to detect as well. Such scams must be taken very seriously by investors. With the use of AI, scammer frauds become convincing frauds; verifying all the info will help avoid such losses.",Reviews|Crypto Scams|Deepfake Scams|Growing|Rug Pull,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-02-21 06:04:21

While Layer 2 solutions, like the Lightning Network, improve speed and scalability, the base layer, or Layer 1, offers security and decentralization. However, Layer 3 has emerged as a result of conversations over the future of Bitcoin. However, what is Layer 3 and how does it advance current technology? Understanding Bitcoin’s Layered Architecture Bitcoin operates on a layered structure to handle different aspects of its network. Here is a breakdown of the layers: Layer Function Example Layer 1 Main blockchain for security and transactions Bitcoin blockchain Layer 2 Enhances scalability and transaction speed Lightning Network Layer 3 Adds applications and smart contract capabilities Emerging projects Each layer builds on the previous one, solving specific challenges while maintaining Bitcoin’s decentralized nature. The Role of the Lightning Network (Layer 2) The Lightning Network was introduced to address Bitcoin’s scalability problem. It enables off-chain transactions, reducing congestion on the main blockchain. With Lightning, users can conduct microtransactions with minimal fees and almost instant confirmation times. However, it has some limitations: Setting up payment channels can be complex. Liquidity constraints can lead to failed transactions. Privacy concerns exist since transactions can be traced through certain nodes. Because of these limitations, a number of discussions have arisen over a new layer to scale up functionality further. What is Bitcoin’s Layer 3? It’s a new concept: another enhancement in functionality for Bitcoin that will not cost much regarding security and decentralization. Precisely, it would focus on: Smart contracts : allowing programmable transactions just like in Ethereum; Scalability enhancements: regarding efficiency in application operations running atop Bitcoin; Interoperability : including the ability of Bitcoin to function with other blockchains and financial systems. Privacy and Security : Providing stronger encryption methods for transactions. While Layer 3 is still in development, it could significantly expand Bitcoin’s use cases beyond simple payments. Potential Use Cases of Layer 3 If successfully implemented, Layer 3 could open up various possibilities, including: Use Case Description Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Creating lending, borrowing, and yield farming on Bitcoin NFTs on Bitcoin Enabling the creation and transfer of digital assets Gaming and Metaverse Supporting Bitcoin-based in-game economies Cross-Chain Transactions Allowing seamless transfers between Bitcoin and other blockchains Privacy Solutions Improving transaction confidentiality beyond current levels These applications could make Bitcoin more than just a store of value, turning it into a fully functional ecosystem. Projects Exploring Layer 3 Solutions Several projects and developers are already working on Layer 3 solutions. Some of the key initiatives include: RGB Protocol : A smart contract system designed for Bitcoin and Lightning Network. Taro : A protocol that enables the issuance of assets on Bitcoin. OmniBOLT : A platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Lightning Network. While these are early-stage projects, they highlight the potential of Layer 3 in transforming Bitcoin’s capabilities. Challenges and Considerations Despite its potential, Layer 3 faces several challenges: Security Risks : Adding more layers increases the attack surface. Decentralization Concerns : Some solutions might introduce centralization points. Adoption and Development : Without widespread adoption, Layer 3 may struggle to gain traction. Regulatory Issues : Governments may impose stricter regulations on advanced Bitcoin functionalities. Only when these challenges are overcome, will success be realized for Layer 3. Layer 3, in the evolution of Bitcoin, will go further by integrating smart contracts into the network to ensure scalability and interoperability. Though still very much in their infancy, this might unlock many new use cases beyond Bitcoin’s currently narrow function as digital gold. In constant development, Layer 3 could be Bitcoin’s future and, to a broader degree, realign how bitcoin will fit within the global monetary system.",Reviews|LIGHTNING NETWORK,EN,0,0,BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Bitcoin World', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinworld,2025-02-21 06:04:48

This week’s expiry event is smaller than last week’s and one of the tiniest of the year, which means there will be virtually no impact on spot markets, which have been range-bound for most of the week. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.75, meaning that there are slightly more call (long) contracts expiring than puts (shorts). Moreover, open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, still remains highest at the $120,000 strike price, which is $1.8 billion, according to Deribit. There is also around $1.2 billion in OI at the $110,000 strike price, as derivatives traders continue to speculate that BTC prices will rise in the longer term. Earlier this week, crypto derivatives provider Greeks Live said sentiment was “cautiously bearish,” with low volatility frustrating traders. “Next week’s options priced at 40% volatility again with front-month contracts falling below, indicating potential market weakness,” it added. Deribit concurred in its weekly Insights report, stating, “Strong directional sentiment in derivatives markets has waned in response to the largely sideways moves in spot [markets] over the last two weeks.” Funding rates for both majors, BTC and ETH, remain close to zero after Ether saw a strong negative spike earlier in the month, it reported before adding that volatility in Ethereum retains a premium over Bitcoin. Bitcoin OI by expiry. Source: Deribit Around 153,000 Ethereum contracts are also expiring today, with a notional value of $420 million and a put/call ratio of 0.48. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $2 billion. Crypto Market Outlook Markets have shown minor gains towards the end of the week, with total capitalization reaching $3.35 trillion. However, zooming out, they still remain at the lower bounds of a three-month sideways trading channel. Bitcoin hit an intraday and two-week high of $98,750 during early trading in Asia on Friday morning. However, it faced resistance there, as it has done twice before, and pulled back slightly at the time of writing. Ethereum has been a little choppier over the past 24 hours, spiking to $2,767 before pulling back to $2,744 at the time of writing. ETH has been trading sideways since it dumped below $3,000 in early February. The altcoins were generally in the green this Friday morning, with larger gains for Solana , Sui, Avalanche, and Litecoin as ETF hope grows.

As more investors and institutions pour into this field, the advantages of AI quantitative investment are becoming more and more obvious, forming an unprecedented wave of innovation. 1. The rise of AI quantitative investment In the past few years, the digital currency market has experienced explosive growth. With the dramatic changes in price fluctuations and market sentiment, traditional investment methods seem to be stretched. In order to cope with the uncertainty and complexity of the market, more and more investors are beginning to seek solutions for AI quantitative investment. AI quantitative investment uses technologies such as machine learning, big data analysis and algorithmic trading to analyze market data and trends and formulate scientific and reasonable investment strategies. This method can not only significantly improve investment efficiency, but also reduce the interference of human emotional factors in the ever-changing market. 2. BTC and ETH: Market Leaders As the leading coins in the market, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have a significant impact on the entire digital currency ecosystem with their price fluctuations and market trends. Through AI quantitative investment, analysts can use historical price data, trading volume, social media sentiment and other data sources to build multi-factor models to predict future price trends. For example, some quantitative trading platforms have successfully used AI technology to monitor discussions on Twitter and other social media in real time to capture changes in market sentiment. This analysis not only improves the ability to predict price fluctuations of Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also provides stronger support for investment decisions. 3. DOGE’s Alternative Investment Strategy Dogecoin (DOGE), as a digital currency originated from Internet culture, has gradually attracted more and more investors’ attention in recent years. Although its basic value is not as stable as Bitcoin and Ethereum, its community support and social media popularity make it a unique investment asset. AI quantitative investment can flexibly respond to this, using natural language processing (NLP) technology to analyze the expression of users’ emotions about DOGE on social media, providing investors with a relatively accurate assessment of market prospects. At the same time, through machine learning algorithms, AI can continuously optimize its investment strategy and adjust risk exposure in time to adapt to market changes. 4. Stability and arbitrage opportunities of USDT Focusing on the stablecoin market, Tether (USDT) is favored for its relatively stable value, especially in a volatile market environment. AI quantitative investment can provide investors with arbitrage opportunities for stablecoin transactions. By monitoring market liquidity, transaction depth and price differences, combined with algorithmic trading, investors can obtain considerable returns with low handling fees. In USDT transactions, the AI ​​system can also monitor the exchange rate with other fiat currencies and digital assets in real time, helping investors to discover potential price deviations, thereby implementing high-frequency trading strategies. This not only improves the efficiency of fund use, but also minimizes investment risks. 5. Dual guarantee of security and compliance With the rapid development of the digital currency market, security and compliance issues have gradually become the focus of investors. AI technology has shown good application prospects in secure transactions and risk management. By real-time monitoring of transaction behavior and detecting abnormal transactions, the AI ​​system can issue alarms in time to help investors avoid potential security risks. At the same time, the AI ​​system can also automatically adjust trading strategies according to the laws and regulations of different countries and regions to ensure the compliance of quantitative investment. This is especially important for institutional investors who hope to achieve long-term development in the increasingly regulated market. 6. Future Outlook With the continuous advancement of AI technology, the application of quantitative investment in the digital currency market will become more and more extensive. In the future, investors can not only use AI to analyze market trends and optimize investment portfolios, but also use its predictive models to make more complex and diversified investment decisions. In this process, digital currencies such as BTC, ETH, DOGE, and USDT will continue to play an important role and become a new opportunity for investors to realize wealth appreciation. In this market full of challenges and opportunities, mastering AI quantitative investment technology will be a direction that every investor needs to explore step by step. In an era of digital assets full of opportunities and challenges, GWS Investment Platform (GLOBAL WEALTH STRATEGIES LTD) announced its newly launched AI quantitative digital currency trading system.

Farina’s analysis from January reveals that holding a relatively small amount of XRP can already place investors among the top ranks. However, he also recently drew attention to the difficulty in climbing the ranks , and as the asset’s price grows, these thresholds continue to change. If you hold more than 2,601 $XRP , you’re in the top 10% pic.twitter.com/aPWpOEW2Pk — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) January 5, 2025 The Entry Point for the Top 10% Recent data from the XRP rich list shows that investors must hold 2,501 XRP is enough to rank among the top 10% of holders. With XRP currently priced at $2.69, acquiring this amount would require an investment of approximately $6,727.7. The number of wallets that meet this threshold has grown significantly, with 617,768 wallets currently classified within this category. In September 2024, only 531,558 wallets were in the top 10% , and the digital asset traded around $0.5. This value shows a decline from June 2024 which Farina highlighted in his video, when 583,589 wallets were in the top 10%. The asset’s massive growth which began in November must have motivated more investors to accumulate tokens and join the top levels. However, Farina acknowledged that he controls 20-25 separate XRP wallets, indicating that the number of unique holders may be lower. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What It Takes to Reach the Top 5% The requirement is significantly higher for investors looking to move beyond the top 10% into the upper 5%. Current data shows that 9,122 XRP is the minimum amount needed to enter this category. At the current price, this equals an investment of around $24,538.18. Farina recently stated that not holding at least 1,000 XRP is insanity, and has also recommended that investors hold up to 10,000 XRP to have better profit-taking opportunities as prices increase. If the asset reaches $100, those holding 10,000 XRP could become millionaires. The Wealthiest XRP Holders – The Top 1% The threshold is considerably higher for those aiming for the most elite category. Farina said reaching the top 1% of XRP holders requires at least 53,212 XRP. With the $2.69 per token, acquiring this amount would cost approximately $143,139. Presently, only 61,777 wallets hold 53,212 XRP or more, reinforcing the exclusivity of this group. Farina also advised self-custody to avoid being priced out and hold for the long term, instead of leaving with just 2x or 3x gains.

They’re putting their money where their mouth is, estimating a whopping 85% probability of approval within the next year. Is this just wishful thinking, or is there solid ground for such bullish crypto predictions ? What’s Driving the Optimism for Litecoin ETF Approval? The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to speculation, but Polymarket’s prediction offers more than just random guesses. It represents the aggregated sentiment of informed users who are actively engaging with the market and putting their capital at stake. Here’s a breakdown of why this Polymarket prediction is noteworthy: Decentralized Wisdom: Polymarket harnesses the ‘wisdom of the crowd’. Unlike traditional polls or surveys, users on Polymarket have real financial incentives to make accurate predictions. Their bets reflect their genuine beliefs and research. Market Sentiment Indicator: An 85% prediction isn’t just a number; it’s a strong signal of market sentiment. It suggests that a significant portion of crypto-savvy individuals believe the regulatory environment is becoming more favorable for crypto ETFs, even for assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Precedent Set by Bitcoin and Ethereum: The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and the growing anticipation for Ethereum ETFs have paved the way. This momentum might be interpreted as a broader acceptance of crypto investment vehicles by the SEC, increasing the perceived likelihood of further approvals. Polymarket Predictions: A Closer Look at the 85% Likelihood To truly understand the significance of this LTC ETF approval prediction, let’s delve deeper into Polymarket and what an 85% likelihood really implies: How Polymarket Works: Polymarket is a decentralized prediction market platform built on blockchain technology. Users can trade on the outcome of real-world events by buying ‘yes’ or ‘no’ shares. The price of these shares fluctuates based on market sentiment and perceived probability. Interpreting 85%: An 85% likelihood on Polymarket means that for every $1 invested in ‘yes’ shares (Litecoin ETF approval), the potential payout is roughly $1.18 (reflecting an implied probability). Conversely, betting against it (no approval) offers a potentially higher payout but is seen as less likely by the market. Dynamic Nature of Predictions: It’s crucial to remember that this 85% figure is not static. It’s a real-time reflection of market sentiment and can change as new information emerges, regulatory developments unfold, or market conditions shift. While 85% is a strong indicator, it’s not a guarantee. The path to SEC approval in 2025 is still fraught with potential hurdles and uncertainties. The Road to SEC Approval 2025: Challenges and Opportunities for LTC ETF Even with optimistic crypto predictions and favorable market sentiment, securing SEC approval for a Litecoin ETF is not a walk in the park. Let’s consider the potential challenges and opportunities that lie ahead: Challenges Opportunities Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC has historically been cautious about crypto products, emphasizing investor protection and market manipulation concerns. Litecoin ETFs will face the same rigorous scrutiny. Growing Regulatory Clarity: Recent ETF approvals for Bitcoin and potentially Ethereum suggest a gradual shift towards a more accommodating regulatory stance on crypto. Market Maturity of Litecoin: While Litecoin is a long-standing cryptocurrency, the SEC might assess its market maturity, liquidity, and susceptibility to manipulation compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Established Market Presence: Litecoin has been around since 2011, with a well-established network, significant trading volume, and a track record of relative stability. Competition from Other Crypto ETFs: The increasing number of crypto investment products might lead to market saturation and make it harder for a Litecoin ETF to stand out and attract significant investment. Diversification Demand: Investors are increasingly looking for diversified crypto exposure beyond Bitcoin. A Litecoin ETF could fulfill this demand and offer a valuable diversification tool. Why a Litecoin ETF Matters: Benefits for Crypto Investors The potential approval of a Litecoin ETF is more than just good news for LTC holders. It carries broader implications for the crypto investment landscape. Here are some key benefits: Increased Accessibility: An ETF would make Litecoin accessible to a wider range of investors, including institutional investors and retail investors who prefer traditional investment vehicles over directly holding cryptocurrency. Enhanced Liquidity and Efficiency: ETFs are traded on regulated exchanges, offering greater liquidity and price efficiency compared to buying and selling LTC on crypto exchanges. Reduced Custodial Risk: Investors wouldn’t need to worry about the complexities and risks of self-custodying Litecoin. The ETF provider would handle custody and security. Mainstream Adoption: The approval of a Litecoin ETF would further legitimize Litecoin and the broader cryptocurrency market, potentially accelerating mainstream adoption. Navigating Crypto Predictions: Actionable Insights for Investors While Polymarket predictions and market sentiment are valuable indicators, they shouldn’t be the sole basis for investment decisions. Here are some actionable insights for investors considering the potential of a Litecoin ETF: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always conduct thorough research before investing in any cryptocurrency or crypto-related product. Understand Litecoin’s fundamentals, technology, and market position. Manage Risk: Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky. Diversify your portfolio, invest only what you can afford to lose, and be prepared for potential price volatility. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments, market news, and expert analysis related to Litecoin ETFs and the broader crypto market. Consider Long-Term Potential: Think beyond short-term price fluctuations. Evaluate the long-term potential of Litecoin and the role a Litecoin ETF could play in the evolving crypto investment landscape. The 85% prediction on Polymarket is undoubtedly exciting news for Litecoin enthusiasts and the crypto community at large. It signals growing optimism and anticipation for a more mature and accessible crypto investment market. However, as with all things crypto, vigilance, research, and a balanced perspective are paramount. The journey to SEC approval 2025 is still underway, and the final outcome remains to be seen. But one thing is clear: the market is betting on ‘yes’, and the stakes are high.

40631605,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132456,1740123249,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking: 20 US States Spearhead Bitcoin Reserve Legislation Revolution,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-states-bitcoin-legislation/,"Is the winds of change blowing for Bitcoin in the United States? Absolutely! In a landmark move that could redefine the landscape of digital assets, an impressive 20 U.S. states are actively considering and proposing groundbreaking Bitcoin reserve legislation . This surge in legislative interest signals a potential shift in how cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are treated and regulated within the nation. Let’s dive deep into this exciting development and explore what it could mean for the future of crypto. Why the Sudden Push for Bitcoin Reserve Legislation Across US States? The increasing interest in Bitcoin legislation at the state level is not happening in a vacuum. Several factors are likely contributing to this momentum: Growing Mainstream Adoption: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly mainstream. As more individuals and institutions adopt digital assets, governments are compelled to establish clear regulatory frameworks. Economic Opportunities: States are recognizing the potential economic benefits associated with embracing cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Attracting crypto businesses and innovation can lead to job creation and economic growth. Investor Protection: With increased adoption comes the need for investor protection. Cryptocurrency regulation aims to provide a safer environment for individuals engaging with digital assets, mitigating risks associated with fraud and market manipulation. Following Arizona’s Lead: Arizona has emerged as a frontrunner in pushing forward with Bitcoin reserve legislation . Their progress is likely inspiring other states to explore similar pathways. These factors, combined with a growing understanding of digital assets among lawmakers, are creating a fertile ground for Bitcoin legislation discussions across the U.S. Which US States are Leading the Charge in Bitcoin Legislation? While 20 states are reportedly involved in proposing legislation, some are further ahead in the process than others. Here’s a closer look at some of the key states making waves: Arizona: As mentioned, Arizona is at the forefront. Their efforts are being closely watched as a potential model for other states. Utah: Utah is building significant momentum, suggesting a strong interest in fostering a crypto-friendly environment. Ohio: Ohio is also showing promising signs of progress in its legislative endeavors related to Bitcoin reserves. Alabama: Alabama is another state where lawmakers are actively engaging in discussions and legislative processes concerning Bitcoin legislation . Texas: Known for its pro-business stance, Texas is also reportedly gaining momentum in its approach to Bitcoin reserve-related laws. It’s important to note that the specifics of the proposed legislation will likely vary from state to state, reflecting different priorities and approaches to cryptocurrency regulation . What Exactly is Bitcoin Reserve Legislation? The term “Bitcoin reserve legislation” might sound complex, but the core idea is relatively straightforward. It generally refers to laws that would allow or encourage states, or potentially even municipalities, to hold Bitcoin as part of their reserves. This could involve: State Treasury Holdings: Allowing state treasuries to allocate a portion of their reserves to Bitcoin, similar to how they hold other assets like gold or foreign currencies. Public Pension Funds: Enabling public pension funds to invest a percentage of their portfolios in Bitcoin, potentially diversifying their holdings and seeking higher returns. Municipal Investments: Giving local governments the option to hold Bitcoin as part of their financial reserves. The rationale behind such legislation often revolves around: Diversification: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets could offer diversification benefits to state and municipal reserves. Inflation Hedge: Some proponents argue that Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflation, preserving the purchasing power of reserves over time. Technological Innovation: Embracing Bitcoin reserves can be seen as a forward-thinking move, positioning states as leaders in technological innovation. Potential Benefits and Challenges of Bitcoin Reserve Legislation Adopting Bitcoin reserve legislation is not without its potential benefits and challenges. Let’s weigh both sides of the coin: Potential Benefits: Enhanced Portfolio Diversification: As mentioned, Bitcoin can diversify state and municipal portfolios, reducing overall risk. Potential for Higher Returns: Bitcoin’s historical performance suggests the potential for significant returns, which could benefit public funds. Attracting Crypto Businesses: States that embrace digital assets may become more attractive to crypto companies and talent, fostering economic growth. Future-Proofing Finances: Holding Bitcoin reserves can be seen as a way to prepare for a future where digital assets play a more prominent role in the global financial system. Potential Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility is a significant concern for risk-averse public entities. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, creating uncertainty around legal and accounting frameworks. Custodial Risks: Securely storing and managing Bitcoin reserves requires specialized expertise and infrastructure to mitigate custodial risks. Public Perception: Public opinion on Bitcoin can be divided, and there might be concerns about the appropriateness of using public funds for investments in volatile digital assets . What Does This Mean for the Future of Cryptocurrency Regulation in the US? The widespread consideration of Bitcoin reserve legislation across 20 US states is a significant development. It indicates a growing acceptance and understanding of cryptocurrencies at the state government level. This trend could pave the way for: More Clarity in Cryptocurrency Regulation: As states take the lead, it could pressure the federal government to provide more comprehensive and consistent cryptocurrency regulation . Increased Institutional Adoption: If states start holding Bitcoin reserves, it could signal a greater level of institutional acceptance, further legitimizing digital assets . A More Crypto-Friendly Environment: The combined efforts of these states could create a more welcoming and supportive environment for the cryptocurrency industry in the United States. While challenges remain, the momentum behind Bitcoin legislation is undeniable. It suggests that the U.S. is moving towards a future where digital assets are more integrated into the financial system, with states playing a crucial role in shaping this evolution. Stay Informed and Get Involved The developments in Bitcoin reserve legislation are unfolding rapidly. To stay ahead of the curve: Follow State-Level Legislative Updates: Track the progress of Bitcoin-related bills in your state and others. Engage with Your Representatives: Reach out to your state lawmakers to express your views on cryptocurrency regulation. Join Crypto Advocacy Groups: Support organizations working to promote sensible cryptocurrency policies. Educate Yourself: Continue learning about Bitcoin and digital assets to make informed decisions and contribute to constructive discussions. The future of cryptocurrency regulation is being shaped now, and your awareness and participation can make a difference! Conclusion: A Transformative Era for Bitcoin in the US The fact that 20 U.S. states are exploring Bitcoin reserve legislation is nothing short of transformative. It marks a significant step towards mainstream acceptance and integration of Bitcoin into the traditional financial system. While the journey is just beginning, the direction is clear: digital assets are here to stay, and states are increasingly recognizing their potential. This wave of legislative activity is a beacon of hope for the crypto community, signaling a future where innovation and regulation can coexist to unlock the full potential of digital assets and blockchain technology.

Ethereum (ETH) has dominated the market, and experts forecast a rally above $8,000 leading the altseason. Investors searching for high-upside altcoins are turning to an undervalued gem, Rexas Finance ($RXS). At $0.20, market watchers predict a major breakout that could see RXS emerging as the cycle’s best gainer. Can Ethereum (ETH) Hit $8,000 by 2025? Ethereum’s price has decreased to about $2782 from its recent $3,300 high. However, analyst Ted Pow shared a weekly price chart showing an intact support trend line. The diagram shows an increasing triangular pattern with an overhead ceiling corresponding to the $4000 psychological zone. A break above this level will signal a rally to $8000. Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick predicts that institutional demand and DeFi expansion will take ETH to this level by the end of the year. Ethereum’s significance in DeFi and smart contracts remains unprecedented. Its continuous network development and future ETF approvals might be the catalyst for a significant price increase in 2025. While ETH reaching $8,000 would be huge, altcoins within Ethereum’s ecosystem stand to benefit even more—with Rexas Finance (RXS) leading the way. Rexas Finance (RXS): The Altcoin Set Soar Alongside ETH Rexas Finance (RXS) is based on tokenizing real-world assets (RWA), allowing users to split ownership of real estate, commodities, and other tangible assets. This technique combines traditional banking and blockchain technology, transforming RXS into a high-utility ERC-20 coin with substantial development potential. Rexas Finance positions real-world assets (RWAs) on the blockchain, allowing users to tokenize and fractionalize ownership of tangible goods. For example, a $5 million commercial real estate property can be turned into 5 million $RXS-backed tokens, allowing investors to buy fractional interests in the property without difficulty. This approach increases accessibility, liquidity, and transparency by converting historically illiquid assets into trading blockchain tokens. Businesses and individuals can use Rexas Token Builder to generate and launch asset-backed tokens, ensuring a smooth tokenization process. Furthermore, the Rexas QuickMint Bot streamlines tokenization through Telegram and Discord, allowing greater accessibility. Its also offers new tools such as Rexas GenAI, an AI-powered NFT development solution, and Rexas Treasury, a multi-chain yield optimizer that maximizes dividends for cryptocurrency investors. RXS DeFi allows users to participate in governance, liquidity pooling, staking, and yield farming, increasing the value of RXS tokens. Rexas Finance Certik audit The completed RXS Certik audit , which confirms the security and integrity of its smart contracts, is boosting investor trust. Verifying the project’s long-term viability decreases risk while increasing investor trust. Meanwhile, Rexas Finance has been making waves for its presale, raising $45.2 million and selling $446 million worth of RXS tokens. This high demand shows investors recognized its value early on, setting it up for growth after listing. With the RWA tokenization sector expected to reach $16 trillion by 2030, $RXS is at the vanguard of a significant financial transformation, making it one of the most promising cryptocurrencies on the market today. To further boost adoption, Rexas Finance is hosting a $1 million giveaway . Twenty top presale participants will each earn $50,000 worth of RXS, an opportunity for investors to increase their holdings before the token’s public launch. With the presale stages nearing completion, experts believe the project has put enough in place for an explosive price rally, including its mega listings, as seen in the early stages of projects like Solana. Projections vary from 25,000% to 40,000% gain, making Rexas Finance a coin to watch amidst the Ethereum rally. Now is the Ideal Time to Buy Rexas Finance As Ethereum prepares for a possible $8,000 surge, Rexas Finance ($RXS) provides a unique opportunity to ride the wave of growth for just $0.20. With real-world use cases, a solid deflationary architecture, and institutional support, Rexas Finance is poised for a 10x boom before ETH even reaches its goal. The presale is ending shortly, and with demand on the rise, now is the time to get $RXS before it skyrockets on big exchanges.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is mandated to respond to Grayscale’s spot XRP ETF application by October 18. This crucial deadline, reported by Fox Business’ Eleanor Terrett, marks a significant moment for XRP and the broader crypto market. But what does this mean, and what are the possible outcomes? Let’s dive into the details. What’s the Buzz Around Grayscale’s XRP ETF Application? Grayscale, a leading digital asset management firm, submitted its application for a spot crypto ETF focused on XRP on February 14. The official publication of this application (form 19b-4) in the Federal Register has now set the SEC’s response clock ticking. This is not just another application; it represents a potentially groundbreaking step towards mainstream adoption of XRP and cryptocurrency investments. Why is this such a big deal? Increased Accessibility: An approved XRP ETF would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP through regulated and familiar investment vehicles, like brokerage accounts. No more navigating crypto exchanges or worrying about private key management for those who prefer conventional investment routes. Boosted Liquidity and Market Maturity: ETFs bring significant liquidity to the underlying asset. For XRP, this could mean deeper markets, reduced volatility, and a more mature market structure overall. Validation for XRP: Approval by the SEC would be seen as a major validation for XRP, especially after the recent legal clarity gained in the Ripple case. It could signal a shift in regulatory perception and open doors for further XRP adoption. Understanding the SEC Decision Process The SEC’s decision on the ETF application is a multi-layered process. Here’s a breakdown of what typically happens: Application Filing (19b-4): Grayscale submitted the initial application, detailing the proposed XRP ETF structure, operation, and rationale. Federal Register Publication: The official publication in the Federal Register initiates the formal review period and public comment period. This is where we are now. Public Comment Period: Interested parties, including the public, industry experts, and other organizations, can submit comments to the SEC regarding the application. SEC Review and Deliberation: The SEC staff reviews the application, considering public comments, and assesses whether the proposed ETF meets the necessary regulatory requirements. Key considerations include investor protection, market manipulation prevention, and compliance with securities laws. Decision (Approval, Delay, or Rejection): The SEC will issue a decision by the deadline. This could be: Approval: Green light for the XRP ETF to launch. Delay: Postponement of the decision, often requiring more information or further review. Rejection: Denial of the application, citing regulatory concerns or insufficient information. Why is this SEC Decision So Anticipated? The SEC decision on Grayscale’s XRP ETF is particularly significant for several reasons: Precedent Setting: While Bitcoin ETFs have already been approved, an XRP spot ETF approval would set a precedent for other altcoins. It could pave the way for ETFs based on Ethereum, Solana, and other cryptocurrencies, broadening the crypto ETF landscape. Market Sentiment Catalyst: A positive decision could inject significant optimism into the crypto market. It could signal a more accommodating regulatory environment and encourage further institutional investment. Conversely, a rejection could dampen sentiment, at least in the short term. Grayscale’s Track Record: Grayscale has been a driving force in pushing for crypto ETFs. Their success in converting their Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot Bitcoin ETF adds weight to their XRP ETF application. However, the SEC’s stance on altcoin ETFs remains less clear than on Bitcoin. Grayscale XRP ETF: Benefits and Potential Challenges Let’s weigh the potential benefits and challenges associated with a Grayscale Grayscale XRP ETF: Benefits Potential Challenges Easier access to XRP for retail and institutional investors Increased liquidity and trading volume for XRP Potential price appreciation for XRP due to increased demand Enhanced market maturity and credibility for XRP Diversification opportunities for investors Regulatory hurdles and potential SEC rejection Market volatility and risks associated with XRP Custodial risks associated with holding XRP for the ETF Potential for lower-than-expected adoption if investors remain hesitant Competition from other crypto investment products What Happens Next? Key Dates and Expectations The crucial date to watch is October 18 . By this date, the SEC must provide a response to Grayscale’s Grayscale XRP ETF application. While an outright approval is the desired outcome, a delay or even a rejection are also possibilities. Market analysts will be closely monitoring the SEC’s communication leading up to the deadline for any hints or signals. Investors and XRP holders should: Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with news and analysis regarding the SEC’s decision. Manage Expectations: Be prepared for any outcome – approval, delay, or rejection. Consider Risk Tolerance: Understand the risks associated with XRP and crypto investments before making any decisions based on the ETF outcome. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for XRP and Crypto ETFs The SEC’s impending SEC decision on Grayscale’s XRP ETF is more than just a regulatory event; it’s a potential watershed moment for XRP and the broader cryptocurrency ETF market. Approval could unlock significant capital flows into XRP, enhance its market standing, and pave the way for a new wave of crypto ETFs. As October 18 approaches, the crypto community waits with bated breath for a decision that could reshape the landscape of digital asset investments. The ETF application outcome will undoubtedly have lasting implications, regardless of the SEC’s final verdict.

40631739,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132418,1740123573,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,ECB’s Visionary Leap: Expanding Wholesale CBDC Platform for a Unified Digital Euro Future,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ecb-expands-wholesale-cbdc-development/,"In a significant move that underscores Europe’s commitment to staying at the forefront of digital finance, the European Central Bank (ECB) is doubling down on its efforts to develop a wholesale CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) platform. This initiative is poised to reshape how financial institutions operate within the Eurozone, promising enhanced efficiency and a more integrated financial landscape. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development and explore what it means for the future of finance in Europe and beyond. What’s Driving the ECB’s Focus on Wholesale CBDC? The ECB’s renewed push for a wholesale CBDC platform isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several factors are converging to make this a critical moment for the Eurozone’s financial infrastructure: Global Competition: With other major economies exploring or implementing their own digital currencies, the ECB recognizes the strategic importance of a digital euro. This is especially highlighted by the U.S. recent decision to halt CBDC development, potentially creating an opening for Europe to lead in this space. Efficiency in Institutional Transactions: Current systems for large-scale, interbank transactions can be complex and time-consuming. A wholesale CBDC aims to streamline these processes, making them faster, more secure, and potentially cheaper. Countering Private Stablecoins: The rise of private stablecoins poses both opportunities and challenges to central banks. The ECB sees a digital euro as a crucial tool to maintain monetary sovereignty and offer a trusted, public alternative in the digital currency realm. Fostering a Unified European Financial Ecosystem: As ECB board member Piero Cipollone emphasized, the goal is to create a more unified and efficient financial ecosystem across Europe. A wholesale CBDC can play a vital role in breaking down barriers and fostering seamless transactions between institutions across member states. The Phased Approach to Wholesale CBDC Development The ECB is not rushing into a full-scale launch of a wholesale CBDC . Instead, they are adopting a phased approach, recognizing the complexity of integrating such a system into the existing financial framework. This methodical strategy involves: Pilot Programs and Experimentation: The ECB is likely to continue conducting pilot programs and experiments to test various aspects of the wholesale CBDC platform. This allows them to identify potential challenges and refine the technology before wider implementation. Gradual Integration: The integration of a wholesale CBDC into existing systems will be a gradual process. This will involve working closely with financial institutions to ensure a smooth transition and minimize disruption. Focus on Institutional Needs: The initial focus is clearly on wholesale applications, catering to the needs of banks and other financial institutions. This targeted approach allows the ECB to address specific pain points in the current system and demonstrate the value proposition of a CBDC in a controlled environment. Benefits of an ECB Wholesale CBDC: A Glimpse into the Future What are the potential advantages of the ECB’s foray into wholesale CBDC ? The benefits are multifaceted and could have a profound impact on the European financial landscape: Enhanced Transaction Efficiency: Wholesale CBDCs promise to significantly speed up and simplify large-value transactions between financial institutions. This could reduce settlement times and improve overall market efficiency. Reduced Costs: By streamlining processes and potentially eliminating intermediaries, a wholesale CBDC could lead to lower transaction costs for financial institutions. These cost savings could eventually be passed on to businesses and consumers. Improved Security and Transparency: Leveraging blockchain or similar technologies, wholesale CBDCs can offer enhanced security and transparency in financial transactions. This can reduce the risk of fraud and improve regulatory oversight. Greater Financial Stability: A well-designed wholesale CBDC could contribute to greater financial stability by providing a more resilient and efficient infrastructure for interbank payments and settlements. Strengthening the European Financial Ecosystem: By fostering seamless and efficient transactions across borders within the Eurozone, a wholesale CBDC can strengthen the integration and competitiveness of the European financial ecosystem . Challenges and Considerations: Navigating the Road Ahead While the potential benefits of a wholesale CBDC are significant, the ECB also faces several challenges and considerations as it moves forward with its development plans: Cybersecurity Risks: As with any digital system, cybersecurity is paramount. The ECB must ensure robust security measures are in place to protect the wholesale CBDC platform from cyberattacks and vulnerabilities. Privacy Concerns: While wholesale CBDCs primarily target institutional transactions, privacy considerations still need to be addressed. Ensuring data protection and confidentiality is crucial. Interoperability: For a wholesale CBDC to be truly effective, it needs to be interoperable with existing financial systems and potentially with other digital currency platforms globally. Regulatory Framework: A clear and comprehensive regulatory framework is essential to govern the operation of a wholesale CBDC and address legal and compliance issues. Technological Infrastructure: Building and maintaining the technological infrastructure for a wholesale CBDC is a complex and resource-intensive undertaking. The ECB needs to ensure it has the necessary expertise and resources to support this endeavor. Lagarde’s Perspective on Bitcoin: Staying Grounded in Reality Amidst the excitement surrounding digital currencies, ECB President Christine Lagarde has reiterated a cautious stance on Bitcoin. She has emphasized Bitcoin’s volatility and inherent risks, deeming it unsuitable as a reserve asset for central banks. This perspective highlights the ECB’s commitment to a measured and pragmatic approach to digital currencies, prioritizing stability and reliability over speculative assets like Bitcoin in the context of official reserves. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? While wholesale CBDC primarily targets financial institutions, these developments have broader implications: For Financial Professionals: Stay informed about the ECB’s CBDC initiatives and consider how these changes might impact your institution’s operations and strategies. For Businesses: Keep an eye on the evolving digital payment landscape in Europe. Wholesale CBDCs could eventually pave the way for more efficient and cost-effective payment solutions for businesses. For Crypto Enthusiasts: Understand the distinction between wholesale and retail CBDCs. The ECB’s focus on wholesale CBDC doesn’t negate the potential for retail digital currencies in the future, but it reflects a strategic prioritization. For Policymakers: Follow the ECB’s progress closely and engage in discussions about the regulatory and policy implications of CBDCs. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Digital Euro Future The ECB’s expansion of its wholesale CBDC development platform marks a significant step forward in Europe’s digital currency journey. By focusing on institutional transactions and adopting a phased approach, the ECB is laying the groundwork for a more efficient, secure, and unified European financial ecosystem . While challenges remain, the potential benefits of a digital euro are undeniable, positioning Europe to be a leader in the evolving world of digital finance. This visionary move could reshape the financial landscape for years to come, offering a glimpse into a future where digital currencies play an increasingly central role.

Coinbase Named Custodian for Proposed Cardano ETF Key details of the filing show that Coinbase Custody Trust Company has been named as the custodian for the product.

40631786,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132571,1740123683,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Critical Shift to Bitcoin Season in Crypto Market,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-bitcoin-season-8/,"Is the crypto market undergoing a significant shift? Recent data from CoinMarketCap (CMC) suggests a resounding ‘yes’. The Altcoin Season Index, a crucial metric for gauging the prevailing market trend, has dipped to 36 as of February 21st, 00:30 UTC. This one-point drop from the previous day isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a clear indicator that we’ve transitioned into what’s known as Bitcoin Season . For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding what this means and how it impacts the broader crypto market is paramount. Let’s dive deep into the nuances of the Altcoin Season Index and explore the implications of this market phase. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: A Crypto Market Thermometer The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it’s a sophisticated tool developed by CoinMarketCap to provide insights into the comparative performance of altcoins against Bitcoin. Think of it as a thermometer for the crypto market, telling us whether altcoins are leading the charge or if Bitcoin is dominating. But how exactly does this index work? Scope: The index meticulously tracks the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC. However, it intelligently excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a clearer picture of genuine market dynamics. Timeframe: It analyzes the price performance of these top 100 coins over the past 90 days. This 90-day window offers a substantial period to identify trends and avoid short-term market noise. The Core Comparison: The index pits each of these top 100 coins against Bitcoin. The crucial question it answers is: How many of these coins have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days? Season Definitions: This is where it gets interesting. The index uses specific thresholds to define market seasons: Altcoin Season: To declare an Altcoin Season, a significant majority – at least 75% – of the top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day period. This signifies a market where altcoins are generally experiencing higher growth rates than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of the top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin. This points to a market where Bitcoin is generally outperforming altcoins, often indicating a flight to Bitcoin’s relative safety and established market position. Index Scoring: The Altcoin Season Index itself ranges from 1 to 100. A higher score would theoretically lean towards Altcoin Season, while a lower score indicates Bitcoin Season. The current reading of 36 firmly places us in Bitcoin territory. In essence, the Altcoin Season Index provides a quantifiable measure of market sentiment, helping traders and investors understand the prevailing trend and adjust their strategies accordingly. It’s a vital tool for anyone looking to navigate the volatile waters of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin Season: What Does It Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio? With the Altcoin Season Index signalling Bitcoin Season , the immediate question on every crypto investor’s mind is: What does this actually mean for my portfolio? Bitcoin Season isn’t just a label; it represents a shift in market dynamics with tangible implications. Key Characteristics of Bitcoin Season: Bitcoin Dominance: Historically, Bitcoin Season often correlates with an increase in Bitcoin dominance. This means Bitcoin’s market capitalization grows at a faster rate compared to the rest of the crypto market, increasing its share of the total market cap. Flight to Safety: During periods of market uncertainty or correction, investors often seek the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin. As the oldest and most established cryptocurrency, Bitcoin is often seen as a less risky asset compared to altcoins, especially during turbulent times. Altcoin Underperformance: While Bitcoin Season doesn’t necessarily mean altcoins will crash, it typically indicates that they are likely to underperform Bitcoin. Their growth may stagnate, or they might experience more significant corrections compared to Bitcoin. Capital Rotation: We often see capital rotating from altcoins back into Bitcoin during Bitcoin Season . Traders and investors may take profits from altcoin positions and reinvest in Bitcoin, anticipating its outperformance. Is Bitcoin Season Always Negative for Altcoins? Not necessarily. While Bitcoin Season implies Bitcoin outperformance, it doesn’t spell doom for all altcoins . Here’s a nuanced perspective: Selective Altcoin Opportunities: Even in Bitcoin Season , certain altcoins with strong fundamentals, unique technology, or upcoming catalysts can still perform well. It’s crucial to differentiate between strong and weak projects. Accumulation Phase: For long-term investors, Bitcoin Season can be an accumulation phase for quality altcoins . If prices are correct during this period, it can present opportunities to buy fundamentally sound altcoins at potentially discounted prices. Market Cycles: Crypto markets are cyclical. Bitcoin Season is often followed by Altcoin Season and vice versa. Understanding these cycles is key to strategic portfolio management. Navigating the Crypto Market During Bitcoin Season: Actionable Insights So, how can you effectively navigate the crypto market during Bitcoin Season ? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Re-evaluate Your Portfolio Allocation: Consider adjusting your portfolio to increase your Bitcoin holdings, especially if you were heavily weighted in altcoins . This doesn’t necessarily mean selling all your altcoins , but perhaps rebalancing to reflect the current market trend. Focus on Quality Altcoins: If you remain invested in altcoins , prioritize projects with strong fundamentals, solid use cases, active development teams, and healthy communities. Avoid speculative or meme coins that are more vulnerable during Bitcoin Season . Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) into Bitcoin: Bitcoin Season can be an opportune time to implement or increase your DCA strategy into Bitcoin. Consistent buying during periods of consolidation or correction can be beneficial in the long run. Stay Informed and Adaptable: The Altcoin Season Index is a dynamic metric. Monitor it regularly and stay informed about broader market trends. Be prepared to adapt your strategy as market conditions evolve. Manage Risk: Bitcoin Season can sometimes be associated with increased market volatility. Ensure you have proper risk management strategies in place, including setting stop-loss orders and not investing more than you can afford to lose. The Future Outlook: Will Altcoin Season Return? While the Altcoin Season Index currently points to Bitcoin Season , the crypto market is inherently dynamic. Market sentiment can shift rapidly, influenced by various factors such as technological advancements, regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, and institutional adoption. It’s highly likely that Altcoin Season will return in the future, as the crypto market typically moves in cycles. The key takeaway is to remain informed, adaptable, and strategic. Understanding tools like the Altcoin Season Index empowers you to make more informed decisions and navigate the ever-changing landscape of the cryptocurrency market effectively. By recognizing the signals and adjusting your approach accordingly, you can position yourself to capitalize on both Bitcoin Season and the eventual resurgence of altcoins .

Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining sector in Russia grew in 2024 as the number of mining farms rose 7% to 136,600, Russian newspaper Kommersant reports , citing data by MTS EnergyTool. As of January 2025, total mining capacity in the country had crossed 11 GW. Moscow accounted for about 9% of the farms, while the surrounding Moscow region had 8%. Irkutsk remained the top mining hotspot, hosting over 10% of the identified crypto mining farms, the data shows. Despite the growth, legal crypto miners in Russia only use 3 GW out of the available 11 GW, the report says. While Russian authorities have been working to bring underground crypto miners into the legal fold, energy consumption apparently remains a major issue, with many still operating off the books.

Irkutsk, in particular, attracts miners with its cheap hydroelectric power. However, regulators continue to crack down on illegal mining operations that strain local grids. In early August 2024, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed new laws officially legalizing Bitcoin and digital asset mining. Under the new rules, citizens can mine Bitcoin as long as they stay within the government’s electricity cap, though the Bank of Russia still has the power to ban specific assets if they pose a risk to financial stability. As crypto.news reported earlier, Russian power grid operator Rosseti lost over 1.3 billion rubles in 2024 due to illegal crypto mining, with miners tapping into electricity through unauthorized connections. The biggest losses hit the North Caucasus, where Rosseti Severny Kavkaz reported damages exceeding 600 million rubles. In Novosibirsk, losses reached 400 million rubles, while Rosseti Center and Privolzhye saw around 120 million rubles drained.

Ozak AI progresses credibly throughout its presale phase as investors actively participate, while its capability to analyze data using AI positions it at the forefront of the next wave of blockchain innovation. This convergence of AI and blockchain technology, alongside the rebound of key crypto assets like Dogecoin and Dogwifhat, marks a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency market. The firm is currently in the third round of its presale stage, having raised more than $850,000 by selling over 152 million $OZ tokens. The initial value of $0.001 for the $OZ token has surged to its current price of $0.003. According to experts, the $OZ token may achieve a value of $1 during 2025 before reaching a minimum exchange price of $0.05. Ozak AI’s Rapid Growth: Harnessing AI and Blockchain for Financial Innovation The growth of Ozak AI happens mainly because it depends on innovative technologies, including the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). These elements are essential for real-time data processing, pattern recognition, and secure data decentralization. Ozak AI is positioning itself as a significant player in the blockchain space, providing advanced financial decision-making solutions powered by predictive analytics and AI. The company’s deflationary token model, with a capped supply of 10 billion tokens, ensures that early investors could see substantial returns if the project continues its upward trajectory. Through its Ozak Prediction Agent (PA), the platform delivers advanced predictive analytics, enabling users to make more informed investment decisions. This strategic focus on leveraging AI for financial intelligence is key to Ozak AI’s potential for success in a competitive market. Rebounding Cryptos—Dogecoin and Dogwifhat’s Market Activity The successful pre-sale of Ozak AI raises market interest in the price recovery of established cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin (DOGE) as well as Dogwifhat (WIF). On-chain expert Ali Martinez provides research that indicates Dogecoin is demonstrating the potential for recovery through the positive signals from daily active addresses, whale movements and transaction volume data. Market measurements that rise could boost DOGE price sustainability since the cryptocurrency has struggled with market fluctuations during recent weeks, according to Martinez. Dogwifhat (WIF) shows price fluctuations following its rapid surge, which it experienced over the previous months. The current price drop of WIF indicates positive analyst projections because market sentiment improvements may produce another price surge. Market sentiment demonstrates a clear influence on the stock performance of meme coins, including WIF, because cryptocurrency markets dramatically react to outside factors and user engagement. Conclusion The combination of AI and blockchain at Ozak AI gives it a leading role in the developing decentralized finance market as well as predictive analytics. Ozak AI continues to attract investors throughout its presale period while its token value increases, which proves that its financial decision automation and meaningful insights capabilities are becoming more apparent. The current market momentum of Dogecoin alongside Dogwifhat demonstrates a promising direction for the entire cryptocurrency sector. Modern technology infrastructure and a growing group of investors position Ozak AI to benefit from both the AI and blockchain industry developments.

What is happening? The TVL metric is now rising faster than we’re able to comfortably comprehend. For context, our previous Ecosystem review in August reported that Sonic had surpassed $200 million in TVL, meaning it has since added more than $800 million in just within the last couple of months. BREAKING: @SonicLabs Rockets Past $1B TVL, Up 49.6% in Price last 7 Days! Sonic is rewriting the rules — TVL shattering records, momentum hitting overdrive. With staking and lending fueling the ecosystem, the Layer-1 revolution is here. Bet on innovation. Bet on Sonic.… pic.twitter.com/yQzMUXq1va — Sonic Insider (prev Fantom Insider) (@insider_sonic) February 20, 2025 Sonic’s Unstoppable Growth: A Layer-1 Revolution Sonic is demonstrating its ability to be a game-changer in the DeFi space, proving that it is not only a fast-evolving ecosystem but also one that is expanding at a considerable rate. This warrants decreased attention toward something Ecco could otherwise be thought of as—a simple liquidity pool. So, for all intents and purposes, consider Sonic a DeFi powerhouse. It has even “surged past $1 billion” in total value locked, at the time of this writing, according to DeFiLama—a significant achievement in and of itself. The Sonic ecosystem is moving forward thanks to its strong staking and lending features, which have proven to be popular with DeFi users. These mechanisms are not only bringing in new participants but also maintaining high levels of liquidity within the system. Users can earn rewards by staking assets in Sonic’s infrastructure, and its lending platform allows for borrowing and lending in a decentralized, transparent manner. Not too many projects have such a unique infrastructure. The synergy created by these mechanisms is producing a self-sustaining ecosystem that is moving forward and gaining momentum. Sonic’s ecosystem is notched up among the top protocols pulling in the Total Value Locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi). The latest data from DeFiLlama shows that, of the projects within the Sonic ecosystem, @SiloFinance has the most TVL. They are followed by @Beets_fi, @avalonfinance_, @ShadowonSonic, and @SwapXfi—among others. This concentration of projects with respectable TVL suggests that the Sonic ecosystem is a good place to build.

Besides its truly explosive growth in total value locked (TVL), Sonics has seen a nearly 50% uptick in its price in just the past week. This goes without saying (but let’s say it anyway) — a nearly 50% price growth in just a week signals something, and what it’s signaling is strong investor confidence and a rapidly growing market interest. On top of that, they’re not just confidence and interest; they’re also something that’s increasingly in demand. A number of things are causing this good price action. First, the total DeFi space has been growing very strongly and pushing a lot of value into the tokens of DeFi projects. This means that more folks are looking to the Sonic platform for the kind of services DeFi offers, which is basically finance without banks. And they are finding the Sonic ecosystem complete, robust, and competitive. At the same time, the Sonic platform has been making several moves of its own. It has been improving and introducing new features, which have made it even more desirable to users and investors. Sonic’s achievement in exceeding the $1 billion TVL landmark, along with the favorable price action, sends an unmistakable message. That message is: The Layer-1 revolution is very much alive and gaining traction. At the same time, it invites speculation about what the Sonic ecosystem might accomplish next. The rapidity with which Sonic has drawn developers and users to its platform suggests it could be a harbinger of a future DeFi world. Caution Ahead: Profit-Taking Could Be on the Horizon Even though things are looking up, the Sonic token’s price might be facing some short-term volatility. That is what seems to be the consensus among market analysts. They have pointed to a head-and-shoulders pattern that has formed in the Sonic token’s price chart. This technical formation could mean that Sonic’s price is due for a pullback or some kind of correction. Martinez’s analysis also shows that the TD Sequential indicator, a technical analysis tool used to spot potential price trends, is giving a sell signal on the 4-hour chart. This would suggest that the market is potentially poised for a profit-taking phase in the near future—that is, traders might be looking to cash in on recent gains. While this doesn’t necessarily mean Sonic’s bullish run is over, it could indicate some short-term price fluctuations have a decent chance of materializing. #Sonic $S has hit the target from its head-and-shoulders pattern. Now, with the TD Sequential flashing a sell signal on the 4-hour chart, a spike in profit-taking could be on the horizon! pic.twitter.com/iMrA0r0pUF — Ali (@ali_charts) February 20, 2025 It’s crucial to grasp these technical signals and the potential for a pullback shortly if you’re considering being part of Sonic’s ecosystem. Perhaps even more so than with other cryptocurrencies, you really need to stay on top of what’s happening in the market, because Sonic seems to be in a near-constant state of price discovery. The Road Ahead for Sonic Sonic’s ascendance appears likely to continue, and with it, the ecosystem’s prospects can only brighten. Between its DeFi features that are as ambitious as they are various, an ever-broadening array of protocols, and a burgeoning community, Sonic has seemingly set itself up to be a big player in the Layer-1 revolution. Yet, like any nascent blockchain project, Sonic must contend with typical emerging-project problems, such as the very real possibility of market corrections and intensifying competition from Layer-1 protocol neighbors like Aptos, Sui, and others. Still, from a DeFi perspective, the apparent strength of this protocol’s innovation and the very real power of its technical infrastructure, when taken together with the ecosystem continuous growth path in terms of both TVL and user base, make it seem safe to say that Sonic has the opportunity to become a major player in the DeFi space. While the market takes in and makes sense of Sonic’s recent price and total value locked surge, what is bound to get most of our attention in the coming months is how the entire Sonic ecosystem progresses and sharpens in this new chapter. Will it rewrite the rules? Will it play nice and not give us conflict? Will conflict equals revenue? Will market dominance give way to market corrections? Time and price action will tell, but the recent price surge gives us a reason to pay attention to the Sonic story. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The wait is finally over for Aussie crypto enthusiasts. Betashares, a prominent Australian fund manager, has just launched a spot Bitcoin ETF Australia on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). This groundbreaking move, trading under the ticker QBTC, opens up a new avenue for investors to tap into the world’s leading cryptocurrency right here in Australia. But here’s the exciting twist: QBTC isn’t directly holding Bitcoin. Instead, it’s ingeniously linked to the NYSE-listed Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Let’s delve into what this means for you, the Australian investor, and the broader crypto market. What’s the Buzz About the New ASX Bitcoin ETF? The launch of the Betashares QBTC marks a pivotal moment for crypto investment Australia . For years, Australian investors seeking Bitcoin exposure had limited options, often involving navigating complex overseas exchanges or holding Bitcoin directly, with its associated security concerns. Now, with QBTC, accessing Bitcoin exposure becomes as straightforward as trading any other ETF on the ASX. This accessibility is a game-changer, potentially drawing in a wave of new investors who were previously hesitant to enter the crypto space due to perceived barriers. Here’s a quick breakdown of what makes this launch so significant: Accessibility: QBTC trades on the ASX, making it easily accessible to Australian investors through their existing brokerage accounts. No need for separate crypto exchange accounts or wallets. Regulation: As an ETF listed on a regulated exchange like the ASX, QBTC offers a layer of regulatory oversight and investor protection that is often lacking in the broader crypto market. Familiar Investment Vehicle: ETFs are well-understood investment products. QBTC allows investors to gain Bitcoin exposure within a familiar and comfortable framework. Diversification: For portfolio diversification, QBTC provides a new asset class option within a traditional investment structure. Betashares QBTC: How Does it Link to Bitwise BITB? The innovative structure of the Betashares QBTC is key to understanding its operation. Instead of directly holding Bitcoin, QBTC invests in the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), which is listed on the NYSE in the United States. This indirect approach is likely a strategic move by Betashares to navigate the current regulatory landscape and offer a Bitcoin ETF Australia as quickly as possible. By investing in BITB, QBTC essentially piggybacks on the already established and regulated infrastructure of a US-listed Bitcoin ETF. This allows Australian investors to indirectly benefit from the performance of Bitcoin through a locally accessible and regulated product. Why Choose an ASX Bitcoin ETF Like QBTC? The advantages of investing in an ASX Bitcoin ETF , specifically QBTC, are compelling for a range of investors: Simplified Bitcoin Exposure: QBTC removes the technical complexities of buying, storing, and securing Bitcoin directly. Investors don’t need to worry about private keys, crypto wallets, or exchange security breaches. Diversification within Crypto: While still linked to Bitcoin’s price movements, investing in an ETF can offer a degree of diversification compared to holding a single cryptocurrency directly. Potential Tax Benefits: Depending on individual circumstances and Australian tax laws, investing through an ETF structure might offer certain tax advantages compared to direct crypto ownership. (It’s always best to consult with a financial advisor regarding your specific tax situation). Institutional Grade Access: ETFs are often preferred by institutional investors due to their regulatory compliance and ease of integration into traditional portfolios. QBTC opens up Bitcoin exposure to a broader range of institutional investors in Australia. Are There Challenges to Consider with QBTC? While the launch of QBTC is undoubtedly exciting, it’s important to approach any investment with a balanced perspective. Here are some potential challenges and considerations: Indirect Bitcoin Exposure: QBTC’s performance is tied to BITB, which in turn tracks Bitcoin. While this provides exposure, it’s not direct ownership of Bitcoin. The price of QBTC will reflect BITB’s price, which itself tracks Bitcoin, so there are layers to consider. Management Fees: ETFs typically charge management fees. Investors need to be aware of the fee structure of QBTC and compare it to other investment options. Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility. QBTC, being linked to Bitcoin, will also be subject to this volatility. Investors need to be comfortable with the potential for significant price swings. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for crypto assets is constantly evolving. Changes in regulations in either Australia or the US could potentially impact QBTC and BITB. Actionable Insights for Investors: Is QBTC Right for You? So, should you consider adding QBTC to your investment portfolio? Here are some actionable insights to guide your decision: Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Bitcoin and crypto assets are inherently volatile. Understand your risk tolerance and ensure that investing in QBTC aligns with your overall investment strategy. Do Your Research: Before investing, thoroughly research both Betashares QBTC and the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB). Understand their investment objectives, fee structures, and performance. Consider Your Investment Goals: What are you hoping to achieve by investing in Bitcoin? Is it long-term growth, diversification, or something else? Align your investment in QBTC with your financial goals. Start Small: If you’re new to crypto investing, consider starting with a small allocation to QBTC. You can gradually increase your investment as you become more comfortable. Seek Professional Advice: Consult with a qualified financial advisor to discuss your investment goals and determine if QBTC is a suitable investment for your individual circumstances. The Future of Crypto ETFs in Australia Betashares’ launch of QBTC is likely just the beginning. It paves the way for potentially more ASX Bitcoin ETF products and broader crypto ETF offerings in Australia. As the regulatory landscape for digital assets matures and investor demand grows, we can expect to see further innovation and diversification in crypto investment products available on the ASX. This could include ETFs holding other cryptocurrencies, thematic crypto ETFs, and more sophisticated investment strategies. The arrival of QBTC is a clear signal that the Australian financial market is increasingly embracing digital assets and recognizing the growing investor appetite for crypto exposure. A Landmark Moment for Australian Crypto Investors The launch of Betashares QBTC ASX Bitcoin ETF is more than just the listing of a new investment product. It’s a landmark moment that signifies the growing maturity and acceptance of cryptocurrency within the Australian financial system. It offers a regulated, accessible, and familiar pathway for investors to participate in the Bitcoin market. While challenges and volatility remain inherent in the crypto space, QBTC represents a significant step forward in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. This revolutionary move could reshape how Australians invest in crypto for years to come, making Bitcoin exposure more mainstream than ever before.

Per a recent filing with the Brooklyn federal court, Smith admitted to misleading investors about the status of SafeMoon’s liquidity pool, falsely claiming it was locked and inaccessible. Prosecutors allege he, along with CEO Braden John Karony and creator Kyle Nagy, diverted client funds for personal use, thereby engaging in securities fraud and wire fraud. In his recent court appearance before Magistrate Judge Cheryl Pollak, Smith withdrew his initial not-guilty plea and formally pleaded guilty to both charges. Judge Pollak has since recommended that U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee, who is overseeing the case, accept Smith’s new plea. If accepted, Smith faces a maximum sentence of 20 years for wire fraud conspiracy and up to 25 years for securities fraud conspiracy. The sentencing decision now rests with Judge Komitee, who will weigh the severity of the offenses and Smith’s cooperation in the ongoing investigation.

Smith, Karonym, and Nagy were accused of conspiracy, fraud, and money laundering tied to the deceptive promotion and handling of the SafeMoon token (SFM), which was classified as an unregistered crypto asset security. According to the SEC, the team falsely marketed SFM as a secure investment, claiming that its liquidity pool was locked and inaccessible to the project’s insiders. In reality, prosecutors allege the executives retained full access and siphoned off more than $200 million in investor funds. These funds were allegedly used for personal gain, including luxury cars, expensive real estate, and other high-end purchases. The trio was also accused of engaging in wash trading—a deceptive tactic where the same asset is bought and sold simultaneously to create misleading market activity. With this, they were able to inflate the token’s market cap to as high as $8 billion at its peak, which later crashed, leaving thousands of investors with significant losses. Smith and Karony were arrested shortly after the charges were filed, while Nagy remains at large. Karony has pleaded not guilty to all charges and previously attempted to have them dismissed. His request for a trial delay was recently denied , and opening statements are set to begin on April 7.

Sounds like a plot from a futuristic financial thriller? Well, leading asset management firm VanEck thinks this could be reality. Their latest report suggests a groundbreaking strategy: by strategically acquiring and holding Bitcoin, the U.S. government could potentially offset a staggering $21 trillion of its debt by 2049. Let’s dive into this fascinating proposition and explore how the BITCOIN Act could be the unexpected game-changer. The Shocking Potential of Bitcoin for U.S. National Debt Reduction VanEck’s recent analysis isn’t just another crypto market prediction; it’s a detailed examination of how a proactive stance on Bitcoin could revolutionize the U.S.’s fiscal landscape. The core of their argument revolves around the BITCOIN Act, championed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, a known advocate for cryptocurrency. This act proposes that the U.S. government should establish a strategic reserve of Bitcoin, aiming for up to 5% of the total Bitcoin supply. Here’s the crux of VanEck’s stunning projection: Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: If the U.S. government were to follow the BITCOIN Act and accumulate 1 million Bitcoin by 2029. Long-Term Holding: Holding these Bitcoin assets until 2049. Debt Offset: This strategic reserve could potentially offset approximately $21 trillion of the national debt by 2049. Significant Debt Reduction: This amount represents about 18% of the projected total U.S. debt in 2049. To put this into perspective, $21 trillion is an astronomical figure. Reducing the projected national debt by almost a fifth through a forward-thinking approach to Bitcoin is nothing short of revolutionary. But how does this work, and what are the underlying assumptions? Understanding the BITCOIN Act and its Vision for Cryptocurrency Senator Cynthia Lummis’s BITCOIN Act isn’t just about jumping on the crypto bandwagon. It’s a strategic proposal rooted in the belief that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are not fleeting trends but fundamental shifts in the financial paradigm. The act envisions: Recognizing Bitcoin’s Strategic Importance: Positioning Bitcoin as a strategic asset, akin to gold reserves, in the digital age. Government Bitcoin Reserve: Establishing a U.S. government-held reserve of Bitcoin to enhance financial security and potentially generate revenue. Diversification and Innovation: Encouraging diversification of national assets and embracing innovation in the financial sector. The BITCOIN Act reflects a growing sentiment among some policymakers that embracing cryptocurrency is not just about technological advancement but also about strategic financial planning. VanEck’s analysis provides a compelling economic rationale for this perspective, focusing on the potential for national debt reduction. How Can Bitcoin Potentially Reduce the US National Debt? The idea of Bitcoin, a decentralized digital currency, playing a role in managing a nation’s debt might seem unconventional. However, VanEck’s projection is based on the fundamental principles of Bitcoin’s scarcity and potential for value appreciation. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Scarcity and Demand: Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins. As demand increases over time, driven by adoption and institutional interest, its value is expected to rise. Strategic Investment: Acquiring Bitcoin at current or future prices and holding it as a long-term investment leverages this potential appreciation. Value Appreciation Over Time: VanEck’s analysis assumes a significant appreciation in Bitcoin’s value over the next 25 years (until 2049). This appreciation is what generates the potential $21 trillion offset. Debt Repayment or Asset Backing: The appreciated Bitcoin reserve could then be used to directly repay a portion of the national debt or serve as an asset backing, improving the nation’s financial position. Essentially, it’s a bet on Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. If Bitcoin continues to grow in adoption and value as many analysts predict, a strategic reserve could become a highly valuable asset capable of making a tangible impact on the US debt situation. What are the Challenges and Considerations? While the potential benefits are immense, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and considerations associated with this bold strategy: Volatility of Bitcoin: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate significantly, which could impact the value of the reserve in the short to medium term. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Government adoption of Bitcoin would necessitate clear and supportive regulations. Public Perception and Political Will: Convincing the public and policymakers about the merits of investing in Bitcoin for debt reduction might require overcoming skepticism and misconceptions about cryptocurrency. Security and Custody: Securing and managing a large Bitcoin reserve requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Market Impact of Large Purchases: Large-scale Bitcoin purchases by the government could impact the market price, potentially driving up acquisition costs. These challenges are not insurmountable, but they require careful planning, strategic execution, and a long-term vision. A phased approach to Bitcoin acquisition, coupled with robust risk management strategies, could mitigate some of these concerns. Examples of Countries and Companies Embracing Bitcoin The idea of governments or large entities holding Bitcoin is not entirely novel. Several countries and companies are already exploring or implementing Bitcoin strategies: El Salvador: The first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador has also added Bitcoin to its national reserves. MicroStrategy: This publicly traded company has made Bitcoin its primary treasury reserve asset, holding billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin. Other Nations Exploring Bitcoin: Various other nations are considering or experimenting with Bitcoin for different purposes, including remittances, inflation hedging, and diversification. These examples demonstrate a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential beyond just a speculative asset. They pave the way for more significant institutional and governmental adoption, aligning with the vision of the BITCOIN Act . Actionable Insights: Is Bitcoin the Answer to US Debt Woes? VanEck’s analysis presents a compelling, albeit ambitious, scenario. While it’s not a guaranteed solution, it offers actionable insights for policymakers and investors alike: Consider Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset: Governments and institutions should seriously consider the potential of Bitcoin as a strategic asset for long-term financial planning and diversification. Explore Regulatory Frameworks: Developing clear and supportive regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies is crucial to facilitate responsible adoption and innovation. Educate and Engage: Public education and open dialogue are essential to address misconceptions and foster informed decision-making about cryptocurrency and its potential benefits. Phased and Strategic Adoption: A phased and strategic approach to Bitcoin acquisition, as suggested by the BITCOIN Act, can mitigate risks and optimize potential benefits. The prospect of using cryptocurrency , specifically Bitcoin, to tackle the monumental challenge of the U.S. national debt is undoubtedly intriguing. VanEck’s report serves as a crucial conversation starter, highlighting the need to explore innovative solutions and consider unconventional assets in addressing complex financial challenges. Conclusion: A Bold Vision for America’s Financial Future? VanEck’s projection of a $21 trillion debt offset through Bitcoin acquisition is a bold vision that demands attention. Whether the U.S. government will embrace the BITCOIN Act and embark on this path remains to be seen. However, the analysis undeniably underscores the transformative potential of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in reshaping global finance and even addressing seemingly intractable problems like national debt . As the digital asset landscape matures, strategic and forward-thinking approaches like the one proposed by VanEck and Senator Lummis may well become increasingly relevant in navigating the complexities of the 21st-century economy.

Today’s official market capitalization for XRP is up 6%, which is kind of impressive when you consider that the broader crypto market isn’t really moving. Moreover, over the past week, XRP’s market capitalization has increased by 9%. As far as I can tell, these positive price movements are a result of some very recent developments in the ecosystem surrounding XRP. XRP’s Outperformance: A Strong Player in a Stagnant Market Even though many leading cryptocurrencies have seen a period of stagnation or slight losses, XRP has actually shown a good deal of strength and is outperforming most of its peers. At the time of writing, XRP’s market cap is holding quite strong and is standing out as one of the only major assets that have managed to register any kind of upward movement at all. It’s risen over 6% just today in market cap and is showing an overall upward trend of 9% in the last week. So it’s definitely looking like XRP is a solid performer in what has otherwise been a pretty lackluster market. One of the most alluring aspects of XRP’s recent performance is its price action compared to Bitcoin ($BTC). Since November 11, 2024, $XRP has experienced an astonishing surge of 297% in relation to $BTC, which is a hefty gain for any asset, much less this ultra-volatile sector. If this trend continues, it might be fair to say that XRP is on a path of strength—gaining traction while many (including) Bitcoin face headwinds. Despite flat crypto market conditions, XRP Ledger's market cap is +6% on the day and in the minority as a positive gainer over the past week (+9%). Since November 11, 2024, $XRP 's price vs. $BTC is +297%. There are 261 more 100K+ XRP wallets than 10 weeks ago, a strong sign… pic.twitter.com/5O37A7En7g — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 19, 2025 Growing Confidence: More High-Value Wallets Appear XRP’s budding influence and budding market presence are crystallizing into a growing number of high-value wallets. In just the past 10 weeks, the number of crypto wallets with over 100,000 XRP has jumped by 261. This is a number not often seen with other major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ether. Because large moves in and out of a wallet can really shake the price of a crypto, it’s important to pay attention to wallets that hold large amounts of a cryptocurrency. We cannot overlook the increase in these large wallets, for they may indicate that strategic accumulation of XRP is taking place. By who, we may ask? Here are a couple of possibilities that spring to mind: Either institutional investors are buying and storing large amounts of XRP, or wealthy individuals who believe in XRP’s potential as a future asset are accumulating it. The uptick in high-value wallets is meaningful because investors watch such trends closely for signs of where the market might be headed; an accumulation by “the smart money” tends to infuse the market with greater confidence. What’s Next for XRP? Ascending Triangle Setup Could Trigger a 26% Price Move The resilience of XRP has caught the attention of analysts, who are now directing their focus onto the technical chart patterns that the asset is currently displaying. In terms of what XRP is actually doing on the technical side, many experts have zeroed in on a formation that is often associated with a potential breakout: an ascending triangle. As mentioned earlier, the formation of the ascending triangle is often seen as a possible precursor to a potent breakout. If XRP does indeed break out from the ascending triangle formation to the upside, it could mean an approximate 26% move to the upside. An ascending triangle is typically regarded as a pattern that points to bullish conditions, as it indicates that buying pressure is increasing steadily, even as the price faces resistance. If XRP can push past the key resistance point of the triangle, it could light a fuse under its price, as traders and investors react to the technical breakout. With the price of XRP holding steady in a flat market, and large investors showing increased interest, many believe the breakout could be imminent. This is an exciting opportunity for traders and investors to track the short-term performance of XRP. If the price does see that 26% bump, it’ll probably take a lot of folks by surprise and set off a new wave of interest and trading activity among the XRP community. It’ll also be interesting to see if XRP can maintain the kind of momentum on its price and trading volume that would suggest XRP can be a solid performer in the crypto market throughout 2025. $XRP is gearing up for a breakout from this ascending triangle, which could trigger a 26% price move! pic.twitter.com/m7d18xMyAZ — Ali (@ali_charts) February 20, 2025 The Road Ahead for XRP: Will the Momentum Continue? XRP’s recent performance shows that it has a solid foundation, both technically and fundamentally. The way it moves in relation to Bitcoin, the rising number of high-value wallets, and its nearly completed breakout from the ascending triangle all suggest that it’s an asset primed to do something very positive in the near future. Investors should exercise caution and due diligence when approaching any cryptocurrency, given the unpredictable swings of the market. The breakout from the ascending triangle is a nice technical development, but a breakout isn’t the same as a guaranteed move to the upside. XRP is now trading in conditions that are better than most other cryptocurrencies, and considering the broader market environment, that’s a pretty bullish statement. Forecasting the 2025 future of XRP is a complex calculation involving several moving parts. It’s not just about how and where price energy is being directed right now but also about the levels of pricing confidence that investors are carrying into the future. One fairly obvious pricing confidence indicator is the presence of large wallets. These emerging big players are significant enough in the market that we need to factor their presence and influence into any price future conversation we want to have about XRP. At present, XRP is moving upward, and if it keeps this up, 2025 could see it break new ground and establish itself even more as one of the standout assets in the crypto market.

Speaking at the Future Investment Initiative Institute conference in Miami, the president said he wants to position the US as the global leader in crypto , and according to him, Bitcoin’s record-breaking prices are proof that the market trusts his stance . But it’s not just about words. In a recent video analysis, Altcoin Daily analyses Trump’s two major moves: clearing out restrictive regulations and potentially stockpiling Bitcoin as a national asset. Meanwhile, Bitcoin got a boost after the president mentioned it at a conference. The price jumped from $96,000 to $98,450 as investors reacted to the news. This shows how big announcements can quickly affect Bitcoin’s value. Michael Saylor Advocates for a US Bitcoin Reserve Strategy’s michael saylor michael saylor Michael J.

He also held 2.4 million shares of MicroStrategyEvents Attended: Bitcoin 2024 Nashville and BTC prague msaylor@microstrategy.com Entrepreneur Crypto and Blockchain Expert Author has been vocal about the US government securing Bitcoin as a strategic asset . He suggests that the country should acquire at least 20% of Bitcoin’s total supply to maintain its financial dominance. His argument highlights how digital assets are becoming crucial in shaping global economies, with Bitcoin’s limited supply making it a valuable long-term investment. Trump’s comments on Bitcoin appear to support this idea, as he continues to express his belief that cryptocurrency should be an integral part of the financial system. His views reflect a possible change in how the US government sees Bitcoin, taking a 360-degree turn from overreach to active participation. Regulatory Changes and Policy Shifts Moving on, the Blockchain Association’s Kristin Smith has rated the current regulatory outlook for crypto as highly positive. Congress is now focused on reversing previous restrictions, including the repeal of SAB 121 , which placed limits on institutional crypto adoption. Policymakers are also working on frameworks for stablecoins and clearer market structures, aiming to create a stable and innovation-friendly environment for crypto businesses. This will open the market for new investors in the US who were previously afraid to enter the crypto space due to SEC’s regulations increasing adoption and bringing fresh capital to the system. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Sam Bankman-Fried Seeks Donald Trump’s Pardon in the FTX Saga , Growing Institutional Interest in Ethereum and XRP ETFs However, Bitcoin is not the only prime focus. Investors are also driving Ethereum ETFs to the next level. According to Matt Hougan from Bitwise, this trend reflects a bigger acceptance of Ethereum as a key player in the crypto market . Plus, discussions around potential ETFs for XRP and Solana have started gaining momentum. The SEC’s changing stance suggests that more crypto assets could soon be available in regulated investment products, making them accessible to a wider range of investors. All these factors are building a bullish scenario for not only Bitcoin but for the entire crypto market. We have to wait and watch how Trump will fulfill his promises; as of now, it’s all words after all. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

At press time, the price has crashed by more than 65% and is currently trading at $0.65. Pi Coin has been a subject of controversy for quite some time. What initially appeared to be an innovative blockchain project aimed at bringing cryptocurrency to mobile phones has been plagued by several allegations and reports pointing to its questionable practices. Pyramid Scheme and Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) Allegations One of the primary concerns surrounding Pi Coin is its referral-based mining system, which bears a striking resemblance to a multi-level marketing (MLM) structure. In this setup, users are encouraged to invite others to join the platform, with those recruits becoming part of the original user’s “downline.” This creates a hierarchical system where those who recruit more members benefit financially by increasing their mining rates. The Hengyang City Public Security Bureau of Hunan Province, in a July 2023 release, labeled Pi Coin as a scam, specifically pointing to its hierarchical invitation mechanism. This practice, which rewards recruiters for bringing in new members, is a key feature of pyramid schemes. Preying on the Elderly According to reports, Pi Coin has unfortunately been involved in schemes targeting the elderly. According to the Wuxi City Public Security Bureau’s release in July 2023, scammers used Pi Coin’s promise of getting rich overnight to lure elderly individuals into downloading its mobile app. The scammers often claimed that users could mine Pi Coin for free by simply using their phones and inviting others to do the same. Several police reports show incidents where elderly individuals were deceived into uploading sensitive personal information, such as identification cards, as part of the sign-up process. This, in turn, exposed them to further risks, including identity theft. Data Leaks and Privacy Concerns Another major issue Pi Coin has faced involves serious privacy breaches. In May 2021, a large-scale data leak occurred involving the personal information of approximately 10,000 Vietnamese citizens. The leak, which included sensitive data like identity card numbers, phone numbers, and home addresses, was allegedly tied to Pi Network. Although Pi Network denied responsibility for the leak, claiming that the data had been compromised by a third-party service provider, Yoti, this incident further tainted the project’s reputation.",News|Crypto news,EN,0,0,ASIA|MINING|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-21 07:51:02

The event clearly spotlighted—for better or worse—what actual power a Coinbase listing can wield in pushing a cryptocurrency’s price higher and also gives more momentary visibility to $CLANKER. As crypto traders and investors try to make sense of what this space is all about, with AI now being factored in, $CLANKER has surged to the forefront. Coinbase’s Listing Announcement Fuels Clanker’s Surge Coinbase’s status in the cryptocurrency market is clear—when it lists a digital asset, that asset typically experiences a large price jump, as demonstrated by the 80% price rise we saw with $CLANKER. Once it confirmed that $CLANKER would be added to its listing roadmap, the token began rapidly gaining attention and, one might even say, respect. Assets added to the roadmap today: tokenbot (CLANKER) https://t.co/rRB9d3hSr2 — Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) February 19, 2025 Of course, for smaller cryptocurrencies—$CLANKER is hardly a household name—just being mentioned by a major exchange can lead to a big upsurge in interest and price. And that might be the most significant development of this whole story: $CLANKER is on its way to becoming a legit cryptocurrency. The largest Clanker-based token by market cap, @_Clanker 's price soared nearly 80% as Coinbase added the token to its listing roadmap. Interesting that Coinbase listings can significantly impact prices, especially those of smaller tokens pic.twitter.com/9PGSLmtzJ1 — Vishal C. (@vishal4c) February 20, 2025 The price increase also arrives at a moment when the cryptocurrency AI sector is starting to gain more notice. As AI tech continues to move forward apace in lots of directions, its integration into blockchain projects generates increasingly enthusiastic responses, and for AI-driven tools like Clanker’s token deployment apparatus—well, these are the sorts of developments that put Clanker on the map for potential investors and users. And if Clanker winds up as one of the leaders in the space, a Coinbase listing can’t hurt. In the first day following the announcement, $CLANKER became the most discussed AI Agent project, generating major mindshare among the crypto crowd. Its recent rise in price and newfound fanfare only reinforce the narrative that AI and crypto are in some way synergistic and that the tools being used are fundamentally different from those of yesteryear and thus worth paying attention to.

Clanker is a platform powered by artificial intelligence, and its primary purpose is to streamline and improve the process of creating tokens. When users of the platform want to deploy a new token, they can tag Clanker with the token idea in a Farcaster client (like Warpcast or Supercast), and the AI will get to work launching the token on the Base layer-2 blockchain. This method allows for a rapid and efficient deployment of new tokens, which fits right into the current demand for not just new assets, but also new decentralized applications. Clanker is appealing because of what it offers: a combination of the powers of AI and blockchain. By providing an easy-to-use platform for the creation of tokens, Clanker removes a lot of the technical barriers that exist for users who don’t have the experience or the know-how to build those tokens themselves. And with this tool, Clanker is making it possible for a lot of new projects and decentralized communities to come together—if not thrive—on the blockchain. Clanker’s integration with Farcaster, a decentralized social network, adds another level of utility to the platform, on top of the already useful technical benefits. By allowing its users to tag Clanker through their Farcaster clients—like Warpcast and Supercast—Clanker is taking full advantage of the current trend of decentralized social media and user-generated content. Using Farcaster to tag Clanker in posts allows for even more innovative ways to use Clanker and a wider array of people to potentially stumble across the platform in the blockchain and crypto spaces. The Impact of Coinbase Listings on Smaller Tokens The significant price movement of $CLANKER reminds us of the influence that a listing on Coinbase can exert on relatively unknown tokens. For a long time, Coinbase has been one of the most powerful forces in the cryptocurrency world. When it decides to list a token, that event often points to the token’s bright future. You sure can’t say that about every token out there. Yet listing on Coinbase definitely makes a token like $CLANKER more visible. Immediate liquidity and visibility to a worldwide audience of traders are two benefits of a Coinbase listing. But perhaps the more important effect of a token listing is how it bolsters investor confidence. When a token lists on Coinbase, it’s almost like a stamp of approval, a form of market validation that signals the token is worthy of and ready for much bigger things. And this strong impression that Coinbase conveys can have some immediate and sizable effects on the price of a token. Clanker’s recent upsurge is a vivid example of how a small project can suddenly become prominent when it lists on a major exchange. The surge has given exposure to Clanker and its tool that operates on the “AI-driven blockchain.” But Clanker was not just a small player that suddenly shot to the top. In fact, Clanker is the child project of the much bigger hedge fund on Solana called Galois Capital. Galois Capital came to prominence in the crypto space in late 2021 when it became a leading investor and sponsor of various projects. Looking Ahead: What’s Next for Clanker? Clanker is becoming more popular, and our future looks brighter. The project’s distinct concentration on AI-driven token deployment makes them sound like an exhilarating outfit in the blockchain landscape. Following the announcement from Coinbase, we’re gaining a lot more visibility in the space, at least. The price of our token shot up after that, but maintaining a price level—really, ensuring price appreciation into the future—that requires consistent evolution and innovation on our part, and maybe on your part too, as token holders. In the next weeks and months, we will find out if Clanker can use its Coinbase listing to turn itself into a sustainable ecosystem. More and more users and developers are adopting Clanker’s tools for token creation. If this trend continues, it could solidify Clanker’s role as a key player in decentralized finance (DeFi) and artificial intelligence (AI), which could remake it into an even bigger player in the crypto space. At present, $CLANKER’s 80% price surge serves as a testament to the might of strategic announcements and mounting investor interest in AI-based blockchain solutions. It is still early days for the project, but as it continues to evolve, it will be fun to watch how it carves out a space for itself in the undecided, token-creating project class.

40632160,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132578,1740124320,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Surprising Survey Reveals: One in Three Australians See Positive Crypto Impact from Trump,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/australians-view-trump-positive-crypto/,"Is Donald Trump secretly a crypto bull? While the former US President’s stance on digital currencies has been… let’s say, dynamic , a recent survey from down under has unearthed a rather surprising perspective. It appears a significant chunk of Australians believe ‘The Donald’ is actually good news for the crypto world. Let’s dive into this fascinating Aussie crypto sentiment and unpack what it all means. Decoding the Australian Crypto Survey: Trump’s Crypto Influence Independent Reserve, a well-known crypto exchange in Australia, recently polled 2,100 Australian adults to gauge their views on various crypto-related topics. Among the intriguing findings was the perception of Donald Trump’s impact on the cryptocurrency landscape. Cointelegraph reported that the survey highlighted that nearly one-third of Australians – a solid 31% – perceive Trump’s influence on crypto as positive. Now, before you picture kangaroos stacking sats, it’s important to understand the nuances. A significant majority, around 60%, opted for a neutral stance, suggesting either indifference or perhaps a ‘wait-and-see’ approach regarding Trump’s crypto dealings. On the other end of the spectrum, only a small 8% viewed his impact negatively. This paints a picture of cautious optimism, or at least, not outright pessimism, when it comes to Trump and crypto in the Australian context. Crypto Investor Sentiment vs. Mainstream Views Here’s where things get even more interesting. The survey data reveals a stark contrast between crypto investors and those who are not yet in the crypto game. It turns out that crypto investors in Australia are considerably more bullish on Trump’s crypto effect. A noteworthy 50% of crypto investors surveyed believe Trump’s influence is positive. That’s a whole half! This strongly suggests that those already invested in digital assets are more inclined to see Trump as a potential ally or catalyst for the crypto market. Conversely, among non-crypto investors, the positive sentiment towards Trump’s crypto impact is considerably lower, at just 20%. This disparity highlights a potential knowledge gap or difference in perspective between those actively involved in crypto and the general public. It could also indicate that crypto investors are more attuned to, or perhaps more hopeful about, any external factors that could positively influence the value and adoption of digital currencies. Let’s break down the numbers for clarity: Overall Australian Adults: Positive view of Trump’s crypto impact: 31% Neutral view: ~60% Negative view: 8% Crypto Investors: Positive view of Trump’s crypto impact: 50% Non-Crypto Investors: Positive view of Trump’s crypto impact: 20% Why the Positive Crypto Market Sentiment Towards Trump? So, why are some Australians, particularly crypto investors, seeing Trump as a positive force for crypto? While the survey doesn’t delve into the ‘why,’ we can speculate on a few potential reasons based on Trump’s general political and economic stances, and how they might be interpreted within the crypto community: Deregulation Advocate: Trump’s broader political ideology often leans towards deregulation. Crypto enthusiasts might interpret this as a potential for a less restrictive regulatory environment for digital currencies in the US, which could have global ripple effects, including in Australia. Market Volatility = Opportunity: Trump’s presidency was often characterized by market volatility. While volatility can be risky, many crypto traders thrive in volatile markets, seeing it as an opportunity for profit. Therefore, some might view Trump’s potential return to power as a catalyst for increased market activity and potential gains in the crypto space. Anti-Establishment Figure: Cryptocurrencies, at their core, often represent a challenge to traditional financial systems and institutions. Trump, as a political outsider and anti-establishment figure, might resonate with some crypto proponents who see him as someone who disrupts the status quo, potentially benefiting decentralized finance. Geopolitical Uncertainty: Global political and economic uncertainty can sometimes drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Trump’s policies and pronouncements often introduced an element of unpredictability, which, paradoxically, could be seen as positive for the crypto market by some seeking safe havens or uncorrelated assets. Is This a Global Trend in Crypto Investor Sentiment? While this survey is specific to Australia, it begs the question: is this positive sentiment towards Trump’s crypto influence a broader global trend among crypto investors? It’s difficult to say definitively without similar surveys conducted in other countries. However, it’s plausible that similar sentiments might exist in other parts of the world, particularly among those who share the perspectives outlined above regarding deregulation, market volatility, and anti-establishment views. Further research and surveys across different regions would be needed to ascertain whether this Australian finding is an isolated case or part of a larger global trend in crypto investor sentiment regarding political figures and their potential impact on the digital asset space. It’s certainly a fascinating area to watch as the intersection of politics and cryptocurrency continues to evolve. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts So, what can crypto enthusiasts and investors take away from this survey? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed on Global Political Developments: This survey underscores the fact that global political events and figures can indeed influence the cryptocurrency market. Keeping abreast of political developments, particularly in major economies like the US, is crucial for crypto investors. Consider Diverse Perspectives: Understanding how different segments of the population (like crypto investors vs. non-investors) perceive external factors can provide valuable insights into potential market movements and sentiment shifts. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): While surveys provide interesting data points, always conduct your own thorough research before making any investment decisions based on political opinions or survey results. Understand the potential risks and rewards associated with any crypto investment. Engage in Crypto Community Discussions: Discussing these findings and their implications within the crypto community can lead to a richer understanding of the various factors influencing the market and help refine your own investment strategies. Conclusion: Decoding the Trump Crypto Puzzle The Australian survey offers a compelling glimpse into the complex relationship between political figures and the cryptocurrency market. The fact that a significant portion of Australians, and especially crypto investors, view Donald Trump as a positive influence on crypto is a noteworthy finding. Whether this perception is accurate or will translate into tangible market effects remains to be seen. However, it highlights the increasing interconnectedness of the political and crypto spheres and underscores the importance of considering a wide range of factors when navigating the dynamic world of digital currencies. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, understanding these nuanced perspectives will be crucial for both investors and observers alike.

40632282,https://nulltx.com/?p=145470,1740124480,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Pyth Network Gears Up for Major Growth: Coinbase to List $PYTH and Grayscale Launches Institutional Fund,https://nulltx.com/pyth-network-gears-up-for-major-growth-coinbase-to-list-pyth-and-grayscale-launches-institutional-fund/,"Pyth Network, a powerful oracle protocol on Solana , might be on the verge of undeniable growth and expansion. Why? Well, first of all, there’s the matter of getting your token into the hands of as many relevant parties as possible, and one way to do that is to list the token for trading on a popular exchange. Coinbase, for instance, is a very popular exchange. And guess what? Coinbase is set to list the Pyth token ($PYTH) for spot trading on February 20th, 2023—so right around the same time you’re reading this. Day 5 of posting 3 random things about @PythNetwork that you might or might not know – within the past 7 days, $pyth got listed on Robinhood, Grayscale launched PYTH Trust and Coinbase is expected to list $pyth for spot trading today Feb 20th 9 am pst – there are currently 110+… — Planck (@hopheycaptain) February 20, 2025 The drama surrounding Solana’s memecoin market has threatened to cast shade on Pyth, but Pyth is still there. Pyth is and continues to be a crucial, major infrastructure provider for decentralized finance. It serves off-chain data for smart contracts. The protocol’s integration into major platforms like Coinbase and Grayscale makes it an infrastructure provider even my mom could understand. Because who doesn’t understand Coinbase and Grayscale? And if Pyth is broadcasting off-chain data to these two heavyweights, well then, Pyth’s got to be doing something right, no? Coinbase and Grayscale: Two Major Moves in One Week Pyth Network has received a major boost with the announcement from Coinbase that it will begin supporting $PYTH for spot trading on its platform. This listing will come into effect on February 20th, 2025, at 9 a.m. PST. For a long time now, people have been expecting $PYTH to be listed on a major exchange, and this is a development we naturally welcome because Coinbase is one of the world’s most prominent crypto exchanges. Now, we look ahead. Increased liquidity, wider accessibility, and an immediate uptick in trading volumes seem to be in the plans for $PYTH. Coinbase will add support for Pyth Network (PYTH) on the Solana network (SPL token). Do not send this asset over other networks or your funds may be lost. Transfers for this asset are available on @Coinbase & @CoinbaseExch in the regions where trading is supported. — Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) February 19, 2025 In parallel to Coinbase’s announcement, Grayscale, a preeminent digital asset management firm, has debuted an institutional fund centered on the $PYTH token. The debut of the PYTH Trust not only reinforces the token’s legitimacy but also creates an avenue for institutional investors to access the Pyth Network (which underlies $PYTH). Grayscale’s selection of $PYTH for this Trust is a testament to the burgeoning confidence that both it and the market at large express in the Pyth Network’s prospects. Hearing two peals—the listing of $PYTH on Coinbase and the establishment of the PYTH Trust at Grayscale—serves to underscore the rapidly growing recognition that the Pyth Network enjoys in both retail and institutional circles. The Importance of Pyth Network and Its Role in the Solana Ecosystem The Pyth Network is the leading oracle protocol for the Solana blockchain, supplying vital off-chain data feeds to decentralized finance projects and applications on Solana. Oracles are such a fundamental piece of the decentralized puzzle that making them reliable is one of the best ways to ensure that smart decentralized applications will perform as expected. And Pyth is kind of like the KGB in a Cold War scenario. It has eyes and ears out in the world, but it doesn’t always do its job in a way that’s friendly to decentralized finance. That’s because Pyth provides off-chain data feeds to on-chain contracts with something like 99% reliability. And if you don’t trust Pyth, you might not want to use the applications that are built on top of the proficient oracle it is. Pyth, the leading oracle protocol on Solana, has powered the growth of the Solana DeFi ecosystem by providing the data infrastructure necessary to drive a wide array of applications. In fact, the protocol’s data feeds are trusted by many DeFi projects on Solana, which makes Pyth a pretty integral player in the larger ecosystem. That said, while Pyth’s recent push to expand off of Solana and onto other chains promises to open up a whole new world for the protocol, it faces some serious challenges that threaten key aspects of its value. Despite its trustworthiness, Pyth is not yet premier in the oracle space, which raises some questions about the protocol’s recent overtures to big-name DeFi projects. And then there’s the Solana situation. Still, Pyth has a solid future, boosted by its collaborations and important developments of late. The two events—the listing on Coinbase and the advent of the Grayscale fund—are clear indicators of Pyth’s burgeoning relevance in the crypto sector. Recent Developments and Their Impact on $PYTH’s Price In the last week, a string of essential events surrounding $PYTH has captured the interest of retail and institutional investors. The token’s recent listing on Robinhood, an expanding trading platform that has opened up the world of cryptocurrency to a much wider audience, was perhaps the most attention-grabbing development. $PYTH is now easily tradeable by virtually anyone with a mobile phone—just alongside Venus, Sol, and the Gorga. These key developments mean that $PYTH has attracted much attention from a large number of players, including traders, institutions, and retail investors. The upcoming listing on Coinbase, the conversion from Grayscale to an ETF, and the recent listing on Robinhood give $PYTH an unprecedented level of visibility. This visibility could serve as a driver for what crypto people like to call “tokenomics”—that is, the economy of the token—meaning this visibility could lead to price appreciation and a deeper level of adoption. It is essential to note, however, that $PYTH’s ascent has encountered some bumps. The memecoin drama surrounding Solana has, for a time, pulled Pyth into the limelight of Twitter news cycles. The price of the underlying tokens issued by the Pyth Network has, at times and in some moments, been quite volatile, leading to the price of $PYTH itself becoming somewhat of a roller coaster. Grayscale has launched a $PYTH institutional fund PYTH is the biggest oracle protocol on Solana and is currently down due to SOL memecoins drama. From the price structure, PYTH looks very close to a bottom, which could be around $0.15-$0.17 After that, the next rally will… pic.twitter.com/QOA7rzm4d1 — AMCrypto (@AMCryptoAlex) February 19, 2025 Nevertheless, with the backing of Coinbase, Grayscale, and the other not-too-shabby institutional partners that frequently support crypto ventures, $PYTH appears to be well-positioned for growth over the long haul, no matter how parts of the market play out. What’s Next for Pyth Network? When we look to the future, Pyth Network’s seems to be a very bright one, as it moves ahead to expand its role within both the Solana ecosystem and the wider DeFi landscape. With support from major players like Coinbase and Grayscale, Pyth Network is positioned quite well to lead the oracle space—not only on Solana but also across other blockchain networks. The protocol is set up in such a way that allows it to provide high-quality, real-time data to DeFi applications that makes the network essentially indispensable to the burgeoning decentralized finance industry. The latest progress for $PYTH investors indicates a solid prospect for the token to gain both in price and in market acceptance. Partnerships are a necessity for an oracle protocol, and Pyth Network has in a very short time built an impressive list of partners, consisting of many major players in the blockchain space. If Pyth Network continues on its current trajectory, it is likely to be a very strong player in the industry. As we head into 2025, Pyth Network will be in the spotlight as it tackles the challenges and opportunities in front of it. The listing on Coinbase, the fund run by Grayscale for institutions, and the burgeoning presence of Pyth across the DeFi space all ensure that $PYTH will remain a prominent asset in the near term.

40632300,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132581,1740124568,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Warning: Bitcoin ETF Outflows Hit $364.7M – 3rd Day of Net Exits!,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-outflows-warning-signs/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! The U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market is sending some shockwaves. After a period of significant inflows and market excitement, we’re now seeing a notable shift. For the third consecutive day, these much-anticipated investment vehicles have experienced net outflows, totaling a substantial $364.7 million on February 20th alone, according to data from Trader T’s X account and Farside Investors. Is this a temporary blip, or a sign of deeper market currents? Let’s dive into the details and analyze what this could mean for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto landscape. Decoding the Bitcoin ETF Outflows: What’s Happening? To understand the magnitude of this shift, let’s break down where these Bitcoin ETF outflows are originating. It’s not just one ETF experiencing this trend; it’s a collective movement across several major players in the spot Bitcoin ETF arena. Here’s a snapshot of the ETF-specific data: ETF Provider ETF Ticker Net Outflow/Inflow (USD Million) BlackRock IBIT -$111.88 ARK Invest ARKB -$98.3 Fidelity FBTC -$88.2 Grayscale GBTC -$33.5 Grayscale BTC -$61.1 Bitwise BITB +$24.1 VanEck HODL +$4.2 Other ETFs – $0.0 As you can see, while Bitwise’s BITB and VanEck’s HODL managed to attract inflows, the significant outflows from giants like BlackRock, ARK Invest, and Fidelity, coupled with continued exits from Grayscale’s GBTC, heavily outweigh these positive figures. This results in the substantial net outflow of $364.7 million. Why are Spot Bitcoin ETFs Seeing Outflows Now? The million-dollar question is: why the sudden change in sentiment? After the initial euphoria surrounding the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., several factors could be contributing to these outflows: Profit Taking: Bitcoin has experienced a remarkable price surge in recent times. Investors who bought into Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs earlier may be taking profits off the table, leading to selling pressure and outflows. Market Correction: The crypto market is known for its volatility. These outflows could be part of a broader market correction, with investors de-risking their portfolios amidst uncertainty or anticipating a potential pullback in Bitcoin’s price. Grayscale GBTC Dynamics: GBTC, converted from a trust to an ETF, has been consistently seeing outflows since its conversion. This is partly attributed to investors moving to ETFs with lower fees and also investors who were previously locked in being able to redeem their shares. The continued outflows from GBTC are a significant contributor to the overall net outflow figures. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic conditions, including inflation concerns, interest rate hikes, and geopolitical events, can influence investor sentiment and risk appetite. Uncertainty in the global economy could be prompting some investors to reduce their exposure to riskier assets like Bitcoin. Rotation into Other Assets: It’s also possible that investors are reallocating capital to other asset classes, including other cryptocurrencies, traditional stocks, or bonds, depending on their investment strategies and market outlook. Impact of Crypto ETF Outflows on Bitcoin Price Crypto ETF outflows , particularly when sustained over multiple days, can exert downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin. ETFs hold actual Bitcoin to back their shares. When there are net outflows, ETF providers need to sell Bitcoin to meet redemption requests, increasing supply in the market. Conversely, net inflows create buying pressure. While a few days of outflows don’t necessarily signal a long-term bearish trend, it’s crucial to monitor if this becomes a sustained pattern. Consistent outflows could indicate weakening institutional demand and potentially contribute to a price correction. However, it’s important to remember that the ETF market is still relatively new, and daily fluctuations are expected. Long-term trends and overall investor sentiment are more critical indicators. Are ETF Outflows a Reason to Panic? Not necessarily. While three consecutive days of ETF outflows is noteworthy, it’s essential to keep this in perspective: Early Stages: Spot Bitcoin ETFs are still in their early adoption phase. Market dynamics are still being established, and volatility in flows is expected. Context of Massive Inflows: Prior to these outflows, these ETFs experienced massive inflows, indicating strong initial institutional and retail interest in accessing Bitcoin through regulated investment products. Long-Term Outlook: The fundamental thesis for Bitcoin and its potential as a store of value and alternative asset remains unchanged. Short-term fluctuations in ETF flows shouldn’t overshadow the long-term growth potential of the crypto market. Individual ETF Performance: Note that not all ETFs are experiencing outflows. Bitwise and VanEck, for example, saw inflows, suggesting that investor preferences and fund-specific factors also play a role. Actionable Insights: Navigating Bitcoin ETF Outflows So, what should investors do amidst these ETF outflows ? Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on daily ETF flow data from reputable sources like Farside Investors and analysts like Trader T. Understanding the trends is crucial. Zoom Out: Don’t get overly fixated on short-term fluctuations. Consider the broader market context, long-term Bitcoin fundamentals, and your own investment horizon. Diversification: Diversification remains key in any investment portfolio, especially in the volatile crypto market. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Risk Management: Assess your risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio accordingly. If you are uncomfortable with short-term volatility, consider reducing your exposure to Bitcoin or crypto assets. Seek Professional Advice: If you are unsure about how to navigate these market dynamics, consult with a qualified financial advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your individual circumstances and investment goals. Conclusion: Caution and Vigilance in the Bitcoin ETF Market The recent Bitcoin ETF outflows serve as a reminder that the crypto market, even with the introduction of regulated investment products, remains dynamic and subject to shifts in investor sentiment. While these outflows are a development to watch closely, they don’t necessarily signal an end to the Bitcoin ETF story. Instead, they highlight the importance of vigilance, informed decision-making, and a balanced perspective in navigating the exciting yet often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency investments. Keep your finger on the pulse, stay informed, and remember that long-term trends often outweigh short-term noise.

40632355,https://nulltx.com/?p=145469,1740124646,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,$LIBRA’s Dramatic Plunge Costs Traders $251M Amid Argentina Scandal,https://nulltx.com/libras-dramatic-plunge-costs-traders-251m-amid-argentina-scandal/,"The weekend brought considerable turbulence to the cryptocurrency market, with $LIBRA , the native token of the well-known decentralized project, crashing in price—and crashing hard. The price plunge left investors holding $LIBRA with a breathtaking $251 million less than they had before the price dive. Nansen, a crypto analytics platform, reported that the price plunge affected an overwhelming 86% of traders. They, too, are now counting the losses from this net negative wealth creation event that has drained quite a bit of liquidity from the crypto market. The ongoing scandal concerning $LIBRA’s connections to Argentina was linked to the token’s sudden plummeting price. This has mixed investors with fear and uncertainty, and the situation has been worsened by general market volatility. But while all this seems to have left the $LIBRA trade in a pretty dismal state, with almost all traders who engaged with it between February 16 and 18 now sitting on net losses, there nonetheless appear to be some bright spots where a few traders have managed to yield profits. A Harsh Reality for $LIBRA Traders The latest data from Nansen shows that $LIBRA’s price drop affected its holders severely, resulting in a $251 million loss. Eighty-six percent of traders lost money, and many suffered significant hits to their portfolios because of $LIBRA’s sharp and sudden decline. Conversely, the 14% of traders who were profitable during this time earned a collective $180 million—less than what the majority lost. If nothing else, this divergence of outcomes highlights how devastating the impacts of $LIBRA’s price drop really were. 86% of $LIBRA Traders Lost a Total of $251M Amid Argentina Scandal According to @nansen_ai , last weekend’s $LIBRA plunge wiped out over $250M from investors. Key data: 86% of traders lost a total of $251M Profitable traders only gained $180M $LIBRA became a ""net… pic.twitter.com/Tf1Mr0u5Fv — Followin (@followin_io) February 20, 2025 The $LIBRA crash, for many traders, was a “net negative wealth creation” effect. This means that the overall market value was depleted, losses far outweighed any gains, and more wealth was destroyed than created. The weekend’s wild swings in value, which pushed $LIBRA from about $228 on Friday to $126 by Monday morning, were the result, at least in part, of some very external events. These included a widely publicized hearing in Washington, D.C., where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other top U.S. financial regulators came before Congress to discuss the Libra situation. This situation has also led to worries about the liquidity of the larger market. When a significant number of traders take big hits and in a very short time, it tends to dent overall market confidence. That seems to be the case right now—in crypto and perhaps extending to the broader market. If you look at a chart of major asset price movements over the past month or so, they all seem to have the same pattern: a sharp drop followed by a lack of liquidity to sustain any kind of upward movement. Argentina Scandal: The Catalyst for $LIBRA’s Fall? The dramatic price movement of $LIBRA can be ascribed to a number of factors, but the catalyst seems to be the ongoing scandal regarding the token’s connection to Argentina. It has been reported that the project is being looked at very closely for its part in some questionable financial dealings in that country, and this is creating a lot of investor uncertainty. So much, in fact, that selling panics are appearing in the market, where traders are trying to exit the situation as quickly as possible before it has a chance to get any worse. This has left many questioning the stability and long-term viability of $LIBRA. The token, which had gained popularity for its decentralized and innovative nature, now faces some serious reputational damage that will take a while to recover from. As the amount of the weekend’s losses continues setting in, investors are reassessing the situation. Many are now deciding whether to hold or abandon their holdings and take what’s left in cash. The crash’s timing couldn’t have been worse for holders of LIBRA, as the market already faced broader macroeconomic uncertainties. Internal project difficulties, such as the Argentina scandal, combined with external fluctuations in the overall crypto space to produce a perfect storm that saw LIBRA lose considerable value in a very short time. The Road Ahead for $LIBRA and Its Traders Following the crash, $LIBRA traders are now dealing with the financial fallout and the uncertainty of what comes next. Some traders hope the project can recover and regain its prior momentum. Others, however, are questioning the cost of the recent Argentina scandal to the token’s “brand.” The heavy losses suffered by so many traders are already impacting the token’s liquidity in the marketplace—making it all the more difficult for new $LIBRA investors to join the party without running into substantial risk. For the developers of $LIBRA, the current situation demands a remobilization of efforts to shore up the project’s reputation. A focus on not just the community’s but also the Project’s now seemed necessary. Two opportunities presented themselves: one in Argentina itself and the other in the U.S.-based community. The work of this week was thought to be essential for both opportunities—to begin some damage control and try to get the Project on a path toward rebuilding its reputation. Meanwhile, the price of $LIBRA is probably going to stay volatile, with traders and investors keeping a close eye on any developments associated with the project’s connections to Argentina. While some may view this as a potential buying opportunity to pick up the dip, others will likely stay on the sidelines until the project offers clearer signs of recovery. Conclusion: The Dark Side of Cryptocurrency Volatility The huge losses suffered by $LIBRA traders remind us of the risks we take when investing in the world of cryptocurrencies, which are anything but stable. Certainly, there are high rewards to be had; however, we could just as easily be facing massive losses on projects that are already turning sour due to sensational headlines and are under threat from potential lawsuits and much closer regulatory scrutiny. For now, $LIBRA has to fight uphill to restore any kind of reputation and rebuild anything resembling market confidence, while the rest of us try to assess just how much risk we are facing by being involved in this token at all.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Penny cryptos offer high earning potential, and ChowWow, TRON, and Cardano stand out as top picks for investors seeking the next big opportunity. Table of Contents Cardano: Talo integration sparks hope TRON: Staking activities spike ChowWow: Rewarding token holders via its staking platform Conclusion Cryptocurrencies have a large potential, and penny cryptos are considered to be among the most lucrative instruments for obtaining high revenues. They are relatively cheap and have a high earnings capacity, meaning that they can yield high returns and are suitable for those seeking the next big thing. There are quite a number of tokens in the market, but three stand out that could make investors millionaires: ChowWow (CHOW), TRON (TRX), and Cardano (ADA). All these cryptocurrencies have different characteristics that make them suited for progress in the next couple of years. But among them, ChowWow stands out due to its platform being incorporated with play to earn game and staking. As the presale is still active, there are many people rushing to invest heavily in the project by purchasing tokens in large quantities. Let’s take a look at what makes these three penny cryptos exceptional. Cardano: Talo integration sparks hope Cardano adopted EUTxO to provide higher scalability and, at the same time, increased security measures. That is a difference compared to account-based projects, including Ethereum. But, the model faced issues surrounding cost-efficient liquidity solutions and had liquidity inefficiencies, cyclic trading activities, and a lack of advanced trading platforms. That made ADA traders adopt manual strategies, CEXs or third-party bots. However, most solutions were expensive or came with information undisclosed, thus negatively affecting retail traders and smaller projects. Nevertheless, Talos has promised to fill the gap with advanced technology that relieves liquidity in the Cardano ecosystem. Talos integration aims to enable Cardano to have a different liquidity pool that will offer a better trading experience for institutional and retail investors. This will mean that the users will be able to access a tighter spread size, which will make holders of Cardano more optimistic about the project. TRON: Staking activities spike Tron’s USDT supply rose from $6.7 billion to $62 billion in 2021, painting the picture of stablecoin expansion. This is an indication of a gradual shift in the usage of stablecoins to attract more liquidity in crypto assets. Industry analysts pay increased attention to DeFi operations on TRON and other platforms as well. Due to the general bearish market, DeFi activities were slightly down this month as traders were not very active. The high sell pressure compounded the sentiments with assets loss, which was recorded in Q4 2024. In general, the majority of the networks have experienced an overall drop in the total value locked as well as a drastic drop in the trading volumes. The same is true for the TRON network, which decreased its TVL in the current trading environment. However, staking activities rose to new records, indicating that more people are transitioning to earn yield from their assets. You might also like: Surge predicted for ChowWow in 2025; CHOW aims to be leading SOL meme coin ChowWow: Rewarding token holders via its staking platform ChowWow is a meme coin that is popular for fast and cheap transactions and has a well-developed community support base. Unlike other meme tokens, the ChowWow token is built on the Solana network and stands out as a high-potential token and long-term investment project. Another factor contributing to the growth of ChowWow is its ability to incorporate a play-to-earn gaming system. These games are available to everyone; however, users cannot participate in P2E games and earn CHOW tokens if they do not own any of them. It is noteworthy that the portion of CHOW generated by in-game sales is added to the rewards pool and distributed among the game players, which is why it is the leading crypto project. Moreover, 10% of total tokens are devoted to gaming rewards, which can stabilize the game during its early phases. ChowWow has also integrated a stake-to-earn model that basically enables users to stake their CHOW for passive income. This way, users assist in enhancing the popular network and, at the same time, increase the liquidity so as to support the same. These new crypto staking rewards will depend on the quantity of crypto that has been staked and the period when staking is performed. Conclusion ChowWow, Cardano, and TRON are the leading penny cryptos to invest in the market now. But ChowWow is an exciting new crypto that is getting noticed by top investors. With its fast transactions, strong community, and promising technology, it is a promising crypto project. To learn more about ChowWow, visit the ChowWow presale.

The company, which has made clear that this is only the starting point, held 1,300 BTC in June 2025. By the end of 2025, Metaplanet plans to hold 10,000 BTC, and by 2026, the company’s holdings will have, as promised, increased to 21,000 BTC. To put this in context, when the company hits that mark, it will hold approximately 0.1% of all Bitcoin in existence. Japanese firm Metaplanet has ramped up its Bitcoin holdings to 2,100 BTC, with plans to reach 21,000 by 2026. Their latest purchase: 68.59 BTC for $6.6M. They're clearly betting big on Bitcoin! From 97.85 to 2,100 BTC in 10 months. Targets 10,000 BTC by late 2025, 21,000 by… — Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) February 20, 2025 The most recent acquisition made by the company is a substantial one. They bought 68.59 BTC for $6.6 million. This purchase is not just any purchase, but an indicator of the company’s confidence in Bitcoin. They appear to see it as a store of value, much like gold, and they are betting that it could be a hedge against inflation. The pace at which they are accumulating Bitcoin is impressive. They now hold 2,100 BTC, which is 2,200% more than they had just 10 months ago. Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: A Hedge Against Market Volatility Since April 2024, Metaplanet has had a Bitcoin-focused treasury strategy. It paid off. Following this, the firm’s stock price surged by more than 427%. This newfound confidence in the Metaplanet’s treasury strategy is palpable in the markets. While many firms have struggled to find ways to show accumulation of Bitcoin on their balance sheets, Metaplanet has seemed in some ways to be light years ahead. Accumulating Bitcoin through bonds and stock options rather than through traditional equity or other assets (on-balance sheet) has set them apart in terms of what appears to be a forward-thinking, risk-adjusted strategy. METAPLANET CONTINUES BITCOIN ACCUMULATION, PLANS TO HOLD 10,000 BTC BY YEAR END Metaplanet has expanded its bitcoin holdings with a new purchase of 68 BTC for $6.6 million, reinforcing its position as a major corporate bitcoin holder. The company now holds 2,100 BTC, securing… pic.twitter.com/v8hKrFaymq — IBC Group Official (@ibcgroupio) February 20, 2025 Long held up as “digital gold,” Bitcoin is gaining traction as an asset for public companies that want to guard against inflation, uncertain economic conditions, and the ups and downs of traditional markets. Inflation and geopolitical instability aren’t just affecting the U.S.; they’re hitting global markets. At times like these, an increasing number of firms are looking to Bitcoin as a non-correlated asset that might perform well when our usual investments—stocks, bonds, and the like—are under pressure. This trend is clear in Metaplanet’s strategy. The company is amassing Bitcoin as part of its portfolio and seems to be steering toward a not-so-distant future in which digital currency plays a larger role in the overall economy. Its leadership sees Bitcoin both as a modern equivalent of gold and as a hedge that could help offset the ups and downs of traditional financial markets. The Market’s Positive Response to Bitcoin Investment Rephrased Text: You can’t say enough about how the market has reacted positively to Metaplanet’s strategy of making Bitcoin the centerpiece of its treasury. Ever since the firm announced that it would be accumulating the cryptocurrency as part of its plan, its stock price has gone into overdrive, shooting up 427% and then some. So apparently, not only are Bitcoin itself and all the abstract and legal advantages of holding it making for a pretty sweet situation for Metaplanet, but the company also seems to be benefiting from a market perception that it’s somehow “forward-looking” for adding the digital currency to its treasury. The remarkable growth in stock price is not merely a consequence of Bitcoin’s soaring valuation, but also a reflection of investor enthusiasm regarding the company’s vision for its future. Clearly, investors have been favorably impressed by this bold decision to hitch the company’s fortunes to what is becoming recognized, in the wake of recent economic events, as an alternative asset class—one that XN may well have in its sights for risk management. And if Bitcoin really is on the cusp of becoming a valid asset class—to say nothing of the cash flow generation and the potential for an EPS ramp-up that might be ours to enjoy in fiscal 2015—then Metaplanet is ahead of the curve, gaining traction with both institutional and retail investors. Metaplanet’s Long-Term Vision for Bitcoin Holdings Metaplanet’s strategy for Bitcoin goes far beyond the 2,100 BTC it holds at present. The company has made its intentions indisputably clear: It plans to increase its BTC holdings significantly—and rapidly—over the next two years. Metaplanet has set sights on 10,000 BTC by late 2025 and a staggering 21,000 BTC by 2026. If realized, these lofty BTC targets will vault the venture outfit to a position among the largest Bitcoin holders in the world and, more importantly, among publicly traded entities. This vision is not just about amassing Bitcoin for growth. Metaplanet’s management sees Bitcoin as a key to long-term financial stability—something that no one can take for granted today, when the world is riddled with economic uncertainty, inflation, and geopolitical strife. By increasing its Bitcoin treasury, the company is not only betting on the future of “digital money,” as it calls Bitcoin, but also positioning itself as something of a lighthouse in the still murky waters of the cryptocurrency investment landscape. With Bitcoin gaining acceptance among the large companies of the world, the investment landscape is in for a shift. When those firms recognize and accumulate Bitcoin, they invariably help establish it as an asset class. Metaplanet’s strategy of voraciously accumulating Bitcoin is setting an exciting precedent. By using the cover of a diversified financial portfolio, this company is signaling to would-be followers that “embracing digital currencies” doesn’t have to be a line-in-the-sand kind of declaration. Conclusion: Metaplanet’s Bold Strategy Sets the Stage for Future Growth The Bitcoin investment strategy of Metaplanet has turned out well so far, with the firm’s stock price moving sharply upward, thanks to its maturing Bitcoin investment. Accumulating Bitcoin is Metaplanet’s focus, with plans to increase holdings to 10,000 BTC by 2025 and 21,000 BTC by 2026. The firm should be considered a major player in the cryptocurrency space. Using Bitcoin as a hedge against market volatility, Metaplanet is not just seizing the potential of digital currency but also leading the way for other public companies to do the same. Metaplanet has a long-term vision and a bold, clear, and almost reckless (in a good way) approach to an investment strategy focused on digital assets.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For ‘Take Off’—Analyst Reveals Key Signals Bitcoin’s Open Interest Points to Possible Market Shift One notable development is the increase in Bitcoin’s open interest—an indicator of the total number of outstanding perpetual futures contracts on centralized exchanges. According to ShayanBTC, a CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform contributor, Bitcoin’s open interest has been steadily rising despite recent market volatility. Shayan pointed out that this growth signals heightened activity within perpetual markets, which could lead to a decisive breakout in Bitcoin’s price. However, the direction of this move remains unclear as additional data is needed for a more precise forecast. Shayan noted: This increase suggests that more activity is flowing into the perpetual markets, and the dominant direction of these positions will ultimately determine Bitcoin’s next significant move. If this trend persists, the market will likely experience a major breakout in the mid-term. However, the direction of this move remains uncertain, as additional data is required to make an accurate prediction. Deep Learning Projections Offer Mixed Signals In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant’s analyst CryptoOnChain presented a data-driven projection of Bitcoin’s near-term price movements. By employing on-chain metrics and a deep learning model known as the Wave Net algorithm, CryptoOnChain estimated that Bitcoin’s price may fluctuate between $93,000 and $110,000 over the coming month. The chart below shows the prediction of Bitcoin’s price for the upcoming month using on-chain data and deep learning with the Wave Net algorithm. As observed, this prediction indicates a fluctuating pattern for the next month. #Bitcoin #BTC #CryptoTrading pic.twitter.com/4Ki8TYE8Ui — CryptoOnchain (@CryptoOnchain) February 19, 2025 Meanwhile, Bitcoin is still trading below $100,000 with a current trading price of $97,136, at the time of writing. While this market price has managed to put BTC’s daily performance in green, on a broader scale, BTC is still somewhat bearish. Over the past month, the asset has declined by 6.1% and its current trading price marks a 10.6% decrease away from its all-time high above $109,000 recorded last month.

These are usually high-value wallets held by investors like institutions, whale traders, or early adopters. They often give us signals about market trends or about which projects have potential. In this latest wave of activity, they’ve been focused on a pretty diverse mix of narratives—from AI tech to wrapped assets to meme-inspired tokens. Key Areas of Smart Money Interest The smart wallets that accumulate these tokens do so with purpose and intent. They know what to buy, and they know what not to buy. That tells us that some or all of these three investment areas are likely to blow up, go parabolic, or at least be very good to those who invested in them. As for what exactly these smart wallets are buying, we can summarize things like this: Tokens related to AI and AI agents are getting bought up. Wrapped Bitcoin-related assets are getting bought up. And whatever’s unique or meme-based is getting bought up, too. AI and Blockchain: The Rise of $CLANKER and $HIBER One of the most striking accumulations has been in tokens driven by AI. Two projects, in particular, have stood out in the smart money wallet data: $CLANKER (TokenBot) and $HIBER (Hibernates). Both projects are making a big splash by combining AI with blockchain technology, and at this point, it’s worth considering what makes $CLANKER and $HIBER (and their respective teams) so interesting. In recent days, the attraction of the $CLANKER token, which uses both AI and blockchain, has reached new heights. Its appeal partly stems from the fact that it was recently listed on Coinbase, one of the major crypto exchanges. This sort of event tends to attract institutional investors, and indeed, we have seen some “smart money” wallets accumulating $CLANKER. Twelve of these wallets have a total of about $121,000 worth of tokens. At present, the $CLANKER market cap is around $63 million, and with the establishment of an ecosystem that is integrating AI bots, the project appears well positioned to be a cutting-edge contender for emerging in the space where AI and DeFi intersect. At the same time, $HIBER is advancing as the first robotics AI on the blockchain, backed by a promising team that boasts expertise from tech behemoths like Google and Amazon. This project has piqued the interest of four savvy crypto investors, who have collectively invested $47,000 and have acquired tokens in $HIBER. With a market cap of just $4 million, $HIBER is a low-cap opportunity for crypto investors to gain exposure to the potential of basing projects on the nascent blockchain. The team behind $HIBER, with its significant and relevant experience, adds a level of credibility to the project that makes it a prime candidate in AI investing for the Little Guy. Wrapped Assets: $WTRX Continues to Gain Momentum Investment in wrapped assets remains robust, and the use of AI-driven tokens is starting to be reflected in the investment community. Wrapped tokens are usually pegged to assets on other blockchains and allow these assets to be used in DeFi (decentralized finance) applications. One pegged to TRON (the native token of the blockchain of the same name), $WTRX (wrapped TRX), has been accumulating steady support from smart money wallets. The last 24 hours have seen two wallets invest a total of $70,000 into $WTRX, pushing the current market cap of the token to around $405 million. Part of what makes $WTRX interesting is the token’s recent explosion in transaction volume on platforms like SunSwap. This could indicate that decentralized trading of TRX is becoming more common, and this trend could really play into the hands of $WTRX as a DeFi token. Furthermore, with cross-chain liquidity becoming a bigger issue, $WTRX could really be poised for a breakout as a “smart money” token. Smart money wallets accumulations in the last 24 hours Main specific narratives accumulated: AI and AI Agents (21 wallets) Wrapped BTC and related (5 wallets) MEME and unique narratives (8 wallets) Top accumulations and reasoning: $CLANKER (tokenbot) ->… pic.twitter.com/MsBUG2Ikkh — CoinSense.app (@CoinSense_App) February 20, 2025 Meme Coins: From Fart Girl to Broccoli Even though the market has been dominated by more traditional tech and finance-driven projects, the meme coin phenomenon remains alive and well. Community-driven tokens often tied to inside jokes or internet memes are still attracting a lot of public attention. One good example of this is $FARTGIRL, part of the increasingly popular “Fart meme series.” This token is starting to make a name for itself, thanks to some dedicated community events and a good amount of online hype. One savvy wallet, however, has now picked up to the tune of $43,000 worth of $FARTGIRL. Considering the token’s market cap is $7 million, this is probably a suspect buying event. Still, considering how irrationally these things trade on hype, who knows? A project drawing inspiration from memes that is currently getting attention is $Broccoli, a coin inspired by CZ’s (Binance CEO) dog. $Broccoli has already bagged multiple exchange listings and has developed a solid community following. Two smart wallets have picked up a combined $32,000 worth of the token, which has a current market cap of $49 million. With a mostly unfounded community backing and meme potential, $Broccoli is a clear outlier in the meme coin klepto portfolio. Conclusion Current allocations by smart money into crypto wallets suggest an increasing variety of the kinds of projects that grab their attention. We see this in the clear concentration of interest on the part of such sophisticated investors in artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies. Projects like $CLANKER and $HIBER seem to them to promise both innovation and market growth. Meanwhile, wrapped assets—especially $WTRX—enjoy what can only be described as a DeFi-fueled upswing. This dramatic rise offers a platform on which to build cross-chain applications. Finally, we are a long way from the days in which serious crypto folks only half-jokingly considered Bitcoin “the next internet.” Meme coins may seem a bit strange. But in both $FARTGIRL’s and $Broccoli’s cases, we see a strong community and real potential behind what can only be described as unusual projects.

In a new interview with CNBC, Back says that Bitcoin’s buying demand remains high across various investing segments, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and that the bull market is far from over. “I think we’re certainly in the early stages of the bull market at this point. You know, typically the bull market cycle lasts for a certain period after the halving, and so we’re still in the early innings. I think there are very stiff inflows from ETFs buying about two times the Bitcoin mined per day, MicroStrategy and the other Bitcoin treasury companies buying another two times, and the retail buyers and dollar-cost-average investors. So really, that’s a lot of inflow.” Back predicts Bitcoin will soon start printing a series of rallies and may see an explosive breakout if governments start adopting Bitcoin strategic reserves. “I think temporarily there’s some consolidation, because some earlier investors, sort of mid-term investors’ profit taking. But that overlay would set us up for a price where you start to see Bitcoin competing with gold, perhaps pulling money out of gold ETFs, into Bitcoin, ETFs. And then, of course, if the treasuries come in, like the sovereign treasuries, the Bitcoin reserves, that would be something where you’d see sovereign competition, as soon as one of the bigger countries jumps in, I think the others will feel forced to follow suit, so all bets will be off if that happens… I think there’s a lot more capital in the institutional space of pension funds and mutual funds. So there’s a lot of room for capital to come in in this cycle.” Bitcoin is trading for $98,247 at time of writing, up 1.4% in the last 24 hours. ?

A huge $13.50 billion has come out of the market, and it certainly has the appearance of an “outlaw” (indeed, a significant loosening of the reins seems to have sparked at least partially this past week’s exodus from the banking sector). It makes us wonder whether a middle-ground/compromise scenario with sufficient regulatory clarity (especially on U.S. soil) can actually come to pass, and if it does, whether it will do so soon enough to avoid the appearance of a withering Bitcoin ecosystem. $BTC open interest is on the rise, showing increased activity in perpetual futures markets. Despite price fluctuations, this trend suggests a major breakout could be on the horizon. The big question—will bullish momentum take over, or are bears about to step in? More data is… pic.twitter.com/bZ7bqcxm6S — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) February 20, 2025 Bitcoin’s Price Action and Key Technical Indicators Bitcoin’s price has reached a critical moment after a recent rebound. The $BTC market has been pulling back as of late, with the TD Sequential indicator flashing a sell signal on the 4-hour chart. This suggests that Bitcoin might be setting up for a short-term retracement, with the recent upward momentum possibly coming to an end. The TD Sequential, a popular technical analysis tool, is often used to predict when price trends are running out of gas and might be reversing. This signal adds to the general uncertainty in the market, with traders questioning whether the recent surge was just a brief rally before further consolidation or the head fake it seems to be at times. #Bitcoin $BTC may be setting up for a pullback, as the TD Sequential indicator flashes a sell signal on the 4-hour chart following the recent rebound! pic.twitter.com/HCCDb4uFNh — Ali (@ali_charts) February 20, 2025 Even so, the resistance level most vital for monitoring Bitcoin is still at $97,533. This price point is seen as the threshold that will determine at least for the time being whether Bitcoin has the necessary push to move higher or whether it is going to have to work very hard just to maintain the upward trajectory that could be called bullish. Something that could happen and that many analysts would like to see happen would be a sustained breakout above this critical resistance level, an event that might just propel Bitcoin towards its next leg of bullish price action. The most critical resistance level for #Bitcoin $BTC is currently at $97,533! A sustained breakout above this level could signal further upside. pic.twitter.com/Fh8qIUtvZJ — Ali (@ali_charts) February 20, 2025 Rising Open Interest: A Sign of Increased Market Activity Amid these price fluctuations, one remarkable phenomenon is the growing open interest in Bitcoin’s perpetual futures markets. Open interest means the outstanding derivative contracts that have not yet been settled—our compound future capital price indicator. Open interest growth signals an increase in market activity and liquidity, and we take it as saying capital is coming into the Bitcoin futures markets. Moreover, we infer from the rising open interest that traders are taking larger positions and are expecting a big price move sometime soon. The increase in open interest combined with price fluctuations indicates that a significant breakout or breakdown is coming. Traders are positioning themselves for volatility, and Bitcoin’s approaching critical technical levels is likely to increase the swings the market will take. There are two other factors to consider. The increasing activity in the futures market seems to point toward not just more volatility but more substantial price moves in either direction—more price discovery as they say—which also tends to be an ingredient in the short-term recipe for big upward or downward price moves that they serve to traders. Capital Outflows: Bearish Sentiment Creeps In A recent development that should concern Bitcoin investors is the outflow of capital from Bitcoin-related financial products. Recently, the products saw a net outflow of $71.07 million. This number is concerning because it emphasizes a recent development: We seem to have gone from a period of relatively stable inflows of institutional capital into the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets to a period of relatively stable outflows. This stable outflow period emphasizes two key concerns that I have about the current state of Bitcoin’s price, which I will cover in the next two sections. On February 19, the total net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was 71.0709 million US dollars. The total net inflow of Ethereum spot ETF was 19.0192 million US dollars, and the net inflow continued for 4 days. https://t.co/Tvs2oCS03I — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 20, 2025 The broader cryptocurrency market has seen an exit of $13.50 billion in capital over the past week, and this is further highlighting the sentiment shift. As this market sees an exit of capital and a slowdown in new inflows, it gives the appearance of a Bitcoin cooling-off period. Without substantial buying pressure, which seems less likely with a slowdown in capital inflows, Bitcoin is now positioned against something even worse than a return to the resilience of the 786 Fib level: stagnation. $13.50 billion has left the cryptocurrency market in the past week, signaling a decline in capital inflows. pic.twitter.com/oZSzuSKEOo — Ali (@ali_charts) February 20, 2025 The Big Question: Bulls or Bears? While Bitcoin receives these contradicting signals, the fundamental question every trader seems to be asking is whether Bitcoin is still on a bullish trajectory or if the bears are about to take over. What happens next really seems to hinge on how Bitcoin deals with the $97,533 resistance level. A clear move to the upside past this threshold could very well reignite the bullish narrative and have traders looking for new highs in the very near future. A failure to do the same could have the opposite effect and really could have the market looking for a deeper pullback in the Bitcoin price. Open interest is up. Even with Bitcoin down around 2% today, traders are holding out hope, and many of them are still in it for a significant price move—either up or down. And the way open interest is rising, you could even say the market seems primed for a volatility explosion—suggesting some traders might want to be on alert for BTC breakouts or breakdowns in the coming days. Of course, as Bitcoin moves, potential inflow and outflow from the BTC ETFs could also cause volatility, unless they just change the direction in which inflow or outflow is going. Conclusion At this pivotal moment, many key elements exert an influence on the future price of Bitcoin. A hefty $13.50 billion has exited the cryptocurrency market, and the open interest in Bitcoin futures has been rising, which is a setup that often leads to turbulence. Yet, with these outflows and the open interest leading to turbulence, Bitcoin’s nominal price is not leading to a crisis atmosphere, with the digital currency still holding above the support at $30,000. Because it is also hovering beneath the necessary breakout point of $37,000, market participants are eying any developments in the turbulence between bulls and bears.

40632718,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132583,1740125237,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Rearrest: South Korean Crypto Figure ‘HODL Kim’ Faces New $47M Fraud Charges,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/south-korean-crypto-fraud-arrest/,"Just when you thought the crypto world couldn’t get any more dramatic, another scandal erupts from South Korea. “Jonbur Kim,” or “HODL Kim” as he’s known in English crypto circles – real name Park – is back in the headlines, and not for good reasons. After being released on bail for a previous $14 million crypto scam, Park has been rearrested on fresh charges involving a staggering $47 million. Let’s dive into this developing story and understand the depths of this alleged crypto fraud . Why is ‘HODL Kim’ Back in Custody for Crypto Fraud? Park’s alias, “Jonbur Kim,” ironically translates to “HODL Kim,” a term synonymous with holding onto cryptocurrency investments for the long term, regardless of market volatility. This moniker now seems dripping with sarcasm given the current accusations. According to an exclusive report by KBS News, the Seoul Southern District Court issued a new arrest warrant on February 20th. The court cited serious concerns that Park might attempt to tamper with evidence or even flee the country. These are not light accusations, highlighting the gravity of the situation and the court’s apprehension about potential obstruction of justice in this crypto fraud case. Adding to the intrigue, an accomplice known only as Mr. Moon was also apprehended under similar warrants. This suggests a potentially wider network involved in the alleged fraudulent activities, indicating a more complex scheme than initially perceived. The Artube (ATT) Scam: Unpacking the $47 Million Crypto Fraud The latest charges revolve around a cryptocurrency named Artube (ATT). Prosecutors allege that between March 2021 and April 2022, Park and Moon orchestrated a sophisticated scheme to defraud investors. Here’s a breakdown of the alleged crypto fraud : False Disclosures: Park and Moon are accused of misleading investors with inaccurate or fabricated information about the Artube (ATT) project. This could involve exaggerating the technology, partnerships, or potential of ATT to create artificial hype and demand. Price Manipulation: Prosecutors claim the duo actively manipulated the price of ATT. This could involve wash trading (buying and selling the same asset to create artificial volume) or pump-and-dump tactics, designed to lure unsuspecting investors into buying at inflated prices before the perpetrators cash out. Massive Investor Losses: The alleged scheme resulted in a colossal 68 billion won loss for investors, equivalent to approximately $47 million USD. This significant sum underscores the devastating impact of crypto fraud on individuals and the wider market. The sheer scale of the alleged fraud – $47 million – is alarming and places this case among the more significant instances of South Korean crypto scams. It raises serious questions about investor protection and the regulatory landscape within the burgeoning cryptocurrency market in South Korea. What Does This Mean for the South Korean Crypto Market? This rearrest and the associated $47 million Artube scam have several significant implications for the South Korean crypto market and beyond: Erosion of Trust: High-profile cases like this further erode trust in the cryptocurrency market, particularly among retail investors. When individuals see headlines about massive fraud and scams, it can create a climate of fear and discourage participation in legitimate crypto projects. Increased Regulatory Scrutiny: Such incidents often prompt regulators to intensify their scrutiny of the crypto industry. We can expect increased pressure on South Korean crypto exchanges and project developers to implement stricter compliance measures and enhance investor protection mechanisms. Demand for Stronger Investor Protection: Investors who have suffered losses in this and similar scams will likely demand stronger legal frameworks and enforcement to protect their interests. This could lead to new regulations, stricter penalties for crypto fraud, and easier pathways for victims to seek redress. Impact on Crypto Adoption: While South Korea is known for its high crypto adoption rates, repeated instances of crypto fraud could potentially dampen enthusiasm and slow down further mainstream adoption. People may become more hesitant to invest in digital assets if they perceive the market as rife with scams and lacking sufficient safeguards. Navigating the Risky Waters of Cryptocurrency Investments The “HODL Kim” saga serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in cryptocurrency investments. While the potential for high returns is alluring, the market is also susceptible to scams, fraud, and manipulation. Here are some actionable insights for navigating these risky waters: Actionable Insight Description Due Diligence is Key Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency project before investing. Understand the team, technology, whitepaper, and community. Be wary of projects with vague information or overly hyped promises. Diversify Your Portfolio Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Spread your investments across different cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Be Skeptical of Guarantees No investment, especially in crypto, comes with guaranteed returns. Be highly suspicious of projects promising unrealistic profits or risk-free investments. Use Reputable Exchanges Trade cryptocurrencies only on well-established and regulated exchanges. Avoid lesser-known or unregulated platforms, which may be more prone to scams. Stay Informed Keep up-to-date with the latest news and developments in the crypto market. Regulatory changes, security breaches, and emerging scam trends can impact your investments. Seek Professional Advice If you are unsure about cryptocurrency investments, consult with a qualified financial advisor who understands the crypto market. The Unfolding Drama of South Korean Crypto The rearrest of “HODL Kim” adds another layer of complexity to the already turbulent South Korean crypto landscape. It highlights the ongoing challenges of regulation, investor protection, and the fight against financial crime within the digital asset space. As investigations continue and legal proceedings unfold, the crypto community will be watching closely for further developments in this shocking case of alleged cryptocurrency arrest and crypto fraud . This incident serves as a crucial lesson for both seasoned and novice crypto investors: vigilance, skepticism, and thorough research are paramount in navigating the exciting yet risky world of cryptocurrencies. The promise of innovation and financial freedom comes with the responsibility of informed decision-making and a healthy dose of caution.

The air is buzzing with anticipation as a prominent voice in the crypto analytics sphere, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, boldly declares, “alt season has begun.” For those in the know, this isn’t just another day in the digital currency world; it’s a potential gold rush for altcoins, those digital assets beyond Bitcoin. But this time, the narrative is shifting. Forget the traditional Bitcoin dominance story – a new catalyst is taking center stage. Let’s dive deep into what’s fueling this potential altcoin surge and what it means for you. What Exactly is Alt Season and Why Should You Care? For the uninitiated, “alt season” refers to a period in the cryptocurrency market where altcoins—any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin—experience significant price appreciation, often outperforming Bitcoin itself. It’s a time of heightened excitement and potential for substantial gains, but also increased volatility and risk. Why should you care? Because alt season can present unique opportunities to diversify your crypto portfolio and potentially see exponential growth in your investments. It’s the time when projects beyond the established giants can shine, offering fresh narratives, innovative technologies, and potentially higher percentage gains. But navigating this terrain requires knowledge and caution. CryptoQuant CEO’s Bold Declaration: Is Alt Season Truly Here? Ki Young Ju, the CEO of CryptoQuant, a well-respected on-chain data analytics platform, recently ignited the crypto community with a simple yet powerful statement on X (formerly Twitter): “alt season has begun.” This isn’t just market speculation; it’s an observation based on data-driven insights. CryptoQuant is renowned for its analysis of blockchain data, providing traders and investors with valuable metrics to understand market trends. Ju’s statement carries weight because it’s grounded in observable shifts within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. But what exactly is he seeing? [img]Image of diverse altcoins surging upwards with Bitcoin in the background fading[/img] Stablecoin Demand: The Unsung Hero of This Altcoin Surge The traditional playbook of alt season often involves Bitcoin’s price consolidating or slightly declining, leading investors to rotate profits into altcoins. However, Ju points out a fascinating twist this time: “Instead of a direct Bitcoin (BTC)-to-altcoin rotation, stablecoin holders are driving altcoin demand .” This is a crucial distinction. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, are typically seen as safe havens in the volatile crypto market. Their increasing deployment into altcoins suggests a fresh influx of capital, separate from Bitcoin’s price action. Think of it like this: Traditional Alt Season (BTC-driven): Bitcoin price plateaus → Profits from BTC are moved to altcoins → Altcoin prices rise. New Alt Season (Stablecoin-driven): Stablecoin holders see opportunity in altcoins → Stablecoins are used to purchase altcoins → Altcoin prices rise, independently of immediate BTC price movement. This stablecoin-fueled demand could indicate a broader market confidence and a willingness to explore opportunities beyond Bitcoin, even amidst market uncertainties. Trading Volume Speaks Volumes: Why Bitcoin Dominance Isn’t the Only Metric For years, Bitcoin dominance – the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total cryptocurrency market cap – has been a key indicator of market trends. A declining Bitcoin dominance often signaled the rise of altcoins. However, Ki Young Ju highlights a different metric this time: bitcoin trading volume compared to altcoin trading volume. He notes that “Altcoin trading volume is now 2.7 times that of BTC.” This is a powerful signal. It means that currently, more trading activity is happening in altcoins than in Bitcoin. This shift in trading volume suggests a genuine increase in interest and capital flow into the altcoin market, regardless of Bitcoin’s dominance percentage. Let’s break down why this trading volume metric is so significant: Metric Traditional Indicator Current Indicator (Ju’s View) Significance for Alt Season Bitcoin Dominance Decreasing BTC dominance suggests alt season. Less relevant in the current scenario. Historically important, but potentially less telling now. Trading Volume Ratio (Altcoins vs. BTC) Traditionally lower altcoin volume compared to BTC. Altcoin volume significantly higher (2.7x BTC). Strong indicator of current altcoin market interest and capital influx. This table clearly illustrates the shift in perspective. While Bitcoin dominance remains a metric to watch, the surge in bitcoin trading volume ratio is painting a potentially more accurate picture of the current altcoin market dynamics. Navigating the Altcoin Market: Opportunities and Essential Research The declaration of an alt season, especially one driven by novel factors like stablecoin demand and trading volume, presents exciting opportunities. However, Ki Young Ju wisely emphasizes the crucial need for caution and due diligence: “Ju emphasized the need for thorough research, as the market remains highly selective.” This isn’t a blanket bull run where every altcoin will skyrocket. The market is likely to be discerning, rewarding projects with strong fundamentals, active development, genuine utility, and vibrant communities. Here are some actionable insights to navigate this potential alt season: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): This cannot be stressed enough. Don’t blindly follow hype or social media trends. Thoroughly research any altcoin you consider investing in. Understand its technology, use case, team, tokenomics, and community. Focus on Fundamentals: Look for projects with solid foundations. Are they solving a real-world problem? Do they have a working product or a clear roadmap? Is their technology innovative and sustainable? Assess Trading Volume and Liquidity: While high altcoin trading volume is a positive sign overall, examine the volume of individual altcoins. Higher liquidity generally means easier entry and exit points. Manage Risk: Altcoins are inherently more volatile than Bitcoin. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio across different types of altcoins and allocate a smaller portion to higher-risk, higher-reward plays. Stay Informed: The crypto market moves rapidly. Keep up-to-date with news, market analysis, and project developments. Follow reputable sources and be wary of misinformation. The Dawn of a New Altcoin Era? Ki Young Ju’s statement, backed by CryptoQuant’s data, suggests that we might be witnessing a significant shift in the altcoin market. The traditional reliance on Bitcoin dominance as the sole indicator might be evolving, with stablecoin inflows and trading volume emerging as crucial metrics. This potential alt season , fueled by distinct dynamics, could offer unique opportunities for those who are prepared, informed, and diligent. However, remember that the crypto market is inherently unpredictable. While the signs are promising, thorough research and prudent risk management are paramount. The era of altcoins could be upon us, but navigating it successfully requires a sharp mind and a cautious approach.

40632850,https://nulltx.com/?p=145465,1740125463,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Ethereum Shows Strength Amid Rising New Addresses and Capital Inflows: Key Levels to Watch,https://nulltx.com/ethereum-shows-strength-amid-rising-new-addresses-and-capital-inflows-key-levels-to-watch/,"Ethereum ($ETH), with the second-largest crypto market cap, shows that strength and growth are still possible in today’s crypto landscape. Ethereum’s network is showing some very positive metrics lately, not the least of which is the dramatic surge in new address creation—a figure often viewed as a proxy for network growth and a signal of the unmistakable increased adoption of Ethereum by the crypto community. These new addresses indicate a surge of renewed interest in Ethereum, and the overall activity on the Ethereum blockchain is unmistakably picking up. The number of new addresses on the #Ethereum $ETH network continues to climb, making a series of higher highs with a 12.10% increase over the past week. pic.twitter.com/oooCtLmeVN — Ali (@ali_charts) February 20, 2025 Key Technical Developments and Market Sentiment A clear indication of Ethereum’s long-term platform health and adoption is its increasing new address count, which is a direct result of more users joining the network. In essence, Ethereum seems to be enjoying something of a surge. Investors, developers, and users show growing confidence in Ethereum’s blockchain, as it continues to robustly serve decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and other innovative projects. Overall, this is a very decentralized, very diverse, and very real surge in network activity—one that bodes very well for Ethereum’s continuing relevance in the fast-evolving blockchain tech landscape. Even though the number of new addresses is rising, the short-term price action of Ethereum is causing some concern. Right now, the cryptocurrency looks like it’s trying to hold up and not completely fall apart, but its price is consolidating at what appears to be very close to critical support levels. Analysts are now trying to figure out exactly what the next move for Ethereum is going to be. The best-case scenario for the asset would involve it continuing to hold up within a price range and just testing support levels before eventually heading back towards the higher prices that it was at not too long ago. Right now, the Ethereum price holds a strong support level at around $2,300. If the price were to drop to this level and hold for several days, this would likely signal an excellent buying opportunity for reasonably confident investors to get back into Ethereum before the potential price rally up to the key resistance level of around $4,000. And if the price were to break back out above this nearly $4,000 resistance point, that would likely indicate a continuation of the currently resumed bullish price action for Ethereum that started in late 2023 and has extended into early 2024. In the best-case scenario, #Ethereum $ETH is range-bound, meaning it could test $2,300 support before rebounding toward $4,000. However, in the worst-case scenario, this could be shaping up as a double-top pattern. pic.twitter.com/LKZJoXiucQ — Ali (@ali_charts) February 20, 2025 Nevertheless, a far more problematic situation looms for those who hold Ethereum, and that is the prospective emergence of a double top. A double top is a bearish formation that often leads to a protracted decline in price. Price action that would form a double top would first have to make another move up to test our recent high of approximately $2,000 before reversing. If Ethereum were to inch back toward $2,000 and then reverse, the downward price target for the double top would be roughly $1,400. Should that happen, it would wipe out all the gains Ethereum has made in 2023 so far. Positive Capital Flows and Market Sentiment Concerns about Ethereum’s price action notwithstanding, there is a trend worthy of notice taking place in the Ethereum spot ETF market. On February 19, Ethereum spot ETFs had a net inflow of $19.02 million, marking the fourth consecutive day of positive inflows. But this trend isn’t just a random occurrence. Capital is flowing into Ethereum ETFs for a worthy reason: Institutional investors are showing a pronounced interest in Ethereum, which adds to the liquid confidence we seem to have in Ethereum’s potential for future growth. And those institutional investor inflows are happening at a time when the broader cryptocurrency market is seeing capital outflows. On February 19, the total net outflow of Bitcoin spot ETF was 71.0709 million US dollars. The total net inflow of Ethereum spot ETF was 19.0192 million US dollars, and the net inflow continued for 4 days. https://t.co/Tvs2oCS03I — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) February 20, 2025 The ongoing influx of cash into Ethereum ETFs is yet another indicator of the astonishing growth of Ethereum. Not only have institutional investors begun to invest in Ethereum, but also they have displayed a remarkable confidence in it. Inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs have now continued for several days, and during that time, Ethereum’s price has remained quite stable and has held support around the $2,300 level. As inflows into Ethereum ETFs continue, the likelihood increases that Ethereum spot ETFs will also receive approval from regulators. What’s Next for Ethereum? In the Ethereum’s immediate future, it hinges on the ability to push up through key resistance levels and avoid forming a bearish double-top pattern. Pushing up through these resistance levels and avoiding price action that looks like a double top means a lot for Ethereum because it’s something that underpins one of the big bullish narratives that’s going on right now. Ethereum’s user base keeps growing. Inflows into Ethereum-related financial products have also been increasing, which has been almost a counter-narrative to everything else that’s going on in the crypto market. As Ethereum’s price presently encounters vital levels, the next few days might prove decisive in finding the near-term trend. Should it maintain support at $2,300 and move back up toward $4,000, the extremely bullish sentiment surrounding the token could gain even more momentum. Conversely, if the market cannot muster enough energy to surge past the $4,000 mark and instead fulfills the right side of a double-top formation, Ether might be looking at a longer-term period of underperformance and some kind of corrective downturn. To sum up, the Ethereum network is moving along some solid fundamentals, seeing an increase in new addresses and institutional support that has translated into inflows into the very pro-Ethereum ETFs. So what’s next? Well, in the next few weeks, Ethereum will have to shape up or it might risk heading the way of Bitcoin’s recent route and lose some of its confidence- and momentum-building cover. The next week or two contains some critical price levels that Ethereum must hold to remain in a watchable range instead of plunging down into the drab depths of a bear market.

The DeFi cryptocurrency recently witnessed a staggering $156 million token burn, which appears to have fueled a price upswing. As a result, market watchers are highly bullish on the token’s future outlook, although a recent smart whale trade maneuver sparked contrasting speculations. Maker (MKR) Price Bullish As Supply Takes Hit Amid Massive $156M Burn According to a series of X posts by the transaction tracker Whale Alert on Feb 20, a staggering $156.77 million MKR was burnt recently, which dealt a massive blow to the token’s circulating supply. As an upshot, Maker price soared 77%, per the weekly chart, abiding by the law of supply and demand. For context, token burn mechanisms focus on permanently reducing a crypto’s market supply, propelling a bullish impact on price. Meanwhile, the wallet address ‘0xf65’ was reported to be solely responsible for the massive burn, per Whale Alert data that revealed 8 colossal burn transactions on Feb 20. Market watchers weigh substantial optimism over the asset in light of the supply shredding drastically within such a brief period. TVL Boosts Market Standing Simultaneously, another vital factor appears to be driving the leading DeFi token ‘s recent growth. As per DeFiLlama data, the TVL on the Maker ecosystem stood at $5.55 billion on Friday. This data further cemented the protocol’s market standing, making it one of the top DeFi projects on the Ethereum blockchain. Source: DeFiLlama MKR Price Rally To Sustain? As mentioned above, MKR coin’s price has already defied the broader market turmoil, rallying 77% in a week and over 22% in a day. The coin currently rests at $1,445.25, with an intraday low and high of $1,177.44 and $1473.35, respectively. Traders also appear to be positive amid the massive burn, as the coin’s intraday trading volume soared 166% to $257.95 million. Smart Whale’s Trading Sparks Caution However, it’s worth mentioning that a smart whale has cashed out all its MKR holdings amid the recent rally. Although this mover underscored a profit-booking motive, market watchers exercise caution as the selloff also indicates a loss of confidence for the asset among experienced traders. According to SpotonChain data on Feb 21, the address 0x637 (“inveteratus.eth”) sold all his holdings (1,230 MKR) for 1.78 million USDC at an average price of $1,448. This trader boasts a 100% win rate with his previous tradings for the same DeFi token. In turn, the maneuver added a layer of intrigue to the price action ahead despite massive burn transactions spurring a rally.

Gaming Giants Eye Crypto Tokens, Reveals Immutable Co-founder",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gaming-giants-eye-crypto-tokens/,"Are you ready for the next level of gaming and cryptocurrency convergence? Imagine your favorite gaming universes powered by digital assets, offering unprecedented player ownership and engagement. Well, the future might be closer than you think! Exciting news is buzzing in the crypto sphere as Robbie Ferguson, the co-founder of Immutable, a prominent Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, dropped a bombshell on X (formerly Twitter). He revealed that numerous gaming behemoths, each boasting a market capitalization exceeding a staggering $1 billion, are seriously contemplating launching their own crypto tokens. This revelation signals a potential paradigm shift in the gaming industry, potentially intertwining it deeply with the world of blockchain and digital assets. Let’s dive into what this could mean for gamers, crypto enthusiasts, and the future of interactive entertainment. Why Are Gaming Giants Suddenly Interested in Gaming Tokens? The announcement by Robbie Ferguson has sent ripples of excitement and speculation throughout the crypto and gaming communities. But what’s driving this sudden surge of interest in gaming tokens from these industry titans? Several factors could be at play, pushing these companies towards exploring the realm of digital assets: Enhanced Player Engagement and Ownership: Crypto tokens can revolutionize player engagement by offering true ownership of in-game assets. Unlike traditional gaming models where virtual items are controlled by game developers, blockchain gaming tokens empower players to own, trade, and utilize their assets across different platforms, fostering a more invested and loyal player base. New Revenue Streams and Economic Models: Gaming tokens open up entirely new revenue streams for gaming companies beyond traditional game sales and in-app purchases. They can facilitate play-to-earn models, decentralized marketplaces, and innovative in-game economies, potentially unlocking billions in new value. Community Building and Decentralization: Issuing crypto gaming tokens can strengthen community bonds by giving players a stake in the game’s ecosystem. Tokens can be used for governance, allowing players to participate in decision-making processes and shape the game’s future, fostering a sense of ownership and shared purpose. Attracting the Web3 Audience: The growing web3 gaming community is actively seeking immersive and rewarding experiences powered by blockchain technology. By embracing crypto tokens, traditional gaming companies can tap into this burgeoning market and attract a new generation of gamers who value decentralization and digital ownership. Unlocking New Dimensions: The Benefits of Crypto Gaming Tokens The potential benefits of integrating crypto gaming tokens into billion-dollar gaming companies are vast and transformative. Let’s explore some key advantages: Revolutionizing In-Game Economies: Gaming tokens can power dynamic and player-driven in-game economies. Imagine a world where players can earn tokens by participating in quests, winning tournaments, or contributing to the game’s ecosystem, and then use these tokens to purchase items, customize their characters, or even cash them out. This creates a more engaging and rewarding gameplay loop. Cross-Game Interoperability: Blockchain gaming technology allows for the potential of interoperability between different games. Your hard-earned assets in one game could potentially be usable or tradable in another game within the same ecosystem or even across different gaming platforms, maximizing the value and utility of player assets. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Crypto gaming tokens leverage the security and transparency of blockchain technology. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, ensuring fairness and preventing fraud within the game’s economy. This transparency builds trust and confidence among players. Global Reach and Accessibility: Web3 gaming tokens can facilitate global reach and accessibility for gaming companies. Crypto transactions are borderless, allowing companies to tap into international markets and reach players who may not have access to traditional payment systems. Navigating the Challenges: Roadblocks in Blockchain Gaming Token Adoption While the prospect of major gaming companies embracing gaming tokens is incredibly exciting, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges and potential roadblocks that lie ahead: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies and digital assets is still evolving globally. Gaming companies need to navigate complex and often unclear regulations regarding token issuance, distribution, and trading. Compliance will be paramount for widespread adoption. User Adoption and Education: Educating mainstream gamers about the benefits and functionalities of crypto gaming tokens is crucial. Many traditional gamers may be unfamiliar with blockchain technology and digital wallets. User-friendly interfaces and clear communication will be essential for driving adoption. Scalability and Transaction Costs: For blockchain gaming to handle the massive scale of popular online games, scalability solutions are essential. High transaction fees and slow processing times on some blockchains could hinder the user experience. Layer-2 solutions like Immutable X are designed to address these scalability challenges. Market Volatility and Risk Management: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility. Gaming companies and players need to be aware of the potential risks associated with holding and trading web3 gaming tokens, including price fluctuations and market downturns. Robust risk management strategies will be necessary. Web3 Gaming Tokens: Shaping the Future of Interactive Entertainment? The potential entry of billion-dollar gaming companies into the web3 gaming space through token issuance could be a watershed moment for the industry. It suggests a growing recognition of the transformative power of blockchain technology to revolutionize gaming experiences. Token issuance could be a strategic move that positions these companies at the forefront of innovation, attracting a new generation of players and unlocking unprecedented economic opportunities. Imagine a future where: Players truly own their in-game creations and achievements, carrying them across different virtual worlds. Gaming communities are more empowered and actively participate in shaping the games they love. New economic models reward players for their time and skill, blurring the lines between gaming and earning. Gaming becomes more immersive, interactive, and interconnected than ever before, fueled by the power of blockchain. Token Issuance: A Strategic Move for Gaming Companies? For these gaming giants, considering token issuance is not just about jumping on a bandwagon; it’s likely a strategic move driven by a long-term vision. They are potentially recognizing that the future of gaming is increasingly intertwined with decentralization, digital ownership, and community-driven experiences. By exploring token issuance , these companies are not just creating new revenue streams; they are potentially building the foundation for the next generation of gaming ecosystems. Robbie Ferguson’s revelation is more than just industry gossip; it’s a signal flare illuminating the path towards a more decentralized, player-centric, and economically vibrant gaming future. As these billion-dollar companies delve deeper into the world of crypto gaming tokens, we can expect to witness groundbreaking innovations that redefine how we play, interact, and engage with virtual worlds. The game is changing, and it’s about to get a whole lot more interesting.

Expert analysis suggests that the $0.001 price point is achievable, provided utility grows, and investor interest increases enough to drive FLOKI up 8x its current market cap. Will Floki reach $0.01? FLOKI would need a $96 billion market cap to hit $0.01, over 80x its current value. Only the top six cryptos have surpassed this level, making it a major challenge without massive growth in adoption and demand. While possible, it’s unlikely in the short term. Does FLOKI have a good long-term future? According to expert analysis, FLOKI has a promising long-term future with consistent growth potential. The coin could reach up to $0.002 within the decade.

The correction in crypto markets in recent months has seen both bitcoin ( BTC ) and ether ( ETH ) futures near backwardation, which is a sign of lower demand, the report said. Backwardation occurs when the spot price of an asset is higher than the price trading in the futures market. ""This is a negative development and indicative of demand weakness by those institutional investors that use regulated CME futures contracts to gain exposure into these two cryptocurrencies,"" analysts led Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote. If demand for bitcoin and ether futures is healthy, the futures cost more than the spot price, and the curve is said to be in contango , the bank noted. When demand slows and price expectations soften, the futures curve moves towards backwardation, the bank added. This weakness in demand could be due to a number of reasons. Positive crypto initiatives by Trump's new administration are more likely to kick in during the second half of the year, the bank said, and this means institutional investors are likely taking profits due to a lack of short-term catalysts. Lower demand from systematic and momentum-driven funds, such as CTAs, has also affected bitcoin and ether futures, JPMorgan added.

They have often dominated the industry and continue to do so. Since the launch of Dogecoin in 2013 at the beginning of the industry, the meme coin race began. These assets are known for their high volatility and are considered speculative investments, but they are adored by the crypto community.

33767162,[object Object],1740129124,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"ECB Develops Blockchain Payment System for CBDC, BTC Bull Token Captures Retail Interest",https://bitcoinist.com/ecb-develops-blockchain-system-for-cbdc-btc-bull-token-surges/,"The difference between the US and EU approaches to crypto has become evident as the European Central Bank (ECB) is building a blockchain system to process CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency) transactions. ECB President Christine Lagarde also nixed the idea of a European Bitcoin reserve due to $BTC’s volatility and frequent use in illicit activities (which isn’t entirely true– criminals prefer cash to crypto ). In contrast, President Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell are strictly against CBDCs , and 20 US states have proposed establishing crypto reserves (cries in European). Let’s unpack what the EU’s anti-crypto stance means for the market. Inside the ECB’s CBDC Plan The launch of an EU-wide blockchain payment system is the first step toward rolling out a fully functioning wholesale CBDC, the digital euro. This system will be compatible with TARGET Services, a platform that currently handles large-value payments, securities settlement, and instant payments across Europe. After integrating the new system with TARGET, the ECB will focus on its interoperability with foreign CBDC infrastructures for exchange settlements. ECB Board member Piero Cipollone deems this innovation, but European crypto investors would likely call it an attempt at surveillance. ECB Is Against Crypto Reserves, Czech Republic Feels Rebellious The ECB also disapproved of the Czech National Bank’s plan to allocate 5% of its reserves to $BTC purchases. CNB Governor Aleš Michl argued he used to run an investment fund and ‘likes profitability,’ which suggests the Czech Republic might soon set a precedent for other EU countries. It’s clear that the EU prioritizes safety and stability over individual freedoms and technological development. However, this might change when multiple US states create crypto reserves, particularly if they prove this strategy to be fruitful. Non-eurozone countries like the Czech Republic would be the first to go against the tide, and others could follow suit. When this happens, $BTC will rally to new heights due to broader adoption and legitimacy. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) Celebrates Crypto’s Historic Rally With $BTC Airdrops While government officials remain cautious, retail investors can go for riskier opportunities like new meme coins on presale that might yield greater returns. But not all new crypt o have an equal chance in this bull run. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is the only meme coin closely linked to $BTC. It supports the OG crypto on its way to $250K with regular $BTC airdrops. All you need to get free $BTC is to buy $BTCBULL, hold it in Best Wallet , and wait for the world’s first crypto to hit $150K and $200K. When $BTC reaches $250K, the project will reward its loyal holders with a massive $BTCBULL token airdrop. $BTCBULL’s deflationary tokenomics model aims to support the token’s upward price action after launch. Whenever $BTC hits $125K, $175K, and $225K, the project will permanently remove a part of the tokens for circulation to create scarcity and drive demand. $BTCBULL’s presale kicked off on February 11 and has since raised $2.5M. One token now costs $0.002375, but the price is increasing fast as the project progresses toward new fundraising milestones. This means now is the time to take the bull by the horns and secure your share of $BTCBULL before everyone else does. Early adopters also benefit from a 172% APY, set to decrease as the staking pool expands. Final Remarks We aren’t just watching a battle of regulations–we’re watching two different philosophies play out in real time. While the US says, ‘let’s give crypto a shot,’ the EU is giving it a cold shoulder. This doesn’t mean that the ECB is entirely against innovation, though. Its blockchain-based payment system could also support crypto like $BTC and altcoins in the future if the US and Czech Republic lead by example. Institutional adoption will fuel this year’s $BTC rally, and $BTCBULL has positioned itself to capture investor appetite. However, remember the old-school Wall Street saying: bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered. Don’t get greedy–DYOR, diversify your portfolio, and only invest as much as you can afford to lose.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-02-21 09:12:04

Here's Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-exchange-bithumb-announced-that-it-has-delisted-these-two-altcoins-heres-why/,"Bithumb, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, announced the delisting of Valor (VALOR) and Bitcoin Gold (BTG) as part of its investor protection policies. Bithumb to Delist Valor (VALOR) and Bitcoin Gold (BTG) Tokens The exchange noted that both assets failed to meet listing maintenance standards, leading to the termination of support for trading and withdrawals. Bithumb stated that the documentation provided by the Valor Foundation was insufficient to address concerns regarding the utility and disclosures of the token. After conducting a comprehensive review, the Exchange has determined that VALOR no longer meets the criteria for continued trading support. Bitcoin Gold (BTG) has been delisted following a decision by the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA), a consortium of South Korean exchanges responsible for monitoring asset risks and investor protection. Bithumb announced that concerns regarding BTG’s sustainability and operational transparency led to its removal from the platform. Dates of Delist Transaction (Buy/Sell) Ends: March 24, 2025, 15:00 Withdrawal Support Ends: April 23, 2025, 15:00 Important Notes for Users All unfilled buy and sell orders will be automatically canceled after being removed from the list. API trading for both tokens will also be suspended. Users who wish to withdraw their tokens must register a whitelisted wallet address beforehand as the review process may take time. Holding delisted tokens beyond the withdrawal deadline may result in losses due to lack of technical support or potential price drops on other exchanges. Bithumb reminds users that investing in cryptocurrencies carries significant risks, including the possible loss of all or part of capital. *This is not investment advice.

The project, which promised to build decentralized computing, was financed with 820,000 ETH. Golem, one of the best-funded crypto projects, moved Ethereum (ETH) again in several transactions to Binance and Coinbase. The Golem project, which promised to build decentralized computation tools, made its biggest earnings from simply gaining ETH upfront and using a part of it for staking. The Golem wallets became active in the past month, coinciding with the slide of ETH under $3,000. The ICO started moving funds earlier, though the latest transactions have the biggest potential to put pressure on ETH. The problem of old ICOs with big treasuries and dormant reserves of ETH is one of the big issues for the token’s price. Some wallets from the original ETH ICO now contain more tokens even compared to the Ethereum Foundation. The Golem ICO moved funds for the first time in five months. Previously, the Golem multisig wallet funded a series of new addresses, which are now the origin of transactions to exchanges. In the past week, Golem shifted 7,250 ETH to intermediary addresses, of which 4,850 were sent to the markets. Over the years, Golem has spent some of the ETH but retained over 98,000 ETH as a stake in the Beacon Chain contract. The recent amount of ETH moved to exchanges matches the potential reward from staking. Golem would earn up to 3,872 ETH a year, and the recent ETH sale is consistent with staking since the summer of 2023. Previously, Golem Network has explained that a part of the ETH shifts is for intended staking tests . The proceeds of staking may be used for ecosystem development, as well as marketing and project visibility. Despite this, Golem has been inactive on social media since the end of 2024. The recent shift in funds is relatively small compared to Golem’s activity during the late 2024 bull market. During a market peak, Golem moved 24,400 ETH , with another 36,000 ETH shifted to exchanges in December. Previously, Golem claimed some of the ETH may be sent to Binance or Coinbase to test other forms of delegated staking. Golem ecosystem funds other projects Similar to other large-scale ICOs like Animoca Brands, Golem has spread its influence by funding other projects. While the ICO has sold some of its ETH, it also managed to retain it for the long term, while similar projects have sold all ICO proceeds. Golem has set aside 40,000 ETH for innovation scholarships and supporting other projects. The potential of Golem is to create multiple new startups, as recent ICOs raise much smaller amounts of ETH. The platform has not turned into a formal fund and has no known backers since crypto VC funding was barely developed in 2016. Golem retains around 10K ETH in its multisig wallet and has not posted any proof of reserves or a plan for spending the funds. The team has claimed it did not intend to liquidate the entire ETH treasury, though the project ended up sitting on significant liquidity after a series of sales in 2024. The GLM native token for Golem is still tradable, though forgotten in comparison to hotter new memes. GLM traded at $0.31 after a recent recovery. Short-term traders view GLM as a potential source of easy 2X gains due to the available liquidity and listings on top exchanges. The token is valued at only $313M, easily surpassed by newer assets. GLM is also fully launched and diluted, leading to speculative trading with regular spikes and drawdowns. GLM peaked above $0.72 during the altcoin market rally in March 2024. GLM is in the DePIN category of tokens, though it has not announced any links to AI or the recent agent trend. GLM ranks in the top 20 of the DePIN category, lagging behind the hottest tokens like RNDR and TAO. Golem has built a general-purpose network for shared computational resources, with just under 20K holders of the GLM token and ecosystem participants. So far, GLM has not explored the meme potential of its asset or tried to ride any modern trends, which are mostly well-supplied by its ICO reserves.

The debate over whether quantum computers could threaten Bitcoin ( BTC ) is heating up once again, with River CEO Alexander Leishman arguing that Bitcoin is at greater risk than traditional banking systems. https://twitter.com/Leishman/status/1892685481357255036?s=20 In an X post on Feb. 21, Leishman explained that in case with Bitcoin, the security of funds depends entirely on the private key. Once a public key is exposed, a quantum computer could access the funds with ease. “There is no layer of protection here for any address with a revealed public key. It is, BY FAR, the most ROI+ attack to perform if you have access to a QC no question.” Alexander Leishman However, the banking system is more secure, Leishman agues. While a quantum computer could disrupt HTTPS encryption, which is used to secure online communication, attackers would still need to intercept traffic and hijack DNS before gaining access to bank systems.

Everything is very KYC’d with a lot of manual controls around large movements of funds. Good luck moving millions or billions without a human catching something.” Alexander Leishman While quantum computing poses a potential threat to Bitcoin, it’s not something to worry about in the near future. However, recent developments suggest that quantum computing may be closer than previously thought. On Feb. 19, Microsoft introduced a new quantum chip, claiming it demonstrates quantum computing is “years, not decades” away. The so-called Majorana 1 chip is designed to reduce quantum computing’s error-prone nature and is supported by a scientific paper slated for publication in Nature. While there’s still some doubt in the tech world about how soon quantum computing will have an impact, companies like Google and IBM are predicting large-scale quantum computers could be up and running by 2033.

Bitcoin RHODL Has Been Losing Momentum Recently In a new post on X, analyst Checkmate has discussed about the latest trend in the RHODL Ratio of Bitcoin. The “Realized HODL (RHODL) Ratio” is an on-chain metric that calculates the ratio between any two given RHODL wave bands. HODL wave bands keep track of the percentage of the total BTC supply that was last moved inside a given age range. The RHODL wave bands are a modified form of these, adding an additional weighting factor: the Realized Value. Related Reading: Ethereum Fees Back To Lowest Since August: Is This Bullish? Put simply, the Realized Value is the spot price at which a given token of the cryptocurrency was last transacted on the blockchain. That is, it’s the coin’s current cost basis. As the RHODL wave band multiplies this metric with the amount of supply present within a given band, it tells us about the sum of cost bases of coins in that band. When the value of the indicator goes up for any particular band, it means the amount of capital invested into coins falling in the age range is rising. In the context of the current topic, the RHODL Ratio of the 1 week and 1 to 2 years bands is of relevance. Below is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows the trend in this RHODL Ratio over the history of Bitcoin. As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin RHODL Ratio for these wave bands shot up to a high level during the rally beyond $100,000 that took place last year. Such a trend implies the 1 week wave band, which corresponds to the fresh capital coming into the sector, grew large relative to the veteran 1 year to 2 years band. From the chart, it’s apparent that an extreme rotation of capital into the 1 week wave band has historically coincided with bull run tops for the cryptocurrency’s price. Since last year’s peak, the metric has been on the way down, which suggests the new demand for the asset is now slowing down. This is also visible in the momentum oscillator for the indicator attached by the analyst on the bottom, which just dipped into a zone that has played the role of the transition region between bullish and bearish trends in the past. Related Reading: How Close Is Bitcoin To A Bear Market? This Historical Level May Contain Hints Considering the historical pattern, this development in the RHODL Ratio is certainly not the best for Bitcoin. It now remains to be seen whether the metric would continue its decline in the coming days, potentially signaling a transition away from a bull market, or if it will bounce back up. BTC Price Bitcoin made a retest of the $98,000 mark earlier today, but it appears the coin ended up finding rejection as its price is now down to $97,000.

Its price spiked to nearly $2 before collapsing to the current $0.63. Ripple (XRP) jumped to almost $2.75 following the approval of the first spot XRP ETF in Brazil, now trading around $2.66. Analysts, including Ali Martinez, predict a potential rebound. Bitcoin (BTC) climbed back above $98,000, improving market sentiment as the Fear and Greed Index re-entered the “Greed” zone. Fed official Raphael Bostic hints at possible 2025 rate cuts that could fuel a further price surge. The Long-Awaited Milestone Earlier this week, Pi Network finally launched its Open Network. The development saw the light of day nearly six years after the project’s birth and made the PI token publicly accessible by allowing exchanges to list it. Some of those that hopped on the bandwagon were Bitget, MEXC, and OKX. The asset’s price experienced huge volatility during its first day of trading, briefly climbing to almost $2 before crashing to the current $0.63 (per CoinGecko’s data). PI Price, Source: CoinGecko It is worth mentioning that Pi Network has been the subject of controversy numerous times, and some industry participants remain skeptical about it. Bybit’s CEO Ben Zhou , for instance, called it a scam and assured that his company will not embrace the token. “If the project is legitimate and straight up, then you should come forth and address these reports so everyone can understand, but instead you choose to make up shit and do these childish attacks with no ground,” he stated. XRP Predictions Ripple’s XRP was among the top-performing cryptocurrencies yesterday (February 20), with its price jumping to almost $2.75. The rally occurred shortly after Brazil’s securities regulator – the Comissão de Valores Mobiliários – approved the world’s first spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). In the past several hours, though, the asset lost some steam and is currently trading at approximately $2.66. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko However, many market observers remain optimistic that another pump could be on the horizon. The popular X user Ali Martinez assumed that XRP looks ready for a rebound “as the TD Sequential indicator flashes a buy signal on the hourly chart.” Prior to that, though, the analyst observed the same technical indicator to warn about a potential pullback for Ripple’s native token. BTC Crawls Into Green Territory Lastly, we will touch upon the primary cryptocurrency, which has witnessed an evident price increase in the past few days. Recall that Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below $94,000 on February 18, but it is currently well above $98,000. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko Its resurgence has seemingly affected investor sentiment, with the Fear and Greed Index entering the “Greed” zone again . Meanwhile, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said his “baseline expectation” is for two additional rate cuts later this year, but “the uncertainty around that is pretty significant.” Lowering the benchmark in the following months might give the crypto market a serious boost . After all, such a decision will make money-borrowing easier and could increase the interest in riskier assets such as BTC.

40635864,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132469,1740130804,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Sudden Exit: Clearview AI CEO Resigns Amidst Facial Recognition Backlash,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/clearview-ai-ceo-resigns-backlash/,"In a surprising turn of events in the ever-evolving world of AI and data privacy, Hoan Ton-That, the CEO of Clearview AI, has announced his resignation. This news, first broken by Forbes and confirmed by Bitcoin World, marks a significant shift for the controversial facial recognition startup that built its empire on a massive database of 30 billion scraped photos. Ton-That stated his departure is for “the next chapter” in his life, while assuring he will remain on the board. But what does this sudden exit mean for the future of Clearview AI, especially in the context of ongoing debates around facial recognition technology and data privacy ? Why Did the Clearview AI CEO Resign Now? While Ton-That remains tight-lipped about the specific reasons behind his resignation, the timing is certainly noteworthy. Clearview AI, under his leadership, has been a lightning rod for controversy since its inception. Here’s a quick recap of the challenges they’ve faced: Massive Data Scraping: Clearview AI built its powerful facial recognition database by scraping billions of photos from the internet without user consent. This practice immediately raised alarm bells regarding privacy and ethical considerations. GDPR Fines and Legal Battles: The company has been slapped with over $100 million in GDPR fines from European data protection agencies for violating data privacy regulations. Their uncooperative stance and refusal to pay these fines have only intensified scrutiny. Lawsuits and Counterclaims: Beyond GDPR, Clearview AI has faced legal challenges on multiple fronts, including a lawsuit from Charles Johnson alleging co-founder status, which was recently dropped, though counterclaims remain. Unprofitability and Contract Struggles: Despite claims of record growth and revenue in 2024, reports suggest Clearview AI remains unprofitable and has struggled to secure large federal contracts. Could the mounting pressure from these challenges have contributed to Ton-That’s decision to step down? The lack of transparency surrounding his resignation leaves room for speculation, but the backdrop of these issues is undeniable. New Leadership and a Trump Administration Focus Stepping into the CEO role are Hal Lambert and Richard Schwartz, now co-CEOs. Their background in Republican politics signals a potential strategic shift for Clearview AI, particularly with an eye on the upcoming Trump administration. Let’s break down what we know about these new leaders: Co-CEO Background Potential Implications Hal Lambert Early Clearview AI investor; Founder of Point Bridge Capital, known for the MAGA ETF May prioritize relationships with Republican administrations and focus on government contracts. MAGA ETF history suggests a politically aligned approach. Richard Schwartz Clearview AI Co-founder; Former senior advisor to Rudy Giuliani Deep political connections within Republican circles. Giuliani link could indicate a focus on law enforcement and national security applications of facial recognition . Their statement to Bitcoin World about capitalizing on “new opportunities” under the Trump administration is telling. It suggests a pivot towards leveraging political connections to secure government contracts, potentially in areas where facial recognition technology is favored, such as law enforcement and national security. The Ethical Tightrope of Facial Recognition and AI Ethics Clearview AI’s journey has been a stark illustration of the ethical dilemmas surrounding facial recognition technology. While proponents argue for its effectiveness in law enforcement and security, critics raise serious concerns about privacy violations and potential for misuse. Key ethical questions remain at the forefront: Consent and Data Collection: Is it ethical to build a massive facial recognition database by scraping photos without individuals’ consent? Where is the line between public data and personal privacy? Bias and Accuracy: Facial recognition systems have been shown to exhibit biases across different demographics. How can we ensure fairness and accuracy, especially in high-stakes applications like law enforcement? Surveillance and Civil Liberties: The widespread use of facial recognition raises concerns about mass surveillance and its impact on civil liberties. How do we prevent this technology from becoming a tool for unchecked government monitoring? Transparency and Accountability: Who should be accountable for the use and potential misuse of facial recognition technology? How can we ensure transparency in its deployment and prevent abuses? These are not just academic questions. They have real-world implications for individual rights and societal norms. As AI ethics continues to gain prominence, companies like Clearview AI are under increasing pressure to address these concerns. Data Privacy in the Age of AI: What’s Next for Clearview AI? Ton-That’s resignation and the new co-CEO leadership mark a potential turning point for Clearview AI. Will they pivot towards greater transparency and address the persistent data privacy concerns? Or will they double down on government contracts and navigate the regulatory landscape with their political connections? Here are a few possible scenarios: Increased Government Focus: With leaders connected to Republican politics, Clearview AI might aggressively pursue federal and state government contracts, potentially finding more favorable reception under a Trump administration. Continued Legal Battles: The GDPR fines and other legal challenges are unlikely to disappear overnight. Clearview AI will need to develop a strategy for navigating these ongoing legal battles, potentially involving negotiations or further defiance. Reputation Management: The company’s controversial image is a significant hurdle. New leadership might attempt to rebrand or improve public perception, possibly by emphasizing ethical considerations or highlighting successful use cases in law enforcement. Technological Advancements: Regardless of leadership changes, the underlying technology of facial recognition continues to evolve. Clearview AI may focus on refining its algorithms, expanding its database, or exploring new applications beyond law enforcement. The cryptocurrency and blockchain space, while seemingly distant from facial recognition , is deeply intertwined with discussions around data privacy , security, and ethical technology development. As the world becomes increasingly data-driven, the lessons learned from Clearview AI’s journey are relevant across industries. Conclusion: A New Chapter for Clearview AI and the Future of Facial Recognition Hoan Ton-That’s resignation signals a pivotal moment for Clearview AI. The company, now under new leadership with strong political ties, stands at a crossroads. Whether they can navigate the complex landscape of AI ethics , data privacy regulations, and public perception remains to be seen. The future of facial recognition technology itself hangs in the balance, with Clearview AI’s next moves likely to influence the broader conversation around its responsible and ethical deployment. The crypto community, keenly aware of privacy and decentralization, will be watching closely as this story unfolds.

The asset, often overshadowed by flashier rivals such as Bitcoin (BTC), is riding a wave of investor optimism, registering $9.6 billion in daily on-chain transaction volumes per data from Santiment. Litecoin Gains Momentum Amid ETF Speculation While Bitcoin and Ethereum often dominate crypto headlines, LTC has been quietly building momentum. According to Santiment, between February 2 and February 19, its market cap went up by 46%, fueled by increased network utility and institutional interest. Litecoin doesn’t typically get the social media hype of other top cap cryptocurrencies like XRP, Solana, Chainlink or Cardano. But on the back of some legitimate ETF rumors, it has quietly seen a big jump in value recently. From February 2 to February 19, 2025, Litecoin’s… pic.twitter.com/FSRpoKt2zd — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 20, 2025 The buzz isn’t just speculation. Recently, Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas suggested there was a 90% chance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Litecoin. The odds of this product hitting the market are much higher than those of larger capped cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL). Canary Capital has filed to list a Litecoin ETF, with the SEC acknowledging the filing and initiating its review process. If approved, it would allow mainstream investors to gain exposure to LTC without managing private keys or holding the asset directly. In Santiment’s view, an LTC ETF would not only open the floodgates for institutional investment but also make it more likely for the other altcoins to be tied to similar financial products. On-Chain Activity and Market Impact Beyond the ETF noises, Litecoin’s $9.6 billion worth of on-chain trading activity over the past week is remarkable. The same metric had a value of $2.8 billion just six months ago, meaning its current state is a 242% improvement from that period. Meanwhile, market watchers have predicted LTC’s next price target at $140, with a potential rally toward $170 if momentum continues. At the time of writing, the coin was changing hands at just above $133, a 3.4% improvement on its level 24 hours ago. Across 12 months, the cryptocurrency’s price is up more than 94%, pushing its market value past the $10 billion mark. Although that barely compares to Bitcoin’s nearly $2 trillion market cap, the OG crypto’s recent dip to a two-week low of $93,500 saw it outperformed by Litecoin, which also did significantly better than the broader crypto market, which is up a mere 0.60%.

With new contenders entering the market daily, picking the right one can be a game-changer. Today, three coins are making serious waves: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is crushing presale milestones, ai16z is gaining traction, and Dogwifhat is experiencing a surge in popularity. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is now at its Blizzard Bay presale stage, boasting a unique location-based launch approach and an aggressive token burn mechanism. Meanwhile, ai16z is positioning itself as a disruptor in AI-driven crypto solutions, and Dogwifhat’s meme culture dominance continues to grow. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, ai16z, and Dogwifhat. Arctic Pablo’s Deflationary Model: A Token Burn That Matters Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) has set itself apart with a burn mechanism designed to enhance scarcity and long-term value. Unlike traditional presales, Arctic Pablo permanently removes unsold tokens every week before launch, ensuring a deflationary supply model that benefits early investors. Any tokens left after the presale? Burned. With transactions secured on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), this strategic burning process ensures a controlled supply, preventing inflation and maximizing investor gains. The goal? A price surge post-launch, driven by scarcity and demand. Investors searching for the best new meme coins to buy now should take note—Arctic Pablo meme coin presale isn’t playing by the usual rules. Blizzard Bay: The Latest Presale Destination for Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) Arctic Pablo Coin’s journey has now reached Blizzard Bay, the 11th phase in its global expedition. With 9 locations conquered in less than a month, this presale has moved at lightning speed, capturing investor interest at every stop. Right now, the presale price sits at $0.000063, presenting a jaw-dropping 12,618.77% ROI potential from this stage to the projected launch price of $0.008. Over $1.44 million has already been raised, proving that Arctic Pablo is dominating presale markets. As it moves toward new locations, the entry price rises—meaning the window to grab Arctic Pablo at its lowest is closing fast. For those scouting the best new meme coins to buy now , Arctic Pablo is delivering a presale experience unlike any other. The next phase will see another price jump, making Blizzard Bay an opportune moment to get in before the hype pushes it even further. ai16z Making Headlines with AI-Driven Crypto Innovations ai16z is making a name for itself as one of the most advanced AI-backed blockchain projects in the space. Recent developments indicate a major push toward integrating artificial intelligence with decentralized finance, aiming to streamline automated trading and smart contract optimizations. With increasing institutional backing and strategic partnerships, ai16z has quickly become a contender in the crypto AI sector, positioning itself as a major player for long-term growth. Dogwifhat’s Meme Takeover Continues Dogwifhat (WIF) has taken the meme coin world by storm, proving its staying power beyond the hype. Recent data suggests a massive surge in community engagement and market adoption, pushing WIF’s trading volume to record highs. With its grassroots appeal and growing merchant adoption, Dogwifhat is solidifying its status as more than just another meme token—it’s becoming a movement within the crypto space. Final Thoughts: Which Crypto Stands Out? With Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale numbers skyrocketing, ai16z pushing AI-powered blockchain innovation, and Dogwifhat capturing meme culture dominance, all three coins are gaining serious traction. However, Arctic Pablo’s deflationary model, high-yield staking, and unique presale structure make it an exciting contender in the market. As the presale advances beyond Blizzard Bay, early adopters stand to gain the most before the next price surge. If you’re looking for the best new meme coins to buy now, Arctic Pablo Coin might just be the one to watch.

Another American Celebrity Is Launching His Own Memecoin! Here's That Name,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-memecoin-craze-continues-another-american-celebrity-is-launching-his-own-memecoin-heres-that-name/,"Rapper and designer Ye, better known as Kanye West, is set to launch his own cryptocurrency token, YZY, despite his past criticism of crypto projects and ongoing controversy over his public statements. Ye Plans YZY Crypto Token Despite Previous ‘Coin’ Criticism According to multiple sources familiar with the project, 70% of the YZY token supply will be allocated directly to Ye, with only 10% set aside for liquidity and 20% for investors. The token is designed as an official currency for fashion brand Yeezy and will be accepted as payment on its website. Ye’s move into cryptocurrency comes after a series of major job losses in recent years. Ye was fired by Adidas, Balenciaga, and his talent agency after making anti-Semitic remarks in 2022. Most recently, he shut down his Shopify online store after calling himself a “Nazi” and selling a T-shirt with a swastika. With mainstream platforms cutting ties, the decentralized nature of crypto offers an alternative for Ye to monetize his brand without institutional oversight. Ye’s move into crypto comes despite his own past skepticism.

The buzz is building as reports emerge about the Canary Litecoin ETF getting listed on the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) website. This exciting news, initially highlighted by the crypto insights platform Unfolded on X, suggests a significant step forward for this much-anticipated financial product. But what does this listing really mean for Litecoin and the broader crypto market? Let’s dive into the details and explore what this could signal for the future of cryptocurrency ETFs. Decoding the DTCC Listing: A Crucial Step for Canary Litecoin ETF First things first, what exactly is the DTCC, and why is a listing here noteworthy? The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is a vital part of the financial infrastructure in the United States. It provides clearing and settlement services for trillions of dollars in securities transactions annually, essentially acting as the plumbing that keeps the financial markets flowing smoothly. Listing on the DTCC website is generally understood as a preparatory step for an ETF to begin trading on exchanges once regulatory approvals are in place. It signifies that the infrastructure is being set up for the ETF to function in the market. For the Canary Litecoin ETF , this listing on the DTCC is not just a procedural update; it’s a tangible sign of progress in its journey towards becoming a publicly traded investment vehicle. Think of it like this: DTCC Listing: Setting up the operational framework – think of it as preparing the stage for a play. SEC Approval: The green light from regulators – this is the official go-ahead for the play to begin. Exchange Listing: Where the action happens – this is where investors can actually buy and sell shares of the ETF, like the play being performed in a theater. While DTCC listing is a positive indicator, it’s essential to remember that it is not the final hurdle. The crucial step remains the approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC’s Role: Navigating the Path to Litecoin ETF Approval The journey of any ETF, especially a cryptocurrency ETF, involves rigorous scrutiny by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the case of the Canary Litecoin ETF , Canary Funds officially submitted their 19b-4 application to the SEC on January 16th. This application is a formal request seeking permission to list and trade the proposed Litecoin ETF on an exchange. The 19b-4 form is a crucial document in the ETF approval process, detailing the structure, operation, and rationale behind the proposed ETF. It kicks off a formal review period where the SEC evaluates whether the ETF meets the necessary regulatory standards to protect investors and maintain market integrity. The SEC’s review process is thorough and can be lengthy. They consider various factors, including: Market Surveillance: Ensuring there are mechanisms in place to prevent market manipulation and fraud in the underlying Litecoin market. Custody Solutions: Evaluating the security and reliability of how the Litecoin assets backing the ETF will be stored and managed. Investor Protection: Assessing whether the ETF structure is transparent and provides adequate disclosures to investors about the risks involved. While the DTCC listing is a promising sign, the SEC’s decision will ultimately determine whether the Litecoin ETF sees the light of day in the US market. The cryptocurrency community is keenly watching this process, hoping for a favorable outcome that could pave the way for broader acceptance of crypto investment products. Why a Litecoin ETF Matters: Unpacking the Potential Benefits The potential launch of a Litecoin ETF is significant for several reasons. Firstly, it represents a further expansion of cryptocurrency investment options available to mainstream investors. ETFs, or Exchange Traded Funds, are popular investment vehicles known for their accessibility, diversification, and ease of trading. A Litecoin ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to Litecoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. This can be particularly appealing to those who are interested in the crypto market but are hesitant about the complexities of wallets, private keys, and exchanges. Here are some potential benefits of a Litecoin ETF: Accessibility: Investing in a Litecoin ETF would be as simple as buying shares of any stock through a traditional brokerage account. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, potentially offering a sense of security and oversight that some investors find reassuring compared to the often-unregulated crypto exchange landscape. Diversification: For investors looking to diversify their portfolios, a Litecoin ETF could provide exposure to a different segment of the cryptocurrency market beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Tax Efficiency (Potentially): Depending on the jurisdiction and individual circumstances, ETFs can sometimes offer tax advantages compared to directly holding the underlying asset. The introduction of a Litecoin ETF could unlock a significant influx of capital into the Litecoin market, potentially driving up demand and price. It could also legitimize Litecoin further in the eyes of institutional investors and traditional financial markets. Navigating the Challenges: Hurdles and Considerations for Litecoin ETFs While the prospect of a Canary Litecoin ETF is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge the challenges and hurdles that cryptocurrency ETFs, in general, face. The SEC has been cautious in approving crypto spot ETFs, primarily due to concerns about market manipulation and investor protection. While Bitcoin spot ETFs have recently been approved, the regulatory landscape for other cryptocurrencies remains uncertain. The SEC will likely apply similar scrutiny to Litecoin ETFs, focusing on the maturity and robustness of the Litecoin market. Some potential challenges include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The SEC’s stance on cryptocurrency ETFs can evolve, and there’s no guarantee that a Litecoin ETF will receive approval, even with the DTCC listing. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. The SEC will want to ensure that the ETF structure can withstand these fluctuations and protect investors. Custodial Risks: Securely storing large amounts of Litecoin for an ETF is a significant undertaking. The SEC will scrutinize the custodial solutions proposed by Canary Funds. Competition: The crypto ETF space is becoming increasingly competitive. The success of a Litecoin ETF will depend on its ability to attract investors in a crowded market. Despite these challenges, the DTCC listing of the Canary Litecoin ETF is a positive signal. It suggests that progress is being made and that the infrastructure is being prepared for a potential launch. The cryptocurrency community will be eagerly awaiting further updates from the SEC regarding the 19b-4 application. Actionable Insights: What Should Investors Watch For? For those interested in the potential of a Litecoin ETF , staying informed is key. Here are some actionable insights to consider: Monitor SEC Announcements: Keep an eye on official announcements from the SEC regarding the review of the Canary Litecoin ETF 19b-4 application. Any updates or decisions will be significant market events. Track DTCC Updates: Continue to monitor the DTCC website for any further updates related to the Canary Litecoin ETF listing. Changes in status or additional listings could provide further clues. Follow Crypto News Platforms: Stay updated with reputable cryptocurrency news platforms like Unfolded and others for timely analysis and insights on ETF developments. Understand ETF Risks: Before investing in any ETF, especially a cryptocurrency ETF, ensure you understand the associated risks, including market volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Litecoin and Crypto ETFs The listing of the Canary Litecoin ETF on the DTCC website is undoubtedly a significant and encouraging development. It represents a tangible step forward in the journey towards bringing a Litecoin ETF to the US market. While SEC approval is still pending and challenges remain, this news injects a dose of optimism into the cryptocurrency space. For Litecoin, it could mean increased institutional interest and broader investor adoption. For the crypto ETF market, it signals continued expansion and diversification beyond Bitcoin. As we await further developments, the DTCC listing serves as a powerful reminder of the ongoing evolution and maturation of the cryptocurrency investment landscape. The future of cryptocurrency investment options looks increasingly bright, and the Canary Litecoin ETF is poised to potentially play a key role in shaping that future.

On X, Zhou posted that Bybit will not be supporting Pi Network, citing fraud as his reason. He also shared an official police warning of $Pi from Chinese police dated back in 2023. Pi Network’s mainnet launch overshadowed by Bybit CEO’s harsh criticism On Thursday morning, the Pi coin was officially listed on several exchanges, including OKX, Gate.io, Bitget, and more. Amid the otherwise successful launch of the Pi Network mainnet, pioneers received dampening news from Bybit CEO Ben Zhou. The network’s mainnet initially experienced several delays and rescheduling. While fans of the Pi network celebrated the successful listing of the Pi coin on several exchanges, the exuberance was short-lived as Bybit CEO Ben criticized the project and its cryptocurrency. The police warning article said older people had been deceived into mining Pi coin with the prospect of rewards, like cars and luxury gifts, but hadn’t delivered anything. Some victims provided real identification details to cash their winnings but didn’t get anything in return. Zhou noted that the Pi Network had devastating effects on its victims, some of whom lost pension funds and personal data because of the project. His comments were prompted by an anonymous post on X claiming that Bybit’s decision not to list Pi coin stemmed from personal bias, claiming that Pi Network developers had rejected the exchange. “Bybit had made no listing request to $PI, and the claim that $PI was refused by Bybit or failed its KYB is complete nonsense,” Zhou wrote. He further challenged the Pi Network to address these concerns transparently instead of making “childish attacks.” Pi Network’s soaring debut fizzles as scam allegations and price crash cloud optimism The Pi Network continues to face allegations of being a scam despite its price reaching an all-time high of about $330 million after launching its long-awaited mainnet on February 20. When launched, the token’s price soared to $1.99 — a remarkable 36% jump. However, enthusiasm soon faded, and the token’s value crashed by 55% in the following hours, falling to a low of $0.9123. The comments by Zhou have stirred up a mixed bag of reactions within the crypto community. An anonymous user on X wasn’t very pleased with the Pi Network team after accidentally sending some tokens to the wrong wallet address. The user said they had attempted to contact support many times with no response and that the project has no customer support or operational integrity. Others have lauded Zhou’s move to oppose Pi Network. Others praised Bybit for its extensive due diligence process and for refusing to list a token that raised a litany of red flags. A comment by one user highlighted that crypto exchanges should be more scrutinizing when allowing projects on their platform and have a job to protect investors from major scams.

This bold decision positions Altvest Capital to become the first publicly traded company in Africa to officially adopt Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. Let’s dive into what this means, why it’s significant, and what the future might hold. Why Bitcoin Treasury Reserve is a Strategic Game Changer? Altvest Capital’s CEO, Warren Wheatley, recently revealed to Bloomberg the company’s purchase of 1 BTC and ambitious plans to significantly increase their Bitcoin holdings. They are currently seeking regulatory nods to raise a substantial $10 million through a stock sale, specifically earmarked for expanding their Bitcoin treasury reserve . But why Bitcoin? What makes it such an appealing asset for a company’s treasury? Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty: Wheatley explicitly stated that Bitcoin is viewed as a strategic reserve asset, acting as a powerful hedge against economic instability. This is particularly relevant in regions experiencing currency depreciation, like South Africa with its Rand. Diversification Beyond Traditional Assets: Companies traditionally hold reserves in fiat currencies or precious metals. Adding Bitcoin provides diversification into a completely new asset class, uncorrelated with traditional markets. Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin’s history, while volatile, has shown significant long-term appreciation. Companies adopting it as a reserve asset are betting on its continued growth potential. Decentralization and Transparency: Bitcoin operates outside traditional financial systems, offering decentralization and transparency through its blockchain technology. Altvest Capital’s Crypto Adoption Africa: A Pioneer in the Making Altvest Capital’s move isn’t just about Bitcoin; it’s a significant step for crypto adoption in Africa . Africa, with its burgeoning tech-savvy population and often volatile economic landscapes, presents a fertile ground for cryptocurrency adoption. Here’s why Altvest’s decision could be a catalyst: Setting a Precedent: As the first publicly listed African company to embrace Bitcoin as a treasury reserve, Altvest Capital sets a powerful precedent. This could encourage other companies in Africa and emerging markets to explore similar strategies. Boosting Investor Confidence: Such a move from a publicly traded entity can enhance investor confidence in the crypto space within Africa. It signals maturity and acceptance at a corporate level. Driving Innovation in Financial Strategies: Altvest’s approach can inspire innovation in financial strategies across the continent, prompting businesses to consider digital assets for treasury management and growth. Consider the broader context: While companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have famously adopted Bitcoin treasury strategies in North America, Altvest Capital is potentially blazing a trail in Africa. This localized adoption is crucial for the global expansion and mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Diving Deeper into Altvest Capital Bitcoin Investment Altvest Capital Bitcoin investment is more than just a headline; it’s a calculated financial manoeuvre. Let’s break down some key aspects: Aspect Details Initial Purchase 1 BTC already acquired Fundraising Goal $10 million via stock sale Purpose of Funds Expand Bitcoin treasury reserve holdings Strategic Rationale Hedge against Rand depreciation and economic uncertainty Regulatory Status Seeking regulatory approval for stock sale The planned $10 million stock sale highlights Altvest’s serious commitment to this strategy. It’s not a token gesture, but a substantial allocation of capital towards building a significant Bitcoin reserve. This move suggests a long-term vision and confidence in Bitcoin’s potential. Bitcoin as Reserve Asset: Benefits and Challenges The concept of Bitcoin as a reserve asset is still relatively new for corporate treasuries. While the potential benefits are compelling, there are also challenges to consider: Benefits: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s limited supply (21 million coins) makes it a potential hedge against inflation, unlike fiat currencies which can be inflated. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin is a global, borderless asset, easily transferable and accessible worldwide. Potential for Higher Returns: Compared to traditional low-yield reserve assets, Bitcoin offers the potential for significantly higher returns over time. Challenges: Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its price volatility, which can be a concern for corporate treasuries focused on stability. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, creating uncertainty and potential risks. Accounting and Tax Complexity: Accounting for and taxing Bitcoin holdings can be complex and varies across jurisdictions. Security Risks: Storing and securing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Despite these challenges, the potential rewards and strategic advantages are clearly compelling enough for companies like Altvest Capital to take the plunge. Effective risk management and a long-term perspective are crucial for navigating the complexities. South Africa Bitcoin Landscape and Future Outlook Altvest Capital’s decision also shines a spotlight on the South African Bitcoin landscape. South Africa has shown a growing interest in cryptocurrencies, both from retail investors and, now, potentially from corporate entities. This move could signal a broader trend within the South African business environment. Looking ahead, several factors will influence the success and impact of Altvest’s Bitcoin treasury strategy: Regulatory Approvals: Securing regulatory approval for the stock sale and Bitcoin holdings will be crucial for Altvest’s plans to proceed smoothly. Market Performance of Bitcoin: Bitcoin’s price performance will directly impact the value of Altvest’s reserve asset and the overall success of this strategy. Broader Market Adoption: Whether other African companies follow suit will determine if this becomes a widespread trend or remains an isolated case. Economic Conditions in South Africa: The economic climate in South Africa, particularly the performance of the Rand, will influence the effectiveness of Bitcoin as a hedge. Altvest Capital’s pioneering initiative is undoubtedly a significant development. It represents a forward-thinking approach to treasury management and a powerful endorsement of Bitcoin’s potential as a strategic corporate asset, especially in emerging markets like Africa. In conclusion, Altvest Capital’s foray into Bitcoin treasury reserves is more than just news; it’s a potential paradigm shift. It showcases the evolving role of cryptocurrencies in corporate finance and signals a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a viable and strategic asset for businesses in Africa and beyond. Keep an eye on Altvest Capital – they might just be leading the charge in a new era of corporate treasury management.

VanEck’s Tool Provides Insights,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-bitcoin-solve-the-us-debt-crisis-vanecks-tool-provides-insights/,"The post Can Bitcoin Solve the US Debt Crisis? VanEck’s Tool Provides Insights appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The tool, provided on the VanEck website , allows users to calculate whether BTC could help resolve the US debt crisis. The two prime components of the tool are the US National Debt Value calculator and the Bitcoin Treasury Reserve Value calculator. Currently, the US debt stands at $36 Trillion. The US National Debt Value calculator shows that if the debt grows at a compound annual growth rate of 5%, it will reach $116 Trillion by 2049. As of now, the price of Bitcoin stands at $98,269. The US Treasury Reserve Value calculator shows that if the BTC price surges by a compound annual growth rate of 25%, the value of a 1M BTC reserve will become approximately $21 Trillion by 2049 – which is roughly 18% of the expected 2049 US Debt. The overall calculation suggests that if the US establishes a BTC strategic reserve as directed by the BITCOIN Act, it would be able to offset over 18% of its total national debt by 2049. The BITCOIN Act and Its Proposal: What You Should Know The BITCOIN Act was presented to the US Senate by Senator cynthia lummis cynthia lummis Cynthia Lummis is a senator from Wyoming, United States. She has a net worth ranging from $20 million and $75 million. On her son-in-law's advice, she purchased Bitcoin and became the first U.S senator to possess cryptocurrency. She possesses no less than $230,000 worth of Bitcoin. She adopted office on January 3, 2021, the term terminates on January 3, 2027. She has always been focused on advocating for Wyoming's future. She struggled her entire career fighting for Wyoming families, communities, businesses, and values. Beginning at the halls of the Wyoming House to the Halls of the U.S. House. Lummis was born on September 10, 1954, and graduated from the University of Wyoming, earning a bachelor's degree in animal science, and biology. She also achieved a Juris Doctor from the University of Wyoming College of Law. Her career experience comprises working as general counsel to previous Wyoming Governor Jim Geringer, Wyoming House of Representatives, as a treasure of Wyoming, and in the United States House of Representatives from Wyoming's at-large congressional district. In 1990, she also worked as the chair of Mary Mead's gubernatorial campaign and Ray Hunkins's gubernatorial campaign, in 2006, also served on Bob Dole's presidential steering committee in Wyoming. Through her firmly beneficial crypto position, she developed the reception and fair guidelines of computerized resources in the United States. She voluntarily organized a great foundation for herself as a significant Bitcoin financial backer.

This alarming development, reported by Cointelegraph, sends shivers down the spines of crypto investors and raises serious questions about blockchain security and accountability in the digital asset space. Let’s delve into the details of this shocking SafeMoon fraud case and understand what it means for the future of cryptocurrency. What Led to the SafeMoon CTO’s Guilty Plea in the Crypto Fraud Case? The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have been actively cracking down on fraudulent activities in the cryptocurrency market. In November 2023, their joint investigation culminated in charges against key SafeMoon figures: CEO Braden John Karony, founder Kyle Nagy, and CTO Thomas Smith. These charges weren’t just minor infractions; they included serious allegations of conspiracies related to securities fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering – painting a grim picture of the inner workings at SafeMoon. Thomas Smith’s guilty plea is a significant turning point in this case. He admitted to two charges, acknowledging his role in what prosecutors describe as extensive fraudulent activities. This admission not only implicates Smith but also casts a dark shadow over SafeMoon and its leadership. The question now looms large: what exactly did Smith and his colleagues do to orchestrate this massive cryptocurrency scam? Unpacking the $200M Cryptocurrency Scam: How Did SafeMoon Fraud Unfold? While details are still emerging, the charges and guilty plea suggest a meticulously planned and executed scheme. Here’s a breakdown of what we know and what might have transpired in this $200 million crypto fraud : False Promises and Misleading Information: Like many fraudulent crypto projects, SafeMoon likely lured investors with promises of unrealistic returns and technological advancements that were never truly realized. This is a classic tactic in cryptocurrency scams, preying on the fear of missing out (FOMO) and the desire for quick wealth. Pump-and-Dump Scheme: It’s highly probable that SafeMoon operated a pump-and-dump scheme. This involves artificially inflating the price of the SafeMoon token through misleading marketing and endorsements, only for the insiders to sell their holdings at the peak, leaving unsuspecting investors with worthless tokens. Money Laundering: The inclusion of money laundering charges suggests that the perpetrators attempted to conceal the proceeds of their fraudulent activities, further indicating a deliberate and criminal intent behind the SafeMoon fraud . Breach of Trust: As CTO, Thomas Smith held a position of trust. His guilty plea signifies a profound breach of this trust, shaking investor confidence not just in SafeMoon, but potentially in other emerging cryptocurrency projects as well. Thomas Smith Guilty Plea: What Are the Immediate Repercussions? Thomas Smith’s guilty plea has several immediate and significant repercussions: Repercussion Description Legal Ramifications for Smith: Smith now faces potential jail time and hefty fines. His cooperation with authorities could influence the severity of his sentence, but a guilty plea in such a high-profile case typically leads to significant penalties. Increased Pressure on Karony and Nagy: With Smith’s admission, the pressure intensifies on SafeMoon CEO Braden John Karony and founder Kyle Nagy. Their defense strategies will likely need to adapt, and the likelihood of similar outcomes for them has increased. Investor Confidence Plummets: For those who invested in SafeMoon, this news is devastating. The value of SafeMoon tokens is likely to further decline, and any remaining trust in the project is shattered. Regulatory Scrutiny Intensifies: This case will undoubtedly lead to heightened regulatory scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry. Regulators will be under pressure to implement stricter rules and enforcement mechanisms to protect investors from similar scams. Why is Blockchain Security Paramount in Cryptocurrency? The SafeMoon saga underscores the critical importance of blockchain security and due diligence in the cryptocurrency world. While blockchain technology itself is inherently secure and transparent, the projects built upon it are not immune to fraud and manipulation. Here’s why focusing on blockchain security is more crucial than ever: Decentralization Doesn’t Guarantee Security: While decentralization is a core tenet of many cryptocurrencies, it doesn’t automatically equate to security against fraudulent schemes. Scammers exploit the decentralized nature to operate outside traditional regulatory frameworks. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities: Many crypto projects rely on smart contracts, which, if poorly coded, can be exploited. Auditing smart contracts and ensuring robust blockchain security measures are in place is vital. Investor Education is Key: Ultimately, the best defense against cryptocurrency scams is investor education. Understanding the risks, conducting thorough research, and being wary of projects promising unrealistic returns are crucial steps for protecting oneself. Need for Stronger Regulation: Cases like SafeMoon fraud highlight the urgent need for clearer and stronger regulations in the crypto space. This includes regulations around token launches, marketing practices, and accountability for project leaders. Cryptocurrency Scam Red Flags: How to Protect Yourself? Learning from the SafeMoon debacle, how can investors protect themselves from falling victim to cryptocurrency scams? Here are some crucial red flags to watch out for and actionable insights: Unrealistic Promises: Be extremely cautious of projects promising guaranteed high returns or claiming to be “risk-free.” Cryptocurrency investments are inherently risky, and no legitimate project can guarantee profits. Anonymous or Unverified Teams: Legitimate crypto projects usually have transparent teams with publicly verifiable profiles. Be wary of projects where the team is anonymous or lacks credibility. Aggressive Marketing and Hype: Scammers often rely on aggressive marketing tactics and create artificial hype to drive up token prices quickly. Be skeptical of projects that rely heavily on social media buzz and celebrity endorsements without solid fundamentals. Lack of Transparency: A trustworthy crypto project will be transparent about its technology, development roadmap, and tokenomics. Lack of transparency is a major red flag. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before investing in any cryptocurrency, conduct thorough research. Read the whitepaper, analyze the tokenomics, check the team’s background, and understand the project’s technology. Don’t rely solely on hype or social media sentiment. Conclusion: A Stark Reminder of Risks in the Crypto World The Thomas Smith guilty plea in the SafeMoon fraud case serves as a stark and shocking reminder of the risks inherent in the cryptocurrency market. While the potential rewards of crypto investments can be substantial, so too are the risks of fraud and scams. This case underscores the critical need for increased investor awareness, enhanced blockchain security measures, and robust regulatory oversight to protect participants in this rapidly evolving financial landscape. The SafeMoon saga is a cautionary tale that should prompt investors to exercise greater vigilance and demand accountability in the crypto space.

On February 21, blockchain analytics firm Santiment reported that Litecoin’s market capitalization had surged by 46% between February 2 and 19, citing increased investor enthusiasm and growing network activity. This sharp rise in transaction volume is significant—just five months ago, in August 2023, Litecoin processed only $2.8 billion per day. The latest figures represent an impressive 243% jump in network activity, reinforcing Litecoin’s growing role in the crypto ecosystem. Litecoin ETF Listings Spark Bullish Sentiment Momentum behind a Litecoin ETF is picking up, with major financial institutions taking concrete steps toward launching such products. On February 19, the SEC acknowledged a rule change for listing the CoinShares spot Litecoin ETF on Nasdaq , signaling the start of a regulatory review process. Just a day later, market observers noticed the Canary Capital Litecoin ETF listed on the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) system under the ticker LTCC. The DTCC plays a crucial role in global finance, handling trillions of dollars in securities transactions daily. According to the Litecoin Foundation, this listing is an important preparatory step before a potential fund launch. Despite these developments, analysts caution that ETF approval is not yet guaranteed. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that while the DTCC listing signals progress, it does not confirm regulatory approval. However, he remains optimistic, maintaining a 90% chance of a Litecoin ETF being approved this year. LTC Outperforms BTC News of the DTCC listing had an immediate impact on LTC’s price, causing an 8.5% intraday jump from $127 to $138 before a slight pullback on February 21. Over the past two weeks, LTC has gained nearly 30%, far outperforming Bitcoin, which has remained relatively stagnant after dipping below $100K earlier this month. Litecoin’s price has doubled since early November, outpacing the broader crypto market’s 42% gain over the same period. Analysts attribute this rally in part to speculation surrounding a potential Litecoin ETF, coming just 13 months after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Bitcoin’s first spot ETFs.

This revelation, initially reported by Watcher Guru on X, has ignited a flurry of discussions across the cryptocurrency community and beyond. What does it signify when the head of one of the most powerful law enforcement agencies in the world is a Bitcoin holder? Let’s delve into the details and explore the potential implications. FBI Director Kash Patel’s Bitcoin Investment: A Closer Look The news that FBI Director Kash Patel holds a significant amount of Bitcoin has certainly raised eyebrows. In a world where digital assets are increasingly under scrutiny, especially from regulatory bodies and law enforcement, this disclosure is particularly noteworthy. Here’s what we know: The Revelation: Watcher Guru, a well-known crypto news source, broke the story via a post on X (formerly Twitter), stating Kash Patel’s Bitcoin holdings are valued at $115,000. Context is Key: It’s crucial to remember that holding Cryptocurrency is not illegal or unethical in itself. Many individuals from various backgrounds are invested in digital assets. However, the position of FBI Director adds a layer of complexity and public interest to this information. No Official Statement (Yet): As of now, there has been no official statement from Kash Patel or the FBI regarding this disclosure. The information is circulating based on the report from Watcher Guru. Why is This News Significant for Cryptocurrency? The fact that a high-ranking official like the FBI Director is invested in Bitcoin carries weight. Here’s why this news resonates within the Cryptocurrency space: Acceptance and Mainstream Adoption: When individuals in positions of power and influence engage with Cryptocurrency , it can be interpreted as a sign of growing acceptance and mainstream adoption of digital assets. It subtly normalizes Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the eyes of the public and potentially within government circles. Understanding and Perspective: Having a leader who is personally invested in Bitcoin could suggest a deeper understanding of the technology and its potential. This understanding could influence the FBI’s approach to Cryptocurrency -related issues, potentially leading to more informed and balanced policies. Potential for Reduced Hostility: In the past, some government agencies have been perceived as hostile towards Cryptocurrency . The FBI Director’s personal investment might signal a shift towards a more nuanced or less adversarial stance. Navigating Government Regulation and Cryptocurrency The intersection of Government Regulation and Cryptocurrency is a complex and often debated topic. Kash Patel’s Bitcoin holdings come at a time when regulatory frameworks for digital assets are being developed and implemented worldwide. Let’s consider some key aspects: The Tightrope Walk: Balancing Innovation and Compliance Governments face the challenge of regulating Cryptocurrency to prevent illicit activities and protect consumers, while simultaneously fostering innovation and technological advancement. Finding this balance is crucial for the healthy development of the crypto ecosystem. Potential Conflicts of Interest? While not inherently a conflict, the FBI Director’s investment in Bitcoin could raise questions about potential conflicts of interest. Will his personal financial interests influence the FBI’s approach to Cryptocurrency regulation or investigations? Transparency and ethical considerations become paramount in such situations. The Need for Clear Regulatory Frameworks The ongoing discussions around Government Regulation highlight the urgent need for clear and consistent regulatory frameworks for Cryptocurrency . This clarity is essential for businesses, investors, and law enforcement agencies alike. It reduces uncertainty and provides a stable environment for the responsible growth of the digital asset space. Global Regulatory Landscape Cryptocurrency regulation is not just a US issue; it’s a global concern. Different countries are taking varied approaches, from outright bans to proactive adoption. The actions of major economies like the United States significantly influence the global regulatory landscape. The FBI Director’s personal stance on Bitcoin , even indirectly, could be observed internationally. Kash Patel: More Than Just the FBI Director Beyond his role as FBI Director , it’s important to remember that Kash Patel is an individual with his own financial decisions. His investment in Bitcoin reflects a personal choice within the bounds of legal and ethical guidelines. Understanding the person behind the position can offer a broader perspective. Background: Kash Patel has a background in law and national security, having served in various government roles prior to becoming FBI Director. His experience likely provides him with a unique perspective on technology, finance, and security. Personal Finance Decisions: Like many others, Kash Patel is likely diversifying his investment portfolio. Bitcoin , despite its volatility, is increasingly seen as a legitimate asset class by many investors. No Indication of Wrongdoing: It’s crucial to emphasize that there is no indication of any wrongdoing or impropriety associated with Kash Patel’s Bitcoin investment based on the information available. It’s a personal financial decision that has become public due to his high-profile position. What Does This Mean for the Future of Cryptocurrency? While one individual’s investment doesn’t dictate the future, the FBI Director’s Bitcoin holding is a symbolic moment. It underscores the growing integration of Cryptocurrency into mainstream society and even within the highest echelons of government. Here are a few potential takeaways: Increased Legitimacy: Such revelations contribute to the increasing legitimacy of Cryptocurrency as an asset class. It challenges the narrative that Bitcoin is only for fringe groups or illicit activities. Shifting Perceptions within Government: This news might subtly shift perceptions about Cryptocurrency within government agencies. It could encourage more open-minded discussions and a move away from purely restrictive approaches. Continued Scrutiny: Despite potential positive signals, Cryptocurrency will undoubtedly remain under regulatory scrutiny. The focus will likely be on establishing clear rules and ensuring compliance, regardless of individual officials’ personal investments. Conclusion: A Surprising Revelation with Ripple Effects The disclosure of FBI Director Kash Patel’s $115,000 Bitcoin investment is more than just a news headline; it’s a significant marker in the ongoing evolution of Cryptocurrency . It highlights the increasing penetration of digital assets into mainstream consciousness and even into the portfolios of top government officials. While the full implications are yet to unfold, this revelation undoubtedly adds another layer to the complex narrative surrounding Cryptocurrency and Government Regulation . It prompts us to consider how perceptions are changing and how the future of digital assets will be shaped by the actions and beliefs of those in positions of power.
