After its rally, which gained 35% over the past 60 days, the popular Layer 1 blockchain is back in the news with more on-chain activities. According to recent data, Solana’s DeFi Total Value Locked or TVL increased to $5.7 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 26% improvement from the previous quarter. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K? Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast Kamino, a crypto lending service, leads the count with $1.5 billion in TVL and an impressive 7% Quarter-on-Quarter growth, helped by jupSOL and PYUSD additions. Recent data also suggests that Solana’s market cap is now $3.8 billion, an improvement of 23%, boosted by the integration of PayPal’s PYUSD. DeFI Continues To Drive Growth For Solana Solana DeFi tops the chain’s activities with a total locked value, worth $5.7 billion. This latest SOL data reflects a solid 26% growth QoQ, pushing the blockchain to become third largest in this metric, surpassing Tron. In a Messari report, Solana’s TVL increased due to increased activities for Kamino, which accounted for $1.5 billion of the total contracts locked. Kamino’s recent quarterly figure represents a 57% rise, thanks to the recent integration of jupSOL and PYUSD. Aside from Kamino Finance, Solana’s blockchain featured locked assets for Raydium, with $1.1 billion, and Jupiter, with $749 million. Kamino Finance’s impressive performance is linked to its Kamino Lend V2 launch, offering a permissionless vault and market layer. Analysts expect Kamino Finance to continue its dominance by adding new projects like the Spot Leverage and Lending Orderbook. Solana DEX Shows Signs Of Slowing Down Solana’s DEX activity was down 10% QoQ but rebounded a bit by October. The average daily volume on the blockchain’s exchange hit $1.7 billion, largely because of a fall in meme coins. Raydium retains its dominance on Solana’s DEX, with a 51% market share, although its daily average volume dipped by 13% to $852 million. The volume increased by $350 million with the release of Moonshot, a crypto mobile trading app. Jupiter also stayed at the top, cornering 43% of the total spot exchange volume. Recent developments, including the release of Jupiter Mobile and the integration of Google Pay and Apple Pay, helped the platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading? SOL’s Stablecoins Get Help From PYUSD In the same Messari report, PayPal’s PYUSD lifts SOL’s stablecoin market. The PYUSD was launched in May in Solana, which is mainly instrumental in its market cap growth, which now stands at $3.8 billion. With exciting features like programmable transfers and transfer hooks, PayPal’s PYUSD became instantly popular. Aside from PYUSD, USDC also contributes to Solana’s stablecoins market. Circle’s integration of Web 3.0 services for SOL provides enterprise functionality features like fee sponsorship and programmable wallets, allowing developers to integrate multi-chain solutions quickly.

As a Layer-2 platform on the Solana blockchain, the Grass platform allows users to share unused internet bandwidth to train AI models using a browser extension. With its promising technology, it’s no surprise that its token launch and airdrop last October 28th was highly anticipated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading? While the airdrop was marred by a few issues, including a three-hour outage, the token’s price rally succeeded. Last October 29th, the token peaked at October 29th, then made a massive rally from October 31st until November 2nd, breaching the $1.50 level. After hitting a high of $1.9175 on November 2nd, it has slowed down, settled below the $1.75 level, and now trades at the $1.45 level. GRASS has rejected the $2 price, with analysts seeing a deeper pullback—so, is this the right time to buy? A Rough Start For GRASS Trading for GRASS started on October 28th, but a few issues delayed the token’s airdrop and launch. The team recorded technical issues, including users being prevented from accessing their tokens on their Phantom wallets. Also, the rush to claim the tokens was marred by the three-hour power interruption. Furthermore, some users reported flagged transactions, and many were disqualified from the airdrop. WTF is this @getgrass_io @grassfdn I’m using it since Epoch 1 and after 10 months of using, it is saying that your wallet is not eligible?? Really?#grassairdrop #grassfoundation #grassSCAM pic.twitter.com/wt7BWPBI1R — Phantom Soul (@PhantomSoulll) October 28, 2024 A total of 1 billion GRASS tokens were circulated, and 10% were given to early supporters and contributors. It’s still too early to see the full extent of these issues’ effect on GRASS, but the token started well price-wise. Token Tries To Breach $2 It’s challenging to make sense of GRASS’s price action since it only launched a few days ago. However, analysts see a bullish trend on the chart’s lower timeframes. The token boasts above-average volume in the last 24 hours. Also, the token’s on-balance volume and price increased starting October 30th. In short, there was buying pressure for the token, suggesting that price gains may happen soon. However, GRASS rejected $2, making it the token’s short-term psychological resistance. Analysts said the price could dip to $1.75 since the RSI reflects a bearish divergence. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K? Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast Other Analysts See A Deeper Dive For GRASS Based on the technical charts, the analysts found two notable liquidity pools at prices of $1.56 and $1.96. The current price is currently closer to the liquidity pool at $1.56, with the token appearing to reject the $1.96 level. Since there’s a bearish momentum and a liquidity pool at $1.56, traders and holders can expect a price dip below $1,75. Swing traders and new buyers who want to enter a position can wait for the token’s retesting of $1.56 or even $1.4.
