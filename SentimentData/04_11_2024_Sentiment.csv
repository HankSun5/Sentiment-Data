After its rally, which gained 35% over the past 60 days, the popular Layer 1 blockchain is back in the news with more on-chain activities. According to recent data, Solana’s DeFi Total Value Locked or TVL increased to $5.7 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 26% improvement from the previous quarter. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K? Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast Kamino, a crypto lending service, leads the count with $1.5 billion in TVL and an impressive 7% Quarter-on-Quarter growth, helped by jupSOL and PYUSD additions. Recent data also suggests that Solana’s market cap is now $3.8 billion, an improvement of 23%, boosted by the integration of PayPal’s PYUSD. DeFI Continues To Drive Growth For Solana Solana DeFi tops the chain’s activities with a total locked value, worth $5.7 billion. This latest SOL data reflects a solid 26% growth QoQ, pushing the blockchain to become third largest in this metric, surpassing Tron. In a Messari report, Solana’s TVL increased due to increased activities for Kamino, which accounted for $1.5 billion of the total contracts locked. Kamino’s recent quarterly figure represents a 57% rise, thanks to the recent integration of jupSOL and PYUSD. Aside from Kamino Finance, Solana’s blockchain featured locked assets for Raydium, with $1.1 billion, and Jupiter, with $749 million. Kamino Finance’s impressive performance is linked to its Kamino Lend V2 launch, offering a permissionless vault and market layer. Analysts expect Kamino Finance to continue its dominance by adding new projects like the Spot Leverage and Lending Orderbook. Solana DEX Shows Signs Of Slowing Down Solana’s DEX activity was down 10% QoQ but rebounded a bit by October. The average daily volume on the blockchain’s exchange hit $1.7 billion, largely because of a fall in meme coins. Raydium retains its dominance on Solana’s DEX, with a 51% market share, although its daily average volume dipped by 13% to $852 million. The volume increased by $350 million with the release of Moonshot, a crypto mobile trading app. Jupiter also stayed at the top, cornering 43% of the total spot exchange volume. Recent developments, including the release of Jupiter Mobile and the integration of Google Pay and Apple Pay, helped the platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading? SOL’s Stablecoins Get Help From PYUSD In the same Messari report, PayPal’s PYUSD lifts SOL’s stablecoin market. The PYUSD was launched in May in Solana, which is mainly instrumental in its market cap growth, which now stands at $3.8 billion. With exciting features like programmable transfers and transfer hooks, PayPal’s PYUSD became instantly popular. Aside from PYUSD, USDC also contributes to Solana’s stablecoins market. Circle’s integration of Web 3.0 services for SOL provides enterprise functionality features like fee sponsorship and programmable wallets, allowing developers to integrate multi-chain solutions quickly.

As a Layer-2 platform on the Solana blockchain, the Grass platform allows users to share unused internet bandwidth to train AI models using a browser extension. With its promising technology, it’s no surprise that its token launch and airdrop last October 28th was highly anticipated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading? While the airdrop was marred by a few issues, including a three-hour outage, the token’s price rally succeeded. Last October 29th, the token peaked at October 29th, then made a massive rally from October 31st until November 2nd, breaching the $1.50 level. After hitting a high of $1.9175 on November 2nd, it has slowed down, settled below the $1.75 level, and now trades at the $1.45 level. GRASS has rejected the $2 price, with analysts seeing a deeper pullback—so, is this the right time to buy? A Rough Start For GRASS Trading for GRASS started on October 28th, but a few issues delayed the token’s airdrop and launch. The team recorded technical issues, including users being prevented from accessing their tokens on their Phantom wallets. Also, the rush to claim the tokens was marred by the three-hour power interruption. Furthermore, some users reported flagged transactions, and many were disqualified from the airdrop. WTF is this @getgrass_io @grassfdn I’m using it since Epoch 1 and after 10 months of using, it is saying that your wallet is not eligible?? Really?#grassairdrop #grassfoundation #grassSCAM pic.twitter.com/wt7BWPBI1R — Phantom Soul (@PhantomSoulll) October 28, 2024 A total of 1 billion GRASS tokens were circulated, and 10% were given to early supporters and contributors. It’s still too early to see the full extent of these issues’ effect on GRASS, but the token started well price-wise. Token Tries To Breach $2 It’s challenging to make sense of GRASS’s price action since it only launched a few days ago. However, analysts see a bullish trend on the chart’s lower timeframes. The token boasts above-average volume in the last 24 hours. Also, the token’s on-balance volume and price increased starting October 30th. In short, there was buying pressure for the token, suggesting that price gains may happen soon. However, GRASS rejected $2, making it the token’s short-term psychological resistance. Analysts said the price could dip to $1.75 since the RSI reflects a bearish divergence. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K? Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast Other Analysts See A Deeper Dive For GRASS Based on the technical charts, the analysts found two notable liquidity pools at prices of $1.56 and $1.96. The current price is currently closer to the liquidity pool at $1.56, with the token appearing to reject the $1.96 level. Since there’s a bearish momentum and a liquidity pool at $1.56, traders and holders can expect a price dip below $1,75. Swing traders and new buyers who want to enter a position can wait for the token’s retesting of $1.56 or even $1.4.

It is interesting to note that the volume has not followed the rise in bitcoin in this second half of the year, unlike what happened in March. When we analyze Bitcoin's seasonality, we see that this could be a great investment opportunity. Investment Thesis I recommend buying the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC). The US elections are approaching with Trump favored in most swing states, including the ""Trump Trade"", which is apparently being reflected in the DXY, and so a confluence may be forming around Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Trump has repeatedly demonstrated promising plans for cryptocurrencies. Although bitcoin is close to its highs, its volume is still low, and seasonality indicates that there is room for greater capital flows into the cryptocurrency, which could be a great investment opportunity. Franklin Bitcoin ETF The Franklin Bitcoin ETF seeks to replicate the performance of bitcoin, making it a big draw for investors looking for traditional exposure to the cryptocurrency's price. Let's take a look at the holdings. Holdings (Franklin Templeton) With this ETF, investors do not need to open accounts on exchanges and manage digital assets, making the investment process more convenient. The management fee is 0.19%. After this introduction, let's move on to the thesis. Why Invest In ETF And Not Directly In Bitcoin? Investing in bitcoin through the EZBC ETF brings a number of advantages. The ETF has a very competitive management fee of 0.19%, and other peers such as the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (BATS: FBTC ) or the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEARCA: GBTC ) have management fees of 0.25% and 1.5% respectively. Other advantages include simplicity, as it eliminates the need to manage a portfolio of digital assets on an exchange. Finally, the ETF is registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and is offered by Franklin Templeton, which gives it an additional layer of security. The Elections and Their Implications For Bitcoin It is noticeable that the future of Bitcoin looks much more promising with the possible election of Donald Trump, at least if we analyze his latest statements . In this sense, Trump seems to be the favorite to win the election, given the latest polls in the swing states. Trump Pulls Ahead in Battleground States (Statista) Another indicator of market tension, and one that possibly indicates an advantage, is the DXY. As we can see below, the dollar versus a basket of currencies is appreciating in what the market has called the ""Trump Trade"". Fed Fund Rate 2024e (%) vs DXY (pts.) (BTG Pactual) Interesting Signs When analyzing this data regarding the elections, I was quite intrigued, and I went looking for more data to delve deeper into the analysis. What really caught my attention was that Bitcoin is at its all-time highs, but the volume is still very low. Price x Volume (The Block) Therefore, we have two options in my view: The volume is low, and the price will fall, or Bitcoin will come back into fashion, and with the volume returning, the cryptocurrency will skyrocket even more. It seems to me that the price will rise further due to another piece of data that I will show below. Seasonality In Bitcoin? The black line below shows the seasonality of Bitcoin prices based on average returns between 2012 and 2023. The red line shows Bitcoin's performance in 2024, and compares it to the historical average. Let's take a look below. Bitcoin Price Seasonality (Topdown Charts, LSEG) As we can see, Bitcoin has been showing strong seasonal performance in November and December. Furthermore, the current pattern suggests that it should continue to rise if this trend continues. This supports my recommendation to buy the Franklin Bitcoin ETF. Potential Threats To The Bullish Thesis One of the risks to my thesis is that, when looking for an ETF, the investor is usually looking for diversification. This is not the case with the Franklin Bitcoin ETF, so investors should be extra careful in their analysis. As for Trump's election being a trigger for the rise of Bitcoin, it is important to remember that election results are unpredictable, and there are also polls indicating a victory for Kamala Harris. Bitcoin is at its all-time highs, which means that much of the safety margin for investment is already gone. Additionally, the liquidity of this ETF may be a problem for large investors, given that the assets under management are around $522 million. Finally, the investor will not be buying Bitcoin directly, which means the net return will be slightly lower than what Bitcoin itself could provide. Finally, the investor would not be able to use it in financial transactions. The Bottom Line If Trump wins the US election, a series of combinations could occur that would make the price of Bitcoin rise even further, especially with the latest statements by the US presidential candidate. It is very striking that the Bitcoin volumes that followed the highs of March are not following the highs of October. However, when we analyze seasonality, we see that this could be an opportunity. Based on this analysis, I recommend buying the Franklin Bitcoin ETF. In my view, although the asset is at all-time highs, there is an opportunity for its prices to rise even further with the combination of factors reported.",BTC-USD|EZBC,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTG,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-04 01:35:06

ETH is struggling and might recover if it clears the $2,500 resistance zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline from the $2,650 resistance zone. The price is trading below $2,500 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2,450 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a recovery wave if it surpasses the $2,500 and $2,550 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Takes Hit Ethereum price struggled to stay above $2,550 and started a fresh decline like Bitcoin. ETH declined below the $2,520 and $2,500 levels. It tested the $2,420 support zone. A low was formed at $2,411 and the price is now attempting to recover. There was a move above the $2,450 resistance zone.

If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,500 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,450 level. The first major support sits near the $2,400 zone. A clear move below the $2,400 support might push the price toward $2,350. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,320 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,250.

DOGE tested $0.1420 and is currently recovering losses. DOGE price started a fresh decline from the $0.180 resistance level. The price is trading below the $0.1650 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1580 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.1550 and $0.1580 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Eyes Fresh Increase Dogecoin price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $0.180 resistance like Bitcoin and Ethereum. DOGE declined below the $0.1720 and $0.1650 support levels. The price even declined below $0.1550 before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $0.1422 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $0.150 resistance zone. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1790 high to the $0.1422 low. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.1550 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1550 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1580 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1580 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. A close above the $0.1580 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1600 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1650 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1790 high to the $0.1422 low. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1720. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1550 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1480 level. The next major support is near the $0.1420 level. The main support sits at $0.1400. If there is a downside break below the $0.1400 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1320 level or even $0.1300 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level.

Steph, an analyst under the “StephIsCrypto” username, offers a bold, positive outlook for XRP, saying that a significant price rally is in the pipeline thanks to increased global liquidity. Related Reading: Solana DeFi Momentum Soars With $5.7 Billion Locked In Q3 In a published analysis, Steph highlighted the token’s historical relationship with increased liquidity and structural patterns like the descending channel and the Bollinger Bands. According to Steph, these are the primary factors that set up XRP for a price ascent soon. At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5052, up 0.5% in the last 24 hours, but sustained a nearly 2% rally in the last week, data from Coingecko shows. XRP And Its Relationship With Global Liquidity Higher global liquidity often favors Ripple’s XRP, fueling price rallies. In Steph’s analysis, a token’s liquidity, or the available cash flow across the market, traditionally helps XRP sustain price action in past cycles. BUY #XRP BEFORE IT HITS $14.00 !!! pic.twitter.com/e8wY3UVq11 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) November 3, 2024 Steph is now looking at the same trajectory, where global liquidity is increasing thanks to favorable policies from central banks. He cites the possible move of the Federal Reserve, which can introduce additional money into circulation, thus weakening the fiat currencies but creating more capital. Steph sees the token as a great investment when the liquidity surge happens. As Weighted Global Liquidity Index Moves Up, Riskier Assets Increase Steph’s thesis on XRP is also based on the Weighted Global Liquidity Index (WGLI) movement. The WGLI tracks the world’s money supply by looking at central banks’ balance sheets and other important financial statements. The analyst argues that the index reflects possible price movements of risky assets, like XRP. If the index trends upward, crypto assets tend to increase as well. According to the analyst, every XRP price surge happened immediately after an increase in the index. Currently, there’s a divergence between XRP’s price and the index. Although there’s an increase in global liquidity, XRP’s price appears stable. But for Steph, this setup acts as his bullish signal. Bollinger Bands Squeeze And Descending Channel Favor SRP According to Steph, even the Bollinger Bands and Descending Channel set up the altcoin for a favorable run. Since 2021, XRP has been trading in a descending channel, with multiple resistance price points and declining volumes. Related Reading: GRASS Token Fails To Break $2 Level – Is It Time To Buy? He pointed out that the asset’s Bollinger Bands are compressed. If the bands tighten in crypto, it suggests a probable price action. For example, XRP’s Bollinger Bands compressed in 2017, which was followed by the asset’s price rally. If the analysis and data trends hold true, the analyst expects XRP to trade at $14, translating to an increase of 2,670%.

This level has previously held strong as a line of defense for ADA, but its recent breach suggests that sellers may be gaining the upper hand. With ADA navigating lower levels, investors are left questioning whether this slip could open the door to a deeper downtrend. As bears tighten their grip, this article aims to analyze the recent decline of ADA below the critical $0.3389 support level and evaluate the likelihood of a deeper downtrend unfolding. By exploring technical signals and market dynamics, this piece will provide readers with a clear understanding of ADA’s current position, potential risks, and paths forward in the face of mounting bearish pressure. Technical Analysis: Is ADA Set For Further Slide? On the 4-hour chart, ADA has recently broken below the $0.3389 mark, with its price now exhibiting strong bearish momentum as it trades beneath the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This positioning under the SMA is a key indicator of a possible prolonged downside move, suggesting that sellers are currently in control. If selling pressure persists, the $0.2388 level will become an important area to monitor. Also, the 4-hour Composite Trend Oscillator for ADA is displaying negative signals, as both the SMA line and the signal line have dropped below the zero level and are nearing the oversold zone. Typically, this movement indicates that selling pressure is intensifying, showing that sellers are becoming increasingly dominant in the market. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Eyes a Potential Recovery: Can It Bounce Back? On the daily chart, Cardano is exhibiting pronounced downward strength, highlighted by a bearish candlestick pattern that signifies increased selling pressure below the $0.3389 mark. This pattern indicates that sellers are firmly in control of the market, relentlessly driving the price lower, prompting a strong likelihood of further losses in the near term. An in-depth examination of the 1-day Composite Trend Oscillator reveals that Cardano is likely poised for prolonged losses. Following its failure to break above the SMA line, the signal line is descending and moving into the oversold zone, indicating a significant negative shift in momentum. If this downward trend continues, Cardano may face considerable challenges in staging a recovery, which could lead to an extended period of sluggish price movement. Key Levels To Watch In The Coming Days As Cardano faces a challenging market landscape, investors must monitor several key levels in the coming days. Attention should be directed toward the support level at $0.2388, which may provide crucial protection against additional downturns. Should ADA sustain its position above this threshold, it could pave the way for a potential recovery, aiming for the $0.3389 level and even higher.
