After its rally, which gained 35% over the past 60 days, the popular Layer 1 blockchain is back in the news with more on-chain activities. According to recent data, Solana’s DeFi Total Value Locked or TVL increased to $5.7 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a 26% improvement from the previous quarter. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K? Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast Kamino, a crypto lending service, leads the count with $1.5 billion in TVL and an impressive 7% Quarter-on-Quarter growth, helped by jupSOL and PYUSD additions. Recent data also suggests that Solana’s market cap is now $3.8 billion, an improvement of 23%, boosted by the integration of PayPal’s PYUSD. DeFI Continues To Drive Growth For Solana Solana DeFi tops the chain’s activities with a total locked value, worth $5.7 billion. This latest SOL data reflects a solid 26% growth QoQ, pushing the blockchain to become third largest in this metric, surpassing Tron. In a Messari report, Solana’s TVL increased due to increased activities for Kamino, which accounted for $1.5 billion of the total contracts locked. Kamino’s recent quarterly figure represents a 57% rise, thanks to the recent integration of jupSOL and PYUSD. Aside from Kamino Finance, Solana’s blockchain featured locked assets for Raydium, with $1.1 billion, and Jupiter, with $749 million. Kamino Finance’s impressive performance is linked to its Kamino Lend V2 launch, offering a permissionless vault and market layer. Analysts expect Kamino Finance to continue its dominance by adding new projects like the Spot Leverage and Lending Orderbook. Solana DEX Shows Signs Of Slowing Down Solana’s DEX activity was down 10% QoQ but rebounded a bit by October. The average daily volume on the blockchain’s exchange hit $1.7 billion, largely because of a fall in meme coins. Raydium retains its dominance on Solana’s DEX, with a 51% market share, although its daily average volume dipped by 13% to $852 million. The volume increased by $350 million with the release of Moonshot, a crypto mobile trading app. Jupiter also stayed at the top, cornering 43% of the total spot exchange volume. Recent developments, including the release of Jupiter Mobile and the integration of Google Pay and Apple Pay, helped the platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading? SOL’s Stablecoins Get Help From PYUSD In the same Messari report, PayPal’s PYUSD lifts SOL’s stablecoin market. The PYUSD was launched in May in Solana, which is mainly instrumental in its market cap growth, which now stands at $3.8 billion. With exciting features like programmable transfers and transfer hooks, PayPal’s PYUSD became instantly popular. Aside from PYUSD, USDC also contributes to Solana’s stablecoins market. Circle’s integration of Web 3.0 services for SOL provides enterprise functionality features like fee sponsorship and programmable wallets, allowing developers to integrate multi-chain solutions quickly.

As a Layer-2 platform on the Solana blockchain, the Grass platform allows users to share unused internet bandwidth to train AI models using a browser extension. With its promising technology, it’s no surprise that its token launch and airdrop last October 28th was highly anticipated. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks $73,000, Yet Google Searches Stay Stagnant—Is Hype Fading? While the airdrop was marred by a few issues, including a three-hour outage, the token’s price rally succeeded. Last October 29th, the token peaked at October 29th, then made a massive rally from October 31st until November 2nd, breaching the $1.50 level. After hitting a high of $1.9175 on November 2nd, it has slowed down, settled below the $1.75 level, and now trades at the $1.45 level. GRASS has rejected the $2 price, with analysts seeing a deeper pullback—so, is this the right time to buy? A Rough Start For GRASS Trading for GRASS started on October 28th, but a few issues delayed the token’s airdrop and launch. The team recorded technical issues, including users being prevented from accessing their tokens on their Phantom wallets. Also, the rush to claim the tokens was marred by the three-hour power interruption. Furthermore, some users reported flagged transactions, and many were disqualified from the airdrop. WTF is this @getgrass_io @grassfdn I’m using it since Epoch 1 and after 10 months of using, it is saying that your wallet is not eligible?? Really?#grassairdrop #grassfoundation #grassSCAM pic.twitter.com/wt7BWPBI1R — Phantom Soul (@PhantomSoulll) October 28, 2024 A total of 1 billion GRASS tokens were circulated, and 10% were given to early supporters and contributors. It’s still too early to see the full extent of these issues’ effect on GRASS, but the token started well price-wise. Token Tries To Breach $2 It’s challenging to make sense of GRASS’s price action since it only launched a few days ago. However, analysts see a bullish trend on the chart’s lower timeframes. The token boasts above-average volume in the last 24 hours. Also, the token’s on-balance volume and price increased starting October 30th. In short, there was buying pressure for the token, suggesting that price gains may happen soon. However, GRASS rejected $2, making it the token’s short-term psychological resistance. Analysts said the price could dip to $1.75 since the RSI reflects a bearish divergence. Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Hit $176K? Anthony Scaramucci Lays Out His High-Stakes Forecast Other Analysts See A Deeper Dive For GRASS Based on the technical charts, the analysts found two notable liquidity pools at prices of $1.56 and $1.96. The current price is currently closer to the liquidity pool at $1.56, with the token appearing to reject the $1.96 level. Since there’s a bearish momentum and a liquidity pool at $1.56, traders and holders can expect a price dip below $1,75. Swing traders and new buyers who want to enter a position can wait for the token’s retesting of $1.56 or even $1.4.

It is interesting to note that the volume has not followed the rise in bitcoin in this second half of the year, unlike what happened in March. When we analyze Bitcoin's seasonality, we see that this could be a great investment opportunity. Investment Thesis I recommend buying the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC). The US elections are approaching with Trump favored in most swing states, including the ""Trump Trade"", which is apparently being reflected in the DXY, and so a confluence may be forming around Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Trump has repeatedly demonstrated promising plans for cryptocurrencies. Although bitcoin is close to its highs, its volume is still low, and seasonality indicates that there is room for greater capital flows into the cryptocurrency, which could be a great investment opportunity. Franklin Bitcoin ETF The Franklin Bitcoin ETF seeks to replicate the performance of bitcoin, making it a big draw for investors looking for traditional exposure to the cryptocurrency's price. Let's take a look at the holdings. Holdings (Franklin Templeton) With this ETF, investors do not need to open accounts on exchanges and manage digital assets, making the investment process more convenient. The management fee is 0.19%. After this introduction, let's move on to the thesis. Why Invest In ETF And Not Directly In Bitcoin? Investing in bitcoin through the EZBC ETF brings a number of advantages. The ETF has a very competitive management fee of 0.19%, and other peers such as the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (BATS: FBTC ) or the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (NYSEARCA: GBTC ) have management fees of 0.25% and 1.5% respectively. Other advantages include simplicity, as it eliminates the need to manage a portfolio of digital assets on an exchange. Finally, the ETF is registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and is offered by Franklin Templeton, which gives it an additional layer of security. The Elections and Their Implications For Bitcoin It is noticeable that the future of Bitcoin looks much more promising with the possible election of Donald Trump, at least if we analyze his latest statements . In this sense, Trump seems to be the favorite to win the election, given the latest polls in the swing states. Trump Pulls Ahead in Battleground States (Statista) Another indicator of market tension, and one that possibly indicates an advantage, is the DXY. As we can see below, the dollar versus a basket of currencies is appreciating in what the market has called the ""Trump Trade"". Fed Fund Rate 2024e (%) vs DXY (pts.) (BTG Pactual) Interesting Signs When analyzing this data regarding the elections, I was quite intrigued, and I went looking for more data to delve deeper into the analysis. What really caught my attention was that Bitcoin is at its all-time highs, but the volume is still very low. Price x Volume (The Block) Therefore, we have two options in my view: The volume is low, and the price will fall, or Bitcoin will come back into fashion, and with the volume returning, the cryptocurrency will skyrocket even more. It seems to me that the price will rise further due to another piece of data that I will show below. Seasonality In Bitcoin? The black line below shows the seasonality of Bitcoin prices based on average returns between 2012 and 2023. The red line shows Bitcoin's performance in 2024, and compares it to the historical average. Let's take a look below. Bitcoin Price Seasonality (Topdown Charts, LSEG) As we can see, Bitcoin has been showing strong seasonal performance in November and December. Furthermore, the current pattern suggests that it should continue to rise if this trend continues. This supports my recommendation to buy the Franklin Bitcoin ETF. Potential Threats To The Bullish Thesis One of the risks to my thesis is that, when looking for an ETF, the investor is usually looking for diversification. This is not the case with the Franklin Bitcoin ETF, so investors should be extra careful in their analysis. As for Trump's election being a trigger for the rise of Bitcoin, it is important to remember that election results are unpredictable, and there are also polls indicating a victory for Kamala Harris. Bitcoin is at its all-time highs, which means that much of the safety margin for investment is already gone. Additionally, the liquidity of this ETF may be a problem for large investors, given that the assets under management are around $522 million. Finally, the investor will not be buying Bitcoin directly, which means the net return will be slightly lower than what Bitcoin itself could provide. Finally, the investor would not be able to use it in financial transactions. The Bottom Line If Trump wins the US election, a series of combinations could occur that would make the price of Bitcoin rise even further, especially with the latest statements by the US presidential candidate. It is very striking that the Bitcoin volumes that followed the highs of March are not following the highs of October. However, when we analyze seasonality, we see that this could be an opportunity. Based on this analysis, I recommend buying the Franklin Bitcoin ETF. In my view, although the asset is at all-time highs, there is an opportunity for its prices to rise even further with the combination of factors reported.",BTC-USD|EZBC,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTG,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-04 01:35:06
