The price has skyrocketed by an astonishing 225% in under three weeks, showing no signs of slowing down as momentum builds. This surge has positioned it as a top-performing altcoin, capturing the attention of analysts and traders alike. Related Reading: Avalanche Soars 20% In 24 Hours – Analyst Reveals Next Price Target CrediBull, a prominent analyst on X, has shared a detailed technical analysis highlighting XRP’s strong bullish structure. According to his insights, XRP is currently in a well-defined 5-wave impulsive move, a pattern often associated with sustained upward trends. If it continues to hold a critical support level, CrediBull predicts that the price could soar past $2 in the coming weeks, marking a significant milestone for the altcoin. As excitement grows, market participants are closely watching its performance. The ongoing rally suggests that XRP could hit new highs and pave the way for broader altcoin gains. Whether it can maintain its upward trajectory will depend on its ability to sustain key support levels and capitalize on the current bullish sentiment. For now, XRP remains a focal point in the market, with its next moves eagerly anticipated. The Bullish Rally Could Continue The recent bullish phase for XRP might be just the beginning as optimism continues to build among analysts who foresee a higher price in the months ahead. However, key price levels must be tested and maintained for XRP to sustain its momentum and advance to the next leg up. Prominent analyst CrediBull shared his insights on X, revealing that XRP is currently in a clear 5-wave impulsive move, a strong indicator of a bullish trend. According to his technical analysis, this pattern confirms that XRP’s absolute bottom was established at $0.49 earlier this year. He also emphasized the importance of the $1.05 level, the origin of the fifth subwave in this impulsive structure. CrediBull explained that if XRP falls below $1.05, it could signal the start of a larger Wave 2 correction, which would likely precede the next major upward impulse (Wave 3). However, if XRP holds firmly above $1.05, it would indicate that the fifth subwave is extending, potentially pushing the price to $2 or higher before any significant pullback occurs. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Buying Spree – Taker Buy Volume hits $1.683B In One Hour This analysis reinforces the view that XRP’s current rally may just be the start of a broader bullish trend. Investors are now watching closely to see if XRP can maintain key support levels and confirm its extended move upward. XRP Hits Multi-Year Highs: ATH Next? XRP is trading at $1.45, following an impressive rally that saw the price touch $1.63 yesterday, marking its highest level since May 2021. This milestone has sparked optimism among investors, positioning XRP for a potential run to new all-time highs in the coming months. The sustained upward momentum reflects growing confidence in the price’s bullish trajectory. However, the recent surge also brings the possibility of consolidation. The price might need to cool off and gather strength below the $1.63 mark before continuing its upward movement. Consolidation phases are a natural part of any significant rally and can help establish stronger support levels for future price action.

If the price holds above this mark, it will reinforce its bullish outlook and set the stage for a potential breakout and continuation of its upward trend in the weeks ahead. Analysts believe that maintaining this level would be a strong signal of market confidence, paving the way for XRP to build on its recent gains and target new milestones.

This remarkable price movement has garnered the attention of many analysts as investors continue to project the trajectory of the price. Related Reading: Chainlink Rockets 20%: Whale Activity Sparks Break From Bear Trend There are basically two ways the XRP price can go from here: either a continued move upwards or a notable correction. An in-between is a consolidation pattern. CrediBULL Crypto shared his insights on the potential paths the altcoin might take next. Using the Elliott Wave Theory, he highlighted two scenarios that could shape XRP’s near-term future. What’s The Next Path For XRP Price? According to CrediBULL Crypto, XRP’s recent rally exhibits a textbook example of a five-wave impulsive move, complete with clearly identifiable subwaves. This pattern confirms that the cryptocurrency has likely reached its absolute bottom at the November low of $0.49, which is a strong foundation for its current upward trend. The impulsive wave structure suggests that the crypto is at a pivotal juncture, and its future trajectory hinges on whether it sustains specific price levels. The first possibility centers on XRP failing to maintain its position above $1.05, which is the origin of the fifth subwave in the current impulsive structure. Should this level break, it would confirm that the XRP price is in a larger Wave 2 correction. According to the Elliot Waves Theory, Waves 2 and 4 are corrective waves, while Waves 1, 3, and 5 are the main bullish waves. before This correction, while bearish in the short term, would lay the groundwork for an even stronger Wave 3 rally in the future. CrediBULL Crypto predicts a very different outcome if the XRP price manages to hold above the $1.05 level. Holding above the $1.05 level would indicate that the fifth subwave is extending. In this case, the analyst predicted that the XRP price will surpass the $2 mark before experiencing any substantial pullback. The Road Ahead For XRP XRP, which had lingered below the $1 threshold for the past three years, has now firmly established itself above this pivotal mark. The recent XRP price surge to $1.6 suggests that the cryptocurrency is in a stronger position to target the $2 milestone rather than retreat into a significant correction. This bullish sentiment is bolstered by speculation around SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s anticipated resignation in January 2025.

Nonetheless, the next phase of its journey depends on key support and resistance levels. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $1.46, having corrected by about 8.5% in the past 24 hours. However, the XRP price is still up by 175% in the past 30 days.

While the milestone signals remarkable strength, the price has yet to claim this key level, leaving investors in suspense. Market demand remains robust, fueling optimism that Bitcoin will soon break above the $100,000 threshold. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Buying Spree – Taker Buy Volume hits $1.683B In One Hour Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that Bitcoin’s Realized Profit has reached an all-time high of $443 million in daily gains. This highlights significant buying pressure in the market as traders and long-term holders lock in unprecedented profits. However, this record-breaking profit-taking is also sparking concerns among some investors. They fear the rally could stall, interpreting the surge in realized profits as a potential signal of a local top scenario. Despite these mixed signals, the overall market sentiment leans bullish. Bitcoin continues to hold above crucial support levels, suggesting that demand remains strong enough to drive the next leg up. With the cryptocurrency just shy of a monumental breakthrough, the coming hours and days will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin’s momentum can sustain a decisive move beyond $100,000 or if a temporary consolidation is on the horizon. Bitcoin Rally Could Continue Above $100K Bitcoin’s rally from $66,800 to $99,800 has marked a unique and unexpected bullish phase in 2024. As prices approach the elusive $100,000 milestone, many investors who doubted Bitcoin’s potential to hit this level this year are now revising their expectations. The surge has been driven by strong demand and market confidence, making a breakout above $100,000 seem inevitable. Should this occur, analysts widely anticipate a bullish continuation for Bitcoin, further solidifying its dominance in the crypto space.

Corrections during this phase are not only possible but could also be beneficial for market health. A pullback would provide an opportunity for consolidation, potentially giving altcoins the space to recover and initiate their own rallies. Critical insights from CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn shed light on the aggressive nature of this rally. Data shows Bitcoin’s Realized Profit recently hit an all-time high of $443 million daily, reflecting significant profit-taking activity. While this confirms robust buying pressure, it also raises concerns among cautious investors who interpret the spike in profits as a potential sign of a local top. Despite these concerns, there’s room for growth in Bitcoin’s trajectory. Maintaining support above $95,000 would sustain bullish momentum, but a healthy correction from current levels might also provide the fuel needed for a stronger push beyond $100,000 in the near future. BTC Testing Crucial Supply Bitcoin is currently holding strong above the $97,000 mark, maintaining bullish momentum as it eyes a push above the $100,000 milestone. This level represents a significant psychological and technical barrier, and market sentiment remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential to break it. With demand staying robust, many investors are preparing for an explosive surge that could define Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming weeks. However, there are growing concerns about the possibility of Bitcoin setting a local top. If this scenario materializes, the price could enter a consolidation phase, potentially lasting several weeks as the market digests recent gains. Analysts suggest that holding above the $98,000 level in the next few days would keep bullish momentum intact and pave the way for a breakout above $100,000. Related Reading: Polkadot Holds Key Demand Level – DOT Could Hit $11 In Coming Weeks On the other hand, if Bitcoin fails to hold the $97,000 mark, it could signal the start of a healthy correction. In this case, the price may retrace to the $92,000 level, a key demand zone that would likely act as strong support. A pullback to this level would allow Bitcoin to regroup and build the foundation for another push higher, reinforcing its long-term bullish trend.

After concluding the prior week in a phase of consolidation, the meme cryptocurrency carried this trend into the early days of the new week. However, the Dogecoin price kicked off a new 25% rally on Friday, November 22, to create a new 2024 high. Related Reading: Top Analyst Claims XRP New ATH Is Just Around The Corner – Details Interestingly, this new rally saw the Dogecoin price break a bull flag to the upside. Such a rally has brought into focus the perspective of the Dogecoin price reaching a new all-time high before the end of the year. Dogecoin Price Rally Teases Breakout To $0.82 King of meme coins Dogecoin surged by about 25% as the week drew to a close, reaching an intraday high of $0.4759 on Saturday. This rally is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that the Dogecoin price has finally resumed another leg up after a brief consolidation since it hit $0.43 earlier on November 14. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the significance of this rally in a post on X, drawing attention to Dogecoin’s decisive breakout above a bull flag pattern. According to Martinez, this technical breakout could set the stage for a much larger rally, with his projection targeting a bullish move toward $0.82. If achieved, this price level would represent an impressive increase of approximately 90% from the current Dogecoin price. #Dogecoin $DOGE is in the middle of a bullish breakout to $0.82! https://t.co/KjLJQ7ZkNm pic.twitter.com/Rib4XImoTT — Ali (@ali_charts) November 23, 2024 How Feasible Is The Dogecoin Rally To $0.82? Before the Dogecoin price can rally to the $0.82 price level, it would first need to surpass its long-standing all-time high of $0.7316, a milestone that has remained unbroken for over three years. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.4287, reflecting a slight pullback from its recent intraday peak of $0.4759. This retreat shows that the consolidation phase is not yet complete, as resistance appears to have formed near the $0.43 level and has created a sell wall that must be overcome. Breaking toward the all-time high would first require Dogecoin to achieve a decisive and sustained breach above the $0.43 threshold, which remains a critical level for regaining upward momentum. Interestingly, recent whale activity points to a potential upswing for the meme coin in in the coming week. On-chain data reveals that large holders, or “whales,” have been actively accumulating, purchasing over 550 million DOGE tokens worth an estimated $214.5 million. Related Reading: Chainlink Rockets 20%: Whale Activity Sparks Break From Bear Trend These whale addresses, which typically hold between 10 million and 100 million DOGE, are often seen as influential in shaping market trends.

ETH is rising and aiming for more gains above the $3,500 resistance. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,300 and $3,320 levels. The price is trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,350 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $3,420 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price remained supported above $3,120 and started a fresh increase like Bitcoin. ETH gained pace for a move above the $3,220 and $3,300 resistance levels. The bulls pumped the price above the $3,400 level. It gained over 10% and traded as high as $3,499. Recently, there was a downside correction below $3,400. The price dipped below $3,320 and tested $3,280. A low was formed at $3,288 and the price is now consolidating above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,499 swing high to the $3,288 low.

The main resistance is now forming near $3,420 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,499 swing high to the $3,288 low. A clear move above the $3,420 resistance might send the price toward the $3,500 resistance. An upside break above the $3,500 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,600 resistance zone or even $3,620. Downsides Limited In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,350 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,320 level. The first major support sits near the $3,285 zone. A clear move below the $3,285 support might push the price toward $3,220. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,120 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,040.

The seasoned analyst shared this sentiment in a post on X, highlighting his price targets for various altcoins. He made the announcement as Bitcoin first broke into the $99K price level, showing readiness for the long-awaited $100K milestone.Time for Dogecoin to Pump to $3According to Crypto Scofield, the altcoin market is now ready to follow Bitcoin's lead and push into all-time-high price ranges. Among the highlighted tokens was Dogecoin, which the analyst suggests could peak at $3.Notably, Dogecoin is currently priced at $0.4775 as of today, a level not seen since 2021. When Crypto Scofield first made his call for Dogecoin to pump, DOGE was trading at around $0.3700. Essentially, the asset has already surged by approximately 30% in less than two days since the call.The analysis projecting further upside suggests that market participants who join the Dogecoin rally today could see significant returns from the projected price surge. For context, if Dogecoin were to reach $3 from its current price of $0.4700, it would represent a massive 710% price increase for those buying now.Views of Other Analysts on Dogecoin Reaching $3Crypto Scofield is not the only one projecting that Dogecoin could reach $3. Two weeks ago, Ash Crypto, an analyst with 1.3 million followers on X, also suggested that Dogecoin could hit $3 within the next six to twelve months. Technical analyst Crypto Yapper has also voiced similar sentiments regarding Dogecoin's potential.Ambitious DOGE Outlooks Beyond $3On the more ambitious side, analysts like Javon Marks and Ali Martinez have issued even bolder targets for Dogecoin. Marks, for example, cited historical patterns to argue for a monumental 21,700% rise in Dogecoin’s value.Meanwhile, Martinez has also looked at historical trends and proposed a 7,900% growth to $23. In a separate analysis, he used other indicators to suggest a $18 price point.However, these ambitious estimates rely heavily on historical patterns repeating, and critics have dismissed them as highly speculative, citing concerns over market cap implications.",Market|Doge|Dogecoin Price Prediction|Latest Dogecoin (DOGE) News Today,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-11-25 05:05:36

Pantoja took to social media to address critics who argue that XRP's market cap would make such a price unattainable. He drew a compelling analogy between the future potential of XRP and the early days of the internet.He argued that dismissing the possibility of XRP reaching $100 based on market cap is akin to the arguments in the 1990s that the internet couldn't become a dominant force simply because only a fraction of homes owned personal computers. “People adopt, things change, and the world adapts,” Pantoja wrote , urging crypto investors and enthusiasts to think beyond the present constraints of the market. He emphasized that the path to mass adoption, whether for cryptocurrency or new technologies, often unfolds in unexpected ways. A testament to this is the explosive growth of the internet over the past few decades.The comments come as XRP continues to pull stellar performance in the ongoing bull market, prompting many to issue bold targets while others call for caution. XRP Must Rally 6,750% to Reach $100XRP is worth $1.46 today after seeing its value explode by 185% in the past three weeks. It even traded at $1.6216 over the weekend, marking its first time reaching that price in three years.However, attaining $100 requires XRP’s value to expand by 68-fold or 6,750% from its current level. Moreover, at a $100 price, XRP would command a market cap of $5.7 trillion and a fully diluted cap of about $10 trillion.Some ambitious analysts have suggested that XRP could surpass this threshold even this season. However, critics have challenged the ambition, citing that a trillion-dollar cap for XRP is far from feasible for XRP at this time.Drawing Parallels with Bitcoin's RiseXRP proponents often remind critics that similar doubts were voiced about Bitcoin in its early years—such as claims that Bitcoin could never reach $10,000. Notably, Bitcoin traded as low as $0.04865 back in July 2010, just 14 years ago. Today, even the $100K price point for Bitcoin is within reach, as it currently trades around $98K with a market cap of $1.95 trillion. Essentially, XRP enthusiasts draw inspiration from Bitcoin’s rise, believing that a $100 price and beyond could be feasible for XRP someday in the future.While community commentators like Pantoja are deeply optimistic about XRP reaching $100, he has stated that this threshold could remain elusive for at least another five years—unlike others who argue it’s attainable by 2025. “Tech takes time,” he said, adding that he expects XRP’s peak for this bull season to be around $8 to $20.

Top Crypto Analyst Thinks So,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/next-dogecoin-top-crypto-analyst/,"In a new analysis, prominent crypto analyst Miles Deutscher unveiled his thesis on a crypto he believes could rival Dogecoin in this market cycle. With a following of over 550,000 on X and 208,000 YouTube subscribers, Deutscher’s insights carry significant weight in the crypto community. Titled “I Just Found The Next DOGE! [10X Potential… Or More?],” Deutscher’s video explores the untapped potential of Luckycoin (LKY)—a meme coin that not only predates Dogecoin but was instrumental in its creation. “Dogecoin was originally a fork of a cryptocurrency called Luckycoin, itself a fork of Litecoin,” Deutscher highlighted, referencing Dogecoin’s official website. This connection places Luckycoin at the very foundation of Dogecoin’s existence. Is Luckycoin The ‘Next Dogecoin’? To substantiate his claim, Deutscher cited a podcast featuring Jackson Palmer, co-creator of Dogecoin. Palmer stated: “You know, you were asking me before the show, like, why was there a decision to fork Luckycoin, which was itself a fork of Litecoin, which itself is a fork of Bitcoin… And that’s because Luckycoin had this whole notion of random block rewards built in.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Extends Rally – Can This Lead To A Breakout Above $0.82? Deutscher further pointed out that Dogecoin’s source code contains lines nearly identical to Luckycoin’s, with the primary difference being the replacement of “Luckycoin” with “Dogecoin.” Luckycoin, launched in May 2013, saw its network halt in November 2013. The last original block, numbered 81,743, was mined on November 26, 2013. The reasons for its dormancy included the disappearance of its founder and the unsustainable nature of its random block rewards, which deterred miners. However, on August 25, 2024, the network was revived starting from block 81,744. This community-led takeover has reignited interest in Luckycoin, making it one of the oldest actively mined chains in existence. “This makes it the longest-running meme coin blockchain ever. What’s the next oldest running meme coin blockchain? Well, it’s Doge, and Luckycoin is actually older than Doge,” Deutscher emphasized. The revival has led to a dramatic increase in Luckycoin’s hash rate. At one point, it surpassed Litecoin and Dogecoin. “When you see a spike like this in the interest for mining a coin, there’s two reasons for it: One, when price increases, this creates a flywheel of more people mining because they see that there’s profitability there. Two, exchanges who actually want to list a coin that may not have the necessary supply The only way for them to acquire enough Lucky to list is actually to mine the coin themselves,” Deutscher explained. Notably, industry insider Crypto Dog hinted at major exchanges mining Luckycoin: “Not naming names, but I know one tier-one exchange is currently accumulating Lucky through LTC merge mining.” Deutscher addressed the discrepancies in Luckycoin’s market capitalization reported on platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, which list it around $100 million. He argued that these figures are misleading due to lost or dormant coins from the early mining days. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Rapid Dogecoin Surge To $1: The Timing May Surprise You By accounting for approximately 8 million Luckycoins that are likely lost or inaccessible, Deutscher calculated the true active supply to be around 6.2 million Luckycoins. At the current price of $9, this places Luckycoin’s market cap at approximately $56 million. Comparing this to Dogecoin’s $64 billion market cap, Deutscher highlighted the potential for growth: “Luckycoin is a 1,141x away from Doge, which is a massive discrepancy and, I think, a really powerful shelling point for retail because this is the OG Doge.” Deutscher presented a series of scenarios illustrating Luckycoin’s potential: 5x Increase: Market cap reaches $282 million, representing 0.44% of Dogecoin’s market cap. 10x Increase: Achieves 1% of Dogecoin’s market cap at $600 million. 20x Increase: Reaches 1.75% of Dogecoin’s market cap at $1.1 billion. Emphasizing the importance of storytelling in crypto, Deutscher stated: “Crypto is driven by narratives; crypto is driven by stories. I personally haven’t found a story this compelling in crypto in a long time.” He believes that Luckycoin’s rich history and direct connection to Dogecoin provide a compelling narrative that could resonate with both retail investors and the broader crypto community. Looking ahead, Deutscher identified the upcoming Chinese New Year on January 29th as a potential catalyst. In Chinese culture, luck and prosperity are highly valued, and Luckycoin’s branding aligns seamlessly with these themes. “Chinese culture is all about luck, prosperity, wealth, and health. Luckycoin is literally the epitome of this […] If China picks up this narrative, the stars are basically aligning for this coin to perform really, really well,” he suggested. Currently, Luckycoin is not widely available on major exchanges, which Deutscher views as both a challenge and an opportunity. “It’s not on a Bybit, an OKX, a Binance, a Coinbase… It’s only just been listed on MEXC. Because it’s not on big exchanges, liquidity is thin […] Once it becomes accessible […] that could potentially lead to the floodgates opening on retail coming in and actually buying this coin,” he noted. Beyond his own advocacy, Deutscher highlighted that other influential figures are beginning to discuss Luckycoin. Notably, Ansem, known for his influence on Solana-based projects, has acknowledged Luckycoin as the “OG Doge.” “The important thing here is the fact that he knows about it and he’s talking about it […] I think this will only continue to gain traction, not only because it’s got the OG Doge narrative in a cycle where Doge is performing so well but also because it has that Chinese New Year narrative as well,” Deutscher predicted. Deutscher disclosed his own investment in Luckycoin, having accumulated it between $2.20 and $3.20. He emphasized transparency, stating: “I’m not paid to do this video. I’m not paid because there is no team. I wasn’t given a discounted OTC. I put my own money in; I backed this myself. I’ve picked up this narrative myself because I believe in it.” While bullish on Luckycoin’s prospects, Deutscher cautioned about the inherent risks: “This is a risky meme. It’s a 50 million market cap meme. It could potentially crash. I don’t know what’s going to happen […] Memecoins are risky, right? There’s no sure bets.” At press time, LKR traded at $15.64.

The concept of ""Bitcoin Yield"" is flawed and misleading, as it relies on issuing equity at a premium without even matching a simple Bitcoin ETF. MicroStrategy faces significant refinancing risk, especially outside of crypto euphoria, which could lead to unfavorable debt terms or even bankruptcy. Investors should consider selling MSTR and replacing it with more reasonable Bitcoin exposure, if they must. There’s a lot of confusion around MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), namely, around the possibility that MicroStrategy has somehow found some new strategy which can provide it with value in excess of what its Bitcoin assets plus its business provide. This article will seek to wash away such confusion. First, The Business The least important thing about MicroStrategy is the actual business it is in. This business is enterprise analytics software, delivered as a package or as a web service. This business is stagnant to declining, and is currently not profitable. When this business was slightly larger, shrinking less and profitable, back in 2019, the market valued it at around $0.5 billion ($1 billion market cap, $0.5 billion net cash, thus the business itself was worth $0.5 billion). Considering the above, we can safely ignore MicroStrategy’s actual business, since MicroStrategy, on 256.3 million fully diluted shares at $422 has a $108.3 billion market capitalization, and the business at $0.5 billion represents less than 0.5% of that. The Bitcoin Treasury Of course, the real reason MicroStrategy trades at a $108.3 billion market cap isn’t its business. Instead, it relates to the large Bitcoin investment it has amassed since it started buying Bitcoin in August 2020. As of the most recent filing, MicroStrategy has bought 331,200 Bitcoins. Since Bitcoin is at $98,000 as I write this, these are worth $32.5 billion. But wait, this means MSTR actually trades at an extremely large premium to the Bitcoin it holds. After all, it trades at a $108.3 billion market cap, and it only holds $32.5 billion in Bitcoin. This can be seen in two ways: For MSTR to trade at the same value as the Bitcoin it holds, Bitcoin would have to be at $326,600 (up 233%). Or for MSTR to trade at the same value as the Bitcoin it holds, MSTR would have to be at $126.70 (down 70%) Of course, there is a narrative out there justifying the extremely large premium. This narrative revolves around the concept of “Bitcoin Yield”, or said another way, the supposed ability that MicroStrategy has of increasing the Bitcoin MSTR holders hold per share as time goes by, through a combination of issuing equity and debt. This, as we’ll see, is an absurd concept. The Bitcoin Yield The Bitcoin Yield, as defined by MicroStrategy, represents the % change, period-to-period, between MSTR’s bitcoin holdings and its diluted shares outstanding. Or, said another way, this is the % change in the bitcoin content per share. Obviously, the widespread idea is that since the bitcoin content per share (number of bitcoin per share) can increase over time, you can pay a premium today for the already-held Bitcoin. MicroStrategy makes use of this concept in its own presentations, and presents ""Bitcoin Yield"" as a KPI (Key Performance Indicator), showing its significance in attracting investor bees to the honey. MicroStrategy presentation MicroStrategy presentation But how and why does the bitcoin per share actually increase? It increases by issuing equity when MSTR is trading at a premium. Why? Because: When MSTR issues shares, it buys $1 in bitcoin per $1 of issued new stock. Yet, the already-issued shares trade for a lot less than $1 in bitcoin per $1 of already-issued shares (that’s why the stock trades at a premium to Bitcoin). Hence, when you mix the bitcoin from the newly issued shares with the “less bitcoin rich” existing shares, the whole cake now has slightly higher bitcoin per share. As a result, “Bitcoin Yield” will have been positive. But this is an absurd concept for two reasons: First, because it’s a circular concept – it justifies the stock trading at an irrational premium because if stock is issued at the irrational premium then the premium will be slightly smaller. This, of course, assumes it will always be possible to issue more stock in the future. Second, because the amount by which MSTR would have to dilute to get to $1 in bitcoin content per $1 is value per share would be infinite . Why? Because the end ratio as calculated above is a combination of shares which have $0.xx ratio and a $1.0 ratio, and this combination, as you issue more and more shares, tends to one, but never reaches it . Hence, it would be senseless to pay a premium for the future increase in bitcoin content per share over just buying a Bitcoin ETF which trades at $1:$1 to its bitcoin content per share, since the bitcoin content per share can never exceed $1:$1 through equity issuance at a premium! But wait, MicroStrategy can also issue debt! MicroStrategy has a second way of increasing the bitcoin content per share. It involves issuing debt, when possible at a low coupon and convertible into stock (so that the low coupon can even exist -- the reason why bond investors accept a low coupon on MSTR is for another day, but it's NOT related to Bitcoin or MSTR's strategy, instead being tied to riskless strategies on high-implied volatility stocks). Here, the magical trick is different. When MicroStrategy issues debt and buys bitcoin in the market with the proceeds, the proceeds are turned $1:$1 into bitcoin, but since no shares are diluted at issuance, the mere fact of issuing debt and buying bitcoin mechanically increases the bitcoin per share , and hence, produces “Bitcoin Yield”. But this is a sleigh of hand, in the sense that the “Bitcoin Yield” is calculated with gross bitcoin held, not with net bitcoin held. And of course, when MSTR issues debt, it buys $1 of bitcoin with $1 of debt, thus at the start and unless bitcoin goes up, it has added exactly $0 in net bitcoin value. Thus, issuing debt to buy bitcoin or the “investor” himself buying bitcoin on margin is rather similar. What Is MicroStrategy, Then? A Closed-End Fund The closest thing we can compare MicroStrategy with, is a closed-end Bitcoin fund. After all, at any given moment shareholders can only buy or sell MSTR – they can’t actually subscribe or redeem the underlying, exactly like it happens with a closed-end fund. And MSTR can trade both at a premium, like now, or at a discount, to the underlying. Furthermore, a closed-end fund can also issue more preferred shares or debt to buy more underlying. Yes, closed-end funds can trade both at a premium, like MSTR, and at a discount … like MSTR. The current crop of euphoric shareholders might not know it, but MSTR has, indeed, already shown it was possible to trade at a discount. In closed-end funds, outside of euphorias, the normal is to trade at or below NAV. And so it was for MSTR: MSTR-tracker.com Note that in the chart above there are observations of up to a 49% discount in 2022, and a 15% discount already within 2024. Basically, outside of straight-up Bitcoin euphoria, it hasn’t taken long for MSTR to converge to its NAV or even below it. We have, of course, examples of other closed-end funds behaving exactly the same. For instance: The GBTC example The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ) traded both at a large premium to Bitcoin NAV, including over 100%, and a large discount to NAV (-49%, must like MSTR) when Bitcoin lost its allure. Ultimately, it converged to NAV once it became an open-end ETF. I wrote about this at the time ( I , II ). ycharts.com The LTCN example Like MSTR and GBTC, the Grayscale Litecoin Trust ( OTCQX:LTCN ) also traded at extremes, which included premiums of over 1,000%. However, these were the result of very low liquidity and very few available LTCN shares to trade. And again, after the euphoria was gone and more shares were available to trade, it, too, managed to trade at a discount of more than 60%. I, too, wrote on this situation ( I , II ). Grayscale We have thus established that it is possible, likely even, that MSTR will once again trade at its NAV / value of the bitcoin it holds. This is likely to happen as soon as crypto / Bitcoin euphoria dies a bit, just like it did cyclically in the past. Of course, in the present market it’s even more possible than in the past because the present market now has several ETFs which hold Bitcoin and trade at NAV, like GBTC or the iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ). There is something else which can happen to MSTR, besides trading at or below NAV, though. MicroStrategy’s Refinancing Risk Since MicroStrategy has issued debt, and since MicroStrategy doesn’t produce much cash from operations or has much cash in its balance sheet (it turns everything into Bitcoin), MicroStrategy has refinancing risk when some of its debt matures. This refinancing risk isn’t acute during times of crypto euphoria. But it can be, outside those times. And crypto euphoria is often not very long-lasting. If a debt maturity happens outside of crypto euphoria, here are the avenues available to MicroStrategy to be able to pay the maturing debt: Selling BTC outside a crypto euphoria (so at a bad moment). Selling MSTR outside of a crypto euphoria (so at a bad moment, selling MSTR likely below NAV) Refinancing debt at unfavorable terms. We actually have an example of what refinancing debt at unfavorable terms means for MicroStrategy. Back in June 2021, MSTR was forced to issue debt. That’s when the market, fearing the worst, sold MSTR down to a near-50% discount to NAV. Here are the conditions that MSTR then got to issue just $500 million of debt: A 6.125% coupon, at a time the FED funds rate was 0% and the 10-year was at 0.7%. Senior secured debt, secured by all of its 92,079 bitcoins. With Bitcoin then at roughly $35,500, that meant the debt was secured at an LTV (Loan-To-Value) of 15.3%. This shows how much the creditors “wanted” bitcoin as a collateral. So there it is, if MSTR is forced to refinance debt at a non-euphoric time, history has already shown us that such could happen at a time when MSTR is trading at a 40%+ discount to NAV (so selling shares would be incredibly dilutive to NAV), Bitcoin is kind of crashing (it went lower still, though) and whatever debt can be issued will be under extremely unfavorable conditions. Worse still, had MSTR’s NAV (bitcoin – debt value) been, at the time, significantly lower, it’s likely that no creditor would want to finance MSTR. If that happened, MSTR could simply face bankruptcy. This is an unlikely, but possible, event, with MicroStrategy’s current strategy. Some Scenarios Here are some scenarios for MicroStrategy, if it converges to its bitcoin NAV , for people to have a better understanding of what it means to buy MSTR currently: Bitcoin falls 80% to $19,600 . MSTR currently has $7bn in net debt, the bitcoin it holds, under a scenario of a 80% drop in Bitcoin, would be worth around $7.1bn (I assume the recently issued $3 billion in debt has been used to buy $3 billion in BTC). In a best-case scenario MSTR would drop 93.2% to $27.7. In a worst-case scenario, if a debt maturity happens, MSTR would be facing potential bankruptcy. Bitcoin falls 50% to $49,000 . MSTR falls 83.6% to $69.2. In a worst-case scenario, if a debt maturity happens, all of MSTR’s bitcoin gets offered as collateral to issue secured debt at an 8%+ coupon. Bitcoin stays the same . MSTR drops 70% to $126.6. Bitcoin goes up 100% . MSTR drops 37% to $265.0. Bitcoin goes up 200% . MSTR drops 4% to $403.3. In short, if, as it has done in the past in the absence of a crypto euphoria, MSTR’s value returns to its bitcoin NAV (never mind below, which it has also done in the past by a good margin), current MSTR shareholders need Bitcoin to go up more than 200% for them to even break even . This isn’t a rational position to be in. Conclusion MicroStrategy’s stock is best seen as a closed-end fund. It looks like one, it walks like one, it quacks like one. It has traded both at a premium to its NAV and at a discount to its NAV, even in the recent past. It has traded at a discount or close to NAV the entire time, since it has been buying Bitcoin, where the crypto market wasn’t euphoric. The Bitcoin yield concept is not rational. It can be shown that through equity issuance alone, it’s impossible for MSTR to even surpass the content per share of a normal Bitcoin ETF ($1 of bitcoin per $1 of stock price). Indeed, using this concept in marketing is highly misleading and might one day attract regulatory scrutiny. All it takes for MSTR to be a disaster for its investors, is for MSTR to again trade at or below NAV, like it has done plenty in the past. Disaster can strike if and when MSTR faces refinancing risk for its existing debt, outside of a crypto euphoria. There has already been an example of what this means in the past, with the need to issue debt at unfavorable rates in a favorable rate environment, secured by all of MSTR’s bitcoin. This isn’t even the worst-case scenario. It is possible, but unlikely, for MSTR to go bankrupt if Bitcoin falls enough at the wrong time (when debt matures). In general, even the most optimistic MSTR shareholder, a full believer in Bitcoin, would do well to sell MSTR and buy GBTC or IBIT instead. To not do so is irrational and dangerous.",GBTC|IBIT|LTCN|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-25 13:28:02

Saylor uses MicroStrategy’s NAV premium to issue convertible notes and ATM offerings, boosting BTC per share and driving shareholders' gains in Bitcoin terms and - so far - share price. MicroStrategy owns 1.5% of total Bitcoin supply, positioning itself as a thought leader and bridge between TradFi and Bitcoin - I see this as a competitive advantage supporting its NAV premium. The strategy hinges on Bitcoin maturing into a global reserve asset. Failure to maintain its NAV premium or a significant drop in Bitcoin prices below $20,000 could undermine MSTR’s position. I remain bullish on MicroStrategy, holding my 150 shares and potentially adding more. For believers in Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a global reserve asset, MSTR is a BUY in my opinion. MicroStrategy overview I hold 150 shares in MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), which represent roughly 10% of my main investment portfolio. With MSTR reaching new All-Time-Highs, an ongoing Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bull run and the ticker getting added to the Nasdaq 100, I have recently reflected on whether I should sell part of my position. After researching, I have decided not to. I believe there is still potential upside to this stock, assuming the Bitcoin bull run continues. I believe many analysts misunderstand Michael Saylor’s vision for MicroStrategy, focusing too much on its premium to Bitcoin holdings rather than its broader strategy. In this article, I’ll explain why I think Saylor aims to position MicroStrategy as the first “Bitcoin bank” and outline the investment thesis for the company. This is my second article on MicroStrategy. My previous coverage was when the stock traded at $122, where I rated it a BUY for investors comfortable with high volatility. What is Saylor doing? The NAV Premium “money glitch” Saylor has a chest containing Bitcoin worth roughly $35 Billion (MicroStrategy), and he is somehow able to convince the market to buy rights to this chest (shares in MicroStrategy) for 3 or more times the value of what’s in the chest. MicroStrategy also has a software business, but I think it’s negligible relative to its Bitcoin holdings and I will not take it into consideration for my analysis. I will cover MicroStrategy’s rich NAV premium later, but first I want to explain what Saylor is doing to profit from this situation. He pockets the difference between the value of Bitcoin in his chest and whatever the market is willing to pay for MicroStrategy. He does so in two ways: By issuing Convertible Notes - corporate bonds that can be converted by the bondholders into equity at a given price, at a later date. With At-The-Market ((ATM)) offerings - which means issuing new shares at market prices, diluting existing shareholders. Saylor uses the premium to purchase more Bitcoin for MicroStrategy, resulting in an ever-increasing BTC per share (see chart below). MSTR; BTC per Share 2020 to date (mstr-tracker.com) As a result of this strategy, shareholders are diluted in fiat terms, but they have registered a substantial gain in Bitcoin terms - as their shares “entitle” them to an ever-increasing amount of Bitcoin. In other words, normally, a company issuing new shares should see its price falling. But because MicroStrategy is able to increase its BTC per share by capitalizing on its NAV premium, the stock has done the exact opposite, appreciating by more than 500% this year to date. In a sense, Saylor has found a “money glitch” in the system, as he is able to constantly dilute shareholders without having his stock depreciating - because investors care about an ever-increasing BTC per share and the market discounts he will be able to buy more Bitcoin in the future. Is this “glitch” infallible? No, it is not - and I will explain what can go wrong in the next section. What can go wrong with Saylor's strategy? (Risks to the “money glitch”) I want to define the risks of Saylor’s playbook before I go into the details of why I believe it can be a winning strategy long term. The reason is that I want to be very clear with readers: I think Saylor is entering uncharted territories, playing with Bitcoin as if it was already a globally accepted reserve asset. I believe Saylor’s scheme can collapse (to different extents) if either of the following two scenarios occur: In case, MicroStrategy’s NAV premium goes to 1x or below. In this case, Saylor won’t be able to keep increasing the BTC per share of MicroStrategy by issuing new shares. In this scenario, the company would keep existing and simply trade at 1x its Bitcoin holdings. It would result in a nominal loss for investors who entered MicroStrategy at above 1x NAV, and in MicroStrategy underperforming Bitcoin for a period of time. If Bitcoin does not mature into a reserve asset, and drops below $20,000 per coin. This could effectively bankrupt MicroStrategy, which is by now leveraged on its Bitcoin holdings. If readers believe there is a concrete chance of the second risk materializing, they should steer away from MicroStrategy. There is simply no point in investing in MSTR, Bitcoin or any other Bitcoin proxy if you believe Bitcoin is a fad. This is also the main risk of entering MicroStrategy at any point in time, in my view. I believe most investors in MicroStrategy are believers in Bitcoin, which is also the reason why demand for MSTR shares is strong despite the constant shareholder dilution . While traditional investors wouldn’t care about “BTC per share” as a metric, MicroStrategy shareholders almost exclusively care about that metric. As long as BTC per share as a metric goes up, the glitch can keep going on. In the next section, I will explain why I think a NAV premium is justified, but this is still a concrete risk that investors entering MSTR at current levels should carefully consider. Why I think the NAV premium is justified - What’s a “Bitcoin bank”? The ultimate question about MicroStrategy is: why is the NAV premium justified? To answer this question, consider that MicroStrategy is one of the few publicly listed companies in the world to own Bitcoin, and by far the company that owns the most. MicroStrategy owns more than 330,000 BTC, equivalent to 1.5% of the total supply of Bitcoin. It is highly unlikely, in my view, that any other public or private company or financial institution will ever come close to having as much Bitcoin as MicroStrategy. If you consider the above a competitive advantage, I think it’s reasonable to believe that MicroStrategy should trade at some premium against its NAV holdings. If you do not consider MicroStrategy owning 1.5% of total Bitcoin supply as of 2024 a competitive advantage for the company, then it’s reasonable to believe MicroStrategy will eventually go back to trading at 1x its Bitcoin holdings. Personally, I do consider this a competitive advantage and I do consider a NAV premium justified. The reason has to do with the way Saylor is positioning its company. MicroStrategy rebranded itself as a “Bitcoin Development Company” earlier this year. The company is also becoming - in my view - the Bitcoin thought leader for corporations. On MicroStrategy’s website, users can download free whitepapers about corporate investments into Bitcoin and other topics linked to adopting Bitcoin. And this is without mentioning what Saylor is doing for Bitcoin, having become one of its strongest advocates with numerous public appearances. Beyond PR and advocating for Bitcoin, I also see MicroStrategy evolving into a “Bitcoin Bank”. In short, this means MicroStrategy can bridge the gap between Traditional Finance (TradFi) and Bitcoin, both by issuing financial instruments linked to its Bitcoin holdings and by consulting companies into adopting Bitcoin. In this sense, I see MicroStrategy operating similarly to how investment banks operate today when they consult companies in matters of Mergers & Acquisitions - charging fees both for consultancy as well as for issuance of bonds or other financial instruments to finance said M&As. Readers could argue that other companies - including traditional financial institutions - could do the exact same thing. While this is technically true, other financial institutions do not have their own Bitcoin holdings, and if they ever will, they are unlikely to ever have as much BTC as MicroStrategy’s. Not to mention, MicroStrategy also has far more credibility, in my view, considering how traditional banks have been very skeptical about Bitcoin until very recently if they are not still. This is where the competitive advantage for MicroStrategy comes into play and why its NAV is justified, in my opinion. As Bitcoin evolves, so may MicroStrategy’s offering as a Bitcoin bank. I believe an interesting evolution could be offering margin loans on Bitcoin holdings to other corporate entities. Assuming Bitcoin will grow into a global reserve asset, elevating itself as the soundest, deflationary form of money, selling Bitcoin to finance daily operations would not make logical sense. This is something I covered in one of my past articles about Bitcoin - arguing how, if my Bitcoin bull case takes place, Bitcoin won’t be able to operate as a global currency. The most logical thing to do would be to take a margin loan in fiat currency and take full benefit of the constant depreciation of fiat currencies in Bitcoin terms. In this context, corporations that followed MicroStrategy’s lead in adopting Bitcoin as a reserve asset might eventually turn to MicroStrategy for margin loans on their BTC holdings. While this may seem far-fetched based on Bitcoin’s current status, it represents a potential scenario in the strong bull case for MicroStrategy. I will revisit the risks linked to this bull case in my second risk section later in this article. MSTR’s convertible debt offer indicates strong institutional demand An example of how MicroStrategy is evolving into a Bitcoin bank is the issuance of convertible debt notes. The last offering has been almost doubled from an initial $1.75 Billion to a final $2.6 Billion. This is especially impressive in my opinion, considering that these convertible notes carry a 0% interest rate at a time where T-Bills are yielding above 4%. And who is buying these notes? Listening to skeptics, you would expect buyers to be retail investors and other crypto actors. On the contrary, one of the buyers of these convertible notes was Allianz SE (ALIZF)(ALIZY), an established European insurance company. In other terms, we are already seeing established TradFi players deciding to purchase a convertible note that pays 0% interest in times of high interest rates , just because it’s backed by a significant Bitcoin reserve. Consider also that these notes are convertible into MicroStrategy’s shares at a price of $672.40, which is almost 60% higher than what the stock is trading at the time of writing of this article. In my view, this indicates very strong interest for Bitcoin-linked financial instruments and the market is already discounting a Bitcoin bull run, as well as MicroStrategy trading at significantly higher levels than today. What’s a fair NAV premium? I expect volatility as the market figures it out I have already mentioned how I believe a NAV premium is justified for MicroStrategy. The problem is understanding what exactly is the level of premium that is justified. Looking at history, MicroStrategy traded at a higher premium than today in 2020 and 2021. This was at a time when the company just announced its BTC strategy, and a Bitcoin bull market was in full swing. MSTR; NAV Premium, 2020 to date (mstr-tracker.com) Ultimately, I do not have a precise estimate of what a “fair” NAV Premium looks like for MicroStrategy. Based on history and on the fact that convertible notes indicate a potential 60% upside from current levels, I am however confident there is still room to grow. That’s especially true considering how, even if the premium stays as is (around roughly 3X), a bull case for Bitcoin could still drive significant appreciation of MSTR shares. This is also the reason why I decided not to sell any of my 150 shares in MicroStrategy, but rather give faith to Saylor and see how his company will evolve together with Bitcoin. Nevertheless, I do expect significant volatility going further. As Saylor keeps up with ATM offerings and its first convertible notes come to fruition, the stock will inevitably trade at vastly different premiums in the foreseeable future. Eventually, if Bitcoin ever truly matures as a global reserve asset, so will MicroStrategy as a Bitcoin bank. Don’t buy MSTR stock unless you believe in Bitcoin (reiterating risk) I have already outlined the risks with Saylor’s strategy at the beginning of this article. However, I want to reiterate that the ultimate risk with entering MicroStrategy is that Bitcoin does not end up maturing as a global reserve asset and plummets to new lows. This might very well happen if - for example - the upcoming Trump administration ends up not having the US starting a Bitcoin reserve and pivoting away from Bitcoin completely. While I deem this risk unlikely at this point in time, it is still something that investors should carefully consider before evaluating starting a position in MicroStrategy. My “BUY” rating is only valid assuming investors are willing to bet on Bitcoin maturing as a global reserve asset. In my view, this means Bitcoin matching gold’s market capitalization in the next 3 to 7 years - something I have covered in my Bitcoin articles in the past. Readers who do not believe in Bitcoin as an asymmetric bet on it becoming a new, superior form of global reserve asset should steer clear from MicroStrategy, in my opinion. Conclusion MicroStrategy is entering uncharted territories, trying to evolve from a company simply holding Bitcoin in its coffers to a full “Bitcoin bank”, offering financial instruments linked to its BTC holdings as well as consultancy services related to adopting Bitcoin. The strong institutional demand for its recent convertible note issuance suggests, in my view, that Saylor is succeeding in this ambitious evolution. I find this strategy compelling and have no plans to sell my 150 shares of MicroStrategy. In fact, I may consider adding to my position as I continue to see significant upside potential. I believe that owning 1.5% of the total Bitcoin supply in 2024 provides MicroStrategy with a unique competitive advantage, justifying its NAV premium. However, my bullish thesis assumes that Bitcoin will mature into a global reserve asset as the safest and soundest form of money. For investors who do not share this belief, I recommend avoiding MicroStrategy. But if you agree with this outlook, my suggestion is a BUY at current levels.",BTC-USD|MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-25 13:30:00

After facing a challenging period of bearish pressure, this recovery has sparked curiosity among investors and traders alike. The key question is whether the bulls have what it takes to maintain this momentum and push TON higher. As Toncoin navigates a pivotal moment, this article aims to explore its breakout above the $6 level, delving into the forces behind the move and evaluating its potential to sustain its strength. By analyzing key technical indicators and market dynamics, we will provide insights into whether TON’s rally could evolve into a long-term bullish trend. Indicators To Consider If Toncoin Can Maintain Its Uptrend TON is demonstrating renewed positive strength, rebounding above the $6 mark and signaling a notable shift in market sentiment. Increased buying pressure has driven further price growth, positioning TON on a stronger footing. Significantly, the token has risen above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, a key indicator that reinforces the prevailing bullish trend. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the indicator has climbed to 60% after declining to 53%, signaling a resurgence in buying pressure and reflecting renewed upbeat momentum in the market. A break above the 60% level would indicate strong overbought conditions, suggesting robust demand and the possibility of more price gains. Related Reading: Toncoin Sharpe Ratio Rising, Is TON Readying For $8? Also, the daily chart reveals strong upward movement for Toncoin, marked by a strong rejection wick as it recovers above the $6 level. Trading above the crucial 100-day SMA reinforces the positive trend, indicating sustained strength. As TON continues to climb, it bolsters market confidence, setting the stage for growth with the $7.2 resistance level as the next key target to watch, which could determine whether the bullish move extends further. The daily chart’s RSI at 80% implies robust upside momentum since buyers are firmly in control and pushing Toncoin’s price higher. This surge follows a brief pullback to 65%, which acted as a cooling-off phase before renewed buying pressure kicked in. With the RSI positioned above the critical 50% level, TON’s rally may extend, triggering continued optimism in the market. Potential Challenges Ahead For TON’s Rally Although TON’s recent rally above $6 shows strong potential, several challenges could disrupt its positive movement. Toncoin is nearing overbought conditions, as reflected by its RSI, which may lead to resistance or a pullback. If this occurs, the asset could decline below $6, possibly heading toward the $4.6 support level and further downward.

36830214,4XVwNYR6b8sv,1732548512,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png,Tornado of Administrative Overreach: Challenging Sanctions of Crypto Mixing Services,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2024/11/25/tornado-of-administrative-overreach-challenging-sanctions-of-crypto-mixing-services,"Cryptocurrency transactions are often anonymous, but they’re not private. In fact, they’re quite public. Anyone with the right technical know-how can see every transaction ever made on most publicly accessible blockchains. This radical transparency and traceability has made it easier (contrary to popular belief) for law enforcement to track stolen and laundered cryptocurrency across various transactions. But it has also made it easier for criminal crypto actors to trace certain transactions, and — by collecting enough data points — recognize the real-world identity of crypto users who would otherwise remain anonymous. Dramatic stories abound about violent home invasions targeting those with large cryptocurrency holdings or hackers targeting those who donate to controversial causes. More mundanely, those who accept cryptocurrency as payment for goods or services might not want the person paying them to know their entire on-chain financial history with only a few clicks. Recognizing these realities, crypto-mixing services sprung to life. The technical details can differ dramatically, but essentially these services act as intermediaries, mixing together crypto transactions to make them more difficult, if not impossible, to track. Some mixing services actually take custody of the cryptocurrency, mix the funds together, and then distribute them to pre-determined places. Others rely instead on smart contracts (pre-written computer code) to do this for them. Created in 2019, popular crypto-mixing service Tornado Cash falls into this latter category. For the same reasons these services appeal to legitimate users (privacy and making transactions harder to track), they also appeal to criminals and hostile foreign state actors such as North Korea. Knowing this, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions that would prohibit “U.S. persons” from engaging in transactions with, or using, some of these mixing services, including Tornado Cash. But does OFAC have the authority to do this, particularly when it comes to smart-contract-based services such as Tornado Cash? In two similar lawsuits — one pending in the Fifth Circuit and one pending in the Eleventh Circuit — a series of plaintiffs are arguing that it does not, saying that OFAC’s decision involves “an unprecedented exercise of [its] authority.” To understand why, we need to back up and understand precisely what Congress has said. For starters, it makes sense that Americans wouldn’t want criminals or foreign adversaries using the U.S. financial system to accomplish their nefarious goals. So, Congress empowered the president to use a panoply of broad economic tools to stop them from doing so. The president in turn delegated his authority to impose and exercise these economic sanctions to the Secretary of the Treasury who in turn delegated much of the responsibility to OFAC for implementing them. As relevant here, Congress passed two laws that authorize the president and those to whom he has delegated authority, to act. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) empowers the chief executive (who has delegated his authority all the way down to OFAC) to block “any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest” when certain other specified conditions are met. Another act, the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act , allows the president to sanction the “property and interest in property” of “any person” who engaged in specified conduct. While national security concerns pervade the cases challenging OFAC’s actions, fundamentally the cases are about statutory interpretation. What do the terms “person,” “property,” and “interest in property” mean in plain English so that courts can decide whether Congress gave the President — and OFAC — the power to impose sanctions on Tornado Cash? In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Loper Bright decision, courts must decide for themselves what these terms mean without giving deference to the agency’s interpretation. Of course, the plaintiffs in these lawsuits argue that these aren’t obscure technical terms. And they argue that “text, precedent, and history” support their position that OFAC exceeded its authority in placing the Tornado Cash entity it designated on the sanctions list — largely because of how Tornado Cash operates and is structured. They argue, essentially, that OFAC didn’t properly identify any person — which can include an entity (though they argue there isn’t one in this case) — didn’t properly identify any property because the open-source immutable smart contracts (computer code) at issue here aren’t capable of being owned, and didn’t properly identify any interest in property, as traditionally understood to mean a “legal or equitable claim to or right in property.” In part, this stems from the fact that there’s confusion over what exactly constitutes “Tornado Cash.” While the government referred to an amalgamation of entities and individuals, the plaintiffs say that “[n]obody besides the government call these people ‘Tornado Cash’” and others instead typically use Tornado Cash to refer to the smart contracts underlying the mixing service. Essentially, there’s the (Ethereum) blockchain on which the smart contracts run , the developers who initially programmed the smart contracts, the smart contracts themselves, and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that has many members that vote and takes actions related to the smart contracts but that doesn’t own or control the smart contracts themselves since they are unchangeable open-source software code. The plaintiffs say that by allowing OFAC to break free from the traditional widely accepted understanding of “person,” “property,” and “interest in property,” OFAC’s “sanctions authority would be nearly limitless.” The plaintiffs say that if OFAC’s sanctions are allowed to stand, “every American citizen may be prohibited from executing those lines of code to make political donations, start business ventures, or develop new software features.” They also make clear that OFAC “cannot ban Americans from transacting only with fellow Americans or with their own property,” yet they say that’s exactly what has happened here. Both district courts considering these issues disagreed and found that OFAC had acted lawfully in imposing the sanctions. At a recent oral argument in the Fifth Circuit case, however, the appellate judges seemed skeptical . And the appellate judges in the Eleventh Circuit case asked tough questions too. Due process and First Amendment concerns have been brought up in varying degrees in both cases. There’s also questions about what role, if any, the rule of lenity and the Major Questions Doctrine should play. And, even more to the point, there’s questions with larger implications for the crypto community such as whether a smart contract (computer code) can be a unilateral contract and whether a DAO standing alone can be thought of as an unincorporated association or even a general partnership with liability for some or all of its members. With all of these lingering questions, one thing is clear: Congress should be the entity to respond to the changing circumstances brought about by new technology rather than an administrative agency such as OFAC. Current law shouldn’t be stretched in new and novel ways beyond its proper bounds to fit new circumstances. On that much, we should all agree. Otherwise, OFAC and other agencies will continue to assert even more constitutionally questionable authority.",Opinion,EN,0,0,REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-11-25 15:28:32

As the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin has consistently broken all-time highs over the past three weeks, with yesterday marking a milestone weekly close at $98,000—the highest in its history. Related Reading: XRP Analyst Sets $2 Target If It Holds Key Level – Can It Reach Multi-Year Highs? CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler shared an insightful analysis on X, emphasizing that Bitcoin’s recent attempt to dip below $95,000 met with significant resistance, reinforcing the strength of current support levels. According to Adler, the market is now poised for a critical test of the $100,000 mark, a barrier that could catalyze further bullish momentum or signal a short-term consolidation phase. With Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory showing no signs of slowing, traders and investors are closely watching for a breakout above $100,000. Such a move could ignite broader market optimism and drive renewed interest in altcoins, potentially shaping the next phase of the crypto market’s growth. However, failure to break above this key level might trigger a healthy correction, setting the stage for a more sustainable rally. Bitcoin Price Action Remains Strong Bitcoin’s price action has remained exceptionally bullish despite a recent retrace from $99,800 to $95,800—a minor dip of less than 4%. Investors widely see this pullback as a brief consolidation phase before a potential breakout above the pivotal $100,000 mark. The resilience demonstrated during this retrace has bolstered confidence among market participants, with many viewing it as a healthy pause in an ongoing uptrend. Renowned CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler weighed in on the recent market movements via X, sharing a technical analysis that reinforces Bitcoin’s robust bullish structure. Adler highlighted that pushing BTC to lower demand levels was unsuccessful, further solidifying current support zones. According to his insights, the stage is now set for Bitcoin to finally test the critical $100,000 area and gauge the market’s reaction at this psychological threshold. As BTC approaches this milestone, investor sentiment appears divided. Many traders view the $100,000 level as an ideal price to begin taking profits, citing historical patterns of pullbacks after significant round-number milestones.

Predictions for the rally’s peak range between $105,000 and $120,000, reflecting a broader belief in the cryptocurrency’s long-term potential. Whether Bitcoin consolidates or continues climbing, all eyes remain on its next moves. Bullish Weekly Close Could Send BTC Higher Bitcoin has achieved its highest weekly close in history, recording an impressive $98,000. This milestone is a technical achievement and a critical psychological boost for market participants. It signals a strong bullish environment that could soon propel Bitcoin above the coveted $100,000 mark. The $98,000 level now serves as a robust support zone, and maintaining this price—or at least staying above $95,000—in the coming days will be pivotal. A breakout above these levels could propel Bitcoin towards $100,000 with significant momentum. Such a move would solidify Bitcoin’s uptrend and attract further interest from retail and institutional investors.

Despite bullishness on Bitcoin, MicroStrategy's premium on Bitcoin holdings is unjustified as there are no holding benefits for BTC in a corporate context. MicroStrategy's core software business is losing money and the company has heavily increased its share count in the last several years. The company’s aggressive capital raises and debt issuance dilute shareholder value, further increasing the investment risk. Investors now pay a significant premium to MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings that is simply not warranted or justified. MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) is a business intelligence company that has focused on assembling the largest corporate position of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) in the world. While there were other companies that have invested money into Bitcoin -- such as Block ( SQ ) or Tesla ( TSLA ) -- MicroStrategy is by far the biggest owner of Bitcoin today with a stash of 279,420 Bitcoin (as of November 11, 2024). MicroStrategy’s market valuation has ballooned to ~$100B, mainly due to a steady stream of convertible notes offerings whose cash has been used for additional Bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy is using its core business intelligence operations as a way to leverage up its balance sheet which makes the company at this point a directional bet on the Bitcoin price. However, investors buying MSTR pay an excessive premium to the actual Bitcoin price which makes MicroStrategy not only overvalued, but also potentially set for a massive correction if the Bitcoin price consolidates. Data by YCharts Previous rating and why my previous investment thesis didn't work out I rated shares of MicroStrategy a sell in March of this year -- A Bad Deal For Investors -- due to concerns about the company’s aggressive pace of convertible notes offerings. However, I have been heavily bullish on the price of Bitcoin in the last several years, so much so that I made the digital currency my largest portfolio position. Shares of MicroStrategy have soared since my last coverage, chiefly because of a surging Bitcoin price. The implied premium per Bitcoin is excessive, however, and I see signs of a bubble in MicroStrategy’s share price. What has changed my rating to strong sell is that the Bitcoin price has risen sharply, but MicroStrategy's share price has generated even stronger returns which indicates that investors are overvaluing the company's Bitcoin holdings. Given this discrepancy in the rate of price appreciation between MSTR and BTC, buying MSTR today reflects even higher risks than when I covered MicroStrategy eight months ago. Favorable changes in the regulatory landscape have boosted crypto investor sentiment There are a number of reasons why my investment thesis didn't unfold as expected, the number one reason being that a sustained rally in Bitcoin prices has allowed MicroStrategy to continue (and accelerate) its bitcoin-for-debt strategy. Bitcoin, as well as the broader cryptocurrency market, have also greatly benefited from the presidential election win of Donald Trump who has promised to become the ""first crypto president"" and which has benefited sentiment in the cryptocurrency market greatly. Additionally, a pro-Bitcoin regulatory environment is beginning to take shape, which included the resignation of SEC chairman Gary Gensler... a figure that is not held in high regard by the crypto-community due his crackdown on the industry. If Donald Trump follows through with his announcement to make the U.S. into the crypto capital of the world, the Bitcoin price may continue to rise, potentially even dramatically which obviously would benefit MicroStrategy. Due to these factors, Bitcoin successively reached new highs, allowing MicroStrategy's Bitcoin gamble to continue. As you can see in the chart below, the differential between the Bitcoin price and the share price of MicroStrategy has greatly expanded lately... indicating that a more serious bubble is brewing here than even six months ago. Data by YCharts MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, investment strategy and capital raises MicroStrategy owned 252,220 Bitcoin as of October 29, 2024, which calculates to an average price of $39,266 per-Bitcoin. MicroStrategy has consistently acquired additional Bitcoin over time and has become the largest corporate owner of the digital currency in the world. In November, MicroStrategy raised another $2.1B through a capital offering in order to acquire another 27,200 BTC which brought the total Bitcoin holdings to 279,420 Bitcoin (at a new average price of $42,692 per Bitcoin. MicroStrategy With the Bitcoin price currently hovering just below $100,000, MicroStrategy’s valuation consists chiefly of unrealized capital gains. In fact, MicroStrategy’s unrealized Bitcoin investment gains current amount to ~$16B (based off of the data just provided). MicroStrategy, however, has widely outperformed the Bitcoin price in 2024, which raises questions about MSTR being in a bubble. MicroStrategy’s core software intelligence operations make up a small part of the company’s actual business (which now mainly consists of cryptocurrency investing). In the third-quarter, subscription billings amounted to $32.4M which showed an increase of 93% year-over-year, but in terms of total operating profit, MicroStrategy is not a very profitable company: it achieved non-GAAP operating income of only $0.9M in its core software business and revealed a total non-GAAP operating loss of $413.2M in the September quarter. MicroStrategy MicroStrategy has consistently lost money in its software operations this year: the company's total losses year-to-date, on a GAAP basis, amounted to $495.9M, yet the company has no problems issuing more convertible notes in order to buy more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy As part of MicroStrategy’s long-term capital allocation strategy, the company revealed in the third quarter that it was planning to raise a stunning $42B in capital (both equity and debt) in the next three years in order to further accumulate Bitcoin. Since the company currently has a market cap of $95B, MicroStrategy is poised to expand its market value, purely based off of capital raises, by 44% in the next three years. Since MicroStrategy has pursued aggressive actions in terms of raising capital in the last two years, this target of $42B could well be exceeded going forward. MicroStrategy Most recently (November 21, 2024), MicroStrategy raised another $3B in convertible senior notes due 2029, with a 0% interest rate, with an implied conversion rate of 1.4872 shares. This in turn implies an initial conversion price of approximately $672.40 per-share. Going forward, investors must expect more capital raises (both debt and equity) which is going to dilute shareholders. The amount of shares outstanding has increased by more than 500% in the last three years which poses significant dilution for investors. With the amount of shares surging recently, there is also a natural limit as to how much equity a company can sell going forward. Data by YCharts Sustained Bitcoin run could allow MSTR to continue to out-perform Since MicroStrategy's share price, given its large holding in Bitcoin, can now be expected to move in tandem with the Bitcoin price, the company's bitcoin-for-debt strategy could work in the short term, though I would still question the size of the premium investors are paying for shares of MicroStrategy (see next section). MicroStrategy is basically issuing 0% convertible debt, which means the company's bottom line is not affected by its debt raises. In the short term, this strategy could pay off, especially if the Bitcoin price continues to rise. The strategy may also work for MicroStrategy if the company decided to scale back its Bitcoin purchases (unlikely, in my opinion) or decided to monetize its Bitcoin stake... thereby turning unrealized profits into real ones. Since MicroStrategy seems to have taken a long view on owning Bitcoin, I don't expect the company to take a kind of trading approach to its Bitcoin holdings. If the Bitcoin price therefore continues to rally, MicroStrategy could be a big beneficiary and even overvalued shares can remain overvalued for a long time. Details about an emerging, pro-crypto regulatory landscape would likely also help MicroStrategy continue its strong run, although I would still not be comfortable paying MSTR's excessive, implied BTC premium. MicroStrategy is in a bubble and investors don't need to pay a premium for owning BTC Since MicroStrategy owns so many Bitcoins and since the business intelligence business now represents a relatively small part of the company’s valuation, MicroStrategy is now effectively a directional bet on the Bitcoin price. I believe the company is best valued by directly comparing its market valuation with the total value of the company's Bitcoin holdings. Cloud and software intelligence companies often trade at high revenue multipliers, largely because their top-line potential is attractive to investors. Platform businesses also offer investors significant scale benefits, leading to investors valuing their potential for super-charged growth. Microsoft ( MSFT ) or Salesforce ( CRM ), to use just two examples that own cloud-based software platforms, have current year price-to-revenue ratios of 12X and 10X. If we were to apply the average of 11X to MicroStrategy’s software business, which has ~$460M in expected FY 2024 revenue, we would arrive at a valuation of approximately $5.1B. The remaining ~$95B of MicroStrategy's market value therefore reflects the company’s holdings of a total 279,420 Bitcoins. The total implied value per Bitcoin is therefore ~$339,990 which compares to an actual Bitcoin price of $99,000 today. In other words, investors currently pay a massive 243% premium for MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, although they could simply buy Bitcoin themselves on any cryptocurrency platform of their choice. I don’t see a specific reason why owning Bitcoin through a corporation is in any way more useful or valuable for investors compared to owning Bitcoin outright, especially considering that investors buying Bitcoin directly don't have to pay a premium for BTC. The fact that MicroStrategy's share price performance (+568% YTD) has also fundamentally decoupled from the Bitcoin price performance (+134% YTD) is further evidence that shares of MicroStrategy are in a bubble. Risks with MicroStrategy There are a number of risks with MicroStrategy. The first one is that the company is not primarily a business intelligence company anymore, but rather a corporate vehicle to own Bitcoin. Given the high amount of Bitcoin the company owns on its balance sheet, MicroStrategy’s stock is more a proxy on the Bitcoin price and will likely be subjected to considerable volatility. Second, MicroStrategy is issuing so much debt and equity that investors are seeing some serious dilution which erodes their stakes in the company. Third, MicroStrategy's bitcoin gamble has a natural limit which occurs when investors are no longer willing to fund the company's operating losses or new debt offerings. Final thoughts While I am super-bullish on Bitcoin in the long term, there are no scale benefits of owning the digital currency through a corporation and therefore there is no need whatsoever for investors to pay a premium for a corporate-owned Bitcoin stash, certainly not one that is as high as 243%. Bitcoins are limited in supply, which may result in the price of the currency increasing going forward. Investors that want to buy Bitcoin in order to partake in the growth of the cryptocurrency can buy BTC directly. I believe MicroStrategy's aggressive bitcoin gamble has pushed shares into bubble territory and MSTR is highly vulnerable to even a slight pullback in the Bitcoin price.",MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-11-25 15:32:26

The surge of Bitcoin toward the $100,000 mark and the enthusiasm for meme currencies were the catalysts for this remarkable rally. Related Reading: XRP Below $1? Not Happening, Claims Millionaire Analyst Solana-based tokens have experienced substantial gains in the past month, with some exceeding a twofold increase in value. In the crypto space, Solana’s presence is becoming increasingly evident, as shown by its $121 billion total market capitalization. Solana’s Outstanding DEX Activity Daily trading volume over $6 billion has made Solana’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs) highly in demand. This reflects a 45% market share. The low transaction fees of Solana helped the platform to stand out as a significant alternative to Ethereum, Binance Coin (BNB), and Polygon. Investor optimism has been further bolstered by this level of activity, as analysts have identified the potential for ongoing expansion. Solana’s position in the DeFi sector has been further solidified by the network’s Total Value Locked (TVL) increasing to $9.35 billion, surpassing BNB Chain’s $6.21 billion. Additionally, Solana reached a historic $318 billion in transfer volume, setting a new record for the blockchain. Despite some signs of bot-driven activity inflating these figures, this high throughput demonstrates Solana’s capacity to handle massive transactions. On November 16th, Solana’s transfer volume hit an all-time high of $318 billion, whilst the number of active addresses spiked to over 22 million. However, mean and median transaction volumes dipped during the same period. This pattern of network activity inflation may be… pic.twitter.com/RJcE6Kjnkn — glassnode (@glassnode) November 19, 2024 Market Risks And Resistance Levels Solana’s recent performance has been noteworthy; however, analysts caution that the coin is approaching critical resistance lines. SOL is currently trading at $261, representing a 2.60% increase in the past 24 hours. A breakout point has been identified by certain experts above $226, with key resistance levels at $271 and $309. Solana has the potential to advance into new territory if it can sustain momentum and overcome these resistance levels. However, some are worried about the overbought conditions and have even speculated that consolidation could occur before SOL accomplishes its goal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is getting close to its upper limit, which may indicate a brief market correction is imminent.

The price is currently exhibiting a strong favorable momentum. The Fear & Greed Index currently stands at 80, which indicates strong investor confidence and heightened avarice. Though the overall mood is upbeat, investors need to keep in mind the risks and volatility of the market. It can be said that the growth tale of Solana is yet to be written fully, as seen by the recent trading volume and price action fluctuations. It will, however, need careful maneuvering as it continues its ascent.
