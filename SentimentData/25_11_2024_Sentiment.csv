The price has skyrocketed by an astonishing 225% in under three weeks, showing no signs of slowing down as momentum builds. This surge has positioned it as a top-performing altcoin, capturing the attention of analysts and traders alike. Related Reading: Avalanche Soars 20% In 24 Hours – Analyst Reveals Next Price Target CrediBull, a prominent analyst on X, has shared a detailed technical analysis highlighting XRP’s strong bullish structure. According to his insights, XRP is currently in a well-defined 5-wave impulsive move, a pattern often associated with sustained upward trends. If it continues to hold a critical support level, CrediBull predicts that the price could soar past $2 in the coming weeks, marking a significant milestone for the altcoin. As excitement grows, market participants are closely watching its performance. The ongoing rally suggests that XRP could hit new highs and pave the way for broader altcoin gains. Whether it can maintain its upward trajectory will depend on its ability to sustain key support levels and capitalize on the current bullish sentiment. For now, XRP remains a focal point in the market, with its next moves eagerly anticipated. The Bullish Rally Could Continue The recent bullish phase for XRP might be just the beginning as optimism continues to build among analysts who foresee a higher price in the months ahead. However, key price levels must be tested and maintained for XRP to sustain its momentum and advance to the next leg up. Prominent analyst CrediBull shared his insights on X, revealing that XRP is currently in a clear 5-wave impulsive move, a strong indicator of a bullish trend. According to his technical analysis, this pattern confirms that XRP’s absolute bottom was established at $0.49 earlier this year. He also emphasized the importance of the $1.05 level, the origin of the fifth subwave in this impulsive structure. CrediBull explained that if XRP falls below $1.05, it could signal the start of a larger Wave 2 correction, which would likely precede the next major upward impulse (Wave 3). However, if XRP holds firmly above $1.05, it would indicate that the fifth subwave is extending, potentially pushing the price to $2 or higher before any significant pullback occurs. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Buying Spree – Taker Buy Volume hits $1.683B In One Hour This analysis reinforces the view that XRP’s current rally may just be the start of a broader bullish trend. Investors are now watching closely to see if XRP can maintain key support levels and confirm its extended move upward. XRP Hits Multi-Year Highs: ATH Next? XRP is trading at $1.45, following an impressive rally that saw the price touch $1.63 yesterday, marking its highest level since May 2021. This milestone has sparked optimism among investors, positioning XRP for a potential run to new all-time highs in the coming months. The sustained upward momentum reflects growing confidence in the price’s bullish trajectory. However, the recent surge also brings the possibility of consolidation. The price might need to cool off and gather strength below the $1.63 mark before continuing its upward movement. Consolidation phases are a natural part of any significant rally and can help establish stronger support levels for future price action.

If the price holds above this mark, it will reinforce its bullish outlook and set the stage for a potential breakout and continuation of its upward trend in the weeks ahead. Analysts believe that maintaining this level would be a strong signal of market confidence, paving the way for XRP to build on its recent gains and target new milestones.

This remarkable price movement has garnered the attention of many analysts as investors continue to project the trajectory of the price. Related Reading: Chainlink Rockets 20%: Whale Activity Sparks Break From Bear Trend There are basically two ways the XRP price can go from here: either a continued move upwards or a notable correction. An in-between is a consolidation pattern. CrediBULL Crypto shared his insights on the potential paths the altcoin might take next. Using the Elliott Wave Theory, he highlighted two scenarios that could shape XRP’s near-term future. What’s The Next Path For XRP Price? According to CrediBULL Crypto, XRP’s recent rally exhibits a textbook example of a five-wave impulsive move, complete with clearly identifiable subwaves. This pattern confirms that the cryptocurrency has likely reached its absolute bottom at the November low of $0.49, which is a strong foundation for its current upward trend. The impulsive wave structure suggests that the crypto is at a pivotal juncture, and its future trajectory hinges on whether it sustains specific price levels. The first possibility centers on XRP failing to maintain its position above $1.05, which is the origin of the fifth subwave in the current impulsive structure. Should this level break, it would confirm that the XRP price is in a larger Wave 2 correction. According to the Elliot Waves Theory, Waves 2 and 4 are corrective waves, while Waves 1, 3, and 5 are the main bullish waves. before This correction, while bearish in the short term, would lay the groundwork for an even stronger Wave 3 rally in the future. CrediBULL Crypto predicts a very different outcome if the XRP price manages to hold above the $1.05 level. Holding above the $1.05 level would indicate that the fifth subwave is extending. In this case, the analyst predicted that the XRP price will surpass the $2 mark before experiencing any substantial pullback. The Road Ahead For XRP XRP, which had lingered below the $1 threshold for the past three years, has now firmly established itself above this pivotal mark. The recent XRP price surge to $1.6 suggests that the cryptocurrency is in a stronger position to target the $2 milestone rather than retreat into a significant correction. This bullish sentiment is bolstered by speculation around SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s anticipated resignation in January 2025.

Nonetheless, the next phase of its journey depends on key support and resistance levels. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at $1.46, having corrected by about 8.5% in the past 24 hours. However, the XRP price is still up by 175% in the past 30 days.

While the milestone signals remarkable strength, the price has yet to claim this key level, leaving investors in suspense. Market demand remains robust, fueling optimism that Bitcoin will soon break above the $100,000 threshold. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Buying Spree – Taker Buy Volume hits $1.683B In One Hour Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that Bitcoin’s Realized Profit has reached an all-time high of $443 million in daily gains. This highlights significant buying pressure in the market as traders and long-term holders lock in unprecedented profits. However, this record-breaking profit-taking is also sparking concerns among some investors. They fear the rally could stall, interpreting the surge in realized profits as a potential signal of a local top scenario. Despite these mixed signals, the overall market sentiment leans bullish. Bitcoin continues to hold above crucial support levels, suggesting that demand remains strong enough to drive the next leg up. With the cryptocurrency just shy of a monumental breakthrough, the coming hours and days will be critical in determining whether Bitcoin’s momentum can sustain a decisive move beyond $100,000 or if a temporary consolidation is on the horizon. Bitcoin Rally Could Continue Above $100K Bitcoin’s rally from $66,800 to $99,800 has marked a unique and unexpected bullish phase in 2024. As prices approach the elusive $100,000 milestone, many investors who doubted Bitcoin’s potential to hit this level this year are now revising their expectations. The surge has been driven by strong demand and market confidence, making a breakout above $100,000 seem inevitable. Should this occur, analysts widely anticipate a bullish continuation for Bitcoin, further solidifying its dominance in the crypto space.

Corrections during this phase are not only possible but could also be beneficial for market health. A pullback would provide an opportunity for consolidation, potentially giving altcoins the space to recover and initiate their own rallies. Critical insights from CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn shed light on the aggressive nature of this rally. Data shows Bitcoin’s Realized Profit recently hit an all-time high of $443 million daily, reflecting significant profit-taking activity. While this confirms robust buying pressure, it also raises concerns among cautious investors who interpret the spike in profits as a potential sign of a local top. Despite these concerns, there’s room for growth in Bitcoin’s trajectory. Maintaining support above $95,000 would sustain bullish momentum, but a healthy correction from current levels might also provide the fuel needed for a stronger push beyond $100,000 in the near future. BTC Testing Crucial Supply Bitcoin is currently holding strong above the $97,000 mark, maintaining bullish momentum as it eyes a push above the $100,000 milestone. This level represents a significant psychological and technical barrier, and market sentiment remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s potential to break it. With demand staying robust, many investors are preparing for an explosive surge that could define Bitcoin’s trajectory in the coming weeks. However, there are growing concerns about the possibility of Bitcoin setting a local top. If this scenario materializes, the price could enter a consolidation phase, potentially lasting several weeks as the market digests recent gains. Analysts suggest that holding above the $98,000 level in the next few days would keep bullish momentum intact and pave the way for a breakout above $100,000. Related Reading: Polkadot Holds Key Demand Level – DOT Could Hit $11 In Coming Weeks On the other hand, if Bitcoin fails to hold the $97,000 mark, it could signal the start of a healthy correction. In this case, the price may retrace to the $92,000 level, a key demand zone that would likely act as strong support. A pullback to this level would allow Bitcoin to regroup and build the foundation for another push higher, reinforcing its long-term bullish trend.

After concluding the prior week in a phase of consolidation, the meme cryptocurrency carried this trend into the early days of the new week. However, the Dogecoin price kicked off a new 25% rally on Friday, November 22, to create a new 2024 high. Related Reading: Top Analyst Claims XRP New ATH Is Just Around The Corner – Details Interestingly, this new rally saw the Dogecoin price break a bull flag to the upside. Such a rally has brought into focus the perspective of the Dogecoin price reaching a new all-time high before the end of the year. Dogecoin Price Rally Teases Breakout To $0.82 King of meme coins Dogecoin surged by about 25% as the week drew to a close, reaching an intraday high of $0.4759 on Saturday. This rally is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests that the Dogecoin price has finally resumed another leg up after a brief consolidation since it hit $0.43 earlier on November 14. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the significance of this rally in a post on X, drawing attention to Dogecoin’s decisive breakout above a bull flag pattern. According to Martinez, this technical breakout could set the stage for a much larger rally, with his projection targeting a bullish move toward $0.82. If achieved, this price level would represent an impressive increase of approximately 90% from the current Dogecoin price. #Dogecoin $DOGE is in the middle of a bullish breakout to $0.82! https://t.co/KjLJQ7ZkNm pic.twitter.com/Rib4XImoTT — Ali (@ali_charts) November 23, 2024 How Feasible Is The Dogecoin Rally To $0.82? Before the Dogecoin price can rally to the $0.82 price level, it would first need to surpass its long-standing all-time high of $0.7316, a milestone that has remained unbroken for over three years. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.4287, reflecting a slight pullback from its recent intraday peak of $0.4759. This retreat shows that the consolidation phase is not yet complete, as resistance appears to have formed near the $0.43 level and has created a sell wall that must be overcome. Breaking toward the all-time high would first require Dogecoin to achieve a decisive and sustained breach above the $0.43 threshold, which remains a critical level for regaining upward momentum. Interestingly, recent whale activity points to a potential upswing for the meme coin in in the coming week. On-chain data reveals that large holders, or “whales,” have been actively accumulating, purchasing over 550 million DOGE tokens worth an estimated $214.5 million. Related Reading: Chainlink Rockets 20%: Whale Activity Sparks Break From Bear Trend These whale addresses, which typically hold between 10 million and 100 million DOGE, are often seen as influential in shaping market trends.

ETH is rising and aiming for more gains above the $3,500 resistance. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $3,300 and $3,320 levels. The price is trading above $3,300 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,350 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $3,420 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Eyes More Gains Ethereum price remained supported above $3,120 and started a fresh increase like Bitcoin. ETH gained pace for a move above the $3,220 and $3,300 resistance levels. The bulls pumped the price above the $3,400 level. It gained over 10% and traded as high as $3,499. Recently, there was a downside correction below $3,400. The price dipped below $3,320 and tested $3,280. A low was formed at $3,288 and the price is now consolidating above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,499 swing high to the $3,288 low.

There is also a short-term bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,350 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $3,400 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,420 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,499 swing high to the $3,288 low. A clear move above the $3,420 resistance might send the price toward the $3,500 resistance. An upside break above the $3,500 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,600 resistance zone or even $3,620. Downsides Limited In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,350 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,320 level. The first major support sits near the $3,285 zone. A clear move below the $3,285 support might push the price toward $3,220. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,120 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,040.
