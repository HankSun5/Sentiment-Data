The price has recently encountered resistance at the crucial $69,000 level, which is expected to take time and significant liquidity to overcome. Key data from Binance reveals that more than half of futures traders have shorted BTC in the past few hours, creating a divisive environment for price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Upside Target Around $2,800 As Price Tests Key Resistance The futures market often serves as a barometer for momentum and liquidity, signaling potential shifts in Bitcoin’s price movement. As BTC consolidates just below the $69,000 resistance, maintaining support above $66,000, the coming days will be pivotal. Investors and analysts are closely watching to determine whether Bitcoin will break through to new all-time highs or if the accumulation period will continue. The outcome could set the tone for the next phase of the market. Bitcoin Future Traders Remain Bearish (For Now) Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase after weeks of impressive price appreciation. Despite this pause, analysts and investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory in the coming weeks, with many believing that BTC will begin a massive rally once it breaks its all-time highs. However, this breakout may take some time, as key data from Binance indicates bearish sentiment among futures traders. Top analyst and investor Ali Martinez shared the 4-hour long-short ratio on Binance, revealing that 53.71% of futures traders are shorting BTC. This bearish positioning suggests indecision in the market, as traders remain uncertain when Bitcoin will surpass the critical $69,000 level. The ongoing shorting trend could be a temporary barrier to Bitcoin’s momentum. However, the outlook could shift quickly, as spot investors might take advantage of the current dip and start buying Bitcoin. Increased spot buying could provide the liquidity needed to push BTC higher, reversing the bearish sentiment in the futures market. Related Reading: Solana Could ‘Go Parabolic’ Starting Today – Analyst Sets $370 Target If buying pressure intensifies, Bitcoin could soon challenge and break through the $69,000 resistance, potentially paving the way for a new all-time high. In the short term, investors are closely watching to see whether Bitcoin will consolidate further or gain enough momentum to continue its upward trend. BTC Testing Key Liquidity Levels Bitcoin is trading at $66,800 after facing a rejection from the $69,000 supply level. Despite the pullback, BTC remains strong, holding above the $66,000 mark. This price level is critical, as it will likely determine Bitcoin’s direction in the coming days. Should BTC fail to hold above $66,000, the price could seek liquidity at lower levels, with $64,000 as the next target. This level coincides with the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA), making it a key interest for buyers and sellers. On the other hand, if Bitcoin maintains its position above $66,000, the next likely move will be a renewed challenge of the $69,000 resistance or potentially a push toward $70,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Above $0.12 Level – Time For DOGE To Catch Up? The coming days will be crucial in deciding whether BTC will resume its upward momentum or face further consolidation around these key levels. Traders and investors are closely watching to see how Bitcoin reacts at the $66,000 support, which could set the stage for the next big move.

The recent breakout is seen as a bullish indicator for the top altcoin by analysts who have closely watched the Ethereum price action for the past few months. Ethereum Price Breaks Out Of Key Triangle Pattern A popular crypto analyst identified as “TheMoonCarl” on X (formerly Twitter) has disclosed that the Ethereum price has finally broken out from its symmetrical triangle pattern. Sharing a chart illustration of the distinctive technical pattern, the analyst revealed to his 1.3 million followers that the symmetrical triangle pattern had begun forming in August 2024, extending through September and October to potentially reach a peak around December. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Headed For $35,720? Why Muted Volume Could Trigger Major Crash However, before Ethereum could reach this designated endpoint, its price broke through the upper trendline of the triangle, indicating a potential bullish breakout to new highs. A symmetrical triangle is a key technical pattern that often indicates a period of consolidation followed by a breakout to the downside or upside. In Ethereum’s case, its price has been on a major consolidation trend, failing to experience similar price surges seen in Bitcoin and other altcoins. With the now broken triangle pattern, TheMoonCarl is setting new bullish price targets at around $3,400 for Ethereum. At the time of the symmetrical triangle breakout, Ethereum was trading at around $2,707. However, as of writing, the cryptocurrency has declined by 3.15%, pushing its current price to $2,629, according to CoinMarketCap. While the analyst is highly optimistic about his $3,400 Ethereum price projection, the cryptocurrency will still have to see a 29.91% increase to achieve this feat. TH Whales Are On The Move Amidst analysts’ bullish predictions for Ethereum and its recent breakout from a key symmetrical triangle pattern, reports have revealed that large-scale investors, typically referred to as “Whales” are now back in action. Whale Alert, a blockchain tracker and analytics system revealed a series of substantial whale transactions involving the Ethereum token. In the last 24 hours, an Ethereum whale had moved a whopping 12,590 ETH tokens, worth approximately $33.8 million from an unknown wallet to Coinbase. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts XRP Price Direction For This Week, What To Expect Additionally, in the past few hours, another Ethereum whale had transferred 8,452 ETH tokens valued at $22.4 million from an unknown wallet to Binance. Typically, when whales move coins from their private wallets to a centralized exchange, it often indicates that they may be selling off their tokens. While a full-blown sell-off could cast a shadow on Ethereum’s already slow price momentum, it appears that whales are not only moving ETH to exchanges but also potentially accumulating tokens. Whale Alert has reported that an anonymous whale recently moved 8,811 ETH from Binance to an unknown wallet. These multiple transactions create uncertainty about whether whales are selling more than they are buying. However, with Ethereum’s recent breakout from its symmetrical triangle pattern, bullish momentum could push prices higher, potentially encouraging more buying activity.

In a week, the meme coin has gone pretty high at a 30% increase which propelled its 24-hour trading volume to $1.9 billion with an upsurge of 35%. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Soars: Analyst Predicts 71% Rally In ‘Meme Super Cycle’ – Details Positive Sentiment And Indicators For DOGE Ascent According to market analysts, there are a number of indicators that show it is the right time to invest in DOGE. As observed by Digitalcoinprice, several technical signals have already turned green, indicating traders see brightness in the future of the token. The coin has risen by 37% in the last 30 days. The forecasts hint that the coin might go even higher. One of the strongest indications of the bull trend is the curve of the 50-day Simple Moving Average going upward, which may be a good period for buyers to get in on the action. However, the traders are holding back as the 200-day SMA is going down. As reported by some, DOGE may even go to $0.13 before the year ends. Nevertheless, on the bigger picture, there is still a consensus over the fact that it is still moving in a positive direction for the medium-term trends of the coin. Experts’ Predictions And Influences On Dogecoin’s Future Other high-level cryptocurrency traders also, such as DonAlt, believe that Dogecoin has the makings of being bullish and can potentially exceed the $1 mark. Analysts like Crow see the occasional triangular patterns of Dogecoin in its price chart that reflect phases of consolidation from 2014 to 2021 and can indicate a breakout.

Too bad, you don’t matter.$DOGE is going to $1. pic.twitter.com/mr5tVxFS2c — CROW (@TheCrowtrades) October 18, 2024 Crypto trader Kevin has highlighted a recent 3-day flip in Dogecoin. According to this technical indicator, the cryptocurrency is supposed to trend in the positive direction. In the past, such an indicator resulted in a huge price rally; DOGE had a 210% rally once such a signal appeared.

He also mentioned the upcoming “golden cross” on the weekly chart, which is a bullish signal for DOGE to continue upward. Meanwhile, it’s still Elon Musk that influences these price movements. A passing comment by the “US Department of Government Efficiency” (D.O.G.E) has caused a price surge. Adding to this complexity is his political involvement in recent news. Analysts feel Musk’s overall influence and association with pro-crypto US election candidates such as former US President Donald Trump will aid in an increase in value for DOGE.

After a brief period of downward pressure, the cryptocurrency is gaining traction once again, sparking renewed optimism among traders and investors. With positive momentum building, Cardano is showing signs of further upside movement, positioning it for continued gains toward the $0.4233 mark. The question now is whether bulls can sustain this surge and push ADA toward new highs. As the uptick progresses, this article aims to analyze ADA’s recent price movement, with a focus on how the bulls reversed the pullback and sparked a new rally. It will examine the current bullish path, evaluate key support and resistance levels, and explore the potential for sustained upward movement in the near term. Bullish Momentum Returns: How Cardano Reversed The Pullback On the 4-hour chart, Cardano has turned bullish, currently holding its position above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) printing multiple green candlesticks. As long as the price remains above this level, the bulls will likely maintain control, with the possibility of further gains if the upward trend persists. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a notable surge, rising to 63% after previously dipping to 53%. This increase reflects growing bullish momentum, suggesting that buying pressure is gaining strength in the market. While the current level is still below overbought territory, the upward shift in RSI signals increased demand and could pave the way for additional upside. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Eyes a Potential Recovery: Can It Bounce Back? Also, the daily chart shows that Cardano is actively trying to break above the 100-day SMA, a key resistance level. Successfully surpassing this SMA could indicate a stronger optimistic trend and boost investor confidence, attracting more buyers. If ADA clears this resistance, it may lead to a shift in market sentiment and more upward movement. The RSI on the daily chart is currently at 53%, indicating a bullish trend for ADA, as it is above the critical 50% threshold. Typically, this suggests that buying pressure is outpacing selling pressure, reflecting strong momentum and growing trader optimism about ADA’s price potential. Support And Resistance Levels To Watch In The Coming Days On the upside, the $0.4233 resistance level is critical, as a successful breakout above this point could signal a stronger uptrend and draw in more buying interest. Should ADA surpass $0.4233, the next significant resistance to monitor will be at $0.5229. Clearing this level further bolsters bullish pressure, potentially leading to even higher price targets as market sentiment shifts favorably. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Struggles: Can Bulls Prevent Further Losses? Meanwhile, on the downside, the first support level to monitor if the bulls are unable to maintain their momentum is $0.3389. A break below this level could result in additional losses, possibly driving the price toward the next support level at $0.2388, which may further extend to lower support zones if selling pressure continues.

ETH is now struggling to start a fresh increase above $2,650. Ethereum started a downside correction below the $2,650 support. The price is trading below $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $2,650 and $2,680 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Starts Consolidation Ethereum price started a downside correction from the $2,750 resistance like Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,700 and $2,650 support levels to enter a short-term bearish zone. The price traded as low as $2,605 and is currently consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,620 level. The price traded close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,757 swing high to the $2,605 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, the price is struggling to gain bullish momentum. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,700 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,757 swing high to the $2,605 low. A clear move above the $2,700 resistance might send the price toward the $2,750 resistance. An upside break above the $2,750 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,850 level or $2,880. More Downsides In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,650 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,600 level. The first major support sits near the $2,550 zone. A clear move below the $2,550 support might push the price toward $2,500. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,440 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,420. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.

The main resistance could be $172. A successful close above the $170 and $172 resistance levels could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is $180. Any more gains might send the price toward the $188 level. More Losses in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $170 resistance, it could start another decline.

With just 15 days until the election between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, options traders are increasingly optimistic about a new all-time high for Bitcoin, regardless of who wins the presidency. Traders Favor Call Options Ahead Of US Election According to a recent report from Bloomberg, options traders are placing significant bets that Bitcoin will reach a record high of $80,000 by the end of November. Notably, implied volatility for Bitcoin options, particularly those expiring around the election day, remains elevated. More traders are favoring call options, which give the buyer the right to buy BTC at new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Breakout Confirmed – Top Analyst Predicts $3,400 Target David Lawant, head of research at crypto prime broker FalconX, commented, “I believe the market consensus is that Bitcoin is likely to perform well regardless of the election outcome.” His analysis indicates that options activity surrounding the upcoming elections shows a distinct bias toward upside potential. The political landscape features contrasting views regarding the nascent cryptocurrency landscape. Trump, who has been a vocal advocate for digital assets over the past months, is viewed by many as a pro-crypto candidate, leading to the characterization of Bitcoin as a “Trump trade.” On the other hand, Harris has pledged to support a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies, a shift from the more stringent oversight seen during the Biden administration, characterized by continuous enforcement actions and lawsuits against key players of the sector. Per the report, in addition to political factors, traders are also considering non-political influences such as potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) and ongoing inflation concerns, which contribute to a generally optimistic sentiment. Data Reveals Strong Demand For $80,000 Bitcoin Calls Data from Deribit, a crypto options exchange, reveals a declining put-to-call ratio, indicating that more traders are buying call options than puts as the year draws to a close. Yev Feldman, co-founder of SwapGlobal, elaborated on the current trading patterns seen among investors, stating: “We are seeing traders buying calls near $68,000 and puts near $66,000, suggesting that many are positioning for a breakout in either direction.” Feldman further added that there’s limited reason to expect a downward collapse post-election, making upward movement seem more plausible for the leading crypto of the market. Related Reading: Solana Eyes New All-Time High Of $370 After Cup And Handle Breakout Open interest data also shows that call contracts set to expire on November 29 are heavily concentrated around the $80,000 mark, with the second most popular strike price at $70,000. For contracts expiring on December 27, interest is clustered around $100,000 and $80,000, while the most sought-after strike price for calls expiring on November 8 is $75,000. Interestingly, call options are commanding higher premiums than their put counterparts, according to the skew term structure, which reflects pricing dynamics between these options. “This indicates that investors are leveraging the options market more as a tool for capturing potential upside rather than as a hedge against downside risks,” Lawant explained. The researcher also pointed out that opinions on non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies remain divided, with less consensus on how these assets might perform under varying electoral scenarios. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $67,370.

A recent analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst, Wenry, sheds light on key trends within the XRP ecosystem, offering insights into the activity happening behind the scenes. The analyst particularly revealed where XRP transactions are used by category activity. Related Reading: XRP Price Stays Range-Bound: Will It Soon Make a Move? XRP Transactions: Decline in NFT Activity And Rise in DEX Volume According to Wenry, XRP’s daily transaction volume has been “competitive with major Layer 1 networks,” showing that XRP’s Ledger remains highly active, even though it is less known to retail investors than other blockchain networks. In his analysis posted on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, Wenry highlighted that between September 15 and October 15, 2023, the creation of new wallets on the XRP Ledger increased by 10.39%, reaching a total of 18,321 new accounts. However, total transactions on the network fell by 17.57% to 18.82 million, and payments dropped by 26.16% to 6.81 million. Despite these declines, the number of active wallets on XRPL increased by 14.19%, indicating sustained user engagement with the platform. These numbers suggest that while fewer transactions are being processed, the active user base continues to grow. Wenry’s analysis explored on-chain activity related to token trading and decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. While total trades on the XRP Ledger dropped by 6.83%, decentralized exchange volume increased by 17.64%, from $3.91 million to $4.60 million. This shift suggests that despite a slight decrease in overall trading, more activity occurred on decentralized platforms, demonstrating continued interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions on the XRP Ledger. Regarding non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the analysis showed a significant decline in NFT-related activities on the XRPL. NFTokenMint, which tracks new NFTs created on the network, dropped by 70.66%, from 65,021 to 19,076. Similarly, NFTokenAcceptOffer, which represents the acceptance of offers to buy NFTs, fell by 30.88%. Despite these declines, NFTokenCancelOffer, a metric that tracks canceled NFT transactions, slightly increased by 0.20%, indicating that while fewer NFTs were being minted or traded, some stability remained in the broader NFT ecosystem. AMM Liquidity and Increased Participation A key highlight of the analysis was the strong growth in Automated Market Maker (AMM) liquidity on the XRP Ledger. AMM-related metrics saw considerable increases, with AMMDeposit rising by 62.35%, AMMCreate increasing by 143.10%, and AMMWithdraw climbing by 42.97%. These increases reflect rising confidence in the liquidity pools on the XRPL, as more participants provide liquidity and create new pools. The surge in AMMCreate, which jumped from 58 to 141, suggests that more users are participating in liquidity provision on the network. Related Reading: XRP Network Activity Surges As Price Seeks To Break $0.55 Resistance However, one area of decline in AMM-related activity was the AMMBid, which dropped by 81.82%. Despite this decrease, the overall rise in liquidity deposits and the creation of new pools indicate that the XRP Ledger’s decentralized liquidity offerings remain strong. According to Wenry, these metrics highlight the growing trust in existing liquidity pools and the broader AMM ecosystem on the XRP Ledger.

35049334,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649339,1729684847,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/35049334.jpeg,"SUI To Face Another Pullback Following 5.3% Dip, Analysts Forecast 30% Correction",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/sui-to-face-another-pullback-following-5-3-dip-analysts-forecast-30-correction/,"SUI, the native token of the Sui Network, has seen a 13% pullback in the past seven days, halting its bullish rally. The cryptocurrency broke from a 1-month structure, fueling a bearish sentiment among market watchers, who foresee further downside for the token. Related Reading: Analyst Says Fantom (FTM) Downtrend Is Over, Is $1 The Next Stop? SUI Loses Key Support Zone SUI has been on a downtrend this week, losing the recently gained levels alongside most of the market. The cryptocurrency saw a 5.3% drop in the last 24 hours, which has worried some investors and crypto analysts. The token registered one of the best performances during Q3, leading the market as one of the few altcoins registering green numbers in most timeframes. SUI started the month by recording a 15% weekly surge, which fueled its rally toward its new all-time high (ATH). Additionally, the token jumped 25% from its monthly opening, shooting past the $2 barrier to reach a new ETH of $2.35. However, its bullish rally was overshadowed by insider selling allegations on October 13. Market expert LightCrypto alleged that SUI’s performance would be affected by insiders’ continuous selling, who had unloaded $400 million in SUI tokens. Following the allegations, the cryptocurrency faced a 15% daily correction but remained above the crucial $2 support level. Since then, the cryptocurrency has moved sideways, hovering between the $2-$2.15 price range until today. On Tuesday morning, SUI lost the $2 support, plunging 6.5% toward the $1.87 mark before recovering the $1.90 zone. The token’s dip represented a 13% decline from its price seven days ago and an 18.4% drop from its ATH. Is A 30% Pullback Looming? Following SUI’s recent price action, some crypto analysts revealed that another pullback seems to be looming. Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa weighed in on the markets’ current performance, as it slowed down after Bitcoin’s surge to $69,000 on Sunday. Sherpa considers the market’s rally momentarily paused, highlighting that “most alts are either pulling back or consolidating.” To him, the tokens that recorded a strong run in September, including Bittensor (TAO) and SUI, have “a bit more pullback to go” before resuming their rally. The analyst forecasted a 25% to 30% correction toward the $1.4 support zone or lower, detailing that there will probably be “plenty of bounces” along the way. Similarly, crypto investor Doji noted that the cryptocurrency broke “a massive 1-month stricture to the downside.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Activity Soars After 4-Month Slump—Would A 72% Rally Follow? The investor revealed that the token dropped below the lower trendline of a broadening wedge pattern on its 1-month chart. Doji suggested that SUI will retest the pattern before dropping lower toward the lower liquidity spot at $1.4. Nonetheless, he expects “to see the middle of the macro range at some point.” Despite the drop, SUI registers a 30.7% surge in the monthly timeframe, trading at $1.92 at the time of writing.

The analysis uses the Elliott Wave theory and dives into the historical and projected paths for XRP, marked by critical price levels and wave patterns. Final Crash Ahead For XRP Price? According to Dark Defender, XRP concluded its Wave 1 at a high of $0.9327 in mid July last year, significantly surpassing initial targets set when the price was just $0.28. “The ones know, know, that we targeted $0.89 and above when XRP was at $0.28. However, XRP closed the Wave 1 at $0.9327. So, we haven’t decided on that, right? We set the limits and targets and then see it. So, right after the initial target, XRP started consolidating,” Dark Defender commented. The chart analysis shows that after peaking, the price action found a firm base at $0.3917, a level that was closely approached with a touch at $0.3814, underscoring the accuracy of the predicted support levels based on the Elliott Wave theory. “We all knew that our lowest level was $0.3917, which we set. Later, XRP almost precisely touched $0.3814.We then underlined that this area was the lowest Fibonacci zone several times,” the analyst declared. Related Reading: XRP Network Activity Surges As Price Seeks To Break $0.55 Resistance Moving into more recent activity, Dark Defender has placed significant emphasis on the $0.6649 mark, describing it as an “extraordinary level” and “the strongest of all.” The analyst notes, “And as soon as we see XRP above $0.66, a day, a week, a month, then we will see tremendous moves.” However, the latest weekly Wave indicator provides a red signal, suggesting possible downward pressure. Dark Defender cautions investors, “at the moment, the weekly indicator gives us a red signal, which can be false but tells us that, guys, think about the support levels of $0.5286, $0.4850, and the lowest probability of $0.3917 as a double dip.” Although there is potential for a decline, the likelihood remains low, according to Dark Defender. “Can XRP touch here again!!! Oh God, yes but it is less likely.” Despite the short-term bearish signal, the monthly wave trend remains green, which typically overrides the weekly indicators, suggesting the red signal could be premature. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts XRP Price Direction For This Week, What To Expect “Although the weekly signals red now, the monthly wave trend is green which trumps the weekly. This made me think that the weekly is a fake signal at this stage,” the analyst explains, reinforcing the potential for continued bullish momentum in the longer term. Remarkably, the wave indicator also gave false signals on the weekly chart during the first wave, which underlines the long-term theory of Dark Defender. He still believes that XRP’s Wave 3 “possible targets are at $0.88, $5.85 and $18.22 respectively.” However, before the price can rally this high, there is one last major resistance. “As long as $0.48 and most importantly $0.3917 is maintained, XRP targets are clear, especially after $0.6649. Please do not underestimate and think what the hell is $0.66? It is the red thin line.We know, and see what is going on in the background. Less people remain on the ship, we see. But I trust myself, Ripple, and XRP. Exciting times are ahead of us,” he states. At press time, XRP traded at $0.5302.

Despite the dip, Solana has shown resilience, though the past few hours have been marked by short-term volatility with rapid price fluctuations. Investors are closely monitoring the next moves as Solana navigates this uncertain phase. Related Reading: 53% Of Binance Traders Are Shorting Bitcoin – What Does This Mean For Price Action? Top analyst Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis suggesting a potential surge for SOL in the coming days, with a target of $176. His analysis highlights key bullish patterns, but concerns about the broader market correction could drag Solana down if the correction intensifies. With the market in flux, the next few days will be crucial for SOL. Investors watch closely for signs of strength or weakness that could influence the price action. While optimism remains for a potential surge, caution is warranted as the market correction unfolds. Solana Testing Previous Supply As Demand Solana is currently at a critical level, holding strong above $160, a price that had previously acted as resistance since early August. SOL has broken above this level and found support, so it signals a potential shift in the monthly trend that has kept the price suppressed. Investors are watching closely to see if this shift will lead to continued bullish momentum. Crypto analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, offering insight into Solana’s short-term outlook. He revealed a 1-hour chart showing a symmetrical triangle, a bullish pattern often preceding strong price movements. The upper line of this triangle sits around $168, and Runefelt suggests that if SOL manages to break above this level, the next target would be $176. This would mark a significant push to new local highs, further solidifying Solana’s bullish trend. As Solana continues to hold above $160, the market is waiting. Investors are exercising patience and are aware that the next few hours and days could be pivotal for SOL’s price action. Related Reading: XRP Network Activity Surges As Price Seeks To Break $0.55 Resistance If the bullish pattern materializes and the price breaks out, it could lead to a significant rally. However, until that breakout occurs, traders are cautious, knowing that short-term volatility could still impact Solana’s performance. Technical Levels To Watch Solana is currently trading at $165 after facing a rejection from the $171 mark, a key resistance level that may hold the price down for a few days or weeks. Despite this setback, SOL has shown resilience, rebounding strongly from the daily 200 moving average (MA) at $150 and successfully breaking past the $160 resistance. This breakout is a significant development, signaling a potential upside once the broader market begins pushing up again. Holding above the $160 level is crucial for SOL, reflecting investor confidence and signals strength in the price action. Holding this support level would signal optimism about Solana’s ability to rally and reach new yearly highs in November. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Breakout Confirmed – Top Analyst Predicts $3,400 Target The coming days will determine whether SOL can keep bullish momentum or if a prolonged consolidation below $171 is in.
