The price has recently encountered resistance at the crucial $69,000 level, which is expected to take time and significant liquidity to overcome. Key data from Binance reveals that more than half of futures traders have shorted BTC in the past few hours, creating a divisive environment for price action. Related Reading: Ethereum Upside Target Around $2,800 As Price Tests Key Resistance The futures market often serves as a barometer for momentum and liquidity, signaling potential shifts in Bitcoin’s price movement. As BTC consolidates just below the $69,000 resistance, maintaining support above $66,000, the coming days will be pivotal. Investors and analysts are closely watching to determine whether Bitcoin will break through to new all-time highs or if the accumulation period will continue. The outcome could set the tone for the next phase of the market. Bitcoin Future Traders Remain Bearish (For Now) Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase after weeks of impressive price appreciation. Despite this pause, analysts and investors remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory in the coming weeks, with many believing that BTC will begin a massive rally once it breaks its all-time highs. However, this breakout may take some time, as key data from Binance indicates bearish sentiment among futures traders. Top analyst and investor Ali Martinez shared the 4-hour long-short ratio on Binance, revealing that 53.71% of futures traders are shorting BTC. This bearish positioning suggests indecision in the market, as traders remain uncertain when Bitcoin will surpass the critical $69,000 level. The ongoing shorting trend could be a temporary barrier to Bitcoin’s momentum. However, the outlook could shift quickly, as spot investors might take advantage of the current dip and start buying Bitcoin. Increased spot buying could provide the liquidity needed to push BTC higher, reversing the bearish sentiment in the futures market. Related Reading: Solana Could ‘Go Parabolic’ Starting Today – Analyst Sets $370 Target If buying pressure intensifies, Bitcoin could soon challenge and break through the $69,000 resistance, potentially paving the way for a new all-time high. In the short term, investors are closely watching to see whether Bitcoin will consolidate further or gain enough momentum to continue its upward trend. BTC Testing Key Liquidity Levels Bitcoin is trading at $66,800 after facing a rejection from the $69,000 supply level. Despite the pullback, BTC remains strong, holding above the $66,000 mark. This price level is critical, as it will likely determine Bitcoin’s direction in the coming days. Should BTC fail to hold above $66,000, the price could seek liquidity at lower levels, with $64,000 as the next target. This level coincides with the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA), making it a key interest for buyers and sellers. On the other hand, if Bitcoin maintains its position above $66,000, the next likely move will be a renewed challenge of the $69,000 resistance or potentially a push toward $70,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Above $0.12 Level – Time For DOGE To Catch Up? The coming days will be crucial in deciding whether BTC will resume its upward momentum or face further consolidation around these key levels. Traders and investors are closely watching to see how Bitcoin reacts at the $66,000 support, which could set the stage for the next big move.

The recent breakout is seen as a bullish indicator for the top altcoin by analysts who have closely watched the Ethereum price action for the past few months. Ethereum Price Breaks Out Of Key Triangle Pattern A popular crypto analyst identified as “TheMoonCarl” on X (formerly Twitter) has disclosed that the Ethereum price has finally broken out from its symmetrical triangle pattern. Sharing a chart illustration of the distinctive technical pattern, the analyst revealed to his 1.3 million followers that the symmetrical triangle pattern had begun forming in August 2024, extending through September and October to potentially reach a peak around December. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Headed For $35,720? Why Muted Volume Could Trigger Major Crash However, before Ethereum could reach this designated endpoint, its price broke through the upper trendline of the triangle, indicating a potential bullish breakout to new highs. A symmetrical triangle is a key technical pattern that often indicates a period of consolidation followed by a breakout to the downside or upside. In Ethereum’s case, its price has been on a major consolidation trend, failing to experience similar price surges seen in Bitcoin and other altcoins. With the now broken triangle pattern, TheMoonCarl is setting new bullish price targets at around $3,400 for Ethereum. At the time of the symmetrical triangle breakout, Ethereum was trading at around $2,707. However, as of writing, the cryptocurrency has declined by 3.15%, pushing its current price to $2,629, according to CoinMarketCap. While the analyst is highly optimistic about his $3,400 Ethereum price projection, the cryptocurrency will still have to see a 29.91% increase to achieve this feat. TH Whales Are On The Move Amidst analysts’ bullish predictions for Ethereum and its recent breakout from a key symmetrical triangle pattern, reports have revealed that large-scale investors, typically referred to as “Whales” are now back in action. Whale Alert, a blockchain tracker and analytics system revealed a series of substantial whale transactions involving the Ethereum token. In the last 24 hours, an Ethereum whale had moved a whopping 12,590 ETH tokens, worth approximately $33.8 million from an unknown wallet to Coinbase. Related Reading: Machine Learning Algorithm Predicts XRP Price Direction For This Week, What To Expect Additionally, in the past few hours, another Ethereum whale had transferred 8,452 ETH tokens valued at $22.4 million from an unknown wallet to Binance. Typically, when whales move coins from their private wallets to a centralized exchange, it often indicates that they may be selling off their tokens. While a full-blown sell-off could cast a shadow on Ethereum’s already slow price momentum, it appears that whales are not only moving ETH to exchanges but also potentially accumulating tokens. Whale Alert has reported that an anonymous whale recently moved 8,811 ETH from Binance to an unknown wallet. These multiple transactions create uncertainty about whether whales are selling more than they are buying. However, with Ethereum’s recent breakout from its symmetrical triangle pattern, bullish momentum could push prices higher, potentially encouraging more buying activity.

In a week, the meme coin has gone pretty high at a 30% increase which propelled its 24-hour trading volume to $1.9 billion with an upsurge of 35%. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Soars: Analyst Predicts 71% Rally In ‘Meme Super Cycle’ – Details Positive Sentiment And Indicators For DOGE Ascent According to market analysts, there are a number of indicators that show it is the right time to invest in DOGE. As observed by Digitalcoinprice, several technical signals have already turned green, indicating traders see brightness in the future of the token. The coin has risen by 37% in the last 30 days. The forecasts hint that the coin might go even higher. One of the strongest indications of the bull trend is the curve of the 50-day Simple Moving Average going upward, which may be a good period for buyers to get in on the action. However, the traders are holding back as the 200-day SMA is going down. As reported by some, DOGE may even go to $0.13 before the year ends. Nevertheless, on the bigger picture, there is still a consensus over the fact that it is still moving in a positive direction for the medium-term trends of the coin. Experts’ Predictions And Influences On Dogecoin’s Future Other high-level cryptocurrency traders also, such as DonAlt, believe that Dogecoin has the makings of being bullish and can potentially exceed the $1 mark. Analysts like Crow see the occasional triangular patterns of Dogecoin in its price chart that reflect phases of consolidation from 2014 to 2021 and can indicate a breakout.

According to this technical indicator, the cryptocurrency is supposed to trend in the positive direction. In the past, such an indicator resulted in a huge price rally; DOGE had a 210% rally once such a signal appeared.

He also mentioned the upcoming “golden cross” on the weekly chart, which is a bullish signal for DOGE to continue upward. Meanwhile, it’s still Elon Musk that influences these price movements. A passing comment by the “US Department of Government Efficiency” (D.O.G.E) has caused a price surge. Adding to this complexity is his political involvement in recent news. Analysts feel Musk’s overall influence and association with pro-crypto US election candidates such as former US President Donald Trump will aid in an increase in value for DOGE.

After a brief period of downward pressure, the cryptocurrency is gaining traction once again, sparking renewed optimism among traders and investors. With positive momentum building, Cardano is showing signs of further upside movement, positioning it for continued gains toward the $0.4233 mark. The question now is whether bulls can sustain this surge and push ADA toward new highs. As the uptick progresses, this article aims to analyze ADA’s recent price movement, with a focus on how the bulls reversed the pullback and sparked a new rally. It will examine the current bullish path, evaluate key support and resistance levels, and explore the potential for sustained upward movement in the near term. Bullish Momentum Returns: How Cardano Reversed The Pullback On the 4-hour chart, Cardano has turned bullish, currently holding its position above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) printing multiple green candlesticks. As long as the price remains above this level, the bulls will likely maintain control, with the possibility of further gains if the upward trend persists. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) reveals a notable surge, rising to 63% after previously dipping to 53%. This increase reflects growing bullish momentum, suggesting that buying pressure is gaining strength in the market. While the current level is still below overbought territory, the upward shift in RSI signals increased demand and could pave the way for additional upside. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Eyes a Potential Recovery: Can It Bounce Back? Also, the daily chart shows that Cardano is actively trying to break above the 100-day SMA, a key resistance level. Successfully surpassing this SMA could indicate a stronger optimistic trend and boost investor confidence, attracting more buyers. If ADA clears this resistance, it may lead to a shift in market sentiment and more upward movement. The RSI on the daily chart is currently at 53%, indicating a bullish trend for ADA, as it is above the critical 50% threshold. Typically, this suggests that buying pressure is outpacing selling pressure, reflecting strong momentum and growing trader optimism about ADA’s price potential. Support And Resistance Levels To Watch In The Coming Days On the upside, the $0.4233 resistance level is critical, as a successful breakout above this point could signal a stronger uptrend and draw in more buying interest. Should ADA surpass $0.4233, the next significant resistance to monitor will be at $0.5229. Clearing this level further bolsters bullish pressure, potentially leading to even higher price targets as market sentiment shifts favorably.

Meanwhile, on the downside, the first support level to monitor if the bulls are unable to maintain their momentum is $0.3389. A break below this level could result in additional losses, possibly driving the price toward the next support level at $0.2388, which may further extend to lower support zones if selling pressure continues.

ETH is now struggling to start a fresh increase above $2,650. Ethereum started a downside correction below the $2,650 support. The price is trading below $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $2,650 and $2,680 resistance levels. Ethereum Price Starts Consolidation Ethereum price started a downside correction from the $2,750 resistance like Bitcoin. ETH traded below the $2,700 and $2,650 support levels to enter a short-term bearish zone. The price traded as low as $2,605 and is currently consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $2,620 level. The price traded close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,757 swing high to the $2,605 low. Besides, there was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $2,620 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, the price is struggling to gain bullish momentum. Ethereum price is now trading below $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $2,700 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,757 swing high to the $2,605 low. A clear move above the $2,700 resistance might send the price toward the $2,750 resistance. An upside break above the $2,750 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,800 resistance zone in the near term. The next hurdle sits near the $2,850 level or $2,880. More Downsides In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,650 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,600 level. The first major support sits near the $2,550 zone. A clear move below the $2,550 support might push the price toward $2,500. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,440 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,420. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 zone.
