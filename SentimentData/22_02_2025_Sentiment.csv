The leading decentralized computing network transferred 4,850 ETH from one of its associated wallets to top liquid exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. Binance Receives 3,800 Ethereum Noteworthy, the developer team working on the project performed the transfers to the two exchanges in nine separate transactions. All the transactions occurred on February 20 between 15:46 (UTC) and 18:19 (UTC). ETH traded at $2,818.08 at press time after recording a 3.26% increase within the last 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap data. This price level sums the computing network’s Ethereum dumping to over $13.6 million. A major portion of the assets went to Richard Teng-led Binance . The digital asset service provider received up to 3,800 ETH, worth $10.7 million. Blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence claimed that the other 1,050 ETH, valued at approximately $2.9 million, was moved to a Coinbase wallet address. No ETH Dump, Just Solo Staking With CEX Five months ago, the Ethereum ICO participant moved 2,000 ETH to the American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase in five transactions. Markedly, this was the last time that the project made such a transfer to a centralized exchange. At the time, users were concerned about CEX’s involvement in a solo staking process. In response, Golem Network explained to these concerned users that it wasn’t dumping the second-largest cryptocurrency by market. Instead, it claimed that the transfers were all part of a staking test to ensure operational security. “Our objective was to create a controlled environment where we could monitor the impact of various factors on the staking-related processes,” the team wrote. Golem Network’s ETH Dump Could Trigger Selling Pressure Historically, such huge transfers of tokens to exchanges are usually followed by sales into USDT. At other times, they are swapped to other digital assets. Whatever the case, a sell-off of this size could trigger market pressure and a downtrend in the price of ETH. However, this is highly dependent on the speed of liquidation. Though yet to be confirmed, Ethereum allegedly saw a sharp plunge around the time of the nine transactions from Golem to Binance and Coinbase. From trading around $2,764 an hour before the transaction, the ETH price went down to $2,708 just a few minutes after the first set of funds moved to Binance. Judging by the current price of the altcoin, there has been some price recovery for Ethereum.

In stark contrast, Web3Bay harnesses blockchain technology to forge a decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace free from such constraints. This model abolishes the need for intermediaries, enabling direct interactions between buyers and sellers. This not only drastically cuts transaction fees—typically between 10% to 15% on conventional platforms—but also enhances profit margins for sellers and reduces costs for buyers. Moreover, the security and transparency of transactions are bolstered by smart contracts, eliminating fraud risks without the need for third-party verification. Momentum & Market Potential of Web3Bay’s Presale The Web3Bay 3BAY token presale is capturing significant investor interest, a testament to the growing confidence in decentralized commerce solutions. As of February, the initiative has garnered over $1.5 million and distributed nearly 370 million tokens over four stages. With the token currently priced at $0.004562625, its value is projected to climb through 28 stages to a potential launch price of $0.1959, promising a substantial return on investment of up to 6000% for early investors. The presale’s success is not isolated but reflects a broader shift towards blockchain integrations across sectors like finance, gaming, and now, e-commerce. Investors are drawn to Web3Bay’s potential for low-cost, autonomously governed, and user-directed trade, positioning it as a formidable alternative to established market leaders. Challenges & Forward-Looking Perspective for Decentralized E-Commerce Despite the allure of its zero-fee and self-governed model, Web3Bay confronts significant hurdles, including user and merchant onboarding, competition from entrenched players, and the need for seamless integration with existing cryptocurrency payment systems. The platform’s ability to attract a critical mass of users and provide a frictionless shopping experience will be crucial. Nevertheless, the increasing consumer and vendor disillusionment with traditional e-commerce behemoths, coupled with the rising demand for more equitable, blockchain-based systems, points to a promising trajectory for Web3Bay. Should it fulfill its strategic promises, Web3Bay is poised to challenge the dominance of Amazon and eBay, potentially revolutionizing online shopping with its blockchain-centric approach.

Each of these tokens has exhibited impressive momentum, attracting retail and institutional investors eager to capitalize on the next big breakout. While SUI and BONK have already made waves in the market, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is emerging as a powerful competitor, driven by AI integration and a record-breaking presale event. Analysts are weighing in on which project has the strongest fundamentals and growth potential to win this crypto race. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The AI Meme Coin Set To Win The Crypto Race To $5 As the 2025 crypto race continues, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to outshine SUI and BONK with its AI-powered ecosystem and rapid presale growth. While many meme coins rely on speculation, FloppyPepe (FPPE) combines artificial intelligence, passive income rewards, and a burn mechanism to create a high-value, long-term investment. Analysts predict that FloppyPepe (FPPE) will first surge past $5 and become the next breakout star in the crypto space. FloppyPepe (FPPE) allows traders to approach the volatile market with confidence with its AI-driven predictive model. Its AI video agent provides real-time market insights to help traders make well-informed decisions. Additionally, the upcoming AI text-to-image feature , set to launch on its Telegram community channel in just a week, enables users to monetize AI-generated content. FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers investors multiple ways to earn passive income and long-term rewards. Every transaction redistributes 3% back to token holders to guarantee steady earnings while promoting long-term investment. Its burn mechanism reduces supply to drive price appreciation. With stage-based pricing structures already delivering impressive returns, early adopters stand to gain massively as the token surges toward $5. Also, the network completed a smart audit with SolidProof to guarantee the platform’s freedom from scam attacks and bugs. As momentum builds ahead of the 2025 bull run, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining traction at an astonishing rate. This meme coin extends its impact beyond the crypto market by allocating some of its revenue to wildlife conservation efforts . At its current entry price of just $0.0000002 , investors have a rare opportunity to secure their positions before FloppyPepe (FPPE) outpaces SUI and BONK to hit the $5 milestone. As a forward-thinking project, FloppyPepe (FPPE) recorded over $900,000 inflow in its private round. This approach shows that this AI-powered memecoin is a forward-thinking crypto project. A popular YouTuber with over a million subscribers, NASS Crypto, has backed this AI meme coin to reach unprecedented heights in the coming years. These numbers show confidence in its formidable network and its potential charge. Sui (SUI) and Bonk (BONK) Gear Up For The Next Bull Run Analysts have begun to weigh in ahead of the next bull run. Having observed their performances, they are certain that FloppyPepe (FPPE) will outperform SUI and Bonk (BONK) . Despite trading above $3, the recent whale sell-off shows that investors have low confidence in SUI. Bonk (BONK), on the other hand, has received predictions for 20-25x growth in the next bull run. However, these gains pale in comparison to FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) astronomical ROIs. Why Expert Sentiments Favor FloppyPepe (FPPE) While SUI and BONK have shown strong market performances, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quickly proving to be the ultimate contender in the crypto race to $5. Unlike its rivals, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is backed by cutting-edge AI integration, a thriving community, and a presale event that has already shattered expectations. Its blend of advanced technology and meme culture gives it a competitive edge over SUI and BONK. With analysts predicting exponential growth and investors rushing to secure their positions early, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is emerging as the most promising token to reach the $5 milestone first. As excitement builds around its AI-driven ecosystem and market demand skyrockets, early adopters stand to reap the most rewards.

Cardano has long been viewed as one of the most promising blockchain projects, but its recent performance has sparked concern. With slow development progress and growing competition from newer, faster blockchains, traders are looking beyond Cardano for fresh opportunities. And one altcoin that’s capturing attention is PropiChain (PCHAIN) ; a project that combines blockchain with real-world applications and is showing strong bullish momentum. Cardano Price Struggles While Investors Look Elsewhere The Cardano price has been struggling to break out, frustrating investors who once believed in its potential to revolutionize blockchain technology. One of the main challenges has been the slow rollout of key updates, such as smart contract improvements and scalability solutions. While Cardano remains a technically advanced blockchain, its slower adoption compared to networks like Solana and Ethereum has dampened investor enthusiasm. So investors, who were once eager to support projects like Cardano, are being more cautious with their allocations. As the Cardano price action remains unpredictable, smart investors are exploring projects with clear utility and strong growth potential like PropiChain . Why PropiChain Is Attracting Attention While the Cardano price fluctuates, PropiChain is gaining momentum for all the right reasons. The project is built to solve real-world problems, particularly in real estate investment, which has traditionally been difficult for the average person to access. With PropiChain, investors can own a share of high-value properties without needing massive amounts of capital. For example, instead of requiring millions of dollars to buy a commercial property, investors can purchase fractional shares using blockchain-based tokens. This allows people to benefit from property appreciation and rental income, just like traditional real estate investors; but with significantly lower entry costs. Another key feature is AI-powered market insights, which help investors make better decisions. Instead of guessing which property or virtual asset will increase in value, PropiChain’s AI tools analyze market trends and provide recommendations based on data. This gives investors a competitive advantage, making it easier to identify high-growth opportunities before the broader market catches on. Additionally, the tokenization ensures that property ownership is secure and easily transferable. By converting real estate into blockchain-based tokens, transactions become seamless, cutting out intermediaries and unnecessary fees because these tokenized assets can be traded effortlessly. PropiChain also provides global accessibility, allowing anyone, anywhere, to invest in real estate markets that were previously out of reach. This means a person in Asia could invest in a high-growth real estate market in Europe, all through a decentralized and secure blockchain platform. On top of that, PropiChain is integrating with the metaverse, allowing users to buy and sell digital real estate. As virtual economies grow, owning property in the metaverse could be just as valuable as physical assets. PropiChain is positioning itself at the forefront of this shift, giving investors multiple avenues for growth. Market Validation and Security Assurance While many blockchain projects struggle to gain legitimacy, PropiChain is proving itself through security audits and market recognition. A third-party security audit confirmed that PropiChain’s smart contracts are robust and free of vulnerabilities. This gives investors confidence that their funds are protected from potential exploits; an important factor in today’s crypto space. Additionally, PropiChain has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a key milestone that enhances its credibility and visibility in the market. This listing signals to investors that PropiChain is a serious contender, drawing attention from both retail and institutional players. The Opportunity: How Much Can Investors Gain? With Cardano price failing to show clear bullish signals, many investors are shifting their focus to PropiChain , where momentum is building fast. The project is currently in stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at just $0.011 each. A $1,000 investment at the current price could yield $330,000 in 2025 if PropiChain sees the massive surge analysts are predicting. A Strategic Shift from Cardano to PropiChain While Cardano price remains uncertain, investors are pivoting toward projects with clearer upside potential. PropiChain is proving to be one of the most promising blockchain investments available today. With its low presale price of $0.011, early investors have a rare chance to position themselves for exponential returns before the market fully catches on. For those searching for the next big investment opportunity, PropiChain could be the altcoin that delivers life-changing gains in 2025.

The data reveals that Chainlink ( LINK ) rival Pyth Network ( PYTH ) and AI-based projects Kaito ( KAITO ) and Bittensor ( TAO ) all saw significant increases in price after gaining support from Coinbase. KAITO – an “InfoAI” protocol that aims to solve the problem of fragmentation within the digital assets industry – was recently listed by both Coinbase and the top global crypto exchange by volume Binance en route to nearly doubling up its price. Kaito is trading for $1.92 at time of writing, a staggering 99.89% rise during the last 24 hours. Moving on to the decentralized machine-learning network Bittensor, an open-source platform that allows investors to create and swap AI learning models, the data finds that TAO also saw a significant increase in price but eventually stabilized. TAO skyrocketed from a low of $445 to a peak of $484, a rise of 8.7%, in just a few hours after gaining support from Coinbase. The digital asset has since retraced and is moving for $453 at time of writing. Moving on to PYTH, the data shows the oracle provider also saw an increase in price after being listed followed by a subsequent retrace. On February 20th, PYTH jumped from a price of $0.235 to $0.263, a 12% increase. It was since retraced and is trading for $0.243 at time of writing.

Amid the uncertainty of whether GBP/USD and USD/CAD could continue to post gains, investors and other market participants have recognized a new meme coin named Panshibi (SHIBI). They believe SHIBI’s market potential of minting over 45,000% profits this year makes the token unavoidably the best crypto to buy. What’s the new meme coin about? And could Nasdaq hit $100? Let’s break it down. GBP/USD Outlook GBP/USD currency pair has experienced highs and lows, rising to 1.2670 in the early hours of Friday. The GBP/USD pair gained strength against the U.S. dollar, though, as it lost ground following dismal jobless claims data and mixed signals from the Federal Reserve (Fed). The GBP/USD currency pair posted gains on the back of improved market conditions after President Trump made remarks about potential breakthroughs in trade negotiations with China. However, caution remains in the air for the GBP/USD currency pair among traders due to the UK. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey’s warnings. With these conflicting signals, the GBP/USD pair may see further volatility in the next few weeks as traders watch both U.S. and U.K. economic reports closely to determine the pair’s direction. USD/CAD Might Stall Its Recovery The USD/CAD pair tanked in the Thursday North American session to 1.42. The decline of the USD/CAD pair was largely due to weakness in the U.S. currency, reflected in the decline of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) to 106.70. Despite an announcement from US President Donald Trump that new auto, chip, and pharmaceutical tariffs could become effective within the next month, the USD could not recover. However, the USD/CAD pair did rebound somewhat after dropping earlier in the week. The USD/CAD pair seems to have received a fresh supply for now, but this might stall its recovery. Trading activity around the USD/CAD is expected to slow down within the next 48 hours as the Bank of Canada (BoC) may rethink cutting rates. Could Nasdaq Hit $100? Nasdaq (NDAQ) is a global financial technology, trading, and market infrastructure provider. With a market cap of $47.6 billion. With a pegged price per stock of $82.54, the Nasdaq stock price has already risen above 5% this year. Market activity from TradingView suggests that Nasdaq is building upside momentum, and analysts are now more bullish on the stock than they were two months ago. Based on this growth potential, the possibility of Nasdaq hitting $100 per share might not be too far away. Panshibi: The Best Crypto to Buy Today Panshibi is undoubtedly one of the best crypto to buy on the market today. This meme coin has a Panda as its mascot, which was inspired by Asian culture. The community of this appealing project spans from memecoin enthusiasts, Panda lovers from every corner of the world, and, of course, Asians. The Panshibi community might be rapidly growing, but the Bamboo Valley could still accommodate even more. One aspect of Panshibi’s philosophy that investors cannot ignore is its fight against the corrupt financial higher-ups who have exploited hundreds of thousands of market participants. Panshibi keeps them safe in Bamboo Valley and gives them the power to revolt against corruption. Talk about Panshibi’s plan for Pandas. Many in the crypto community have embraced Panshibi’s interests, so it’s no surprise that the number of people in Bamboo Valley keeps increasing every day. Once the project is listed on the biggest exchanges, industry experts predict gains of up to 45,000%. SHIBI could possibly be the best crypto to buy today, selling at only $0.005 per token.

The stock is nearing a 14% weekly decline after dropping as much as 17%. On February 12, the trading platform reported exceptional fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue more than doubling. This contributed to a remarkable 162% surge in its stock price from November 5, following Trump’s election, through the end of last week. However, Citigroup Inc. and Wolfe Research LLC analysts noted that much of the company’s earnings growth potential was already reflected in the stock’s valuation. As a result, Wolfe’s Steven Chubak downgraded the stock from a buy rating to a hold-equivalent. “We had recommended to our clients that they take some chips off the table at a $60 to $70 share price,” Chubak said. The downgrade is a wake-up call to investors to be “more forensic” over the company’s potential. Crypto-fuelled growth after Trump’s elections spurred Robinhood stock Robinhood experienced serious growth, more than 700% in crypto revenue during the fourth quarter. During the same period, Bitcoin traded above $100,000 as people speculated that Trump would support digital assets. In an email, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev explained that the pullback stemmed from concerns that the “animal spirits” driving the company’s strong fourth-quarter performance may not persist. However, he remains optimistic about the stock, citing ongoing tailwinds from digital assets and a growing user base on the trading platform. Dolev isn’t the only one with a bullish outlook. Nearly three-quarters of analysts tracked by Bloomberg rate the stock as a buy, with an average 12-month price target of $70.76—slightly above its 2021 record high. Still, Chubak cautioned that a rebound is not assured, pointing to industry data that indicates a decline in crypto activity so far this quarter. Chubak said he would not be surprised if the stock continued declining in a weaker crypto activity environment. Robinhood plans to expand to Singapore According to a Bloomberg report, Robinhood plans to introduce cryptocurrency trading products in Singapore through its Bitstamp subsidiary. While the online brokerage has not yet announced a launch date, it aims to begin rolling out services by late 2025. The report cited an interview with Johann Kerbrat, Robinhood Crypto’s vice president and general manager, highlighting Bitstamp’s existing licenses in Singapore as a key factor in the acquisition. “Part of the reason why Bitstamp was attractive was because of their licenses with Singapore and its institutional business,” Kerbrat reportedly told Bloomberg. Robinhood agreed to acquire Bitstamp in June last year for $200 million, a move intended to expand its reach among institutional crypto investors in the US and internationally. Bloomberg also noted that Bitstamp received in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore last year. The acquisition is expected to close this year, pending regulatory approval.

The exchange confirmed that law enforcement is involved, and forensic teams are working to demix hacker addresses to limit how the funds can be sold. Bybit announced the development on X, saying : “We have reported the case to the appropriate authorities and we will send an update as soon as we have any further information. We have fortunately worked quickly and extensively with on-chain analytics providers to identify and demix the implicated addresses. These actions will mitigate and counter the ability of bad actors in disposing and dumping the ETH on the markets via legitimate marketplace narrowing the available outlets of disposal.” CEO responds as Bybit fights to control the fallout Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, responded within 30 minutes of the first reports of the hack. He confirmed that the 401,000 ETH had been drained from Bybit’s cold wallet but assured users that the exchange remained fully operational. Zhou followed up with a livestream on X and YouTube, where he answered questions in real time. “We are handling withdrawals as usual,” he told users. “Retail withdrawals are being prioritized, and we are processing thousands of requests per hour.” Bybit’s transparency helped keep panic under control, with Zhou assuring traders that Bybit’s reserves were 1:1 backed and that no funds were frozen. The hack targeted Bybit’s Gnosis Safe multisig wallets, which Zhou admitted was the point of failure. Bybit has since revoked compromised access, but the damage was already done. The hacker, later linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, executed the attack through exploited multisig processes. Bybit confirmed that 4,000 withdrawals were pending immediately after the breach, but Zhou said the exchange secured a bridge loan to maintain smooth operations. “We are processing every withdrawal request as fast as possible,” he said. “The attack was significant, but it does not impact Bybit’s financial health.” Bybit didn’t just report the hack—it took the fight straight to the hackers. Zhou made it clear that selling the stolen ETH would be extremely difficult, as Bybit had already flagged and blacklisted the wallets involved. On-chain analyst ZachXBT was the first to link the Bybit exploit to Lazarus Group, the North Korean hacking unit known for previous high-profile attacks. ZachXBT confirmed that Bybit’s case matched patterns seen in past Phemex and Atomic Wallet hacks. Bybit also turned to its partners, exchanges, and market makers like Binance and Bitget to prevent the stolen ETH from moving, so they’ve now blacklisted the wallets. Unlike when FTX needed help during its 2022 collapse, where crypto exchange distanced themselves, Bybit’s industry connections rallied around the exchange. Bybit took a direct approach with Lazarus , knowing they were likely watching the livestream, and Zhou repeatedly told them that moving the funds would be impossible and urged them to negotiate. Bybit then told its users that: “We want to assure our users and partners that all other Bybit cold wallets remain fully secure. All client funds are safe, and our operations continue as usual without any disruption. Transparency and security remain our top priorities, and we will provide updates asap.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|Bybit,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ETH|MARKET|ASIA|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-21 23:12:10

Senate Committee to Debate Crypto Rules, Bitcoin Reserve Proposal According to the announcement , Tim Scott, the Republican senator from South Carolina who is now leading the committee, has expressed strong support for the crypto sector, raising hopes for more constructive discussions this time. Industry representatives, including legal experts from Kraken and Lightspark, are expected to provide insights on what regulatory frameworks could foster innovation and economic growth in the space. The session will be held in a hybrid format and will feature testimony from key industry figures, including Lewis Cohen, partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP; Jonathan Jachym, Deputy General Counsel and Global Head of Policy & Government Relations at Kraken; and Jai Massari, Chief Legal Officer at Lightspark. Additional witnesses may be added to the panel ahead of the hearing. Discussions are expected to cover critical topics such as market structure, stablecoin regulations, and the potential creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Lawmakers are attempting to balance oversight and fostering innovation, positioning the U.S. as a leader in digital finance while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. This hearing comes at an important moment for the crypto industry, which has been grappling with increased regulatory scrutiny and calls for clearer compliance measures. The outcome could shape the direction of U.S. digital asset policy and influence its global standing in the crypto economy. The hearing will be webcast live, but access will only be available once proceedings begin.

U.S. Senate Banking Committee to Form Crypto Subcommittee According to FOX Business and Punchbowl News reports, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee is set to establish its first-ever crypto subcommittee , which Senator Cynthia Lummis is expected to lead. This comes a month after President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. NEW: The Senate Banking Committee, led by @SenatorTimScott , is set to establish its first ever subcommittee dedicated to #crypto .

This is similar to the House Financial Services Committee, which launched its own crypto subcommittee in 2023. Lummis, a vocal crypto advocate, recently backed Trump’s push for a strategic Bitcoin reserve . She also filed an amicus brief supporting Coinbase’s appeal against the SEC, arguing the regulator has overstepped its authority in crypto enforcement. She stated that decades-old securities laws don’t always apply to modern digital assets and called for a clear legislative framework. “With lawsuits relying on the SEC’s overreach, it is vital that the Second Circuit halts this encroachment on Congress’s lawmaking powers,” the brief stated . Trump has pledged to curb regulatory overreach and position the U.S. as a crypto hub. The Senate Banking Committee oversees financial agencies like the SEC, making this subcommittee a key step in shaping future crypto policy. Looking forward, this hearing could be the starting point for clearer crypto regulation in the U.S. and might lead to similar regulatory clarity provided by MiCA. The meeting includes many key leaders in the space, and by bringing their opinions together, the outcome could mark the beginning of the U.S.’s goal of being the crypto hub of the world.

With Qubetics presale soaring past $13.5 million, Litecoin witnessing a massive trading volume surge, and Terra Classic attempting a comeback, traders are on high alert. But with so many choices, which project stands out as the top contender? Qubetics is stealing the spotlight with its game-changing decentralized VPN, designed to enhance privacy and security across blockchain networks. Meanwhile, Litecoin is drawing attention with its $580 million in daily trading volume, proving that investors still see value in this long-standing altcoin. On the other hand, Terra Classic continues to battle for market relevance, trying to recover from its previous crashes. But with Qubetics offering a staggering ROI potential of up to 12,286.96%, could it be the ultimate pick for crypto investors in 2025? Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN is Changing the Game As Web3 adoption accelerates, privacy and security have become top concerns for businesses and individuals. Qubetics is addressing these issues head-on with its Decentralized VPN (dVPN), a groundbreaking blockchain-based solution that eliminates centralized control and censorship. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on a single provider, Qubetics’ dVPN leverages a decentralized network, allowing users to browse anonymously, secure their data, and bypass restrictions without relying on third parties. For businesses, this means enhanced protection for sensitive transactions, preventing unauthorized tracking and data leaks. Imagine an international company managing cross-border payments—Qubetics’ dVPN ensures end-to-end encryption, shielding financial data from malicious actors. Meanwhile, individuals can use the dVPN to safeguard their browsing activity from intrusive government surveillance and advertisers. What makes Qubetics even more appealing is its multi-chain compatibility, ensuring seamless integration with various blockchain ecosystems. Whether you’re a trader looking for extra security or a developer seeking privacy-focused infrastructure, Qubetics is proving why it’s among the best cryptos to buy today. Qubetics Presale Surge and Investor FOMO With each Qubetics presale stage lasting just seven days and a 10% price hike every Sunday at 12 AM, investors are rushing to secure TICS tokens before the next increase. The project’s massive $13.5 million presale tally proves that interest is skyrocketing, with over 20,800 token holders already onboard. Analysts have made bold predictions, with TICS expected to reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a 209.67% ROI. If the token hits $1 post-presale, early buyers could see a 1138.69% return, while a $5 valuation would bring in an eye-watering 6093.48% gain. But the real speculation is around the $10 and $15 price targets, which could translate into 12,286.96% and 18,480.45% ROIs, respectively. To put this into perspective, a $1,000 investment at today’s price of $0.08073 could be worth over $122,869 if TICS reaches $10. As FOMO builds and the Qubetics presale stage 22 nears its end, investors are scrambling to lock in their tokens before the next price jump. Litecoin’s Trading Volume Skyrockets to $580 Million While Qubetics is dominating the presale space, Litecoin is making waves in the trading markets, recently hitting $580 million in daily trading volume. Despite newer altcoins entering the scene, Litecoin remains a staple for traders who value its fast transactions and low fees. This surge in trading activity signals renewed interest in the coin, especially as Bitcoin’s halving event approaches, historically benefiting Litecoin due to its similar proof-of-work model. Investors are speculating that Litecoin’s next big breakout could be around the corner, fueled by increased adoption and institutional attention. With crypto whales accumulating large amounts of LTC, traders are keeping a close eye on whether this trading volume surge is an early signal of a major price rally. While Litecoin doesn’t offer the astronomical ROI potential of Qubetics, its established market presence and steady growth make it a strong choice for risk-averse investors. Terra Classic’s Fight for Market Relevance Terra Classic remains one of the most debated cryptocurrencies, with investors divided on whether it has long-term potential or if it’s just a fading memory of its past collapse. The project is making attempts to regain trust, with ongoing community-driven efforts to restore value to its ecosystem. Despite these efforts, skepticism remains high, especially after the LUNA crash left many investors burned. Unlike Qubetics and Litecoin, which are showing clear signs of adoption and utility, Terra Classic is still struggling to prove itself as a viable investment for the future. However, speculative traders continue to bet on its potential price rebounds, believing that a community-led revival could breathe new life into the project. But with the crypto space evolving rapidly, the real question is whether Terra Classic can keep up with competitors like Qubetics, which is building real-world solutions for Web3 adoption. Conclusion: Is Qubetics the Best Crypto to Buy Today? Qubetics is making an undeniable case as one of the best cryptos to buy today, thanks to its Decentralized VPN technology, strong presale momentum, and jaw-dropping ROI potential. With $13.5 million raised and price hikes happening every week, investors are racing to get in before the next surge. Litecoin is also holding its ground, with a $580 million trading volume boost signaling strong investor interest. Meanwhile, Terra Classic remains a wildcard, with speculation driving its price movements rather than fundamental growth. For those looking for the top crypto presale with real-world utility, massive upside potential, and a growing investor base, Qubetics presale is where the real action is happening. With analysts predicting 5x to 100x gains, now might be the time to join the Qubetics presale before the price jumps again.

40661768,https://coingape.com/?p=240326,1740179847,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Lazarus Group Responsible For Bybit’s $1.4 Billion Ethereum Hack: Report,https://coingape.com/lazarus-group-responsible-for-bybits-1-4-billion-ethereum-hack/,"The Lazarus Group, a hacking organization linked to North Korea, has been identified as behind the recent $1.4 billion Ethereum theft from cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. This revelation was made after blockchain investigator ZachXBT provided strong evidence linking the attack to them. Lazarus Group Implicated in the Bybit Hack It is worth mentioning that ZachXBT’s investigation found a series of test transactions and connected wallets that led directly to the Lazarus Group. The research as shared on X included detailed graphs and time-based analysis, which have been shared with Bybit to help their ongoing investigation. Meanwhile, Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain data platform, had offered a reward of 50,000 ARKM tokens for information that could identify the hackers. After reviewing ZachXBT’s findings, Arkham confirmed the link to the Lazarus Group. They stated that his report included a full breakdown of test transactions, connected wallets, and forensic graphs showing how the attack happened. The Bybit Exploit: How Bad is it? Notably, the Bybit hack occurred on Friday, with about 401,346 ETH (worth $1.4 billion) stolen from Bybit’s cold wallet. While cold wallets are supposed to be safe since they are not connected to the internet, the hackers still managed to get in. It shows how desperate the hackers are and how fragile the cryptocurrency market is. This also raises a question of how genuinely decentralized or safe the crypto market is. On the flip side, reports also show that the stolen funds were transferred to different wallets, and at least $200 million worth of staked Ether (stETH) has already been sold on decentralized exchanges. In response to the event that has brought mixed feelings among the Bybit community and the cryptocurrency community at large, CEO Ben Zhou took to his page on X and reassured users that the exchange is financially stable and will still function well irrespective of the severity of the attack. Again, he confirmed that all client assets are fully backed and that the exchange remains solvent despite the large loss. Unfortunately, this attack has also affected the broader digital asset market. Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropped sharply from 62.8 to 51.6 within hours. This shows a decrease in buying activity as the Lazarus Group carted away with the stolen ETH. While the RSI is still above the neutral 50 mark, this drop suggests investors are becoming more cautious. The Altcoin also decreased by 4% moments after the hack. The attack has also affected Bitcoin and other altcoins, with the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization reeling in loss. Lazarus Group and its Trend in Crypto In other news, the Lazarus Group has been responsible for some of the biggest hacks in crypto. There is speculation that the North Korean government is supporting the group. Put differently, they are a state tool that is used for stealing funds to bypass economic sanctions. In March 2022, they stole about $625 million from the Ronin Network, which is connected to the Axie Infinity game. A few months later, in June 2022, it was confirmed by the US. FBI that they had taken $100 million from Harmony’s Horizon bridge. More recently, in 2024, they stole over $300 million from Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange. Sadly, these attacks show that the Lazarus Group keeps changing its methods to exploit security gaps in cryptocurrency systems. The Bybit hack is another warning that stronger security measures are needed to protect digital assets. In January, the United States, Japan, and South Korea issued a joint statement to address threats from North Korean hackers. The joint statement noted that despite the threats, they are working to disrupt their potency.

Wrong trades, wild flips, and token launches — he’s turning madness into millions. Here’s how. Table of Contents The wrong LIBRA gamble Portnoy’s meme coin frenzy hits overdrive SEC heat or just noise? Hype over fundamentals, chaos over caution The wrong LIBRA gamble Dave Portnoy has never been one to shy away from the spotlight. From turning Barstool Sports into a media empire to his viral pizza reviews and high-stakes gambling, he has built a brand around being loud, unpredictable, and unapologetically himself. Lately, though, his name has been making the rounds for a different reason — crypto. And not just any crypto, but meme coins , accidental trades, and a deal he ultimately walked away from. One of the biggest stories revolves around Libra ( LIBRA ), a token that gained traction after Argentina’s President Javier Milei seemingly endorsed it. However, Portnoy’s involvement began with a different kind of LIBRA deal. Portnoy revealed that he had been paid roughly 6 million LIBRA tokens to promote the project, but after its founder, Hayden Davis , allegedly asked him to keep quiet about the arrangement, Portnoy decided to return the money. Then, in one of his most bizarre investment blunders, he mistakenly bought nearly $170,000 worth of the wrong LIBRA token — one with a completely different contract address than the high-profile version making headlines. Realizing his mistake, Portnoy took to X with his trademark mix of self-deprecation, writing, “Anybody wanna buy some fake Libra? Warning: This is a meme coin. I bought it by accident… It will be volatile. It will eventually go to zero.” Anybody wanna buy some fake Libra? Warning. This is a meme coin. I bought it by accident. It will be volatile. It will eventually go to zero. It may rip. It may tank. Don’t put on more than you can lose!!!

Milei himself is now facing accusations of financial misconduct, with some political opponents even calling for his impeachment. But that hasn’t slowed Portnoy down. If anything, it seems to have only fueled his full-throttle dive into meme coins. Let’s break down the swirling speculations and how the crypto community is reacting to the chaos. You might also like: LIBRA’s collapse becomes Solana’s biggest scandal since FTX: How Jupiter and Meteora left retail rekt Portnoy’s meme coin frenzy hits overdrive Just days after mistakenly buying the wrong Libra token and returning 6 million worth of the original LIBRA tokens, Portnoy decided to take matters into his own hands — launching his own tokens, flipping them within hours, and riding the wild volatility that defines the space. On Feb. 18, Portnoy introduced a new token called GREED through Pump.fun , a Solana ( SOL )-based platform designed to simplify meme coin creation. The branding was as on-the-nose as it gets, featuring an image of Michael Douglas’s Gordon Gekko from Wall Street, the character infamous for the line, “Greed is good.” pic.twitter.com/Iau8Xx0v9N — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 18, 2025 And for a brief moment, it was. The token skyrocketed, reaching a peak market cap of $41.5 million in just a few hours. As the excitement built, Portnoy embraced the moment, posting on X: “I kept hearing how meme coins were dead? I’m able to turn 2k into just about a million in 15 minutes if I felt like it. Doesn’t seem dead to me.” I kept hearing how meme coins were dead? I’m able to turn 2k into just about a million in 15 minutes if I felt like it. Doesn’t seem dead to me. Seems like as long as $greed exists and meme coins are legal there will be a big market for this shit. pic.twitter.com/VFo8AWNyei — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 18, 2025 But within a day, he moved all his GREED tokens into another project he had previously endorsed — JAILSTOOL — publicly declaring , “Just put all of #Greed into #jailstool which I’m never selling ‘cause I said I wouldn’t sell.” Then, on-chain data revealed that Portnoy had swapped every single GREED token he owned for JAILSTOOL tokens in a single transaction, worth an estimated $250,000 at the time, instantly crashing the price of GREED by 99%. His decision to cash out sparked backlash, with many accusing him of a “rug pull” — a term used when developers or influencers drain liquidity from a project, leaving late investors holding worthless tokens. 👀 Another wild and bloody scam story Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy ( @stoolpresidente ) just rugged his own audience. After losing $200K on fake LIBRA, he launched the GREED memecoin. It pumped to a $37M market cap, only for him to dump 35% of the supply, cashing out… pic.twitter.com/mQI9b59Du1 — Memento (@Memento_ai) February 19, 2025 Portnoy quickly defended himself, posting: “I have literally only said I will not sell 1 coin. That coin is #jailstool until it hits the 1 billion market cap.” He continued, claiming that he could have made over a million dollars from the sale but instead let GREED drop by 75% before exiting. Some facts not on this tweet. I warned people I could sell. I could have cashed out +1 million. I let it drop 75% before cashing out. Lots of people made money. I took the profits + poured it into #jailstool which I can’t touch. I didn’t make a dime on it. Some people won.… https://t.co/ARkeBKOVjX — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 19, 2025 “Lots of people made money. I took the profits + poured it into #jailstool, which I can’t touch. I didn’t make a dime on it. Some people won, some lost. Only the losers keep bitching.” Then, rather than retreating, Portnoy leaned into the controversy, boasting that he could create another token just as easily, and it would still “moon,” because, as he put it, “Nobody has principles. Just greed.” You can’t beat me. Not in this meme coin market. I could launch Greed 2 collectible coin right now and it would moon. Nobody has principles. Just greed. https://t.co/rmPxbMjQhM — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 18, 2025 Hours later, he followed through, launching GREED2 and warning investors not to put in more than they could afford to lose. *update. Just launched Greed 2. Don’t invest in this collectible coin with more than you can afford to lose. It’ll be volatile. I will not sell 1 penny till at least midnight est or maybe never. Be careful. GoL6RVGQFzTD7MdoNEHUQmNp6SgXBn6f9khxAW5Bpump https://t.co/kFuUCIgvYf — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 19, 2025 Unlike its predecessor, GREED2 struggled to gain traction. It briefly climbed to a $7 million market cap before plummeting 90% over the next five hours. On Feb. 20, he was back on X again, sharing screenshots of his Phantom Wallet balances, revealing staggering gains — 1,923% on GREED, 344% on GREED2, and various smaller profits across other meme coins. Critics condemned Portnoy’s actions as reckless, pointing to the damage they cause to retail investors who jump in late. As for Portnoy, he doesn’t seem concerned. If anything, he appears to be fully embracing the chaos. SEC heat or just noise? As Portnoy’s meme coin antics escalate, social media has become a hotbed for speculation, accusations, and unverified rumours. One of the biggest claims making the rounds is that Portnoy may be facing legal trouble. “Rumors emerging that court documents reveal Dave Portnoy is facing multiple SEC securities violations charges,” posted one user. 🚨BREAKING: Rumors emerging that court documents reveal Dave Portnoy is facing multiple SEC securities violations charges. Authorities allege serious financial misconduct, with further details expected as the case unfolds. pic.twitter.com/MOo6RMqRVs — jdub 🇮🇱 (@jdubz069) February 20, 2025 However, no actual filings or statements from regulators have emerged to confirm this. Adding to the speculation, the SEC recently unveiled the creation of a cybercrime unit aimed at tackling fraud in the crypto industry. The timing of this move has led some to suggest a direct link between Portnoy’s recent token flips and the regulatory shift. “Portnoy rugs five tokens live on a stream, two days later the SEC launches a cybercrime unit,” wrote one user. dave portnoy rugs five tokens live on a stream two days later the sec launches a cyber crime unit to target fraud in crypto enjoy crime season, retards — Zack Voell (@zackvoell) February 20, 2025 Another post adopted a more sarcastic tone: “Portnoy scammed so hard the SEC had to launch a new cyber division.” 🚨NEW: Dave Portnoy scammed so hard the SEC has to launch a new Cyber technology division💀 pic.twitter.com/gMMbJRT42f — Autism Capital 🧩 (@AutismCapital) February 20, 2025 Rather than addressing the allegations head-on, Portnoy opted to mock the situation, flipping the SEC’s announcement to jab at his critics. “Love it! So many scammers and liars out there. Let’s clean this space up! Take out the trash,” he posted, before taking a swipe at those calling him a fraud. “Can we arrest the crybabies who are told meme coins are a risk and then cry foul too?” Love it! So manny scammers and liars out there. Let’s clean this space up! Take out the trash. Together we can win. This is when it pays to be the cleanest man in crypto Ps – can we arrest the crybabies who are told not to risk more than they can lose and that Memecoins… https://t.co/JD7Nk6YfPo — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 20, 2025 So far, it’s all just noise—no official actions or formal accusations. But the growing uproar reveals how deeply his actions have divided the crypto community. Still, Portnoy isn’t backing down. If anything, he’s doubling down. Who am I to deny the will of the people. The heartbeat of trenches is Greed https://t.co/QaqknWr9vt — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 20, 2025 Hype over fundamentals, chaos over caution Portnoy’s foray into the meme coin market is quickly shaping up to be a masterclass in how hype, rather than fundamentals, can drive value in crypto. While most traders focus on returns, Portnoy seems more intrigued by the mechanics of attention. He leverages his massive following to trigger market movements, all while watching the real-time ripple effect unfold. “He’s discovered an infinite money glitch — he tweets a ticker to his 3.5M followers, and it instantly moons, then he does it again,” said Punk, the pseudonymous CCO at Memecoin ( MEME ), capturing how Portnoy’s reach alone is enough to spark immediate volatility. But it’s not just about the money. “He’s amused by the hamster wheel of traders blindly following his moves, so he keeps spinning it.” Portnoy creates a token, watches it surge, then either exits or moves on to the next. Traders know the risk but dive in anyway — not because they believe in the token, but because the activity itself is the draw. This phenomenon is far from isolated. Platforms like Pump.fun have made meme coin creation almost effortless. Since launching in January 2024, over 7.8 million tokens have been created on the platform as of Feb. 21, most offering little beyond speculative thrills. As a result, the market has become a revolving door of viral trends, where the next big token isn’t determined by innovation, but by how quickly it can spread. “Honestly, trust in crypto isn’t exactly at an all-time high,” said Tobin Kuo, CEO of Seraph Studios, in an interview with crypto.news. “At this point, even veterans are joking that the space is turning into the world’s largest casino.” That could explain why Portnoy has gone beyond just trading — he’s creating. As Punk puts it, “Every legal expert warning him only pushes him to do more. The backlash fuels his next move.” Whether this model can last or eventually collapse under its own weight remains to be seen, but as long as the hype keeps driving the market, the cycle isn’t stopping.",Feature|Influencers|Meme Coin|rug pull|SEC|United States,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|SOL,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-21 23:50:00

Notably, the pro-crypto stance of the Mark Uyeda-led SEC has ignited a possibility of XRP benefitting uniquely. Per the current trend, investors wonder if the coin could hit a $300 price target in the long term if the US SEC drops the XRP lawsuit. Is Ripple versus US SEC Lawsuit Suppressing XRP Price? In a recent update, Coinbase revealed that the SEC staff has agreed to drop its lawsuit , pending potential approval by the agency’s commissioners in the coming week. By a large margin, the Coinbase versus SEC lawsuit is considered the second biggest after Ripple Labs. Though similar, the Ripple lawsuit has advanced much more, with the end close as predicted. Gary Gensler fanned the lawsuit, alleging that XRP is a security when sold to the public, significantly impacting the price. Like Coinbase, there is speculation that the US SEC will dismiss its Ripple lawsuit appeal. If this happens, the price of XRP is expected to rise dramatically. Is XRP Price to $300 Feasible? In recent times, analysts have issued massive projections regarding the XRP price. As reported earlier by CoinGape, market analyst XRP Captain predicted that the XRP price could rally to $250 between now and 2026. While analysts justify this projection based on the current trend within the Ripple ecosystem, the economics presents a different picture. With XRP having more than 57.89 billion circulating supply per CoinMarketCap data , a $300 target will give it a valuation of $17.367 trillion for the coin. This fund is way bigger than the crypto industry, which is only worth $3.17 trillion, with Bitcoin dominating. However, this does not discount the likelihood of a massive rally if the lawsuit ends. The XRP ETF Advantage Meanwhile, the Ripple ecosystem has continued to expand at a unique pace. More than four asset managers are seeking approval to offer XRP ETF products to institutional investors. Canary Capital, Bitwise, and CoinShares are some of the firms pushing for this new product. With a 65% odds of approval , the community is somewhat pricing in this product already. With the likelihood of a new capital influx, the expectation is that the XRP price will benefit immensely in the long term.

Dogecoin Whales Liquidate 100 Million Coins,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/panic-or-opportunity-dogecoin-whales-liquidate-100-million-coins/,"The crypto market is paying attention to a massive Dogecoin (DOGE) transaction. A whale transferred 100 million DOGE, or about $25.42 million, to Binance. The move has raised questions about whether a sell-off is about to happen or if this is just another typical shift in holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For ‘Take Off’—Analyst Reveals Key Signals Whale Activity Sparks Concerns When a major cryptocurrency holder moves a sizable amount of their holdings to an exchange, it usually means they want to sell. The price of DOGE may drop as a result, which would cause smaller investors to react. However, cryptocurrency expert Ali Martinez noted a decline in whale activity overall, suggesting that major investors are not acting aggressively for the time being. Whale activity on the #Dogecoin $DOGE network has declined by nearly 88% since mid-November! pic.twitter.com/6X4CIH3mf8 — Ali (@ali_charts) February 17, 2025 DOGE’s present market performance points to vagueness. As of the time of writing, the price is $0.255622; an intraday high is $0.257605 and a low is $0.250725. These swings imply a rather limited trading range; but, if more significant holders decide to sell their shares, volatility might increase. Market Sentiment Remains Divided According to certain traders, the whale transfer is a bearish signal, while others believe that its influence may be negligible unless an influx of additional coins occurs. Dogecoin has a history of reacting sharply to whale movements; however, the aggregate selling pressure appears to be subdued this time. The ongoing discussion regarding a potential DOGE exchange-traded fund (ETF) is another significant factor that affects sentiment. If an ETF acquires momentum, it may attract institutional investors, potentially counteracting any selling pressure from whales. Nevertheless, the market is currently in a state of supposition, as no official approvals or timelines have been announced. The Road Ahead For Dogecoin Despite the whale move, the price of DOGE continues to remain steady, but if market sentiment shifts, there could be a further drop. Further dumping may occur if the price of DOGE drops below $0.25, which might further lower the price. On the other hand, strong purchasing activity may act as a barrier to further decrease.

With meme coins showing signs of another pullback, experienced investors are looking for a more resilient alternative that can weather crashes and still deliver massive returns. That’s why many are shifting to this AI altcoin that doesn’t rely on hype alone but offers real utility, strong fundamentals, and cutting-edge technology that ensures long-term demand. This makes it the perfect hedge against market uncertainty. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Face Growing Uncertainty Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have dominated the meme coin market, but their explosive growth may be fading. Over the past few months, SHIB has struggled to break out of its downward trend, slipping from highs of $0.000033 to nearly half that value. Key support levels have failed, raising concerns about further downside risks. Dogecoin isn’t faring much better. While Elon Musk’s influence has occasionally pumped its price, long-term investors see a pattern; sharp rallies followed by deep corrections. Even with Dogecoin’s potential integration into X, the lack of fundamental utility makes it a highly speculative asset. On-chain data reveals that major SHIB and DOGE holders are shifting capital into new projects with stronger fundamentals, and RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as a top choice. Why RCO Finance Is Gaining Momentum RCO Finance is a fully operational AI-powered trading platform that helps users make smarter investment decisions. At the heart of RCOF is its Robo Advisor, an advanced AI system that scans global financial markets, analyzes real-time data from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, and provides actionable insights for traders. This AI tool can detect emerging trends before they go mainstream, allowing investors to capitalize on early-stage opportunities. Take recent examples like TRUMP and MELANIA tokens. These low-cap coins surged 100x in just days, but most traders missed out. RCOF’s AI is designed to spot these breakouts before they happen, giving users a major advantage. Beyond maximizing gains, the AI also protects investors from market downturns. It can identify weakening trends, recommend exit points, and even adjust portfolio allocations to optimize risk exposure. This strategic approach removes emotional decision-making and ensures smarter, data-driven trading. But RCOF goes beyond crypto investing. The platform offers access to 120,000+ investment options, including stocks, ETFs, bonds, and even tokenized real estate, all within a non-KYC environment. Investors can diversify seamlessly without lengthy verification processes, while RCOF’s crypto debit card allows instant spending without manual conversions. Early Investors Are Rushing Into RCOF’s Presale Shiba Inu and Dogecoin investors are moving into RCOF not just for its AI advantages but also for its lucrative presale opportunity. Unlike most early crypto projects, RCOF already has a live Beta Platform with 10,000+ active users testing its AI-driven tools. The Robo Advisor’s monitoring capabilities will continue improving, enhancing its predictive accuracy over time. This means early adopters are getting in before the AI reaches full optimization, setting them up for long-term gains. Currently, RCOF is in Presale Stage 5 , selling at $0.10 per token. The next stage will push the price up to $0.13, giving today’s buyers an instant 30% profit before the token even lists on major exchanges. A $1,000 investment today would become $1,300 in just weeks once the next presale stage begins. After exchange listings, analysts predict 10,000x growth, meaning an early $500 investment could potentially turn into $500,000. Additionally, RCOF has passed a security audit by SolidProof , confirming its smart contracts are safe and free from vulnerabilities. Unlike meme coins that fluctuate based on trends, RCOF is a fundamentally sound investment backed by real demand. Meme Coins Had Their Run; RCOF Is the Next Big Opportunity Shiba Inu and Dogecoin still have loyal communities, but their long-term upside is limited. Even if Dogecoin somehow climbs to $1, that’s only a 5x return; far below what RCOF is expected to achieve. Meanwhile, RCOF is just getting started, meaning the potential for rapid growth and mainstream adoption is far higher. With AI-driven trading tools, a working Beta platform, strong investor demand, and built-in real-world utility, RCO Finance is positioned for explosive gains in 2025. The opportunity won’t last forever. Investors who got in during earlier RCOF stages have already secured major profits, and with the presale moving quickly, prices will only go up from here. Waiting too long could mean missing out on one of the most profitable crypto launches of the year.

This achievement, coupled with a current price of $0.0248 per coin in Batch 27 and a 2380% surge, positions BlockDAG as a project to watch. But beyond the impressive numbers, BlockDAG’s commitment to education, exemplified by the appointment of Marcus Xavier as Head of Learning, suggests a long-term vision for the project. This article will explore the significance of structured blockchain education, particularly in the context of BlockDAG’s rapid growth and the broader adoption of decentralized technologies. The importance of understanding BDAG, DAG, and KAS within this evolving landscape will also be examined. BlockDAG’s Educational Initiative: Building a Foundation for the Future The addition of Marcus Xavier , with his extensive background in education and emerging technologies, signals BlockDAG’s dedication to fostering a knowledgeable community. As Head of Learning, Xavier will develop the BlockDAG Academy, a learning hub designed to provide structured blockchain education. This initiative is particularly relevant given BlockDAG’s presale success, which has seen over 18.6 billion coins sold and a nearly $200 million raise. The academy aims to equip users, developers, and businesses with the practical skills needed to engage with the BlockDAG ecosystem. This focus on education is a crucial component of BlockDAG’s strategy, demonstrating a commitment to more than just short-term gains. The BlockDAG team understands that widespread adoption depends on accessible and comprehensive educational resources. A Career Dedicated to Learning and Emerging Tech Xavier’s career path reflects a deep interest in the intersection of education and technology. His experience spans B2B e-commerce, tech startups, and higher education. Having witnessed the early stages of the internet boom, Xavier developed an understanding of both the potential and the limitations of centralized systems. This led him to explore the possibilities of decentralized technologies and their ability to address existing gaps.

Amidst these, TRUMP Coin experiences volatile price movements due to major exchange listings, and Chainlink (LINK) looks to rally, yet it’s Web3Bay’s approach to secure online shopping that may truly transform the e-commerce landscape. Leveraging smart contract escrow, Web3Bay not only promises but provides a safe, fraud-free environment, a stark contrast to the speculative nature of many digital assets. While the market dances to the tune of volatile meme coins and seasoned cryptos, Web3Bay introduces a grounded, practical blockchain application, ensuring secure and transparent e-commerce transactions—potentially redefining how we conduct online business. Innovative Escrow Systems Set Web3Bay Apart Online shopping often falls prey to scams, including prevalent issues like fake reviews and rampant chargebacks that compromise both buyer and seller confidence. Web3Bay directly addresses these vulnerabilities with its innovative smart contract escrow system, safeguarding transactions to ensure they are secure, transparent, and immune to disputes. By automating escrow, Web3Bay effectively shields against fraudulent listings and the common pitfall of chargeback fraud, bolstering security for all market participants. This system is particularly advantageous for small business owners who frequently face hefty losses from fraudulent disputes, and consumers who will benefit from interacting with verified, trustworthy sellers. The blockchain’s immutable nature also ensures that product reviews cannot be falsified, cultivating a reliable marketplace atmosphere. With these mechanisms, Web3Bay is not merely participating in e-commerce; it is setting new standards for it. As the platform progresses, Web3Bay’s presale success—having raised $1.5 million in stage 4 for $0.004562625, with over 370 billion tokens sold—underscores the market’s growing demand for secure, reliable online transactions. Web3Bay is quickly establishing itself as a frontrunner in combating e-commerce fraud. TRUMP Coin’s Market Fluctuations After Upbit Listing TRUMP Coin, associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump, saw its value spike over 20% following its introduction on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit. This listing expanded its availability, adding new trading pairs and sparking a surge in trading activity that pushed its valuation significantly. Although it has seen substantial fluctuations, falling from a high market cap back down to more modest levels, the recent exposure has reignited interest, with projections suggesting a potential rise to between $35 and $40 in the near term. This exemplifies the profound impact that major exchange listings can have on meme-based assets, especially in markets like South Korea where retail trading is fervent. TRUMP remains a token to watch, as speculation continues to drive its market dynamics. Chainlink’s Prospects: Aiming for $23 Chainlink (LINK) is presently priced at $18.59, firmly supported between $17 and $18. The TD Sequential indicator has recently given a buy signal close to these levels, pointing to a possible ascent to $21 and potentially extending to $23. This projection is bolstered by historical data indicating that $21 has served as a frequent consolidation area, while $23 has consistently posed a notable resistance level. Simultaneously, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 48.94, signaling a balanced market condition, and the Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows a tight contest between buyers and sellers. Furthermore, whales hold 67% of LINK’s circulating supply, with current statistics revealing that 57% of investors are seeing profits, whereas 40% are experiencing losses. Taking these elements into account, alongside trends in exchange outflows which suggest diminishing selling pressures, there’s a solid groundwork for anticipating a push towards the $23 threshold. Wrapping Up! As the crypto market continues to evolve with its typical unpredictability, the emphasis remains on security and utility for sustainable growth. TRUMP Coin’s dramatic swings underscore the impact of exchange dynamics, while Chainlink’s technical setup hints at possible gains. Amidst these, Web3Bay’s smart contract escrow emerges as a crucial development, addressing the core challenges of online shopping fraud. This approach not only mitigates common e-commerce risks but also provides a substantial foundation for trust and reliability in digital transactions. While many chase market highs and lows, Web3Bay is crafting a more secure future for online shopping, promising more than just speculative benefits.

While XRP has long been a dominant player in the crypto space, newer projects with real-world applications and cutting-edge innovations are starting to take center stage. PropiChain is one such project, gaining traction for its unique approach to real estate. With analysts predicting massive gains, early investors are seeing PropiChain as an opportunity too good to ignore. Why Crypto Traders Are Looking Beyond XRP XRP has been a key player in the crypto market for years, particularly in cross-border payments. Its fast transaction speeds and low fees have made it a favorite among financial institutions. However, despite its strengths, XRP has faced challenges, including regulatory battles and market competition. As the market evolves, crypto traders are looking for projects that not only provide fast transactions but also offer tangible real-world benefits. This is where PropiChain is making waves. Instead of focusing solely on financial transactions, PCHAIN is bridging the gap between blockchain and real-world asset ownership, particularly in real estate. Crypto traders recognize that the future of blockchain lies in practical use cases, and PropiChain’s unique approach is positioning it as a strong contender in the market. What Gives Propichain the Edge? One of the main reasons PropiChain is attracting attention is its ability to revolutionize real estate investment. Traditionally, buying property requires significant capital, complex legal processes, and time-consuming paperwork. PropiChain simplifies this by allowing investors to buy fractional shares of high-value properties. This means that instead of needing millions to invest in premium real estate, users can start with as little as a few hundred dollars. But PropiChain isn’t stopping at fractional ownership. Its AI-powered analytics help investors make smarter decisions by analyzing market trends and identifying high-potential real estate investments. It’s like having access to AI-driven insights that tell you when and where to invest for maximum returns. Additionally, the project integrates tokenization to ensure secure and transparent ownership of real-world assets. Each property listed on PropiChain is converted into a digital token on the blockchain, making it easy to buy, sell, or trade without the complexities of traditional real estate transactions. Beyond real estate, PropiChain is also venturing into the metaverse. With the growing popularity of digital assets, the platform allows investors to purchase virtual real estate and participate in the booming metaverse economy. This creates an entirely new way for investors to diversify their portfolios. To further enhance efficiency, PropiChain uses smart contracts to automate property transactions, rental agreements, and payments. Instead of relying on traditional legal and financial intermediaries, these contracts execute transactions securely and instantly, reducing costs and eliminating unnecessary delays. Additionally, PropiChain’s global accessibility ensures that investors from anywhere in the world can participate in real estate markets that were previously out of reach. With blockchain removing geographic barriers, users can invest in premium properties across different countries without having to go through the complexities of international property transactions. Security and Market Recognition Strengthen Confidence Security is always a major concern for crypto traders, which is why PropiChain has undergone a thorough security audit to ensure its smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure are secure. This level of transparency reassures investors that their assets are protected. Additionally, PropiChain has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a major milestone that boosts its visibility and credibility in the market. A CoinMarketCap listing signals legitimacy and increases exposure to a global audience of investors looking for the next high-growth crypto project. How Much Could Investors Earn with PropiChain? PropiChain is still in stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011, giving early investors a rare chance to buy in at a low price before major price movements occur. A $1,000 investment at the current presale price could grow exponentially, offering life-changing returns up to $100,000 if PropiChain reaches its expected 100x.. Interestingly, PropiChain is still in its early stages, presenting a unique opportunity for those looking to invest before the mainstream market catches on. With a solid foundation, real-world applications, and growing interest from crypto traders, PropiChain has the potential to deliver significant returns. XRP has had its moment, but as the blockchain landscape continues to evolve, newer projects like PropiChain are proving that the future belongs to altcoins with real utility. For those looking to get ahead of the curve, keeping an eye on PropiChain could be the smartest move yet, as it could be the next life-changing investment. Don’t miss out.

Bons argues that BTC is no longer sustainable, especially after having lost its desirable qualities According to Bons, BTC has lost all its attractive qualities, so it won’t last very long. He argued that without capacity, scarcity, privacy, DeFi, or long-term security, the asset has “no legs to stand on.” He even stated that Bitcoin’s other impressive qualities, such as censorship resistance, immutability, financial sovereignty, and decentralization, are long gone and only pioneered by other emerging assets, saying the top asset lost its key principles to corruption. He further commented: BTC was effectively captured by a relatively small group of people who managed to entirely pivot the purpose, vision, and fundamental design of BTC. This did not happen without a fight. That history is now known as the block size debates, cumulating in 2017 when “Bitcoin Core” “won” and Bitcoin lost. Justin Bons He believes a group of people is still controlling BTC, and unfortunately, traders are still in the dark about the token’s reality. He even compared the current BTC governance to more of a Github dictatorship, saying the Core deterred any future expansion to BTC’s capacity, as opposed to Satoshi’s wants. Furthermore, he argued that Bitcoin currently sees only about seven transactions in a second, meaning it cannot be utilized for anything vital. He said that the token has to continuously rely on centralized holders to grow, which was not part of Satoshi’s original plan. Moreover, he said the core altered the token’s economic design to depend on few transactions with really high fees rather than many transactions with low fees, claiming that this also destroyed the asset’s long-term security model. Bons says BTC could fall in the next 8-12 years Bons believes that high trading activity on the BTC blockchain could make transaction fees surge to peak levels, even forcing traders to leave. He pointed out that this trend has been playing out on a smaller scale in recent years, leading to occasional fee spikes. However, he warned that this cycle “spells doom” for Bitcoin in the long term. He even expects the digital asset to collapse in the next 8 to 12 years, saying that an inflation rise past the 21 million cap will be its only saving grace then. He also projects a “bank-run”-like situation for when the token collapses, seeing how difficult it would be for every trader to transfer or withdraw all their assets. To him, BTC can never be a medium of exchange without capacity and will be a horrible store of value without long-term security. He even claims that BTC will reach a point where its price can no longer rise, and a “reckoning” will happen then. He has urged his followers to support Bitcoin by abandoning it and seeing Satoshi’s vision materialize in BTC’s children.

He emphasized their role in sustaining the current bullish trend. According to Martinez’s analysis, these levels have historically acted as both resistance and support for the altcoin. The repeated interaction with this range indicates its significance in determining ADA price direction. Key Support Levels for Cardano Price Stability In a post on X , Ali Martinez highlighted that Cardano price has repeatedly tested the $0.67–$0.80 range. This zone has provided stability for ADA, preventing further declines and acting as a foundation for bullish movements. Historical price movements suggest that this support area has been critical during both uptrends and corrections. The ability of ADA to hold above this range signals strong buying interest. Recent market data indicates that ADA remains within this support range, maintaining its position despite market fluctuations. If buying pressure persists, Cardano price could establish a stronger footing and attempt an upward breakout. Meanwhile, Grok 3 AI highlighted Cardano’s strong decentralization as a driving force behind its potential rally to $5-$6 in this bull cycle. If Cardano price can break key resistance levels, it may gain the bullish momentum needed to reach these ambitious price targets. Technical Indicators Suggest Growing Buying Pressure Cardano price is about to cross the 20-day Exponential Moving Average, a significant indicator for short-term trend identification. The 20 EMA acts as a support level and a breakout above it may indicate a rally for the altcoin. Supporting the bullish sentiments, the 1-day Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicates Cardano price is holding above key support levels, providing a foundation for a altcoin rally. More so, the MACD line is above the signal line, signaling a bullish crossover. If ADA maintains its position above $0.75 and builds on this momentum, it will break the $0.80 resistance and push higher in the short term. Furthermore, there is the Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR) indicator whose dotted lines are placed below Cardano price, which is common in an upward trend . This suggests that ADA price has found a strong support base, further reinforcing the likelihood of an upward move. Source: TradingView ADA Price To $1? If Cardano price remains above the key support range of $0.67–$0.80 and manages to break above resistance levels, analysts project a potential rally toward $0.94. A successful test of this price point could pave the way for ADA to revisit the $1 mark. Conversely, if ADA fails to sustain support above $0.67, selling pressure could increase, driving the price lower. In such a scenario, the next key support level would be around $0.54, where buyers might re-enter the market. Moreover, another analyst shared the bullish sentiments, emphasizing that ADA price movements suggest a potential breakout. The expert highlighted that if Cardano surpasses the critical resistance at $0.9837, it could pave the way for a rally toward $1.35.

Major shifts are happening, with XRP coin drawing attention due to ETF speculation and Solana facing increased short positions as network activity declines. Despite Solana’s recent price dip, long-term interest in its ecosystem remains strong. Meanwhile, Web3Bay , a decentralized e-commerce platform, is transforming blockchain-based shopping by integrating crypto, fiat, and PayPal payments. This hybrid system offers users a smoother shift into decentralized commerce without giving up familiar payment methods. With regulatory decisions impacting XRP, market shifts affecting Solana, and Web3Bay’s payment model gaining traction, crypto adoption is evolving. Each project represents different aspects of this change—finance, blockchain infrastructure, and real-world use—making them key players in shaping the market’s next chapter. Web3Bay’s Hybrid Payment System Simplifies Blockchain Shopping For crypto to gain more users, it must be easy to use. Web3Bay tackles this by offering a decentralized e-commerce platform that accepts crypto, fiat, and PayPal payments. This hybrid approach is more flexible than most blockchain marketplaces, letting users choose the payment method that suits them. Whether they prefer stablecoins, bank transfers, or digital wallets, Web3Bay removes the barriers that often discourage people from trying decentralized commerce. The demand for this system is evident. Web3Bay’s presale has raised over $1.5 million, with more than 370 million 3BAY tokens sold. With a 6,430% ROI potential, early buyers are securing their positions before the final presale price of $0.1959. Spanning 28 stages, this structure rewards early supporters while ensuring steady value growth before the platform’s official launch. By merging crypto’s flexibility with fiat’s convenience, Web3Bay makes decentralized shopping more accessible for everyday use. Even XRP coin holders seeking practical ways to spend their crypto can benefit from Web3Bay’s smooth and user-friendly payment system. Analyzing XRP Coin’s ETF Speculation XRP coin is at a crucial point, with speculation rising over a potential XRP ETF approval. The SEC is currently reviewing an application that could allow institutional investors to access XRP through a regulated exchange-traded fund. Approval could boost demand and drive further market activity. Ripple is also expanding its ecosystem with Ripple USD (RLUSD), a stablecoin designed for enterprise use, strengthening XRP’s role in crypto payments. At $2.56, XRP has experienced high volatility, with analysts predicting a potential rise to $5–$7 in the coming months. While traders are split on short-term performance, long-term optimism remains, supported by growing institutional interest and improving regulatory clarity. With financial institutions watching closely, XRP’s next move could have a significant impact on the broader crypto market. Solana Price Drips as Market Sentiment Weakens The Solana price has dropped to $167.28, down 8.14% over the past 24 hours. A rise in short positions reflects bearish sentiment, partly due to declining network activity. On-chain data shows a 55% drop in active addresses since November 2024, raising concerns about user engagement. Despite this, Solana’s ecosystem remains a hub for growth, with developers continuing to create new applications. External factors are also playing a role. The recent U.S. presidential election has sparked discussions on crypto regulations, boosting interest in both Solana and XRP coins. Institutional inflows into Solana-based investment products indicate that demand remains strong despite recent price drops. Many analysts see this dip as a potential setup for future growth, depending on how the market responds to broader economic and regulatory trends. Final Remarks! Crypto is evolving quickly, with XRP coin, Solana, and Web3Bay driving different aspects of this shift. While XRP awaits regulatory clarity and Solana faces short-term volatility, Web3Bay is making crypto payments more practical for real-world use. As a decentralized e-commerce platform , Web3Bay’s hybrid payment system bridges the gap between traditional finance and blockchain, making it easier for users to engage in decentralized shopping. With over $1.5 million raised and a solid presale structure, Web3Bay shows the real demand for accessible and flexible payment solutions. Whether through investments, blockchain infrastructure, or real-world adoption, these three projects are shaping the future of crypto.

The Shiba Inu price has long been a favorite among retail investors, yet recent stagnation below $0.3 has raised concerns about its long-term viability. Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as a powerhouse, with a 750x growth potential that presents a lucrative opportunity for investors. The Ethereum-based AI’s ongoing presale is already attracting substantial investments, signaling massive confidence in its long-term success. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The 750x Growth Opportunity Drawing Investors In WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out as a transformative force in the multi-billion-dollar crypto wallet and AI security industry rather than being just another token. With a presale that is rapidly gaining traction, thousands of investors are securing early positions, enabling the DeFi wallet’s price to skyrocket once the next round begins. The current presale round has already seen record-breaking investments, with projections indicating a price surge of over 750x after the token launches publicly. WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a secure, AI-powered decentralized wallet that allows direct trading of over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. Presale investors gain access to discounted prices and benefit from lower transaction fees, exclusive features, and governance rights, which allow them to influence platform development. These benefits have attracted SHIB whales and DOGE whales looking to diversify into a token with tangible use cases and a strong financial model. Security remains paramount, with AI-driven technology proactively detecting threats and safeguarding digital assets against hacks. The integration of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) enables transactions and private keys to remain protected. More than just a wallet, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers an entire financial ecosystem where investors can earn, trade, and govern the platform’s future. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is launching its beta platform soon, offering early adopters access to its innovative AI-driven crypto wallet. This phase will highlight security features, trading options, and asset management tools, showcasing the future of decentralized finance. Additionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has passed a rigorous audit by SolidProof, certifying its smart contracts as secure and transparent. This commitment to compliance and security positions the Ethereum-based AI as a strong alternative to stagnant assets like the Shiba Inu price, instilling investor confidence. The MVP version of the WallitIQ (WLTQ) mobile app establishes it as a frontrunner in the development of crypto wallets. This launch will unveil cutting-edge features aimed at improving wallet management, incorporating real-time pricing, and offering sophisticated trading options. Selling at a discounted price of $0.0420 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a compelling opportunity as the Shiba Inu price stagnates below $0.3. With overwhelming demand and potential for 750x growth, a significant price increase appears inevitable, making it an appealing choice for savvy investors. Shiba Inu Price: A Struggle To Regain Momentum Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a popular token, but its inability to push past $0.3 has left investors questioning its ability to deliver sustained returns. The Shiba Inu price whales have continuously supported the token, but diminishing trading volumes suggest a weakening demand. Investors who once anticipated explosive growth are now watching as the token remains trapped in a cycle of minor rallies and corrections. Despite previous gains, the Shiba Inu price struggles to generate the same enthusiasm as it once did. Investors who rode the early wave of the Shiba Inu price success are now weighing alternative options, as meme-based speculation alone is no longer enough to sustain long-term growth. While the Shiba Inu price whales continue holding significant positions, the broader market sentiment remains lukewarm. With investors looking for the next high-reward opportunity, the focus is shifting toward WallitIQ (WLTQ) and its unprecedented growth potential. Conclusion: WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Top Investment Opportunity Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a well-known asset, but its stagnant price performance is causing investors to seek alternatives. With WallitIQ (WLTQ) offering a 750x growth potential, AI-driven security, and lucrative presale rewards, the decision for investors is clear. The presale is already attracting record-breaking investments , with thousands of investors recognizing the massive upside potential. SHIB whales and DOGE whales are investing in the Ethereum-based token, anticipating exponential gains once it launches publicly. Now is the time to secure a position in what could be the most profitable investment of the year.

Story ( IP ) launched on February 13th at the listing price of $2.26 and is now trading at $5.98 at time of writing. It’s already the 71st-largest crypto asset by market cap and has surged by nearly 120% in the past 24 hours alone. Story is a scalable intellectual property solution that aims to serve as a blockchain where rights holders can upload IP, set the terms of use and monetize it throughout the protocol’s application ecosystem.

The banks outlined the Q4 losses in “net charge-offs” statements, revealing loans that the banks have declared as uncollectible and removed from their books after exhausting efforts to recover the owed amounts. JPMorgan Chase reported the highest charge-offs at $2.4 billion, driven largely by customers with big unpaid balances on their credit cards. Bank of America recorded $1.5 billion in charge-offs, also primarily from its credit card portfolio. And Wells Fargo reported $1.288 billion in charge-offs, fueled by higher credit card losses and commercial real estate losses in its office portfolio. The new numbers come as US credit card debt hits a record $1.21 trillion, according to new numbers from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The collective losses at the three banks represent a $188 million increase over the previous quarter, and a $460 million increase from one year ago. Despite the losses, the banks reported major earnings in Q4, with JPMorgan Chase declaring $14 billion in profits, Bank of America reporting $6.7 billion and Wells Fargo coming in at $5.1 billion.

Amid this, XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs, has once again neared a crucial support level from the ascending trendline, which it has been testing since the beginning of February 2025. Considering the current market sentiment and XRP’s outlook, the token appears to have absorbed all the bearish pressure and is now recovering. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, as the XRP price reached the trendline support of $2.50 level a significant buying pressure was observed resulting in the formation of a bullish candlestick pattern. Besides this, the recent price drop has not affected XRP’s past ascending triangle price action pattern which it has formed. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if XRP holds above the $2.50 level, there is a strong possibility that the asset could soar significantly in the coming days and maintain its bullish momentum. However, if the token fails to hold this level and closes a four-hour candle below $2.45, a massive price drop could occur, potentially pushing XRP down to the $1.90 level. Despite the ongoing price recovery, the asset remains below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating that it is still in a downtrend. Current Price Momentum With these key levels in focus, XRP is currently trading near $2.58, having dropped over 3.75% in the past 24 hours. However, despite the decline, investors and traders have shown strong interest in the token, leading to a 44% increase in participation. $21.50 Million Worth XRP Outflow Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass revealed that this rise in participation is driven by significant investor accumulation of XRP tokens. Spot inflow/outflow data showed that as the price dropped, exchanges witnessed a substantial outflow of $21.50 million worth of XRP tokens, indicating potential accumulation. Source: Coinglass Combining this potential accumulation with price action, the current level appears to be an ideal buying opportunity, with $2.50 or $2.45 serving as a potential exit level if sentiment shifts toward the bearish side.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 01:11:47

TD Sequential Says Yes,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/is-it-time-to-buy-xrp-td-sequential-says-yes/,"A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential has just given a buy signal on the hourly XRP price chart. XRP Has Just Witnessed A Bullish Setup On TD Sequential In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a TD Sequential signal that XRP has seen recently. The “TD Sequential” here refers to an indicator from technical analysis (TA) that’s used for locating probable points of reversal in any asset’s price. The indicator consists of two phases: setup and countdown. In the first of these, candles of the same polarity (that is, whether red or green) are counted up to nine. Once these candles, which don’t have to be one after the other, are printed on the chart, the TD Sequential gives a reversal signal. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Plunges 58%: How Do Shiba Inu & Pepe Compare? The countdown phase begins as soon as the setup is over. This phase also works much in the same way, with the only difference being that candles here are counted up to thirteen, not nine. Once the countdown is finished, the asset can be assumed to have arrived at another potential turnaround. Where a TD Sequential signal might lead the price naturally depends on the type of candle that led to the phase’s completion. Green candles naturally mean a correction may be coming, while red ones suggest a bullish reversal. XRP has recently completed the former TD Sequential phase on its 1-hour price. Here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows this pattern forming for the cryptocurrency: As is visible in the above graph, the TD Sequential has finished a setup with nine red candles for XRP recently, which implies the cryptocurrency’s price can be considered to have reached a bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin RHODL Momentum Slowing Down—Analyst Warns Pattern ‘Not Ideal’ If the pattern indeed holds, then the asset would next see a rebound to the upside. Though, given the fact that this buy signal has formed on a short timeframe (1-hour), the surge resulting from the signal may not be too large. Speaking of the TD Sequential, XRP isn’t the only cryptocurrency that has displayed a bullish formation in its hourly price. As Martinez has pointed out in another X post, Steller (XLM) has also seen a buy setup recently. “Stellar $XLM is ready to rebound as the TD Sequential indicator shows a buy signal on the hourly chart!” notes the analyst. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the signal would come to fruition for XRP and XLM or not. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.67, down 1% in the last seven days.

The company was facing a potential lawsuit from the SEC over NFTs being classified as securities. Bloomberg reported on Friday that the SEC told OpenSea that the agency had closed its investigation without taking enforcement action. SEC issued Wells Notice, but OpenSea resisted NFT securities classification The development follows a Wells notice issued to the NFT marketplace last August, indicating the SEC’s intent to take legal action. The agency had been investigating whether some NFTs traded on OpenSea’s platform were actually securities, part of its wider push to regulate the crypto industry. A Wells notice is a formal communication from the SEC that allows the recipient to respond before the agency makes a final enforcement decision. Even though the notice indicated the SEC thought some NFTs might be subject to securities laws, OpenSea had taken the position that classifying them this way would misunderstand the current laws and choke innovation in the space. Devin Finzer, co-founder and CEO of OpenSea, welcomed the news and said the development is a win for everyone who is making and building in their space. He added that attempting to label NFTs as securities would have set them back. According to Finzer, every creator, no matter how small, should be able to build without undue friction.” Finzer’s comments echo the views of other NFT and broader web3 community members who have contended that NFTs are primarily a form of digital collectibles and art, not financial securities. OpenSea had already reserved $5 million in a legal defense fund to help NFT artists and developers who could be scrutinized by the SEC. Crypto community pushes back as SEC eases NFT and crypto regulations The SEC’s efforts to define NFTs as securities have been met with a widespread backlash from the crypto community who see such regulation as a barrier to innovation. For holders and creators of at least some NFTs, the SEC’s decision to close the investigation without enforcement action potentially signals a more lenient approach to enforcement regarding NFTs, which may be a relief for marketplaces, creators, and collectors that have been scrambling to parse existing regulatory guidance. Meanwhile, in a related development, the SEC has also dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase. The crypto exchange revealed earlier today that the SEC staff had agreed in principle to dismiss the case, subject to final approval by the commissioners. If formally adopted, the dismissal would be with prejudice, which would bar the SEC from reissuing similar charges against Coinbase in the future and could impact other ongoing legal fights involving other crypto platforms. The SEC’s decision not to pursue OpenSea any further is a landmark moment for the NFT space and confirms that digital assets as a whole should not be shoehorned into historical securities-based regulation. With OpenSea free from the concerns of regulatory action, creators and developers within the NFT space can focus on innovating as the specter of gory enforcement recedes.

Additionally, ADA’s four-hour chart appears to be mirroring XRP’s , which looks bullish. Current Price Momentum Currently, ADA is trading near $0.77 and has dropped 3.25% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume surged by 45%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors. Cardano (ADA) Bullish and Bearish Levels Despite market fluctuations, the $0.74 level will play a crucial role today. Based on recent price momentum, this level will determine whether ADA sinks or gains upward momentum. Source: Trading View On the positive side, if ADA holds this level, there is a strong possibility it could soar 10% to reach $0.85 in the coming hours. Additionally, if the bullish rally continues, it could gain another 20% to reach $1.01 in the coming days. On the bearish side, if ADA fails to hold the $0.74 level and closes a four-hour candle below it, there is a strong possibility of a 10% drop to $0.65.

The token gained over 44% in value, according to price data on Crypto.news. Derivatives data and on-chain analysis supports a bullish thesis for the DeFi token for next week. Derivatives data from crypto intelligence platform Coinglass shows a large positive spike in Open Interest in MKR on February 21. The spike represents a massive increase in the total value of open contracts in MKR across derivatives exchanges. Coinglass data shows that MKR OI is $116.85 million at the time of writing on Friday, February 21. MKR Futures Open Interest | Source: Coinglass The total value of assets locked in MKR surged to $5.675 billion, as seen on DeFiLlama. This coincides with the rising price, relevance, and demand for tokens among traders. The rebranding to Sky protocol has proven effective for driving adoption in market participants. Maker TVL | Source: DeFiLlama Santiment data shows several negative spikes in Network realized profit/loss metric in the MKR chart since mid-January 2025. This shows several traders and MKR holders are shedding their holdings and realizing losses. Consistent realization of losses is typically considered a sign of capitulation and is consistent with an eventual recovery in the token’s price. MKR’s daily active addresses recorded a nearly three-month peak this week, signalling the rise in interest from traders. MKR token’s supply held by whales (excluding exchange wallets) has climbed, recovering from the decline noted in the first week of February. This is another bullish sign for the DeFi token. Maker on-chain analysis | Source: Santiment The In/Out of money around price indicator on IntoTheBlock shows that 30% of the wallet addresses holding MKR are currently sitting on unrealized losses. 65.55% of MKR token holders have unrealized gains in their portfolio. Combining the In/Out of the money with the Network realized profit/loss metric, it is less likely that profitable traders take profits as the current trend is that of capitulation. The likelihood of further selling pressure on MKR is low for next week, meaning the token could extend its gains and maintain the underlying positive momentum. In/Out of the Money around price | Source: IntoTheBlock Maker (MKR) weekly price forecast Maker broke out of its downward trend on February 12, since then the token has rallied, extending gains nearly everyday this week. At the time of writing, MKR is trading at $1,473, on Friday. The token is close to resistance at $1,632 and $2,050, two key levels in MKR’s upward trend between October 26 and December 4, as observed in the daily price chart. In the event of a correction, MKR could find support at $1,125. Two key technical indicators, the Moving average convergence divergence indicator and relative strength index flash bullish signs on the daily timeframe. MACD shows consecutive green histogram bars above the neutral line and RSI reads 74 and is sloping upwards. While this typically generates a sell signal, in the case of MKR, MACD and the underlying positive momentum in the MKR price trend support further gains. MKR/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news A rally to test resistance at $1,632 marks a nearly 15% rally in MKR price. Even as whales cash out their MKR holdings amidst price surges, they fail to influence prices negatively. While it is typical of a token to observe a decline in its price if large entities shed their holdings, MKR price is holding steady. A wallet address identified as inveteratus.eth on the blockchain sold 1,230 MKR worth 1.78 million USDC and secured a 30% profit of $418,000 within less than a month.

Yesterday, an emergency proposal appeared on the MakerDAO @skyecosystem forum and voting portal. This proposal, which has passed but still pending timelock, dramatically increases both the amount and the LTV that Maker will lend against its own gov token.

Maker tokens worth $17 million burnt, support gains The second market mover for MKR this week is the $17 million token burn, identified on the blockchain. When a large volume of tokens is burnt, they are removed from the supply permanently, and they reduce the selling pressure, supporting price gains.

The meme coin is facing massive sell pressure at the moment, prompting more bearish Dogecoin price movement. Smart market players have identified Panshibi (SHIBI) as the perfect Dogecoin alternative. The Asian-backed meme coin has maintained a positive outlook despite market conditions, and analysis suggests early presale investors could gain 100x from it. Let’s see what the Dogecoin price prediction says in comparison to Panshibi (SHIBI) Dogecoin Risks Further Price Drop As Sell Pressure Increases If the current trend persists, the Dogecoin dip could worsen in the coming days. Short-term Dogecoin holders are already abandoning the coin, as the new Panshibi (SHIBI) looks better primed for an imminent bullish run. The DOGE sell-off is affecting the meme coin's upward momentum, but Dogecoin has maintained its consolidation zone around $0.24 - $0.25 since last week. Despite Grayscale's ETF filing for several altcoins, including Dogecoin, demand on the meme coin has been unimpressive as bearish market trends persist. Technical analysis also identified a death cross on the meme coin, signaling an imminent bearish run. While the popular Dogecoin price prediction targets a surge to $1, recent market trends highlight a potential dip below $0.1. With growing volatility on DOGE, holders have been quick to explore other market opportunities to deliver better returns for investors in the short and long run. Panshibi (SHIBI) To Rally Impressively Soon, Despite General Market Woes Presale tokens are seemingly the best investment types in the crypto market. Even in high market volatility, they offer controlled market parameters that almost guarantee profit for early buyers. The ongoing Stage 4 Panshibi presale is an opportunity for early investors to get in cheap ahead of a higher listing price. Panshibi (SHIBI) is set for 15 presale stages over 60 days, and the ongoing Stage 4 is selling out fast at $0.005. While this entry allows investors to secure over 400% gains before the $0.026 listing, the bigger profit margin is available after the token launch. Panshibi is a new panda-themed meme coin that leverages its Asian influence to grow. To increase engagement in its community, the project will introduce quests, contests, and other reward-backed activities. To achieve this, the meme coin will integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with its Social-Fi mechanism. The new meme coin is currently enjoying much interest, and the fact that it's well-audited and declared safe by Coinsult has added to investors' confidence in it. Panshibi is expected to enjoy higher adoption, and early adopters may gain the most from the token. Additionally, Panshibi will implement a ten-year liquidity lock and lock team tokens for two years, establishing a long-term commitment to the project’s success. Once the presale is over, the Panshibi team will also renounce contract ownership. Conclusion Dogecoin (DOGE) is already at a market size without a margin for 100x gains. Therefore, investors are betting on the more promising prospect of a 100x profit on Panshibi (SHIBI) as the new meme coin does impressive numbers on presale. Unlike Dogecoin, Panshibi (SHIBI) is building momentum from presale and is likely to maintain it when it hits exchanges. The Panda-themed meme coin looks ready to yield good returns, and its prospects are clear for all to see.

This downward momentum casts doubt over the coin's future price trends. In the midst of this downturn, the Panshibi (SHIBI) token has caught the attention of shrewd investors seeking alternatives. Despite widespread market challenges, Panshibi maintains a bright outlook, with projections suggesting potential exponential growth for early presale participants. Considering the current Dogecoin forecast and contrasting it with the optimistic predictions for Panshibi (SHIBI) provides intriguing insights. The Uncertain Path for Dogecoin Amid Rising Sell-offs As selling pressure intensifies, Dogecoin faces the possibility of further depreciation. Investors are turning to Panshibi (SHIBI) for its potential upswing, as the established meme coin struggles to break past the $0.24 - $0.25 zone. Despite efforts like Grayscale's ETF initiatives for Dogecoin, the prevailing bearish sentiment poses challenges. Furthermore, technical indicators hint at potential downturns, marking a cautious outlook for its trajectory. While ambitions of a $1 price tag for Dogecoin exist, volatile conditions suggest a dip closer to $0.1 might be on the horizon. Such fluctuations are driving investors towards more promising ventures that promise lucrative returns in both short and long-term scopes. Panshibi (SHIBI) Sets the Stage for Remarkable Growth Despite Market Hurdles Cryptocurrency presales, with their predictable settings, have attracted those keen on securing early gains amidst market unpredictability. Panshibi's Stage 4 presale offers a gateway to potential profitability at attractive rates. Panshibi (SHIBI) is structured for 15 strategic presale stages, with the current phase advancing swiftly at a $0.005 rate. Investors anticipate substantial gains post-listing, but the true value lies beyond the presale. The Asian-themed panda coin capitalizes on its cultural allure, incorporating features like AI-driven Social-Fi components to boost community engagement through interactive events and rewards. Its rigorous audit process by Coinsult enhances its credibility and investor trust. Further securing its foundation, Panshibi has committed to locking liquidity and team tokens to ensure sustained growth. Post-presale, the project's commitment extends to relinquishing contract ownership, solidifying its long-term vision. Final Thoughts With Dogecoin's current market ceiling hindering dramatic returns, investors are eagerly eyeing the potential windfall that comes with Panshibi (SHIBI). This new entrant in the meme coin domain is making waves, thanks to its strategic presale success. Where Dogecoin falls short, Panshibi (SHIBI) shines by leveraging its early market momentum and anticipated post-listing performance.

Optimists believe this could represent the start of a more general upward movement, backed by Cardano’s strong technical updates in 2024 and thorough plans for 2025. So, is this optimism reasonable to have, or should holders be more cautious? Cardano Price Prediction 2025: Can ADA Really Double? Cardano (ADA) has had a volatile ride in recent months, but analysts remain optimistic about its long-term potential. With key network upgrades in the pipeline, many experts believe ADA could double in value by 2025, potentially hitting $1.50 to $2.00 as adoption grows. One major factor supporting this Cardano price prediction is the blockchain’s commitment to scalability and decentralization. The upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade is set to increase transaction throughput, improving efficiency and making Cardano more competitive with Ethereum. Additionally, the move toward full governance, reinforced by the Plomin Hard Fork and Lace Wallet expansion, could attract more developers and institutional investors to the ecosystem. On-chain data suggests that Cardano accumulation is rising. The number of addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA has steadily increased , signaling that whales are positioning themselves for long-term gains. Currently, Cardano’s market cap sits at $26.58 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $879.83 million, demonstrating strong liquidity and continued investor interest So, is a 2x Cardano price prediction realistic for 2025? If scalability upgrades roll out smoothly and institutional interest continues growing, a strong rally is definitely on the table.

This has led this Dogecoin analyst to believe a $50 billion market cap for DOGE is within reach. In addition, the potential introduction of a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has generated considerable excitement for the meme coin mania. The Dogecoin analyst predicted that a DOGE ETF could drive the price of Dogecoin up to $15 despite on-chain metrics suggesting stagnation. Furthermore, the prospect of Donald Trump’s re-election as U.S. President and the Federal Reserve’s decision to lower interest rates have created a favorable environment for crypto growth.

Particularly, so far, BTC has managed to regain some of the losses shedded in recent weeks with its price now hovering above $98,000, marking a 2.6% increase in the past 7 days. Alongside this price movement, new data have emerged highlighting significant activity among large holders on exchanges, suggesting a shift in market dynamics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Climbs—Is a Market Breakout Around the Corner? Bitfinex Whales Show Increased Activity A CryptoQuant analyst known as Mignolet has recently shared a detailed outlook on exchange whales and their influence on the current price action in Bitcoin. Mignolet’s observations focus on leverage ratios across major trading platforms. According to his analysis, the “all exchange leverage ratio” is at an all-time high. This measure, which captures the amount of leverage being used on exchanges, reflects heightened activity that could precede significant price moves. Interestingly, while Binance has seen its leverage ratio drop back to levels last seen during last year’s consolidation phase, Bitfinex tells a different story. On Bitfinex, leverage ratios have surged sharply, aligning with a rise in open interest. Mignolet highlights that this activity points to a sudden increase in whale movements within the ongoing consolidation range. While these leverage ratios alone don’t guarantee a specific price direction, the sharp uptick on Bitfinex suggests a shift in market dynamics that bears watching. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the question now is: What are these whales aiming for? Mignolet’s analysis stops short of providing a definitive answer, but it raises the possibility of a major price shift soon. With Bitcoin’s price holding steady above $98,000, the actions of these large-scale traders could influence whether the market breaks higher or retreats back into a more extended consolidation phase. Bitcoin Encounters Potential Strong Support Zone Meanwhile, Bitcoin has continued to inch closer to the six-digit price mark which it recently fell below in the previous week. Although the asset is still roughly an 8.7% decrease away from its all-time high (ATH) above $109,000 established in January, it has managed to see an uptick in price in the past few days. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $98,091 marking a 1.2% increase in price over the past day. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the asset appears to be seeing a formation of a “massive demand zone just below the current price.” IntoTheBlock highlighted that should the market face further downward pressure around this area, the zone may act as strong support.

Amidst these market dynamics, Web3Bay is confronting a critical issue: the prevalence of online shopping fraud. Web3Bay employs a smart contract-based escrow system that acts as a robust safeguard for both buyers and sellers, ensuring that payments are released only once contractual conditions are satisfied. This system also combats the issue of falsified reviews by utilizing blockchain technology for verification, thereby fostering increased trust in online marketplaces. Web3Bay’s Smart Contract Escrow System: Transforming Security in Online Retail The menace of online shopping scams is escalating, with consumers and merchants facing losses in the billions due to fraudulent listings and payment disputes. Web3Bay’s response is a blockchain-driven escrow mechanism that not only secures transactions but also safeguards against fraudulent activities by both parties. By automating the transaction process, the platform ensures that funds are transferred only after both buyer and seller have met the agreed-upon terms. This security is further enhanced by Web3Bay’s approach to tackling counterfeit reviews, a significant issue in e-commerce. The platform ensures that only verified purchasers can leave reviews, which minimizes the chances of manipulation and boosts the integrity of online feedback. This transparency not only increases consumer trust but also promotes fairness among businesses. Amidst its ongoing presale, Web3Bay has successfully sold over 370 million coins, raising $1.5 million and progressing to stage 4 of its token offering at a price of $0.004562625 per token. This robust presale activity underscores the market’s growing interest in blockchain solutions that address fraud prevention. Uniswap’s (UNI) Price Predictions: Looking Towards 2025 As of February 15, 2025, Uniswap (UNI) stands at $9.79, marking a minor decline of 4.21% from its last closing price. The past year has seen UNI’s price undergo substantial swings, reflecting its volatile nature. Future projections for UNI suggest it could oscillate between $7.95 and $16.26 in the coming year, potentially realizing a growth of up to 63.59%. These estimates derive from comprehensive market analysis and historical trends, though they warrant cautious consideration due to the inherent unpredictability of the cryptocurrency sector. Investors are encouraged to keep abreast of ongoing market trends and perform detailed analyses before engaging in trading activities. While growth prospects for UNI are plausible, it’s imperative to weigh the potential risks and market forces that could influence its trajectory. Hedera (HBAR): On the Verge of a Market Uptrend Currently, Hedera (HBAR) is priced at $0.227554, showing a nominal decrease of 0.03534% from its previous closing. The trading session saw HBAR reach a high of $0.239214 and dip to a low of $0.227527. Technical analysis suggests that HBAR might be wrapping up its corrective Wave 4, with its position near the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels hinting at an impending upward movement. The RSI indicates oversold conditions, typically a precursor to a rally. A breakout from a descending wedge on the hourly chart further points to a potential bullish phase, with target resistance levels at $0.31, $0.35, and $0.39. Conversely, a fall below $0.218 could negate this bullish forecast, with $0.177 acting as crucial support. In Conclusion While Uniswap (UNI) and Hedera (HBAR) continue their unpredictable market performance, Web3Bay is making a tangible impact on enhancing online transaction security. Beyond just analyzing price trends, Web3Bay provides concrete solutions to real-world problems faced by consumers and businesses, utilizing its escrow system to minimize fraud, avoid wrongful chargebacks, and promote equitable dealings. With its blockchain-validated system bolstering confidence in online reviews, Web3Bay introduces much-needed transparency to e-commerce.

In a post on X, Martinez shared a chart highlighting a potential buy signal on XLM’s hourly chart, based on the TD Sequential indicator. #Stellar $XLM is ready to rebound as the TD Sequential indicator shows a buy signal on the hourly chart! pic.twitter.com/qFvbOkvD02 — Ali (@ali_charts) February 21, 2025 The TD Sequential Buy Signal Traders use the TD Sequential indicator to identify potential trend reversals. On the hourly chart of XLM/USDT, the signal appears as a green “1” candle following a red “9” count, which typically suggests that selling pressure has been exhausted and a price reversal could be imminent. Martinez’s chart reflects this setup, with a black arrow marking the point where the buy signal was triggered. The chart also shows a period of downward price movement leading up to the signal, followed by several small-bodied candles indicating consolidation. If the TD Sequential setup plays out as expected, XLM could see a short-term upward move. Recent Price Action and Market Context When the chart was published, XLM traded at approximately $0.33944 on Binance. The price had previously declined, forming a series of lower highs and lower lows, but the emergence of the buy signal could indicate a shift in momentum. Technical traders often seek confirmation before acting on a TD Sequential buy signal. A bullish candle following the signal, increased trading volume, or a break above key resistance levels would strengthen the case for a rebound. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analyst Ali Martinez’s Broader Market Outlook Ali Martinez actively provides cryptocurrency market analysis, covering various assets beyond XLM. Recently, he has also made notable predictions about XRP. In one of his analyses , he suggested that XRP is “ready for an upswing” based on market structure and technical indicators. In another, he pointed to a cup-and-handle pattern on XRP’s chart , which could signal a major breakout above $3. Additionally, Martinez highlighted a critical support level for XRP , stating that a retest of the $3 level could be on the horizon if it holds. While these predictions focus on XRP, his overall analytical approach remains consistent across different cryptocurrencies. What’s Next for XLM? While the TD Sequential indicator provides a buy signal, traders should remain cautious and seek further confirmation. Market sentiment, broader cryptocurrency trends, and external factors such as macroeconomic conditions can all influence XLM’s price movement. If buying pressure increases and the price starts forming higher highs, XLM could confirm the reversal and move toward resistance levels around $0.345 or higher. However, if the price fails to gain upward momentum, the buy signal may not play out as expected, and further downside could be possible.

Shouting “dismantle the finance ministry!” attendees brandished signs saying things like “we are not your ATM” and mocking prime minister Shigeru Ishiba. Compared to other demonstrations and protests around the world, Friday evening’s (JST) MinFin protest may be seen as relatively tame, but by Japan’s typically polite standards, the growing anger is palpable. Around 1,000 people were estimated to have attended, according to participants. A small but swelling crowd chanted “demolish the ministry!” in unison in one video shared to social media, with the ostensible poster of the film noting the heavy police presence. Lightning Network advocate and Blockstream Japan leader Koji Higashi posted to X that the protest was “so exciting.” Others noted a stark lack of media coverage other than TV Tokyo, and indeed, coverage even at the time of writing is sparse. At a previous “demolish the finance ministry” event on February 17, a high school student visiting Tokyo for university entrance exams expressed frustration at the current statist paradigm, saying that he was sleeping in a park as hotels are now too expensive, and consumption tax keeps going up, while corporations are given breaks. “[The politicians] say if enterprise gets richer, we’ll all get richer. But is anyone here rich?” he asked to a passionate gathering of supporters. A sign at the protest reads: “The citizens are not your ATM.” Source: X . Reasons for the anger, Bitcoin advocates in attendance The February 21 protest is reportedly the fifth of its kind around Japan, and individual reasons for attending seem to be myriad. The 2016, Abe-era Moritomo Gakuen scandal in which the finance ministry admitted to falsifying documents, and essentially cheating the public out of money, is once again in the news . Beyond this issue, as Cryptopolitan has reported previously, residents of Japan are increasingly suffering palpable fiscal pain from inflation, overtourism, skyrocketing food prices, ostensible rice “shortages,” unlivable or non-existent pensions for the elderly, and a government and new prime minister that is hellbent on dumping literal trillions of yen into overseas initiatives and war, instead of helping the people. A street-side display at the “Demolish the Ministry of Finance” demonstration, featuring unflattering images of Japan’s prime minister Shigeru Ishiba. Source: X . “When I thought about the suffering of the people, with children unable to eat three meals a day and sales of rice seasoning at an all-time high, I started screaming and crying,” one protest attendee posted to social media , along with a video. Rice seasoning called furikake is often used in Japan to make cheap, plain meals consisting of mostly just rice, more palatable. Bitcoin advocates also attended the event via their own “Bitcoin Demo” in the same area. However, much like the murky origins of the “demolish the finance ministry” protests, it’s not immediately clear who these individuals are, or what their true agendas may be. Everyday individuals on the ground seemed to be protesting in earnest, but other elements of the demo could be construed by some as “ controlled opposition .” BTC “rebels” illogically appeal to Japanese to “pay taxes in Bitcoin” as a means to stop state spending. Source: X. For example, one photo shared by Blockstream Japan’s Koji Higashi shows a group of demonstrators in Guy Fawkes masks advising people to “pay your taxes with Bitcoin” — hardly the cypher-punk crypto freedom ethos their image might suggest, as BTC is now championed by banks and governments worldwide, including in Japan. And they’d be paying the exact entities they have deemed fiscally irresponsible. Like much cookie-cutter rebellion in the land of the rising sun, aesthetics and images are borrowed from the West, and adopted outrage which is out-of-place or counterproductive is the result. Whatever intentions may be, true crypto advocates are right about one thing: peer-to-peer, permissionless electronic cash with privacy protocols in place can indeed be a means to rein in and completely stop political spending.

However, after a much-hyped launch, the price experienced a sharp drop, falling by 65%. At the time of writing, Pi Coin is trading at $0.75 and has seen a decline of more than 7% in the past 24 hours. Despite the aggressive selling pressure fueled by market uncertainty, analysts, including Kim Wong, remain hopeful about the coin’s future trajectory. Initial Trading Activity and Price Movements When Pi Coin first launched on February 20, it traded at $2, reaching a high of $2.20 and a low of $0.09. Since then, its price has been relatively volatile, and as of February 22, Pi Coin has been trading within a range of $0.60 to $0.80. According to Wong , once Pi Coin manages to break above the $0.80 mark, it is likely to quickly move toward the $1 range. Once it surpasses $1, the $2 level could be within reach. A possible trigger for such a breakout could come from news regarding a Binance listing or progress in Pi’s ecosystem development. Disappointment and Market Misunderstandings Some early investors have voiced their disappointment over what they perceive as a low price for Pi Coin. However, this low price may be misleading, primarily due to confusion surrounding the circulating supply. The market has listed Pi’s circulating supply at 6.35 billion coins, which represents the total number of migrated Pi. However, the actual number of unlocked Pi is only 554 million coins, a figure that should be considered as the true circulating supply. Many new investors may not be aware of this distinction, but once they do, analysts believe the price of Pi could rise significantly — possibly ten times its current value. Pi Coin’s Relative Value in the Crypto Market Even at a price of $0.72, Pi Coin’s valuation is considered by some experts to be reasonable. For comparison, other projects with similar circulating supplies, such as Supra, are trading at a much lower price of $0.012. Projects with a similar supply, like Pi Coin, typically have higher initial listings. This makes Pi Coin’s current price quite favorable when compared to other crypto assets with similar supply and market factor.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ZRX|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 03:32:08

Get ready for a game-changer! Apple’s latest iOS 18.4 developer beta introduces ‘Priority Notifications,’ a smart feature powered by the groundbreaking Apple Intelligence . This innovative update promises to transform how you manage alerts, ensuring you stay focused on what’s important without missing crucial updates. Let’s dive into how this feature will revolutionize your iPhone Notifications experience. Unveiling Priority Notifications: How Does Apple Intelligence Enhance Alert Management? Imagine a world where your iPhone intelligently filters through the noise, presenting only the notifications that demand your immediate attention. That’s precisely what ‘Priority Notifications’ aims to deliver. Powered by Apple Intelligence , this feature analyzes your notifications and categorizes them based on importance. Instead of a chronological list, your Lock Screen will now feature a dedicated section for these prioritized alerts. Think of it as having a smart assistant managing your digital interruptions. Here’s a breakdown of how Priority Notifications changes the notification game: Intelligent Prioritization: Apple Intelligence algorithms work behind the scenes to determine which notifications are most relevant to you. This means messages from close contacts, urgent app alerts, or time-sensitive reminders are more likely to be flagged as ‘priority.’ Separate Lock Screen Section: Important notifications are neatly organized in their own section on the Lock Screen, ensuring they don’t get lost in the shuffle of less critical alerts. Chronological View Still Available: Don’t worry about missing anything! You can still swipe up to access the traditional chronological view of all your notifications, ensuring complete oversight. Reduced Digital Clutter: By filtering out less important notifications, ‘Priority Notifications’ helps minimize distractions, allowing you to focus on tasks at hand and improve your overall digital well-being. Mastering Notification Management : Enabling and Customizing Priority Notifications in iOS 18.4 Ready to take control of your iPhone Notifications with this smart feature? Enabling ‘Priority Notifications’ in iOS 18.4 is straightforward. While the feature is initially turned off by default, activating it is a breeze through your iPhone settings. This user-friendly approach puts you in charge of when and how you want to experience prioritized alerts. Follow these simple steps to enable Priority Notifications: Open Settings App: Locate and tap the ‘Settings’ app icon on your iPhone’s home screen. Navigate to Notifications: Scroll down and select the ‘Notifications’ option within the Settings menu. Find ‘Prioritize Notifications’: Look for the ‘Prioritize Notifications’ section within the Notifications settings. Toggle it On: Simply toggle the switch to the ‘on’ position to activate the ‘Priority Notifications’ feature powered by Apple Intelligence . Once enabled, you’ll immediately start experiencing a more streamlined notification experience. The intelligent filtering will begin working, and you’ll notice important alerts surfacing to the top, right where you need them. Beyond Priority Notifications : What Else is New in iOS 18.4 and Apple’s AI Push? iOS 18.4 isn’t just about smarter notifications. Apple’s developer beta release hints at a broader push towards integrating Apple Intelligence across its ecosystem. The announcement that Apple Intelligence is also coming to Vision Pro as part of visionOS 2.4 further emphasizes this commitment. This expansion suggests a future where AI-driven features become increasingly central to the Apple experience, enhancing user interaction and device functionality across various platforms. In addition to Priority Notifications and Vision Pro integration, Apple also unveiled Apple News+ Food. This upcoming section within Apple News+ will allow users to search and save recipes from numerous publishing partners, showcasing Apple’s continued diversification of its services and content offerings. The Impact of Smart Notification Management : Benefits and Future Implications The introduction of ‘Priority Notifications’ in iOS 18.4 signals a significant step forward in Notification Management . By leveraging Apple Intelligence , Apple is directly addressing the growing concern of notification overload and its impact on user focus and productivity. This feature offers several key benefits: Enhanced Focus and Productivity: By minimizing distractions from unimportant notifications, users can better concentrate on their tasks, leading to increased productivity. Reduced Digital Fatigue: Constant notification bombardment can lead to digital fatigue and stress. ‘Priority Notifications’ helps alleviate this by filtering out the noise. Improved User Experience: A more organized and intelligent notification system contributes to a smoother and more enjoyable user experience on iPhones. Potential for Further AI Integration: ‘Priority Notifications’ is likely just the beginning. We can expect to see even more sophisticated AI-powered features integrated into iPhone Notifications and other aspects of iOS in the future. As Apple Intelligence continues to evolve, features like ‘Priority Notifications’ will become increasingly refined and personalized, adapting to individual user needs and preferences. This move towards intelligent automation in Notification Management is not just a convenience; it’s a crucial step in creating a more user-centric and less disruptive mobile experience. Embrace the Future of iPhone Notifications with iOS 18.4 With iOS 18.4 and ‘Priority Notifications,’ Apple is handing users the reins to master their digital world. This Apple Intelligence -powered feature is poised to redefine how we interact with our iPhones, moving away from notification chaos towards a more controlled and focused experience. By intelligently filtering and prioritizing alerts, ‘Priority Notifications’ promises to be a valuable tool for anyone seeking to reclaim their attention and enhance their digital well-being. Keep an eye out for the public release of iOS 18.4 to experience this transformative feature firsthand and unlock the full potential of smart Notification Management .

40669776,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132991,1740196228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealing Court Documents: Meta’s Risky AI Training Tactics Using Copyrighted Content,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-risky-ai-copyright-content/,"In a startling revelation shaking the foundations of AI ethics, court documents unsealed this week expose internal discussions at Meta regarding the use of copyrighted materials for training their cutting-edge AI models. This news arrives amidst growing concerns in the cryptocurrency and tech world about the ethical sourcing of data powering artificial intelligence. As blockchain technology grapples with its own copyright and intellectual property challenges, this case throws a spotlight on the broader AI landscape and its potential pitfalls. Are tech giants like Meta pushing the boundaries of legality in their relentless pursuit of AI dominance? The Heart of the Matter: Meta’s AI Training Data Dilemma The lawsuit, Kadrey v. Meta , is a landmark case in the burgeoning field of AI copyright law. Plaintiffs, including prominent authors Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, are challenging Meta’s assertion of “fair use” when it comes to training AI models on copyrighted books. Previous filings indicated CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s approval for using copyrighted works and a halt to licensing talks. However, these newly unsealed documents provide a far more granular and concerning look into Meta’s internal strategies. They consist largely of internal work chats between Meta employees, painting a vivid picture of how the tech giant might have incorporated copyrighted data into models like the Llama family. Let’s break down the key revelations from these court filings: “Ask Forgiveness, Not Permission” Mentality: A Meta research engineer, Xavier Martinet, explicitly suggested an “ask forgiveness, not permission” approach to acquiring books for Meta AI training data . This suggests a deliberate strategy to bypass traditional licensing and risk potential legal repercussions later. Retail Ebooks as Training Sets: Martinet proposed purchasing ebooks at retail price to circumvent licensing agreements with publishers, highlighting a potential loophole exploitation strategy for gathering copyrighted content AI training material. Dismissal of Legal Risks: Despite acknowledging the potential for legal challenges, Martinet downplayed these concerns by pointing to the likely widespread use of “pirated books” by AI startups. This reveals a potentially reckless attitude towards copyright law within Meta’s AI research teams. Libgen and the Pursuit of State-of-the-Art AI Models Perhaps the most alarming revelation is the discussion around using Libgen, a notorious “links aggregator” known for providing access to copyrighted works. Internal communications reveal that some Meta decision-makers considered Libgen “essential to meet SOTA numbers” (State-of-the-Art) for their AI models. Sony Theakanath, a Meta product management director, emphasized Libgen’s importance for achieving top-tier AI performance. This underscores the immense pressure within Meta to compete at the highest levels of AI development, even if it means venturing into legally murky territories to acquire Libgen AI data . To mitigate potential legal fallout from using sources like Libgen, Meta reportedly considered these “mitigations”: Data Scrubbing: Removing data from Libgen that was “clearly marked as pirated/stolen.” However, the effectiveness of such a superficial scrubbing process in addressing underlying copyright issues remains questionable. Non-Disclosure: Concealing the use of Libgen datasets in public disclosures about their AI models. This raises serious questions about transparency and ethical reporting in AI development. “IP Risky Prompts” and Data Scarcity Further complicating matters, the filings suggest Meta tuned its models to avoid “IP risky prompts.” This involved programming models to refuse requests that might directly reveal their training data sources or reproduce copyrighted content verbatim, such as asking for excerpts from copyrighted books. This reactive measure highlights an awareness of the legal sensitivities surrounding their AI model training lawsuit but also points to a potentially superficial approach to addressing the core copyright concerns. Moreover, the documents indicate that Meta’s leadership considered “overriding” previous decisions against using certain data sources, including Quora content and licensed books, due to a perceived need for “more data.” Chaya Nayak, a Meta product management director, stated that first-party data from Facebook and Instagram was insufficient, revealing a potential data scarcity problem driving the exploration of ethically and legally questionable data acquisition methods. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Copyright? Meta’s aggressive stance, evidenced by hiring Supreme Court litigators for their defense team, signals the high stakes involved in this legal battle. The outcome of Kadrey v. Meta could set significant precedents for how copyrighted content AI training is legally viewed and regulated in the future. For the cryptocurrency community and the broader tech world, this case serves as a critical reminder of the ethical and legal complexities intertwined with rapid AI advancement. Here are some key takeaways: Legal Precedent: The case could establish crucial legal boundaries for the use of copyrighted material in AI training. Ethical Implications: It raises profound ethical questions about data sourcing, transparency, and the responsibilities of AI developers. Industry Impact: The outcome could significantly influence how AI companies approach data acquisition and licensing in the future. Transparency Concerns: The revelations about non-disclosure of data sources highlight the need for greater transparency in AI development practices. As the legal proceedings unfold, the world watches to see if Meta’s pursuit of AI innovation will be deemed “fair use” or a reckless disregard for copyright law. The implications for the future of AI development and the rights of content creators are immense.

Crypto fund manager Canary Capital is making waves once again in the digital asset investment space. They’ve just submitted an amended S-1 form to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a highly anticipated exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks HBAR, the native cryptocurrency of the innovative Hedera Network. This development, spotlighted by Bloomberg’s ETF expert Eric Balchunas on X, signals a significant step forward in bringing HBAR closer to mainstream investment avenues. Could this be the breakthrough the Hedera community has been waiting for? Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development. What’s the Buzz Around the HBAR ETF Filing? For those unfamiliar, an S-1 form is a crucial document in the U.S. It’s the initial registration statement that companies must file with the SEC before they can offer securities, like an ETF, to the public. Canary Capital’s amended S-1 filing indicates they are actively pursuing the launch of an HBAR ETF , a financial product that would allow investors to gain exposure to HBAR without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. This is a big deal because ETFs can make investing in crypto more accessible to a wider range of investors, including institutional players who often prefer regulated and familiar investment vehicles. This isn’t Canary Capital’s first rodeo with crypto ETFs. They previously navigated a similar process for a Litecoin (LTC) ETF, showcasing their experience in this complex regulatory landscape. However, it’s important to note that while the amended S-1 is a positive step, a Form 19b-4, which is also required for ETF approval and is filed by the exchange listing the ETF, has not yet been submitted for the HBAR ETF . This means there are still regulatory hurdles to clear before the ETF can become a reality. Why is a Crypto ETF a Game Changer? Crypto ETFs represent a significant evolution in the cryptocurrency market. They bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. Here’s why they are considered so important: Accessibility: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to retail investors through brokerage accounts they already use. No need to navigate crypto exchanges or worry about wallet security. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering investors a sense of security and oversight that may be lacking in the often-unregulated crypto space. Diversification: A crypto ETF focused on HBAR would allow investors to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to the potential of the Hedera Network without needing to invest directly in HBAR and manage private keys. Institutional Investment: Many institutional investors are restricted from directly holding cryptocurrencies. ETFs provide a compliant and familiar way for them to enter the crypto market, potentially bringing significant capital inflows. Hedera Network: The Foundation of the HBAR ETF At the heart of this ETF buzz is the Hedera Network, a public distributed ledger platform that positions itself as a faster, more secure, and more energy-efficient alternative to traditional blockchains. Hedera Network utilizes Hashgraph, a patented distributed ledger technology, which offers several key advantages: Feature Hedera Hashgraph Traditional Blockchain Transaction Speed Thousands of transactions per second Slower, often single-digit TPS Transaction Cost Low, fixed fees Variable, often higher fees Energy Efficiency Highly energy-efficient More energy-intensive Security Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) Probabilistic finality in some cases HBAR, the native cryptocurrency of Hedera Network , fuels the ecosystem and is used for network services like transactions, smart contracts, and file storage. The network has been gaining traction with various real-world applications, from supply chain management to decentralized identity solutions, making an ETF tracking its performance an increasingly appealing prospect for investors. Canary Capital’s Strategic Move in the Crypto Space Canary Capital ‘s persistent efforts to launch crypto ETFs, starting with Litecoin and now HBAR, highlight their strategic vision for the future of digital asset investment. Their amended S-1 for the HBAR ETF, following their initial filing in November, demonstrates their commitment and belief in the long-term potential of both HBAR and the broader crypto market. By proactively navigating the complex SEC regulatory process, Canary Capital is positioning itself as a key player in bringing innovative crypto investment products to market. The fact that they are following a similar process to their Litecoin ETF application could suggest a degree of familiarity and potentially increased efficiency in their approach. However, the SEC’s stance on crypto ETFs remains cautious, and the absence of a Form 19b-4 filing for the HBAR ETF underscores that regulatory approval is not guaranteed. The crypto community will be watching closely for further developments. What’s Next for the Anticipated HBAR ETF? The submission of the amended S-1 is undoubtedly a positive step, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. The next key milestone to watch for is the filing of the Form 19b-4 by an exchange seeking to list the HBAR ETF . This form essentially requests permission from the SEC for the exchange to list and trade the ETF shares. Once both the S-1 and 19b-4 are under review, the SEC will then assess whether the proposed ETF meets the necessary regulatory requirements for investor protection and market integrity. The timeline for SEC review and potential approval is uncertain and can vary significantly. The crypto ETF landscape in the U.S. is still evolving, and while there’s growing optimism, regulatory hurdles remain. However, Canary Capital’s continued efforts and the increasing institutional interest in crypto suggest that the path towards a crypto ETF for HBAR, and potentially other digital assets, is gradually becoming clearer. Conclusion: A Hopeful Sign for HBAR and Crypto ETFs Canary Capital’s amended S-1 filing for an HBAR ETF is a significant development that injects renewed optimism into the crypto market, particularly for the Hedera community. It represents a tangible step towards greater accessibility and mainstream adoption of HBAR. While regulatory approval is not a certainty and further steps are needed, this move underscores the growing momentum behind crypto ETFs and the increasing recognition of digital assets as a legitimate investment class.

However the signing message was to change… — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 21, 2025 “However, the signing message was to change the smart contract logic of our ETH cold wallet,” posited Zhou. “[The] hacker took control of the specific ETH cold wallet we signed and transferred all ETH in the cold wallet to this unidentified address.” Shortly afterward, Zhou reassured users and the broader crypto industry that it would be able to deal with the loss. “Bybit is solvent even if this hack loss is not recovered, all of clients’ assets are 1 to 1 backed, we can cover the loss,” he wrote , adding that all other cold wallets were secure and withdrawals were normal. Flashbots strategy head Hasu also observed on X that the hack has not doomed Bybit. “If you want my serious take, Bybit has way more than 1.4 billion of revenue per year,” Hasu opined . “They are good for the money and will make all customers whole. It doesn’t matter for ETH because Bybit will honor customers’ ETH liabilities and buy back the assets on the open market.” Biggest Crypto Hack In History The amount stolen from Bybit on Friday is enormous, even by crypto standards. Decentralized finance (DeFi) commentator Patrick Scott said on X that the hack represents “16% of ALL previous crypto hacks.” This Bybit exploit is the largest of all time, representing 16% of ALL previous crypto hacks. pic.twitter.com/XWs6xZvmdm — Patrick Scott | Dynamo DeFi (@Dynamo_Patrick) February 21, 2025 In 2024, Japanese-headquartered exchange DMM fell victim to the largest crypto hack of that year when hackers pilfered Bitcoin worth over $300 million at the time. Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX was hacked for over $475 million in 2022. Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has offered to help Bybit while also recommending that the exchange should pause withdrawals as a security measure. “Not an easy situation to deal with. Might suggest to halt all withdrawals for a bit as a standard security precaution. Will provide any assistance if needed.

There has been widespread criticism amongst certain sectors that Ethereum is not doing enough to support blockchain casinos. Buterin responded that he would leave the crypto space if such a “moral reversal” occurred and that the very notion of a crypto casino goes against his fundamental beliefs. “Perhaps the most disappointing thing for me recently,” says Buterin, “was when someone said that Ethereum is bad and intolerant because we don’t respect the ‘casinos’ on the blockchain enough, and other chains are happy to accept any application, so they are better.” This comes at a critical time for the Ethereum Foundation. Buterin has suggested neutrality for the application layer and only limited support for specific projects. Financial concerns have consumed many discussions about the Foundation. Pure neutrality at the application layer would allow for more gambling. A more limited approach, conversely, would allow the Ethereum Foundation to uphold their own ethical standards, while making calculated and frugal decisions regarding funds. Buterin expressed disappointment at the online meetings, noticing an over-focus on issues such as crypto gambling. But he conceded that when he meets people in person they often express similar views to him, having a moral focus on the issue of casinos, rather than a purely financial concern. There may be other issues that Buterin is addressing by targeting online casinos. He may be taking a swipe at other tokens like Solana that have promoted meme coins without restraint. There may be other so-called ‘Ethereum killer’ tokens that Buterin is taking a swipe at. Perhaps the ‘ethical approach’, according to this perspective at least, is a case of sour grapes. The Ethereum price, after all, has been struggling in comparison to other tokens. This all comes as the Ethereum Foundation changes its strategy concerning funding, responding to concerns of the community that the foundation should fund projects with decentralized finance instead of merely selling Ethereum tokens. The foundation responded to this request by allocating 45,000 ETH, valued at $120 million, to defi solutions. This would involve funding platforms like Compound. The community agreed to the measures proposed.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News|Vitalik Buterin,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-22 04:09:19

This new challenger is fast rising with a project introduced with what has been dubbed the best crypto presale of 2025. This project delivers a PayFi solution that is quicker, easier to use and attracts lesser fees. This disruptor, Remittix (RTX) , has entered the PayFi market, making a resounding statement by enabling users to convert crypto to FIAT while making transfers to bank accounts worldwide with full control and anonymity. Remittix Presents the Best Crypto Presale of 2025 Backed by a rapidly growing community, massive investor influx and tangible real-world utilities, Remittix is fast gaining a hefty portion of the global payments market and competing with established players. Its success speaks for itself, as the project’s presale has now raised over $12.6 million, and investor interest continues to increase astronomically. This achievement explains why investors say it has all the makings to become the best crypto presale of 2025 RTX tokens are currently selling at $0.0628, making this a perfect time for early investors hoping to get in before the price rises further. Key Drivers Behind Remittix’s Thriving Adoption Seamless Crypto-to-FIAT Conversion and Transfers Despite the spike in the rate of crypto adoption lately, processing times for converting digital assets into FIAT haven’t improved while remaining pricey and mostly inefficient. With traditional exchange platforms, you battle high charges, lengthy withdrawal times, and cross-border transfers that feel just as restrictive as conventional banking systems. Businesses also have to deal with volatility, liquidity challenges, and the intricacies of crypto payment settlements. Enters Remittix, a new project that is getting rid of these hindrances. The PayFi platform facilitates users to instantly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT and send funds directly to any global bank account in their preferred currency. Remittix users do not experience unexpected fees when transacting. They also enjoy full control over their money as there are no intermediaries. Users also stay anonymous when making these payments. Remittix has introduced a simple, seamless and efficient way to leverage crypto for everyday people. Finally, with Remittix, users can send crypto assets globally and their payments get reflected in their preferred FIAT currency that same day, without the additional charges or delays. Global Remittance Ease With Uncompromised Privacy While financial privacy has become more difficult to come by in the modern financial market, no thanks to banks and payment intermediaries getting increasingly scrutinized, Remittix comes with a discreet alternative that replaces traditional payment services lacking privacy. Remittix guarantees that your payment recipients get a standard bank transfer alert that reveals no trace of the payment coming from a crypto source. This process allows users to easily move their funds without having to endure invasive financial tracking. Remittix Presale Capital Soars Past $12.6 Million Remittix (RTX) is the new kid on the block, having raised over $12.6 million in only a few weeks of its record-breaking presale . As the current phase sells out fast, savvy investors can start accumulating their share of the promising RTX tokens for an affordable price of $0.0628. Thanks to the innovative upgrade this project brings to crypto-to-FIAT transactions, analysts dub its ICO the best crypto presale this year. They also predict it will deliver 800% price returns before the presale ends, with more profits expected as the project gains widespread acceptance and usage.

Among the many emerging and established cryptos, Qubetics ($TICS), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Bittensor TAO (TAO) stand out. These digital currencies aren’t just numbers on a screen—they have massive growth potential. The big question is: Which of these top cryptos will skyrocket in 2025 and beyond? Well, the answer lies in their unique use cases and market strategies. Qubetics ($TICS) is currently in its presale stage, catching eyes with its innovative solutions for cross-border transactions. It has already raised more than $13.5 million and sold over 483 million tokens, which speaks volumes about its growth trajectory. On the other hand, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continues to maintain its place in the crypto landscape due to its low-cost and fast transaction capabilities. Bittensor TAO (TAO) is also a fascinating option, as its decentralized machine learning framework positions it as a unique crypto player. Together, they make up an exciting trio of cryptocurrencies ready for massive growth. But here’s where it gets really interesting: Qubetics isn’t just offering another digital currency for transactions—it’s solving real-world problems in the crypto space. From simplifying cross-border transactions for individuals and businesses alike, to providing scalability and efficiency, Qubetics is built to address the challenges that Bitcoin Cash and Bittensor TAO haven’t fully tackled yet. As these projects continue to develop, it’ll explore how each can pave the way for the future of digital finance. Qubetics ($TICS): Solving Real-World Problems with Blockchain Tech Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency—it’s the next level of blockchain technology. Currently in its 22nd stage of presale, Qubetics has already sold over 483 million tokens, raising more than $13.5 million. And with over 20,800 holders already on board, it’s clear that this project is heating up. So, what’s all the buzz about? One of the biggest challenges in the global economy today is the inefficiency of cross-border transactions. Whether you’re a business, a freelancer, or an individual, sending money across borders can be costly, slow, and riddled with intermediaries. Qubetics aims to change that by providing a more streamlined, affordable solution. With a focus on cross-border transactions, Qubetics is creating a platform that enables businesses and individuals to send money quickly and with minimal fees. For many people, this feature is a game-changer, especially in the age of remote work and international business. What makes Qubetics different from others like Bitcoin Cash and Bittensor TAO is its emphasis on solving real-life problems. Bitcoin Cash might be fast, but its use in cross-border payments still involves certain limitations in scalability and transaction fees. Bittensor TAO, while innovative, is more focused on decentralized machine learning rather than optimizing cross-border payment systems. Qubetics ($TICS), however, bridges that gap with its blockchain solution that simplifies and speeds up cross-border transactions while ensuring security and transparency. At $0.08073 per token in this best crypto presale , many analysts are predicting substantial ROI once the presale ends, with expectations of $1 after the presale and possibly $5 post-mainnet launch. Imagine the potential here—over 6093% ROI if it reaches $5, which could create a serious buzz in the crypto space. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Keeping Speed and Low Costs at the Forefront Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was born from a hard fork of the original Bitcoin network, designed to address scalability issues and reduce transaction fees. By increasing the block size, Bitcoin Cash has been able to process transactions more efficiently compared to Bitcoin (BTC), making it a popular choice for day-to-day payments. But despite its clear advantages, BCH has its own set of challenges. One of the biggest factors that affect Bitcoin Cash’s adoption is competition. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Binance Coin, and even newer projects like Qubetics are vying for the top spot, offering similar or superior solutions for fast, low-cost transactions. Still, Bitcoin Cash continues to be one of the most widely used and traded altcoins, especially for those who need to make quick transactions across borders without high fees. In the face of emerging competitors, Bitcoin Cash has focused on improving scalability and expanding its network to ensure that it remains a viable alternative to traditional financial systems. Bitcoin Cash’s low transaction fees and fast speeds make it a solid contender in the world of payment-based cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin Cash is not without its hurdles. As the market evolves, Bitcoin Cash will need to continue innovating and adapting to the changes brought on by new technologies like Qubetics. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin Cash has shown resilience in maintaining its status as a top cryptocurrency. With steady growth and a dedicated user base, BCH is expected to remain a significant player in the crypto space for the foreseeable future. Bittensor TAO (TAO): Machine Learning Meets Decentralization Bittensor TAO (TAO) is a unique cryptocurrency that focuses on decentralized machine learning. It’s designed to allow developers to build and share machine learning models in a decentralized network, opening up opportunities for innovation in AI and blockchain. The project’s primary focus is to create a more open, scalable, and efficient way of training and deploying machine learning models, making it a highly technical yet incredibly promising blockchain solution. While Bittensor TAO is a fascinating concept, it faces a different challenge than Bitcoin Cash or Qubetics—adoption. The world of decentralized machine learning is still in its infancy, and while the potential for revolutionizing AI is immense, it may take time for Bittensor TAO to achieve widespread use. Bittensor TAO’s price and demand fluctuate based on the interest in decentralized machine learning, and its growth will largely depend on the success of its technology in attracting developers and companies to its network. The machine learning space is already competitive, with giants like Google and OpenAI leading the charge in AI development, so Bittensor TAO will need to find a unique niche to succeed in the crowded space. However, the potential for Bittensor TAO is clear. The ability to decentralize AI training and development could reshape industries, from healthcare to finance to entertainment. As move forward, it’ll likely see more use cases emerge that prove just how disruptive Bittensor TAO can be in the world of machine learning. Cross-Border Transactions: Why They’re Crucial for the Future of Finance Cross-border transactions are one of the most fundamental use cases for cryptocurrency. With traditional banks and financial institutions, sending money across borders can take days and involve steep fees. In contrast, cryptocurrency can make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, and more secure. That’s why projects like Qubetics are so important—they’re not just about offering a new digital currency, but creating a seamless financial ecosystem that addresses the real-world problems of international payments. In today’s global economy, businesses and individuals need a way to send money across borders quickly and efficiently. Cryptocurrency offers a solution to this problem by allowing transactions to be processed in minutes, rather than days. Qubetics aims to make cross-border transactions not only faster but also more accessible, reducing the barriers to entry for people in underbanked regions. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the demand for faster, more affordable cross-border payments will continue to grow. Cryptocurrencies like Qubetics are poised to meet this demand, offering a more efficient solution than traditional financial systems ever could. Conclusion: The Future of Digital Finance The cryptocurrency space is rapidly evolving, and projects like Qubetics, Bitcoin Cash, and Bittensor TAO are leading the charge in redefining how people think about money, transactions, and decentralization. With Qubetics focusing on solving real-world problems like cross-border transactions, Bitcoin Cash remaining a fast and affordable alternative to traditional payment systems, and Bittensor TAO exploring the world of decentralized machine learning, the future of crypto is looking brighter than ever. So, what’s the takeaway here? Qubetics has a unique opportunity to be the solution to a significant global challenge. If you’re looking to invest in a project with top cryptos for massive growth potential, now’s the time to get in on the Qubetics presale.

Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the country is still actively seeking membership in the economic alliance led by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa after decades of being shut out of the European Union. Speaking to Bloomberg on Friday, Fidan confirmed that Turkey is “exploring joining groups including BRICS” because it needs more economic options. “The EU was our first choice,” he said. “If we cannot be part of the EU, then other alternatives are always on the table.” Turkey, while officially a NATO member, has increasingly positioned itself as a neutral power between the East and West. The country has refused to join Western sanctions on Russia and has maintained strong trade and energy ties with Moscow, even as NATO allies criticize its decision-making. Turkey officially applied for BRICS membership in November 2024 but was only given “partner-country status,” a secondary position that does not come with voting rights or full membership benefits. Fidan made it clear that Ankara is not satisfied with that status. “We are interested, but we have not been offered a membership yet,” Fidan said at the G-20 foreign ministers’ summit in Johannesburg, South Africa on Friday. As aforementioned, Turkey’s push toward BRICS is a direct result of its longstanding failure to gain entry into the EU. The country first applied for EU membership in 1987, but its candidacy has been stuck in negotiations for over three decades now. Brussels has repeatedly blocked Ankara’s entry, citing concerns over human rights, democratic standards, and political differences. During his interview , Fidan dismissed those reasons, saying that the real issue is cultural discrimination. Ankara has long accused the EU of deliberately stalling its membership because it is a Muslim-majority nation. Turkey’s push for multilateral action is reflected in its approach to Africa, where it has forged ties with countries like Somalia on counterterrorism. “Turkey is offering an opportunity for some African countries,” Fidan said. The BRICS expansion and de-dollarization The BRICS group has added five new members in the past year, including Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Indonesia. Saudi Arabia has also been invited but has not made a final decision yet. Turkey, along with Malaysia and Thailand, is one of the latest nations who want to join the group. Fidan told Bloomberg that: “In the modern world, no one country can alone overcome economic and political issues. Self-help is on the menu for every nation-state.” Turkey is particularly interested in BRICS’s financial cooperation, which includes efforts to reduce reliance on the US dollar in global trade. The bloc has been pushing for de-dollarization, with many members already settling oil and trade transactions in their local currencies instead of the dollar. This has drawn a direct response from Donald Trump, who will return to the White House in 2025. US President Donald Trump has threatened economic retaliation against any country that ditches the greenback. “The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER. We are going to require a commitment from these seemingly hostile countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US economy,” Trump said in a Truth Social post even before he won the Nov. 5 elections. Russia and China, the two leading voices in BRICS, have been the biggest drivers of de-dollarization. Moscow, which has been cut off from Western financial systems due to US sanctions, is pushing for a BRICS-based cross-border payment system that would operate outside Washington’s influence. The New Development Bank (NDB), the BRICS-led financial institution, has also ramped up lending. Since its launch in 2015, the bank has approved nearly $33 billion in loans, focusing on infrastructure and development projects in member states. But that figure is still much lower than the World Bank’s $117.5 billion in commitments for 2024. BRICS’s ultimate goal is to create a multipolar world order, moving power away from the United States and Europe. China, in particular, has been actively pulling Global South nations into its economic orbit to challenge Western financial dominance. But the expansion has created tensions within BRICS itself as India is against it, in fears that it would turn into a pro-China alliance. Brazil was hesitant too, worried about damaging its carefully-cultivated ties with the US and Europe. When Biden was president, Russia was the leading voice behind sticking it to America, but Trump’s win might’ve messed with that plan as presidents Putin and Trump rekindle their friendship, so the former said he was no longer interested in dethroning USD.

Trump’s Statement on Cryptocurrency and the SEC A video attached to a tweet from crypto enthusiast JackTheRippler featured Trump discussing the treatment of cryptocurrency under the Biden administration. In his remarks, Trump criticized regulatory agencies, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for a “hostile” approach toward digital assets. He claimed that these agencies engaged in politically motivated indictments and only softened their stance near the end of Biden’s term due to the large number of cryptocurrency users. Trump suggested that his intervention helped many individuals who were facing legal scrutiny, stating, “I saved your life,” about those who were indicted. He framed his actions as part of a broader effort to position the United States at the forefront of technological innovation, particularly in AI and blockchain. BREAKING: Donald Trump says: “I have signed executive orders to keep the United States at the forefront of artificial intelligence and to end Joe Biden's war on Bitcoin and crypto. We ended that war totally, that war is over!” The SEC v. RIPPLE case is coming to an end! #XRP pic.twitter.com/SEUlSCafWE — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) February 20, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for the SEC v. Ripple Case One of the key takeaways from JackTheRippler’s tweet was the suggestion that the SEC v. Ripple case may soon end. The lawsuit, which began in December 2020, revolves around the SEC’s allegations that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP. The case has had significant implications for the regulatory landscape of digital assets. Both investors and industry participants highly anticipate its resolution. While Trump did not directly reference the SEC v. Ripple case in his remarks, his strong criticism of the agency’s actions suggests that regulatory policies could shift if he returned to office. The SEC’s treatment of cryptocurrency firms, including Ripple , has been a contentious issue, with many in the industry calling for clearer and more favorable regulations. Potential Impact on Crypto Policy Trump’s announcement signals a potential departure from the current regulatory stance on digital assets. His remarks suggest that, under his leadership, cryptocurrency could receive more government support and fewer regulatory restrictions. If this policy shift materializes, it could encourage innovation, attract institutional investors, and provide greater clarity for blockchain-based projects operating in the U.S. However, it remains to be seen how these executive orders will be implemented and what specific actions will follow. Given the complex regulatory landscape and ongoing legal battles, including the SEC v. Ripple case, the cryptocurrency community watches closely for further developments.

The shared chart focuses on historical resistance levels, Fibonacci extension points, and a multi-phase Parabolic Arc formation. XRP Eyes $6—But This Key Level Stands In The Way Egrag Crypto’s chart shows XRP trading near $2.67, coming off a notable bullish surge but now contending with a red horizontal band between roughly $2.75 and $3.00. The upper boundary at $3.00 holds dual significance: it marks a psychologically important level and also corresponds to a critical area from previous cycle peaks. A monthly close above this line would strongly suggest a bullish continuation, potentially setting the stage for a move toward the next Fibonacci extension marks. “XRP current price action is trading at $2.67, showing a strong bullish move but facing resistance at the red horizontal zone (~$2.75-$2.83-$2.910 and $3.00),” Egrag states. The analyst particularly highlights Fib 1.414 near $4.30 and Fib 1.618 around $6.40 as the next barriers if $3.00 is decisively broken. A volume surge would strengthen the bullish case and provide extra confirmation for the run to unfold. Related Reading: XRP Price Consolidation Completed: Will Wave 3 Propel Prices Beyond The $5 Barrier? Failure to overtake $3.00, however, could trigger a correction back into the $1.90–$2.00 support region identified by earlier candle closes. Egrag Crypto notes that if $1.90 fails to hold, a more extensive drop toward $0.90–$1.00 could ensue, which the analyst labels as a potential “Black Swan” scenario likely driven by broader market turmoil rather than XRP-specific weakness. Egrag writes: “Breaking below $1.90 could shift sentiment to bearish, introducing downside risks toward the $0.90-$1.00 range. This would signal a potential Black Swan event across all markets! Such a collapse would be a challenging prelude before the ignition stage for XRP. Honestly, I don’t favor this scenario, as it would be stressful for all of us, including many OGs. Could the upcoming fort knox auditing be the catalyst for this Black Swan.” Related Reading: Pundit Who Correctly Predicted XRP Price Crash To $2.5 Says Demand Zone Will Send It Soaring In the long term, the chart presents three sweeping parabolic arcs—colored yellow, green, and blue—which suggest that XRP may be building a broad-scale bullish structure. Price targets in the $33–$60 range reflect these arcs and channel extensions, though much hinges on whether a monthly close above $3.00 can usher in sustained momentum. Beyond the $6.40 level at Fib 1.618, Egrag Crypto identifies additional Fibonacci-related checkpoints, such as $8, $13, $27, and $67 (Fib 1.888). These higher levels would remain speculative until XRP clears the nearer hurdles and demonstrates stable volume influx and price structure. “Volume and momentum confirmation would be crucial in the[se] coming phases,” he adds. While the path forward depends on technical breakouts, Egrag Crypto underscores that near-term movement around $3.00 will be pivotal for setting the tone. A successful break above resistance could confirm targets in the $4–$6 window, and eventually open the door to the lofty parabolic objectives. At press time, XRP traded at $2.6198.

One such asset is Ondo (ONDO), the native token of the Ondo ecosystem. It is a decentralized finance (DeFi) network that leverages blockchain technology to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs). ONDO Dominates RWAs Space According to a tweet by the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, ONDO is currently dominating the real-world assets space. The asset has outperformed most RWA tokens and has the highest transaction volume. $ONDO is dominating the RWA space, posting the highest transaction volume and significantly outperforming other tokens, even in the current sluggish market pic.twitter.com/j7KV79dL1K — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) February 19, 2025 IntoTheBlock data shows Ondo’s transaction volume hovering close to $300 million, compared to other projects whose numbers are less than $40 million. A few weeks ago, Ondo’s transaction volume spiked to roughly $450 million before a steep plunge that saw the metric hover around $200 million. However, it has begun to rise again and is well on its way to smashing the $300 million mark. Although ONDO dominates transaction volumes, the same cannot be said for asset prices. As the fifth-largest RWA by market cap, ONDO was worth $1.23 at the time of writing, recording a slight uptick in the past 24 hours. The asset was down 7% weekly and 6% monthly, according to data from CoinMarketCap. ONDO is among the most visited tokens on CoinMarketCap, but the asset still lacks the daily and monthly momentum seen among its rivals. Ondo Records Significant Developments Nevertheless, the Ondo project has recorded several developments lately. The team recently unveiled the Ondo Chain, a layer-1 blockchain built for institutional-grade RWAs. The developers said Ondo Chain was built to end the lack of features necessary for regulated assets to thrive on-chain. The new network aims to crush infrastructure barriers for tokenized regulated securities. The barriers include incompatibility with DeFi, cross-chain liquidity fragmentation, high and volatile transaction fees, and inadequate security. Ondo Chain combines the openness of public blockchains with the compliance and security features of permissioned networks. Besides the introduction of the Ondo Chain, Ondo Finance recently secured a strategic collaboration with the U.S. President Donald Trump-backed DeFi protocol, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), to accelerate the adoption of tokenized RWAs. The alliance sees WLFI exploring the integration of Ondo’s tokenized assets into the WLFI network as treasury reserve assets.

Primarily against Bybit’s recent $1.4 billion hack, over $566 million was liquidated across the broader market in the last 24 hours. As a result, BTC price price lost nearly 2% and slipped back to the $96K level on Saturday. Further, ETH and other leading altcoins have also followed the waning trajectory. Crypto Market Today: BTC, ETH & Altcoins Suffer Amid Bybit’s Hack & Massive Liquidations Notably, the crypto exchange behemoth Bybit recently suffered an exploitation attack, resulting in the theft of $1.4 billion ETH from the platform. CoinGape reported that the mastermind behind this hack was ‘The Lazarus Group ,’ a North Korean cybercriminal organization. As a response to the hack, the crypto market saw $566.64 liquidated in the last 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The massive liquidations, underscoring panic selling, in turn brought significant heat to cryptocurrency prices. Further, the global cryptocurrency market cap slipped 1.98% from yesterday to reach $3.17 trillion. BTC Price Backtracks To $96K In sync with the colossal liquidations, BTC price witnessed a 2% loss in value over the past 24 hours, resting at $96,170. The flagship coin’s intraday bottom and peak were $94,852.96 and $99,497.97, respectively. Coinglass data showed that Bitcoin recorded $199.44 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours. Simultaneously, its market dominance slipped marginally by 0.01% to 60.29%. ETH Price Takes Heat Amid Crypto Market’s New Hack ETH price tanked nearly 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $2,674. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $2,616.92 and $2,842.83, respectively. Ethereum recorded liquidations worth $141.76 million in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, market watchers remain cautious about the coin’s future movements in light of the massive Bybit hack. Given that the hackers decide to sell the stolen funds ahead, heightened selling pressure could pull the price further down. XRP Price Cracks 3% XRP price fell by 3% intraday and is now sitting at $2.57. The coin hit a bottom and peak of $2.51 and $2.71 in the last 24 hours. Notably, the Ripple-backed asset saw liquidations worth $14.95 million over the past day and followed the broader market trend to dip in the red zone. SOL Price Slips 2% SOL price saw a 2% decline in the past 24 hours and is now trading at $170. The coin swooped to a low of $167.31 and a high of $180.43 in the last 24 hours. Solana recorded liquidations worth $22.24 million intraday, aligning with the market trend. Meme Crypto Market Also Tumbles Dogecoin: DOGE price saw a 4% drop to $0.2417 amid $14.03 million liquidated in the Dogecoin market. Shiba Inu : SHIB price waned by 2% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.00001516, mirroring the market trend. Even Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Official Trump (TRUMP) prices cracked 2%-5%, reaching $0.000009188 and $16.08, respectively. The meme coin market has primarily mirrored the broader market trend as the week comes to a close.

The coin has erased all the gains made in the last seven days and is down by more than 8%. According to analysts, the immediate support zone might be used as a foundation for a rally if the price continues to hold strong. There are two possible scenarios for XRP’s price movements: one where it could be nearing the end of a correction, or another where it might be starting a new phase of upward movement. The First Scenario: A Correction Almost Done? In this scenario, XRP might have completed its correction phase and is ready to begin moving higher. After a significant price drop on February 3, the market saw a rally and a subsequent pullback. If this correction has now finished, we could see XRP start moving upwards again, potentially pushing the price to new all-time highs. If this scenario plays out, price could expect the price to rise towards $3.40, which was the previous high point. However, this scenario will be invalid if the price falls below the critical level of $2.47 or the support zone at $2.52. The Second Scenario: A Deeper Pullback Ahead In the second scenario, XRP might still be in the middle of a deeper correction, and the price could fall even further before resuming its upward trend. In this case, the price might find support at levels around $2.22, $2.10, or even $1.95. If the price breaks below $2.52, this would confirm that the price is in the midst of a deeper pullback. If this happens, we could see the price target in the $2.26 to $2.31 range before any recovery begins.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 05:04:56

Bybit CEO Allegation A recent controversy stems from Ben Zhou’s comments , who pointed to a 2023 warning from Chinese police that called Pi Network a scam. The police said Pi Network targeted elderly people, collected their data, and caused financial losses, including their pensions. Additionally, Zhou also denied claims about Bybit and Pi Network.

Just as Coinbase celebrated the SEC dropping its lawsuit, Bybit got drained of $1.5 billion, the biggest crypto theft ever recorded. The Dubai-based exchange, which handles $36 billion in daily trades, confirmed the breach almost immediately as CEO Ben Zhou shared via a post on X that hackers took over an Ethereum cold wallet and emptied it into an unknown address. The hack of course shook Bitcoin up a bit as it tumbled by over 3% from $98,000 to around $96,000, according to data from CoinGecko. The Bybit hack is now fueling concerns about crypto security under deregulation. With the SEC pulling back, exchanges are facing fewer compliance checks, making them easier targets for hackers. Hilary Allen, a professor at American University, warned , “Deregulated markets sound good until you have this type of attack. In the short term, we are seeing a lot of cheering for the peeling away of a lot of regulations. But be careful what you wish for.” Meanwhile, on-chain detective ZachXBT has since traced the stolen Ethereum of Bybit to wallets linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. The notorious state-sponsored cybercrime unit has been responsible for some of the biggest crypto heists in history, including the $235 million WazirX attack and $50 million Radiant Capital breach. Lazarus follows a long-term laundering process, making fund recovery nearly impossible. They convert stolen tokens to Ethereum, swap it for Bitcoin, and mix transactions before cashing out through Chinese OTC brokers. The process can take years, and in some cases, Lazarus has been known to sit on stolen funds for over six years before moving them. Even though Bybit secured a loan to cover withdrawals, it still has to pay it back. The stolen funds are gone for good, which means Bybit will be forced to buy Ethereum on the market to settle its debts. That creates an unusual dynamic: Bybit’s buy pressure could push ETH prices up, while Lazarus dumps ETH for Bitcoin, keeping downward pressure on BTC over time. For traders, that means Ethereum may hold steady, but Bitcoin could face long-term sell pressure as North Korea slowly cashes out its gains. Bybit faces a bank run run on withdrawals Crypto traders noticed unusual outflows from Bybit before the company even made an announcement. Soon after his statement, Zhou went live on X to properly address the community. “Hacker took control of the specific ETH cold wallet we signed and transferred all ETH in the cold wallet to this unidentified address,” Zhou said. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen downplayed the impact, saying in Chinese that: “Bybit is a respectable competitor and partner. Although the loss this time is huge, it is only their annual profit. I believe that customer funds are 100% safe. There is no need to panic or run on the bank. Come on, Ben!” By then, panic had set in. Bybit faced a massive bank run, receiving 350,000 withdrawal requests within 10 hours. The flood of exits outpaced the platform’s processing speed, leaving 2,100 requests stuck in the queue as Bybit’s team worked through the night. Even though Bybit had $16.2 billion in reserves, losing $1.5 billion in Ethereum and derivatives meant 9% of its total assets were wiped out. Zhou kept reassuring users that the exchange was solvent, but traders were not taking chances. With billions gone, Bybit had to act fast to avoid insolvency fears. Rival exchange Bitget stepped in with a 40,000 ETH ($106 million) loan to help stabilize withdrawals. Bitget( @bitgetglobal ) transferred 40,000 $ETH ($106M) to Bybit( @Bybit_Official ) as a loan to handle customer withdrawals. https://t.co/FQPc0gSLxX pic.twitter.com/y5BigWoONf — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 22, 2025 Zhou, running on zero sleep, told users, “Since the hack, we have experienced the most number of withdrawals that we have ever seen.” Bybit’s team processed 99.994% of requests, asking customers to “leave a comment if your withdrawal is completed.” Lazarus Group launders funds for North Korea’s weapons program Security experts at Chainalysis say Lazarus funnels stolen crypto into North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program. The group has been a top target of U.S. and U.N. sanctions, but their methods keep evolving. In 2021 alone, Lazarus stole $400 million from centralized exchanges and investment firms. Interestingly, in terms of dollar value, Bitcoin now accounts for less than one fourth of the cryptos stolen by the hackers. In 2021, only 20% of the stolen funds were Bitcoin, whereas 22% were either ERC-20 tokens or altcoins. And for the first time ever, Ether accounted for a majority of the funds stolen at 58%. The laundering process has grown more complex, with Lazarus using mixers to hide transactions. Chainalysis data shows that in 2019, only 21% of stolen funds were mixed, but by 2021, that number jumped to 65%. Chainalysis said in its report, “Chainalysis has identified $170 million in current balances—representing the stolen funds of 49 separate hacks spanning from 2017 to 2021—that are controlled by North Korea but have yet to be laundered through services.” Meanwhile, Zhou updated the users that, “12 hr from the worst hack in history. ALL withdraws have been processed. Our withdraw system is now fully back to normal pace, you can withdraw any amount and experience no delays. Thanks for your patience and we are sorry that this has happened.” He added that Bybit will come out with full incident report as well as security measurement in the next few days.

33767162,[object Object],1740202243,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF On The Brink Of Major Change With NYSE’s Staking Proposal,https://bitcoinist.com/grayscales-ethereum-etf-on-the-brink-major-change/,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has submitted a proposed rule change aimed at allowing the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and the Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust (EZET) to stake their ETH holdings. This proposal is particularly noteworthy because it seeks to enable the trusts to earn rewards on their staked ETH while ensuring that the assets remain under the custody of their current custodian. Grayscale Advocates For Staking In Crypto ETFs Staking, a process integral to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) model, allows holders to earn yield on their assets. By staking through trusted providers, ETHE and EZET could potentially bolster their returns, making these investment vehicles more attractive to institutional investors who are increasingly seeking opportunities that offer staking benefits. Unlike traditional staking-as-a-service models, which have drawn scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Grayscale claims that its approach is designed exclusively for the benefit of fund shareholders. This means that the assets will not be pooled with those of third parties, which could mitigate some regulatory concerns . Industry advocates, including organizations such as Jito Labs and Multicoin Capital, have been vocal in their support for integrating staking features into exchange-traded funds (ETFs). They argue that doing so would not only benefit investors but also more accurately reflect the advantages of native network assets . Furthermore, incorporating staking into ETFs could empower issuers to contribute to the security of the networks on which these assets operate. Ethereum Surpasses Bitcoin In ETF Inflows The proposed rule change comes at a crucial time for Grayscale, especially as its ETHE product has faced substantial outflows—nearly $4 billion—making it the largest loser among Ethereum investment products since the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs. In contrast, the EZET has struggled to gain market traction , attracting only $650 million in inflows, which is minimal compared to its competitors. Other Ethereum spot ETFs, notably those managed by BlackRock and Fidelity, have seen significant inflows, largely due to their lower fees and strong institutional backing. The Ethereum ETF market’s dynamics are shifting, with Ethereum now gaining momentum in terms of ETF flows, even surpassing Bitcoin in inflows for the first week of February, as reported by CoinShares. If the NYSE Arca proposal is approved, it could significantly enhance the appeal of ETHE and EZET, providing a much-needed boost to their performance and potentially curbing outflows. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $2,645, recording a 20% loss in the monthly time frame for the market’s second largest cryptocurrency.

The emerging project 1Fuel has gained substantial market attention because of its potential for 100x returns after the crypto presale. Bonuses exceeding 40% remain available before February 23, making this opportunity an ideal chance to maximize substantial returns. Pepe price volatility pushes investors to consider new opportunities Because of its position as a meme coin, Pepe’s price faces huge wide swings, influenced by market sentiment and crypto whales. Investors who hold Pepe for the long term now doubt that the coin will sustain its upward trajectory during the next market boom. The price of Pepe, as depicted on CoinMarketCap, decreased by 39.94%, within the past month, leading traders to change their investment strategies. Industry experts predict that Pepe will encounter difficulties returning to previous price levels unless new significant utility systems and ecosystem innovations become available. Pepe holders are increasingly showing interest in 1Fuel due to its practical usage and successful crypto presale so far. The new project every PEPE investor should consider 1Fuel stands apart from meme coins because it creates a revolutionary crypto infrastructure that simplifies the process of cross-chain transactions. It provides users with a convenient platform to exchange digital assets among networks without needing multiple wallets. The 1Fuel platform prioritizes user privacy through built-in safety features, such as cold storage solutions, which combine with a transaction mixer to provide complete anonymity. PEPE, on the other hand, has not implemented these security measures. The best factor encouraging owners to explore 1Fuel is its exceptional crypto presale offers. This project’s public presale is in stage 4, with $2.3 million raised. Once $2.5 million is raised, it will provide a 20% bonus to all buyers who purchase before February 23. All purchasers will also receive a 40% bonus for all purchases until February 23 and 20% on all purchases to date for the presale target of $3 million. Why 1Fuel could be a 100x opportunity after launch The cryptocurrency field anticipates 1Fuel to turn into one of the top investments of 2024 after launch because analysts predict a 100x price increase following its release. The anticipated growth comes from innovative features like making transactions across networks easy and cost-effective with the help of AI. The platform provides three essential features: users can benefit from P2P transactions and 30% staking rewards with the planned development of virtual and physical crypto debit cards. Experts anticipate 1Fuel will experience extreme price growth after it lists on significant exchanges. Conclusion The market events impacting Pepe have led numerous investors toward choosing 1Fuel as their upcoming solution. The combination of revolutionary interchain operation features, robust security standards, and lucrative pre-sale events makes 1Fuel an exceptional entry point for diversifying crypto investments at a rapidly growing rate. Participating in the presale is likely a wise choice, as a 100x surge is possible. There is also excellent bonus potential: up to 40% on tokens bought before February 23 and 20% on all past tokens once the presale reaches $3 million.

40673543,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=680269,1740202521,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40673543.jpeg,Trump revives tariff probe over foreign digital taxes on US Tech,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-revives-tariff-probe-digital-taxes/,"President Trump ordered the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) to propose import tariffs on countries that levy digital taxes on US tech companies. According to a White House fact sheet, Trump wants the US Trade Representative office to reopen investigations initiated during his first term into countries that impose digital service taxes ( DSTs) to discriminate against US companies. With this move, he hopes to discourage foreign governments from taxing major US tech corporations like Alphabet and Meta. Trump even commented, “What they’re doing to us in other countries is terrible with digital.” Trump’s administration imposed tariffs on countries with DSTs in 2019, during his first term. When asked to give more details on Trump’s plans, a white house official stated that the president will not have other countries “appropriate America’s tax base” for their own gains. This is not Trump’s first time raising concerns about foreign government taxation policies. In 2019, the USTR investigated the tax systems of France, Italy, India, Spain, and other countries under Trump’s orders. It concluded then that their digital service taxes were discriminatory and harmed American tech firms. Thus, the office launched Section 301 unfair trade practices against these countries, necessitating tariffs on some imports. Since then, some countries opted to pull back their tax plans and even settled for international talks on reduced taxes on tech firms. However, there’s not really been much progress from their discussions. Currently, France, Turkey, Spain, Britain, Italy, India, Canada, and Austria have all imposed taxes on US tech sales revenues. Moreover, the Computer and Communications Industry Association estimates that roughly 30 countries have levied DSTs in the last few years, with Canada imposing them in 2024. Trump’s plans to counter DSTs could escalate tensions between the US and Europe France’s finance minister, Eric Lombard, has insisted that they will not withdraw their digital service taxes on US tech multinationals. In an interview with Bloomberg, he stated, “It’s not changing.” arguing that their tax policy is not a negotiating tool. He also argued that taxes are a question of sovereignty and that every nation has its policies, hoping that their stance would not result in a conflict with the US government. The European nation was actually one of the first to implement DSTs, and they had previously started negotiations with the US to reverse some of its tax plans. However, the two countries never completed their negotiations, and France’s taxes are still hitting hard American tech corporations. With the Trump administration considering retaliatory measures against France and other European nations, tensions could escalate—especially since most of Europe opposes Trump’s decision to negotiate a truce directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine war. Aside from the digital service tax issue, the Trump administration wants to check whether any European Union or UK practices incentivize US companies to develop products that undermine free speech. Trump and Vice President JD Vance have spoken over some of European regulations that they claim have stifled conservative voices.

By the time the market closed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had plunged 748.63 points (1.69%) to 43,428.02. The S&P 500 lost 1.71%, finishing at 6,013.13, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2% to 19,524.01. Traders offloaded stocks as fears mounted about the weekend—another 48 hours where Trump could drop more tariff bombs after already threatening (repeatedly) to slap a 25% duty on cars, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals. Meanwhile, a closely watched measure of consumer confidence issued by the University of Michigan fell sharply in February from January. The survey also showed long-term inflation expectations reached the highest level since 1995. The housing market is breaking down. Sales of existing homes fell 4.9% in January, a far sharper decline than expected. Buyers are pulling back, squeezed by sky-high mortgage rates and rising home prices. That wasn’t the only red flag. The US services sector just shrank at its fastest rate in over two years, according to the latest S&P Global data. Business activity is slowing, and tariffs are making it worse. “The upbeat mood seen at the start of the year has evaporated,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global. “Uncertainty is rising, business activity is stalling, and inflation remains a serious issue.” Wall Street’s biggest names take a hit Big tech got crushed as investors bailed on high-growth names like Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Palantir, and other investor favorites. According to data rom Google Finance, the risk-off sentiment sent cash pouring into defensive stocks, with Procter & Gamble rising 1.8% and General Mills and Kraft Heinz gaining over 3%. Walmart felt the pain too. The stock dropped 2.5%, its second straight day of declines, after the company warned that the consumer outlook is weakening. For the week, the S&P 500 slid 1.7%, while the Dow and Nasdaq both lost 2.5%. The sell-off was accompanied by a rally in Treasury notes, as investors sought the relative safety of government debt, and come at the end of a week of continued geopolitical uncertainty. The Federal Reserve is now in focus. Market bets on interest rate cuts changed fast, with traders now seeing a 55% chance that the Fed will cut rates two to three times by the end of 2025, bringing them down to 3.50%-3.75% from the current 4.25%-4.50%. On Thursday, those odds were just 44.4%. By October, futures suggest a 50-50 chance of a deeper cut between half and three-quarters of a percentage point—a massive change in expectations from just a day before, when the probability was only 38%. Options expiry adds to market chaos Friday was also a major options expiration day, which meant huge volumes and wild price swings. Nearly 80% of stocks in the S&P 500 finished lower, while small-cap stocks took an even bigger beating, with the Russell 2000 sinking more than 2%. “It’s pretty clear that markets are waking up to the consumer impact of tariffs,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. “Even if these tariffs never take effect, consumers are already changing their behavior.” Wall Street is starting to price in the full effects of Trump’s trade war. Investors had initially brushed off the White House’s tariff threats, assuming they were just negotiating tactics. But now, it’s looking real. The administration has already promised tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of America’s largest trading partners. Manufacturers are feeling the heat as well—rising input costs and wage pressures are making it more expensive to operate. “That buy-the-dip mentality, it’s never been higher at the retail level … it’s just the widespread exuberance in the market,” Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, told CNBC. “It’s kind of a Pavlovian response. They’ve bought the dip for two, three years plus and it’s paid off, so they feel very confident about their stock-picking ability and trading this bull market,” Turnquist added.

CryptoQuant CEO Says Altseason Already Begun,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/altcoins-ready-for-round-two-cryptoquant-ceo-says-altseason-already-begun/,"As the cycle progresses, many investors are awaiting the long-anticipated Altseason, with opinions split on whether it will happen. Several market watchers have affirmed that Altcoins (Alts) are getting ready for an explosive breakout, but others, including CryptoQuant’s CEO, have suggested a different outlook. Related Reading: Nansen’s Bitcoin On-Chain Analytics Reveal 42% Increase In BTC Transactions Few Cryptocurrencies To ‘Survive’ The Altseason On Friday, Ki Young Ju, CryptoQuant’s founder and CEO, affirmed that the Altseason has begun. In an X thread, Ju suggested that there will not be a direct Bitcoin-to-alt rotation this cycle, noting that “stablecoin holders are favoring” Altcoins. According to Ju, Bitcoin is no longer a quote cryptocurrency, adding that Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance doesn’t define the altseason anymore. In a December post, he explained that “Altcoins used to move together based on their correlation with BTC,” however, this pattern has now broken. Instead, he stated that trading volume is the metric that defines it, with Altcoins currently having 2.7x the volume of Bitcoin. Ju also considers this to be a very selective and challenging altseason, with only a few Altcoins with strong user cases and narratives expected to thrive. He added that, despite good market sentiment, there isn’t fresh liquidity, which “feels like a PvP fight over a fixed pie.” As a result, Altcoin battles “are getting fiercer,” and only a few are pumping this altseason and attracting new liquidity. Altcoin markets are currently a zero-sum PvP game. While Bitcoin has doubled its market cap, the alt market cap is still below its previous ATH, rotating among themselves without fresh capital inflows. Only a few Alts with strong use cases and narratives will survive. Altcoins Ready For Next Leg Up Trader Crypto Yoddha suggested that Altcoins are “ready for round 2” after its recent performance. According to the post, the crypto market, excluding BTC and ETH, is following 2020-2021’s playbook. During the last cycle, Altcoins experienced two legs towards its cycle top and all-time high (ATH) of $1.13 trillion. In the “first round,” they broke out from its accumulation period, seeing a small re-accumulation phase before surging to the previous top. After reclaiming this resistance level, Altcoins started “round two,” achieving various new highs before hitting a new cycle top. Yoddha pointed out that the market is finishing the first round, as it tested last cycle’s top during the post-election pump. Analyst Rekt Capital affirmed that the crypto market cap, excluding the top 10 tokens, “has completed the second part of its Double Bottom formation.” He explained that Altcoins had been consolidating between the $250 billion to $280 billion range since the February 3 correction.

Analyst Says Longer ETH Consolidation Is Needed Per the post, Alts must close above $280 billion and retest this level as support to confirm a breakout from its three-week resistance and attempt to reclaim the $300 billion mark. Similarly, analyst Carl Runefelt stated that Altcoins have a parabolic move after breaking out of its two-month descending channel. Alts saw a 120% climb after breaking out of a 2024 multi-month descending channel. Altcoins must reclaim the $300 billion resistance to break from this pattern.
