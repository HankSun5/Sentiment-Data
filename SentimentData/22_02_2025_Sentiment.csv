The leading decentralized computing network transferred 4,850 ETH from one of its associated wallets to top liquid exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. Binance Receives 3,800 Ethereum Noteworthy, the developer team working on the project performed the transfers to the two exchanges in nine separate transactions. All the transactions occurred on February 20 between 15:46 (UTC) and 18:19 (UTC). ETH traded at $2,818.08 at press time after recording a 3.26% increase within the last 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap data. This price level sums the computing network’s Ethereum dumping to over $13.6 million. A major portion of the assets went to Richard Teng-led Binance . The digital asset service provider received up to 3,800 ETH, worth $10.7 million. Blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence claimed that the other 1,050 ETH, valued at approximately $2.9 million, was moved to a Coinbase wallet address. No ETH Dump, Just Solo Staking With CEX Five months ago, the Ethereum ICO participant moved 2,000 ETH to the American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase in five transactions. Markedly, this was the last time that the project made such a transfer to a centralized exchange. At the time, users were concerned about CEX’s involvement in a solo staking process. In response, Golem Network explained to these concerned users that it wasn’t dumping the second-largest cryptocurrency by market. Instead, it claimed that the transfers were all part of a staking test to ensure operational security. “Our objective was to create a controlled environment where we could monitor the impact of various factors on the staking-related processes,” the team wrote. Golem Network’s ETH Dump Could Trigger Selling Pressure Historically, such huge transfers of tokens to exchanges are usually followed by sales into USDT. At other times, they are swapped to other digital assets. Whatever the case, a sell-off of this size could trigger market pressure and a downtrend in the price of ETH. However, this is highly dependent on the speed of liquidation. Though yet to be confirmed, Ethereum allegedly saw a sharp plunge around the time of the nine transactions from Golem to Binance and Coinbase. From trading around $2,764 an hour before the transaction, the ETH price went down to $2,708 just a few minutes after the first set of funds moved to Binance. Judging by the current price of the altcoin, there has been some price recovery for Ethereum.

In stark contrast, Web3Bay harnesses blockchain technology to forge a decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace free from such constraints. This model abolishes the need for intermediaries, enabling direct interactions between buyers and sellers. This not only drastically cuts transaction fees—typically between 10% to 15% on conventional platforms—but also enhances profit margins for sellers and reduces costs for buyers. Moreover, the security and transparency of transactions are bolstered by smart contracts, eliminating fraud risks without the need for third-party verification. Momentum & Market Potential of Web3Bay’s Presale The Web3Bay 3BAY token presale is capturing significant investor interest, a testament to the growing confidence in decentralized commerce solutions. As of February, the initiative has garnered over $1.5 million and distributed nearly 370 million tokens over four stages. With the token currently priced at $0.004562625, its value is projected to climb through 28 stages to a potential launch price of $0.1959, promising a substantial return on investment of up to 6000% for early investors. The presale’s success is not isolated but reflects a broader shift towards blockchain integrations across sectors like finance, gaming, and now, e-commerce. Investors are drawn to Web3Bay’s potential for low-cost, autonomously governed, and user-directed trade, positioning it as a formidable alternative to established market leaders. Challenges & Forward-Looking Perspective for Decentralized E-Commerce Despite the allure of its zero-fee and self-governed model, Web3Bay confronts significant hurdles, including user and merchant onboarding, competition from entrenched players, and the need for seamless integration with existing cryptocurrency payment systems. The platform’s ability to attract a critical mass of users and provide a frictionless shopping experience will be crucial. Nevertheless, the increasing consumer and vendor disillusionment with traditional e-commerce behemoths, coupled with the rising demand for more equitable, blockchain-based systems, points to a promising trajectory for Web3Bay. Should it fulfill its strategic promises, Web3Bay is poised to challenge the dominance of Amazon and eBay, potentially revolutionizing online shopping with its blockchain-centric approach.

Each of these tokens has exhibited impressive momentum, attracting retail and institutional investors eager to capitalize on the next big breakout. While SUI and BONK have already made waves in the market, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is emerging as a powerful competitor, driven by AI integration and a record-breaking presale event. Analysts are weighing in on which project has the strongest fundamentals and growth potential to win this crypto race. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The AI Meme Coin Set To Win The Crypto Race To $5 As the 2025 crypto race continues, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to outshine SUI and BONK with its AI-powered ecosystem and rapid presale growth. While many meme coins rely on speculation, FloppyPepe (FPPE) combines artificial intelligence, passive income rewards, and a burn mechanism to create a high-value, long-term investment. Analysts predict that FloppyPepe (FPPE) will first surge past $5 and become the next breakout star in the crypto space. FloppyPepe (FPPE) allows traders to approach the volatile market with confidence with its AI-driven predictive model. Its AI video agent provides real-time market insights to help traders make well-informed decisions. Additionally, the upcoming AI text-to-image feature , set to launch on its Telegram community channel in just a week, enables users to monetize AI-generated content. FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers investors multiple ways to earn passive income and long-term rewards. Every transaction redistributes 3% back to token holders to guarantee steady earnings while promoting long-term investment. Its burn mechanism reduces supply to drive price appreciation. With stage-based pricing structures already delivering impressive returns, early adopters stand to gain massively as the token surges toward $5. Also, the network completed a smart audit with SolidProof to guarantee the platform’s freedom from scam attacks and bugs. As momentum builds ahead of the 2025 bull run, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining traction at an astonishing rate. This meme coin extends its impact beyond the crypto market by allocating some of its revenue to wildlife conservation efforts . At its current entry price of just $0.0000002 , investors have a rare opportunity to secure their positions before FloppyPepe (FPPE) outpaces SUI and BONK to hit the $5 milestone. As a forward-thinking project, FloppyPepe (FPPE) recorded over $900,000 inflow in its private round. This approach shows that this AI-powered memecoin is a forward-thinking crypto project. A popular YouTuber with over a million subscribers, NASS Crypto, has backed this AI meme coin to reach unprecedented heights in the coming years. These numbers show confidence in its formidable network and its potential charge. Sui (SUI) and Bonk (BONK) Gear Up For The Next Bull Run Analysts have begun to weigh in ahead of the next bull run. Having observed their performances, they are certain that FloppyPepe (FPPE) will outperform SUI and Bonk (BONK) . Despite trading above $3, the recent whale sell-off shows that investors have low confidence in SUI. Bonk (BONK), on the other hand, has received predictions for 20-25x growth in the next bull run. However, these gains pale in comparison to FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) astronomical ROIs. Why Expert Sentiments Favor FloppyPepe (FPPE) While SUI and BONK have shown strong market performances, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quickly proving to be the ultimate contender in the crypto race to $5. Unlike its rivals, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is backed by cutting-edge AI integration, a thriving community, and a presale event that has already shattered expectations. Its blend of advanced technology and meme culture gives it a competitive edge over SUI and BONK. With analysts predicting exponential growth and investors rushing to secure their positions early, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is emerging as the most promising token to reach the $5 milestone first. As excitement builds around its AI-driven ecosystem and market demand skyrockets, early adopters stand to reap the most rewards.

Cardano has long been viewed as one of the most promising blockchain projects, but its recent performance has sparked concern. With slow development progress and growing competition from newer, faster blockchains, traders are looking beyond Cardano for fresh opportunities. And one altcoin that’s capturing attention is PropiChain (PCHAIN) ; a project that combines blockchain with real-world applications and is showing strong bullish momentum. Cardano Price Struggles While Investors Look Elsewhere The Cardano price has been struggling to break out, frustrating investors who once believed in its potential to revolutionize blockchain technology. One of the main challenges has been the slow rollout of key updates, such as smart contract improvements and scalability solutions. While Cardano remains a technically advanced blockchain, its slower adoption compared to networks like Solana and Ethereum has dampened investor enthusiasm. So investors, who were once eager to support projects like Cardano, are being more cautious with their allocations. As the Cardano price action remains unpredictable, smart investors are exploring projects with clear utility and strong growth potential like PropiChain . Why PropiChain Is Attracting Attention While the Cardano price fluctuates, PropiChain is gaining momentum for all the right reasons. The project is built to solve real-world problems, particularly in real estate investment, which has traditionally been difficult for the average person to access. With PropiChain, investors can own a share of high-value properties without needing massive amounts of capital. For example, instead of requiring millions of dollars to buy a commercial property, investors can purchase fractional shares using blockchain-based tokens. This allows people to benefit from property appreciation and rental income, just like traditional real estate investors; but with significantly lower entry costs. Another key feature is AI-powered market insights, which help investors make better decisions. Instead of guessing which property or virtual asset will increase in value, PropiChain’s AI tools analyze market trends and provide recommendations based on data. This gives investors a competitive advantage, making it easier to identify high-growth opportunities before the broader market catches on. Additionally, the tokenization ensures that property ownership is secure and easily transferable. By converting real estate into blockchain-based tokens, transactions become seamless, cutting out intermediaries and unnecessary fees because these tokenized assets can be traded effortlessly. PropiChain also provides global accessibility, allowing anyone, anywhere, to invest in real estate markets that were previously out of reach. This means a person in Asia could invest in a high-growth real estate market in Europe, all through a decentralized and secure blockchain platform. On top of that, PropiChain is integrating with the metaverse, allowing users to buy and sell digital real estate. As virtual economies grow, owning property in the metaverse could be just as valuable as physical assets. PropiChain is positioning itself at the forefront of this shift, giving investors multiple avenues for growth. Market Validation and Security Assurance While many blockchain projects struggle to gain legitimacy, PropiChain is proving itself through security audits and market recognition. A third-party security audit confirmed that PropiChain’s smart contracts are robust and free of vulnerabilities. This gives investors confidence that their funds are protected from potential exploits; an important factor in today’s crypto space. Additionally, PropiChain has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a key milestone that enhances its credibility and visibility in the market. This listing signals to investors that PropiChain is a serious contender, drawing attention from both retail and institutional players. The Opportunity: How Much Can Investors Gain? With Cardano price failing to show clear bullish signals, many investors are shifting their focus to PropiChain , where momentum is building fast. The project is currently in stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at just $0.011 each. A $1,000 investment at the current price could yield $330,000 in 2025 if PropiChain sees the massive surge analysts are predicting. A Strategic Shift from Cardano to PropiChain While Cardano price remains uncertain, investors are pivoting toward projects with clearer upside potential. PropiChain is proving to be one of the most promising blockchain investments available today. With its low presale price of $0.011, early investors have a rare chance to position themselves for exponential returns before the market fully catches on. For those searching for the next big investment opportunity, PropiChain could be the altcoin that delivers life-changing gains in 2025.

The data reveals that Chainlink ( LINK ) rival Pyth Network ( PYTH ) and AI-based projects Kaito ( KAITO ) and Bittensor ( TAO ) all saw significant increases in price after gaining support from Coinbase. KAITO – an “InfoAI” protocol that aims to solve the problem of fragmentation within the digital assets industry – was recently listed by both Coinbase and the top global crypto exchange by volume Binance en route to nearly doubling up its price. Kaito is trading for $1.92 at time of writing, a staggering 99.89% rise during the last 24 hours. Moving on to the decentralized machine-learning network Bittensor, an open-source platform that allows investors to create and swap AI learning models, the data finds that TAO also saw a significant increase in price but eventually stabilized. TAO skyrocketed from a low of $445 to a peak of $484, a rise of 8.7%, in just a few hours after gaining support from Coinbase. The digital asset has since retraced and is moving for $453 at time of writing. Moving on to PYTH, the data shows the oracle provider also saw an increase in price after being listed followed by a subsequent retrace. On February 20th, PYTH jumped from a price of $0.235 to $0.263, a 12% increase. It was since retraced and is trading for $0.243 at time of writing.

Amid the uncertainty of whether GBP/USD and USD/CAD could continue to post gains, investors and other market participants have recognized a new meme coin named Panshibi (SHIBI). They believe SHIBI’s market potential of minting over 45,000% profits this year makes the token unavoidably the best crypto to buy. What’s the new meme coin about? And could Nasdaq hit $100? Let’s break it down. GBP/USD Outlook GBP/USD currency pair has experienced highs and lows, rising to 1.2670 in the early hours of Friday. The GBP/USD pair gained strength against the U.S. dollar, though, as it lost ground following dismal jobless claims data and mixed signals from the Federal Reserve (Fed). The GBP/USD currency pair posted gains on the back of improved market conditions after President Trump made remarks about potential breakthroughs in trade negotiations with China. However, caution remains in the air for the GBP/USD currency pair among traders due to the UK. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey’s warnings. With these conflicting signals, the GBP/USD pair may see further volatility in the next few weeks as traders watch both U.S. and U.K. economic reports closely to determine the pair’s direction. USD/CAD Might Stall Its Recovery The USD/CAD pair tanked in the Thursday North American session to 1.42. The decline of the USD/CAD pair was largely due to weakness in the U.S. currency, reflected in the decline of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) to 106.70. Despite an announcement from US President Donald Trump that new auto, chip, and pharmaceutical tariffs could become effective within the next month, the USD could not recover. However, the USD/CAD pair did rebound somewhat after dropping earlier in the week. The USD/CAD pair seems to have received a fresh supply for now, but this might stall its recovery. Trading activity around the USD/CAD is expected to slow down within the next 48 hours as the Bank of Canada (BoC) may rethink cutting rates. Could Nasdaq Hit $100? Nasdaq (NDAQ) is a global financial technology, trading, and market infrastructure provider. With a market cap of $47.6 billion. With a pegged price per stock of $82.54, the Nasdaq stock price has already risen above 5% this year. Market activity from TradingView suggests that Nasdaq is building upside momentum, and analysts are now more bullish on the stock than they were two months ago. Based on this growth potential, the possibility of Nasdaq hitting $100 per share might not be too far away. Panshibi: The Best Crypto to Buy Today Panshibi is undoubtedly one of the best crypto to buy on the market today. This meme coin has a Panda as its mascot, which was inspired by Asian culture. The community of this appealing project spans from memecoin enthusiasts, Panda lovers from every corner of the world, and, of course, Asians. The Panshibi community might be rapidly growing, but the Bamboo Valley could still accommodate even more. One aspect of Panshibi’s philosophy that investors cannot ignore is its fight against the corrupt financial higher-ups who have exploited hundreds of thousands of market participants. Panshibi keeps them safe in Bamboo Valley and gives them the power to revolt against corruption. Talk about Panshibi’s plan for Pandas. Many in the crypto community have embraced Panshibi’s interests, so it’s no surprise that the number of people in Bamboo Valley keeps increasing every day. Once the project is listed on the biggest exchanges, industry experts predict gains of up to 45,000%. SHIBI could possibly be the best crypto to buy today, selling at only $0.005 per token.

The stock is nearing a 14% weekly decline after dropping as much as 17%. On February 12, the trading platform reported exceptional fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue more than doubling. This contributed to a remarkable 162% surge in its stock price from November 5, following Trump’s election, through the end of last week. However, Citigroup Inc. and Wolfe Research LLC analysts noted that much of the company’s earnings growth potential was already reflected in the stock’s valuation. As a result, Wolfe’s Steven Chubak downgraded the stock from a buy rating to a hold-equivalent. “We had recommended to our clients that they take some chips off the table at a $60 to $70 share price,” Chubak said. The downgrade is a wake-up call to investors to be “more forensic” over the company’s potential. Crypto-fuelled growth after Trump’s elections spurred Robinhood stock Robinhood experienced serious growth, more than 700% in crypto revenue during the fourth quarter. During the same period, Bitcoin traded above $100,000 as people speculated that Trump would support digital assets. In an email, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev explained that the pullback stemmed from concerns that the “animal spirits” driving the company’s strong fourth-quarter performance may not persist. However, he remains optimistic about the stock, citing ongoing tailwinds from digital assets and a growing user base on the trading platform. Dolev isn’t the only one with a bullish outlook. Nearly three-quarters of analysts tracked by Bloomberg rate the stock as a buy, with an average 12-month price target of $70.76—slightly above its 2021 record high. Still, Chubak cautioned that a rebound is not assured, pointing to industry data that indicates a decline in crypto activity so far this quarter. Chubak said he would not be surprised if the stock continued declining in a weaker crypto activity environment. Robinhood plans to expand to Singapore According to a Bloomberg report, Robinhood plans to introduce cryptocurrency trading products in Singapore through its Bitstamp subsidiary. While the online brokerage has not yet announced a launch date, it aims to begin rolling out services by late 2025. The report cited an interview with Johann Kerbrat, Robinhood Crypto’s vice president and general manager, highlighting Bitstamp’s existing licenses in Singapore as a key factor in the acquisition. “Part of the reason why Bitstamp was attractive was because of their licenses with Singapore and its institutional business,” Kerbrat reportedly told Bloomberg. Robinhood agreed to acquire Bitstamp in June last year for $200 million, a move intended to expand its reach among institutional crypto investors in the US and internationally. Bloomberg also noted that Bitstamp received in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore last year. The acquisition is expected to close this year, pending regulatory approval.

The exchange confirmed that law enforcement is involved, and forensic teams are working to demix hacker addresses to limit how the funds can be sold. Bybit announced the development on X, saying : “We have reported the case to the appropriate authorities and we will send an update as soon as we have any further information. We have fortunately worked quickly and extensively with on-chain analytics providers to identify and demix the implicated addresses. These actions will mitigate and counter the ability of bad actors in disposing and dumping the ETH on the markets via legitimate marketplace narrowing the available outlets of disposal.” CEO responds as Bybit fights to control the fallout Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, responded within 30 minutes of the first reports of the hack. He confirmed that the 401,000 ETH had been drained from Bybit’s cold wallet but assured users that the exchange remained fully operational. Zhou followed up with a livestream on X and YouTube, where he answered questions in real time. “We are handling withdrawals as usual,” he told users. “Retail withdrawals are being prioritized, and we are processing thousands of requests per hour.” Bybit’s transparency helped keep panic under control, with Zhou assuring traders that Bybit’s reserves were 1:1 backed and that no funds were frozen. The hack targeted Bybit’s Gnosis Safe multisig wallets, which Zhou admitted was the point of failure. Bybit has since revoked compromised access, but the damage was already done. The hacker, later linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, executed the attack through exploited multisig processes. Bybit confirmed that 4,000 withdrawals were pending immediately after the breach, but Zhou said the exchange secured a bridge loan to maintain smooth operations. “We are processing every withdrawal request as fast as possible,” he said. “The attack was significant, but it does not impact Bybit’s financial health.” Bybit didn’t just report the hack—it took the fight straight to the hackers. Zhou made it clear that selling the stolen ETH would be extremely difficult, as Bybit had already flagged and blacklisted the wallets involved. On-chain analyst ZachXBT was the first to link the Bybit exploit to Lazarus Group, the North Korean hacking unit known for previous high-profile attacks. ZachXBT confirmed that Bybit’s case matched patterns seen in past Phemex and Atomic Wallet hacks. Bybit also turned to its partners, exchanges, and market makers like Binance and Bitget to prevent the stolen ETH from moving, so they’ve now blacklisted the wallets. Unlike when FTX needed help during its 2022 collapse, where crypto exchange distanced themselves, Bybit’s industry connections rallied around the exchange. Bybit took a direct approach with Lazarus , knowing they were likely watching the livestream, and Zhou repeatedly told them that moving the funds would be impossible and urged them to negotiate. Bybit then told its users that: “We want to assure our users and partners that all other Bybit cold wallets remain fully secure. All client funds are safe, and our operations continue as usual without any disruption. Transparency and security remain our top priorities, and we will provide updates asap.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|Bybit,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ETH|MARKET|ASIA|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-21 23:12:10

Senate Committee to Debate Crypto Rules, Bitcoin Reserve Proposal According to the announcement , Tim Scott, the Republican senator from South Carolina who is now leading the committee, has expressed strong support for the crypto sector, raising hopes for more constructive discussions this time. Industry representatives, including legal experts from Kraken and Lightspark, are expected to provide insights on what regulatory frameworks could foster innovation and economic growth in the space. The session will be held in a hybrid format and will feature testimony from key industry figures, including Lewis Cohen, partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP; Jonathan Jachym, Deputy General Counsel and Global Head of Policy & Government Relations at Kraken; and Jai Massari, Chief Legal Officer at Lightspark. Additional witnesses may be added to the panel ahead of the hearing. Discussions are expected to cover critical topics such as market structure, stablecoin regulations, and the potential creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Lawmakers are attempting to balance oversight and fostering innovation, positioning the U.S. as a leader in digital finance while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. This hearing comes at an important moment for the crypto industry, which has been grappling with increased regulatory scrutiny and calls for clearer compliance measures. The outcome could shape the direction of U.S. digital asset policy and influence its global standing in the crypto economy. The hearing will be webcast live, but access will only be available once proceedings begin.

U.S. Senate Banking Committee to Form Crypto Subcommittee According to FOX Business and Punchbowl News reports, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee is set to establish its first-ever crypto subcommittee , which Senator Cynthia Lummis is expected to lead. This comes a month after President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. NEW: The Senate Banking Committee, led by @SenatorTimScott , is set to establish its first ever subcommittee dedicated to #crypto .

This is similar to the House Financial Services Committee, which launched its own crypto subcommittee in 2023. Lummis, a vocal crypto advocate, recently backed Trump’s push for a strategic Bitcoin reserve . She also filed an amicus brief supporting Coinbase’s appeal against the SEC, arguing the regulator has overstepped its authority in crypto enforcement. She stated that decades-old securities laws don’t always apply to modern digital assets and called for a clear legislative framework. “With lawsuits relying on the SEC’s overreach, it is vital that the Second Circuit halts this encroachment on Congress’s lawmaking powers,” the brief stated . Trump has pledged to curb regulatory overreach and position the U.S. as a crypto hub. The Senate Banking Committee oversees financial agencies like the SEC, making this subcommittee a key step in shaping future crypto policy. Looking forward, this hearing could be the starting point for clearer crypto regulation in the U.S. and might lead to similar regulatory clarity provided by MiCA. The meeting includes many key leaders in the space, and by bringing their opinions together, the outcome could mark the beginning of the U.S.’s goal of being the crypto hub of the world.

With Qubetics presale soaring past $13.5 million, Litecoin witnessing a massive trading volume surge, and Terra Classic attempting a comeback, traders are on high alert. But with so many choices, which project stands out as the top contender? Qubetics is stealing the spotlight with its game-changing decentralized VPN, designed to enhance privacy and security across blockchain networks. Meanwhile, Litecoin is drawing attention with its $580 million in daily trading volume, proving that investors still see value in this long-standing altcoin. On the other hand, Terra Classic continues to battle for market relevance, trying to recover from its previous crashes. But with Qubetics offering a staggering ROI potential of up to 12,286.96%, could it be the ultimate pick for crypto investors in 2025? Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN is Changing the Game As Web3 adoption accelerates, privacy and security have become top concerns for businesses and individuals. Qubetics is addressing these issues head-on with its Decentralized VPN (dVPN), a groundbreaking blockchain-based solution that eliminates centralized control and censorship. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on a single provider, Qubetics’ dVPN leverages a decentralized network, allowing users to browse anonymously, secure their data, and bypass restrictions without relying on third parties. For businesses, this means enhanced protection for sensitive transactions, preventing unauthorized tracking and data leaks. Imagine an international company managing cross-border payments—Qubetics’ dVPN ensures end-to-end encryption, shielding financial data from malicious actors. Meanwhile, individuals can use the dVPN to safeguard their browsing activity from intrusive government surveillance and advertisers. What makes Qubetics even more appealing is its multi-chain compatibility, ensuring seamless integration with various blockchain ecosystems. Whether you’re a trader looking for extra security or a developer seeking privacy-focused infrastructure, Qubetics is proving why it’s among the best cryptos to buy today. Qubetics Presale Surge and Investor FOMO With each Qubetics presale stage lasting just seven days and a 10% price hike every Sunday at 12 AM, investors are rushing to secure TICS tokens before the next increase. The project’s massive $13.5 million presale tally proves that interest is skyrocketing, with over 20,800 token holders already onboard. Analysts have made bold predictions, with TICS expected to reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a 209.67% ROI. If the token hits $1 post-presale, early buyers could see a 1138.69% return, while a $5 valuation would bring in an eye-watering 6093.48% gain. But the real speculation is around the $10 and $15 price targets, which could translate into 12,286.96% and 18,480.45% ROIs, respectively. To put this into perspective, a $1,000 investment at today’s price of $0.08073 could be worth over $122,869 if TICS reaches $10. As FOMO builds and the Qubetics presale stage 22 nears its end, investors are scrambling to lock in their tokens before the next price jump. Litecoin’s Trading Volume Skyrockets to $580 Million While Qubetics is dominating the presale space, Litecoin is making waves in the trading markets, recently hitting $580 million in daily trading volume. Despite newer altcoins entering the scene, Litecoin remains a staple for traders who value its fast transactions and low fees. This surge in trading activity signals renewed interest in the coin, especially as Bitcoin’s halving event approaches, historically benefiting Litecoin due to its similar proof-of-work model. Investors are speculating that Litecoin’s next big breakout could be around the corner, fueled by increased adoption and institutional attention. With crypto whales accumulating large amounts of LTC, traders are keeping a close eye on whether this trading volume surge is an early signal of a major price rally. While Litecoin doesn’t offer the astronomical ROI potential of Qubetics, its established market presence and steady growth make it a strong choice for risk-averse investors. Terra Classic’s Fight for Market Relevance Terra Classic remains one of the most debated cryptocurrencies, with investors divided on whether it has long-term potential or if it’s just a fading memory of its past collapse. The project is making attempts to regain trust, with ongoing community-driven efforts to restore value to its ecosystem. Despite these efforts, skepticism remains high, especially after the LUNA crash left many investors burned. Unlike Qubetics and Litecoin, which are showing clear signs of adoption and utility, Terra Classic is still struggling to prove itself as a viable investment for the future. However, speculative traders continue to bet on its potential price rebounds, believing that a community-led revival could breathe new life into the project. But with the crypto space evolving rapidly, the real question is whether Terra Classic can keep up with competitors like Qubetics, which is building real-world solutions for Web3 adoption. Conclusion: Is Qubetics the Best Crypto to Buy Today? Qubetics is making an undeniable case as one of the best cryptos to buy today, thanks to its Decentralized VPN technology, strong presale momentum, and jaw-dropping ROI potential. With $13.5 million raised and price hikes happening every week, investors are racing to get in before the next surge. Litecoin is also holding its ground, with a $580 million trading volume boost signaling strong investor interest. Meanwhile, Terra Classic remains a wildcard, with speculation driving its price movements rather than fundamental growth. For those looking for the top crypto presale with real-world utility, massive upside potential, and a growing investor base, Qubetics presale is where the real action is happening. With analysts predicting 5x to 100x gains, now might be the time to join the Qubetics presale before the price jumps again.

40661768,https://coingape.com/?p=240326,1740179847,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Lazarus Group Responsible For Bybit’s $1.4 Billion Ethereum Hack: Report,https://coingape.com/lazarus-group-responsible-for-bybits-1-4-billion-ethereum-hack/,"The Lazarus Group, a hacking organization linked to North Korea, has been identified as behind the recent $1.4 billion Ethereum theft from cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. This revelation was made after blockchain investigator ZachXBT provided strong evidence linking the attack to them. Lazarus Group Implicated in the Bybit Hack It is worth mentioning that ZachXBT’s investigation found a series of test transactions and connected wallets that led directly to the Lazarus Group. The research as shared on X included detailed graphs and time-based analysis, which have been shared with Bybit to help their ongoing investigation. Meanwhile, Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain data platform, had offered a reward of 50,000 ARKM tokens for information that could identify the hackers. After reviewing ZachXBT’s findings, Arkham confirmed the link to the Lazarus Group. They stated that his report included a full breakdown of test transactions, connected wallets, and forensic graphs showing how the attack happened. The Bybit Exploit: How Bad is it? Notably, the Bybit hack occurred on Friday, with about 401,346 ETH (worth $1.4 billion) stolen from Bybit’s cold wallet. While cold wallets are supposed to be safe since they are not connected to the internet, the hackers still managed to get in. It shows how desperate the hackers are and how fragile the cryptocurrency market is. This also raises a question of how genuinely decentralized or safe the crypto market is. On the flip side, reports also show that the stolen funds were transferred to different wallets, and at least $200 million worth of staked Ether (stETH) has already been sold on decentralized exchanges. In response to the event that has brought mixed feelings among the Bybit community and the cryptocurrency community at large, CEO Ben Zhou took to his page on X and reassured users that the exchange is financially stable and will still function well irrespective of the severity of the attack. Again, he confirmed that all client assets are fully backed and that the exchange remains solvent despite the large loss. Unfortunately, this attack has also affected the broader digital asset market. Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropped sharply from 62.8 to 51.6 within hours. This shows a decrease in buying activity as the Lazarus Group carted away with the stolen ETH. While the RSI is still above the neutral 50 mark, this drop suggests investors are becoming more cautious. The Altcoin also decreased by 4% moments after the hack. The attack has also affected Bitcoin and other altcoins, with the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization reeling in loss. Lazarus Group and its Trend in Crypto In other news, the Lazarus Group has been responsible for some of the biggest hacks in crypto. There is speculation that the North Korean government is supporting the group. Put differently, they are a state tool that is used for stealing funds to bypass economic sanctions. In March 2022, they stole about $625 million from the Ronin Network, which is connected to the Axie Infinity game. A few months later, in June 2022, it was confirmed by the US. FBI that they had taken $100 million from Harmony’s Horizon bridge. More recently, in 2024, they stole over $300 million from Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange. Sadly, these attacks show that the Lazarus Group keeps changing its methods to exploit security gaps in cryptocurrency systems. The Bybit hack is another warning that stronger security measures are needed to protect digital assets. In January, the United States, Japan, and South Korea issued a joint statement to address threats from North Korean hackers. The joint statement noted that despite the threats, they are working to disrupt their potency.

Wrong trades, wild flips, and token launches — he’s turning madness into millions. Here’s how. Table of Contents The wrong LIBRA gamble Portnoy’s meme coin frenzy hits overdrive SEC heat or just noise? Hype over fundamentals, chaos over caution The wrong LIBRA gamble Dave Portnoy has never been one to shy away from the spotlight. From turning Barstool Sports into a media empire to his viral pizza reviews and high-stakes gambling, he has built a brand around being loud, unpredictable, and unapologetically himself. Lately, though, his name has been making the rounds for a different reason — crypto. And not just any crypto, but meme coins , accidental trades, and a deal he ultimately walked away from. One of the biggest stories revolves around Libra ( LIBRA ), a token that gained traction after Argentina’s President Javier Milei seemingly endorsed it. However, Portnoy’s involvement began with a different kind of LIBRA deal. Portnoy revealed that he had been paid roughly 6 million LIBRA tokens to promote the project, but after its founder, Hayden Davis , allegedly asked him to keep quiet about the arrangement, Portnoy decided to return the money. Then, in one of his most bizarre investment blunders, he mistakenly bought nearly $170,000 worth of the wrong LIBRA token — one with a completely different contract address than the high-profile version making headlines. Realizing his mistake, Portnoy took to X with his trademark mix of self-deprecation, writing, “Anybody wanna buy some fake Libra? Warning: This is a meme coin. I bought it by accident… It will be volatile. It will eventually go to zero.” Anybody wanna buy some fake Libra? Warning. This is a meme coin. I bought it by accident. It will be volatile. It will eventually go to zero. It may rip. It may tank. Don’t put on more than you can lose!!!

Milei himself is now facing accusations of financial misconduct, with some political opponents even calling for his impeachment. But that hasn’t slowed Portnoy down. If anything, it seems to have only fueled his full-throttle dive into meme coins. Let’s break down the swirling speculations and how the crypto community is reacting to the chaos. You might also like: LIBRA’s collapse becomes Solana’s biggest scandal since FTX: How Jupiter and Meteora left retail rekt Portnoy’s meme coin frenzy hits overdrive Just days after mistakenly buying the wrong Libra token and returning 6 million worth of the original LIBRA tokens, Portnoy decided to take matters into his own hands — launching his own tokens, flipping them within hours, and riding the wild volatility that defines the space. On Feb. 18, Portnoy introduced a new token called GREED through Pump.fun , a Solana ( SOL )-based platform designed to simplify meme coin creation. The branding was as on-the-nose as it gets, featuring an image of Michael Douglas’s Gordon Gekko from Wall Street, the character infamous for the line, “Greed is good.” pic.twitter.com/Iau8Xx0v9N — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 18, 2025 And for a brief moment, it was. The token skyrocketed, reaching a peak market cap of $41.5 million in just a few hours. As the excitement built, Portnoy embraced the moment, posting on X: “I kept hearing how meme coins were dead? I’m able to turn 2k into just about a million in 15 minutes if I felt like it. Doesn’t seem dead to me.” I kept hearing how meme coins were dead? I’m able to turn 2k into just about a million in 15 minutes if I felt like it. Doesn’t seem dead to me. Seems like as long as $greed exists and meme coins are legal there will be a big market for this shit. pic.twitter.com/VFo8AWNyei — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 18, 2025 But within a day, he moved all his GREED tokens into another project he had previously endorsed — JAILSTOOL — publicly declaring , “Just put all of #Greed into #jailstool which I’m never selling ‘cause I said I wouldn’t sell.” Then, on-chain data revealed that Portnoy had swapped every single GREED token he owned for JAILSTOOL tokens in a single transaction, worth an estimated $250,000 at the time, instantly crashing the price of GREED by 99%. His decision to cash out sparked backlash, with many accusing him of a “rug pull” — a term used when developers or influencers drain liquidity from a project, leaving late investors holding worthless tokens. 👀 Another wild and bloody scam story Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy ( @stoolpresidente ) just rugged his own audience. After losing $200K on fake LIBRA, he launched the GREED memecoin. It pumped to a $37M market cap, only for him to dump 35% of the supply, cashing out… pic.twitter.com/mQI9b59Du1 — Memento (@Memento_ai) February 19, 2025 Portnoy quickly defended himself, posting: “I have literally only said I will not sell 1 coin. That coin is #jailstool until it hits the 1 billion market cap.” He continued, claiming that he could have made over a million dollars from the sale but instead let GREED drop by 75% before exiting. Some facts not on this tweet. I warned people I could sell. I could have cashed out +1 million. I let it drop 75% before cashing out. Lots of people made money. I took the profits + poured it into #jailstool which I can’t touch. I didn’t make a dime on it. Some people won.… https://t.co/ARkeBKOVjX — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 19, 2025 “Lots of people made money. I took the profits + poured it into #jailstool, which I can’t touch. I didn’t make a dime on it. Some people won, some lost. Only the losers keep bitching.” Then, rather than retreating, Portnoy leaned into the controversy, boasting that he could create another token just as easily, and it would still “moon,” because, as he put it, “Nobody has principles. Just greed.” You can’t beat me. Not in this meme coin market. I could launch Greed 2 collectible coin right now and it would moon. Nobody has principles. Just greed. https://t.co/rmPxbMjQhM — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 18, 2025 Hours later, he followed through, launching GREED2 and warning investors not to put in more than they could afford to lose. *update. Just launched Greed 2. Don’t invest in this collectible coin with more than you can afford to lose. It’ll be volatile. I will not sell 1 penny till at least midnight est or maybe never. Be careful. GoL6RVGQFzTD7MdoNEHUQmNp6SgXBn6f9khxAW5Bpump https://t.co/kFuUCIgvYf — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 19, 2025 Unlike its predecessor, GREED2 struggled to gain traction. It briefly climbed to a $7 million market cap before plummeting 90% over the next five hours. On Feb. 20, he was back on X again, sharing screenshots of his Phantom Wallet balances, revealing staggering gains — 1,923% on GREED, 344% on GREED2, and various smaller profits across other meme coins. Critics condemned Portnoy’s actions as reckless, pointing to the damage they cause to retail investors who jump in late. As for Portnoy, he doesn’t seem concerned. If anything, he appears to be fully embracing the chaos. SEC heat or just noise? As Portnoy’s meme coin antics escalate, social media has become a hotbed for speculation, accusations, and unverified rumours. One of the biggest claims making the rounds is that Portnoy may be facing legal trouble. “Rumors emerging that court documents reveal Dave Portnoy is facing multiple SEC securities violations charges,” posted one user. 🚨BREAKING: Rumors emerging that court documents reveal Dave Portnoy is facing multiple SEC securities violations charges. Authorities allege serious financial misconduct, with further details expected as the case unfolds. pic.twitter.com/MOo6RMqRVs — jdub 🇮🇱 (@jdubz069) February 20, 2025 However, no actual filings or statements from regulators have emerged to confirm this. Adding to the speculation, the SEC recently unveiled the creation of a cybercrime unit aimed at tackling fraud in the crypto industry. The timing of this move has led some to suggest a direct link between Portnoy’s recent token flips and the regulatory shift. “Portnoy rugs five tokens live on a stream, two days later the SEC launches a cybercrime unit,” wrote one user. dave portnoy rugs five tokens live on a stream two days later the sec launches a cyber crime unit to target fraud in crypto enjoy crime season, retards — Zack Voell (@zackvoell) February 20, 2025 Another post adopted a more sarcastic tone: “Portnoy scammed so hard the SEC had to launch a new cyber division.” 🚨NEW: Dave Portnoy scammed so hard the SEC has to launch a new Cyber technology division💀 pic.twitter.com/gMMbJRT42f — Autism Capital 🧩 (@AutismCapital) February 20, 2025 Rather than addressing the allegations head-on, Portnoy opted to mock the situation, flipping the SEC’s announcement to jab at his critics. “Love it! So many scammers and liars out there. Let’s clean this space up! Take out the trash,” he posted, before taking a swipe at those calling him a fraud. “Can we arrest the crybabies who are told meme coins are a risk and then cry foul too?” Love it! So manny scammers and liars out there. Let’s clean this space up! Take out the trash. Together we can win. This is when it pays to be the cleanest man in crypto Ps – can we arrest the crybabies who are told not to risk more than they can lose and that Memecoins… https://t.co/JD7Nk6YfPo — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 20, 2025 So far, it’s all just noise—no official actions or formal accusations. But the growing uproar reveals how deeply his actions have divided the crypto community. Still, Portnoy isn’t backing down. If anything, he’s doubling down. Who am I to deny the will of the people. The heartbeat of trenches is Greed https://t.co/QaqknWr9vt — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 20, 2025 Hype over fundamentals, chaos over caution Portnoy’s foray into the meme coin market is quickly shaping up to be a masterclass in how hype, rather than fundamentals, can drive value in crypto. While most traders focus on returns, Portnoy seems more intrigued by the mechanics of attention. He leverages his massive following to trigger market movements, all while watching the real-time ripple effect unfold. “He’s discovered an infinite money glitch — he tweets a ticker to his 3.5M followers, and it instantly moons, then he does it again,” said Punk, the pseudonymous CCO at Memecoin ( MEME ), capturing how Portnoy’s reach alone is enough to spark immediate volatility. But it’s not just about the money. “He’s amused by the hamster wheel of traders blindly following his moves, so he keeps spinning it.” Portnoy creates a token, watches it surge, then either exits or moves on to the next. Traders know the risk but dive in anyway — not because they believe in the token, but because the activity itself is the draw. This phenomenon is far from isolated. Platforms like Pump.fun have made meme coin creation almost effortless. Since launching in January 2024, over 7.8 million tokens have been created on the platform as of Feb. 21, most offering little beyond speculative thrills. As a result, the market has become a revolving door of viral trends, where the next big token isn’t determined by innovation, but by how quickly it can spread. “Honestly, trust in crypto isn’t exactly at an all-time high,” said Tobin Kuo, CEO of Seraph Studios, in an interview with crypto.news. “At this point, even veterans are joking that the space is turning into the world’s largest casino.” That could explain why Portnoy has gone beyond just trading — he’s creating. As Punk puts it, “Every legal expert warning him only pushes him to do more. The backlash fuels his next move.” Whether this model can last or eventually collapse under its own weight remains to be seen, but as long as the hype keeps driving the market, the cycle isn’t stopping.",Feature|Influencers|Meme Coin|rug pull|SEC|United States,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|SOL,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-21 23:50:00

Notably, the pro-crypto stance of the Mark Uyeda-led SEC has ignited a possibility of XRP benefitting uniquely. Per the current trend, investors wonder if the coin could hit a $300 price target in the long term if the US SEC drops the XRP lawsuit. Is Ripple versus US SEC Lawsuit Suppressing XRP Price? In a recent update, Coinbase revealed that the SEC staff has agreed to drop its lawsuit , pending potential approval by the agency’s commissioners in the coming week. By a large margin, the Coinbase versus SEC lawsuit is considered the second biggest after Ripple Labs. Though similar, the Ripple lawsuit has advanced much more, with the end close as predicted. Gary Gensler fanned the lawsuit, alleging that XRP is a security when sold to the public, significantly impacting the price. Like Coinbase, there is speculation that the US SEC will dismiss its Ripple lawsuit appeal. If this happens, the price of XRP is expected to rise dramatically. Is XRP Price to $300 Feasible? In recent times, analysts have issued massive projections regarding the XRP price. As reported earlier by CoinGape, market analyst XRP Captain predicted that the XRP price could rally to $250 between now and 2026. While analysts justify this projection based on the current trend within the Ripple ecosystem, the economics presents a different picture. With XRP having more than 57.89 billion circulating supply per CoinMarketCap data , a $300 target will give it a valuation of $17.367 trillion for the coin. This fund is way bigger than the crypto industry, which is only worth $3.17 trillion, with Bitcoin dominating. However, this does not discount the likelihood of a massive rally if the lawsuit ends. The XRP ETF Advantage Meanwhile, the Ripple ecosystem has continued to expand at a unique pace. More than four asset managers are seeking approval to offer XRP ETF products to institutional investors. Canary Capital, Bitwise, and CoinShares are some of the firms pushing for this new product. With a 65% odds of approval , the community is somewhat pricing in this product already. With the likelihood of a new capital influx, the expectation is that the XRP price will benefit immensely in the long term.

Dogecoin Whales Liquidate 100 Million Coins,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/panic-or-opportunity-dogecoin-whales-liquidate-100-million-coins/,"The crypto market is paying attention to a massive Dogecoin (DOGE) transaction. A whale transferred 100 million DOGE, or about $25.42 million, to Binance. The move has raised questions about whether a sell-off is about to happen or if this is just another typical shift in holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For ‘Take Off’—Analyst Reveals Key Signals Whale Activity Sparks Concerns When a major cryptocurrency holder moves a sizable amount of their holdings to an exchange, it usually means they want to sell. The price of DOGE may drop as a result, which would cause smaller investors to react. However, cryptocurrency expert Ali Martinez noted a decline in whale activity overall, suggesting that major investors are not acting aggressively for the time being. Whale activity on the #Dogecoin $DOGE network has declined by nearly 88% since mid-November! pic.twitter.com/6X4CIH3mf8 — Ali (@ali_charts) February 17, 2025 DOGE’s present market performance points to vagueness. As of the time of writing, the price is $0.255622; an intraday high is $0.257605 and a low is $0.250725. These swings imply a rather limited trading range; but, if more significant holders decide to sell their shares, volatility might increase. Market Sentiment Remains Divided According to certain traders, the whale transfer is a bearish signal, while others believe that its influence may be negligible unless an influx of additional coins occurs. Dogecoin has a history of reacting sharply to whale movements; however, the aggregate selling pressure appears to be subdued this time. The ongoing discussion regarding a potential DOGE exchange-traded fund (ETF) is another significant factor that affects sentiment. If an ETF acquires momentum, it may attract institutional investors, potentially counteracting any selling pressure from whales. Nevertheless, the market is currently in a state of supposition, as no official approvals or timelines have been announced. The Road Ahead For Dogecoin Despite the whale move, the price of DOGE continues to remain steady, but if market sentiment shifts, there could be a further drop. Further dumping may occur if the price of DOGE drops below $0.25, which might further lower the price. On the other hand, strong purchasing activity may act as a barrier to further decrease.

With meme coins showing signs of another pullback, experienced investors are looking for a more resilient alternative that can weather crashes and still deliver massive returns. That’s why many are shifting to this AI altcoin that doesn’t rely on hype alone but offers real utility, strong fundamentals, and cutting-edge technology that ensures long-term demand. This makes it the perfect hedge against market uncertainty. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Face Growing Uncertainty Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have dominated the meme coin market, but their explosive growth may be fading. Over the past few months, SHIB has struggled to break out of its downward trend, slipping from highs of $0.000033 to nearly half that value. Key support levels have failed, raising concerns about further downside risks. Dogecoin isn’t faring much better. While Elon Musk’s influence has occasionally pumped its price, long-term investors see a pattern; sharp rallies followed by deep corrections. Even with Dogecoin’s potential integration into X, the lack of fundamental utility makes it a highly speculative asset. On-chain data reveals that major SHIB and DOGE holders are shifting capital into new projects with stronger fundamentals, and RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as a top choice. Why RCO Finance Is Gaining Momentum RCO Finance is a fully operational AI-powered trading platform that helps users make smarter investment decisions. At the heart of RCOF is its Robo Advisor, an advanced AI system that scans global financial markets, analyzes real-time data from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, and provides actionable insights for traders. This AI tool can detect emerging trends before they go mainstream, allowing investors to capitalize on early-stage opportunities. Take recent examples like TRUMP and MELANIA tokens. These low-cap coins surged 100x in just days, but most traders missed out. RCOF’s AI is designed to spot these breakouts before they happen, giving users a major advantage. Beyond maximizing gains, the AI also protects investors from market downturns. It can identify weakening trends, recommend exit points, and even adjust portfolio allocations to optimize risk exposure. This strategic approach removes emotional decision-making and ensures smarter, data-driven trading. But RCOF goes beyond crypto investing. The platform offers access to 120,000+ investment options, including stocks, ETFs, bonds, and even tokenized real estate, all within a non-KYC environment. Investors can diversify seamlessly without lengthy verification processes, while RCOF’s crypto debit card allows instant spending without manual conversions. Early Investors Are Rushing Into RCOF’s Presale Shiba Inu and Dogecoin investors are moving into RCOF not just for its AI advantages but also for its lucrative presale opportunity. Unlike most early crypto projects, RCOF already has a live Beta Platform with 10,000+ active users testing its AI-driven tools. The Robo Advisor’s monitoring capabilities will continue improving, enhancing its predictive accuracy over time. This means early adopters are getting in before the AI reaches full optimization, setting them up for long-term gains. Currently, RCOF is in Presale Stage 5 , selling at $0.10 per token. The next stage will push the price up to $0.13, giving today’s buyers an instant 30% profit before the token even lists on major exchanges. A $1,000 investment today would become $1,300 in just weeks once the next presale stage begins. After exchange listings, analysts predict 10,000x growth, meaning an early $500 investment could potentially turn into $500,000. Additionally, RCOF has passed a security audit by SolidProof , confirming its smart contracts are safe and free from vulnerabilities. Unlike meme coins that fluctuate based on trends, RCOF is a fundamentally sound investment backed by real demand. Meme Coins Had Their Run; RCOF Is the Next Big Opportunity Shiba Inu and Dogecoin still have loyal communities, but their long-term upside is limited. Even if Dogecoin somehow climbs to $1, that’s only a 5x return; far below what RCOF is expected to achieve. Meanwhile, RCOF is just getting started, meaning the potential for rapid growth and mainstream adoption is far higher. With AI-driven trading tools, a working Beta platform, strong investor demand, and built-in real-world utility, RCO Finance is positioned for explosive gains in 2025. The opportunity won’t last forever. Investors who got in during earlier RCOF stages have already secured major profits, and with the presale moving quickly, prices will only go up from here. Waiting too long could mean missing out on one of the most profitable crypto launches of the year.

Amidst these, TRUMP Coin experiences volatile price movements due to major exchange listings, and Chainlink (LINK) looks to rally, yet it’s Web3Bay’s approach to secure online shopping that may truly transform the e-commerce landscape. Leveraging smart contract escrow, Web3Bay not only promises but provides a safe, fraud-free environment, a stark contrast to the speculative nature of many digital assets. While the market dances to the tune of volatile meme coins and seasoned cryptos, Web3Bay introduces a grounded, practical blockchain application, ensuring secure and transparent e-commerce transactions—potentially redefining how we conduct online business. Innovative Escrow Systems Set Web3Bay Apart Online shopping often falls prey to scams, including prevalent issues like fake reviews and rampant chargebacks that compromise both buyer and seller confidence. Web3Bay directly addresses these vulnerabilities with its innovative smart contract escrow system, safeguarding transactions to ensure they are secure, transparent, and immune to disputes. By automating escrow, Web3Bay effectively shields against fraudulent listings and the common pitfall of chargeback fraud, bolstering security for all market participants. This system is particularly advantageous for small business owners who frequently face hefty losses from fraudulent disputes, and consumers who will benefit from interacting with verified, trustworthy sellers. The blockchain’s immutable nature also ensures that product reviews cannot be falsified, cultivating a reliable marketplace atmosphere. With these mechanisms, Web3Bay is not merely participating in e-commerce; it is setting new standards for it. As the platform progresses, Web3Bay’s presale success—having raised $1.5 million in stage 4 for $0.004562625, with over 370 billion tokens sold—underscores the market’s growing demand for secure, reliable online transactions. Web3Bay is quickly establishing itself as a frontrunner in combating e-commerce fraud. TRUMP Coin’s Market Fluctuations After Upbit Listing TRUMP Coin, associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump, saw its value spike over 20% following its introduction on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit. This listing expanded its availability, adding new trading pairs and sparking a surge in trading activity that pushed its valuation significantly. Although it has seen substantial fluctuations, falling from a high market cap back down to more modest levels, the recent exposure has reignited interest, with projections suggesting a potential rise to between $35 and $40 in the near term. This exemplifies the profound impact that major exchange listings can have on meme-based assets, especially in markets like South Korea where retail trading is fervent. TRUMP remains a token to watch, as speculation continues to drive its market dynamics. Chainlink’s Prospects: Aiming for $23 Chainlink (LINK) is presently priced at $18.59, firmly supported between $17 and $18. The TD Sequential indicator has recently given a buy signal close to these levels, pointing to a possible ascent to $21 and potentially extending to $23. This projection is bolstered by historical data indicating that $21 has served as a frequent consolidation area, while $23 has consistently posed a notable resistance level. Simultaneously, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 48.94, signaling a balanced market condition, and the Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows a tight contest between buyers and sellers. Furthermore, whales hold 67% of LINK’s circulating supply, with current statistics revealing that 57% of investors are seeing profits, whereas 40% are experiencing losses. Taking these elements into account, alongside trends in exchange outflows which suggest diminishing selling pressures, there’s a solid groundwork for anticipating a push towards the $23 threshold. Wrapping Up! As the crypto market continues to evolve with its typical unpredictability, the emphasis remains on security and utility for sustainable growth. TRUMP Coin’s dramatic swings underscore the impact of exchange dynamics, while Chainlink’s technical setup hints at possible gains. Amidst these, Web3Bay’s smart contract escrow emerges as a crucial development, addressing the core challenges of online shopping fraud. This approach not only mitigates common e-commerce risks but also provides a substantial foundation for trust and reliability in digital transactions. While many chase market highs and lows, Web3Bay is crafting a more secure future for online shopping, promising more than just speculative benefits.

This achievement, coupled with a current price of $0.0248 per coin in Batch 27 and a 2380% surge, positions BlockDAG as a project to watch. But beyond the impressive numbers, BlockDAG’s commitment to education, exemplified by the appointment of Marcus Xavier as Head of Learning, suggests a long-term vision for the project. This article will explore the significance of structured blockchain education, particularly in the context of BlockDAG’s rapid growth and the broader adoption of decentralized technologies. The importance of understanding BDAG, DAG, and KAS within this evolving landscape will also be examined. BlockDAG’s Educational Initiative: Building a Foundation for the Future The addition of Marcus Xavier , with his extensive background in education and emerging technologies, signals BlockDAG’s dedication to fostering a knowledgeable community. As Head of Learning, Xavier will develop the BlockDAG Academy, a learning hub designed to provide structured blockchain education. This initiative is particularly relevant given BlockDAG’s presale success, which has seen over 18.6 billion coins sold and a nearly $200 million raise. The academy aims to equip users, developers, and businesses with the practical skills needed to engage with the BlockDAG ecosystem. This focus on education is a crucial component of BlockDAG’s strategy, demonstrating a commitment to more than just short-term gains. The BlockDAG team understands that widespread adoption depends on accessible and comprehensive educational resources. A Career Dedicated to Learning and Emerging Tech Xavier’s career path reflects a deep interest in the intersection of education and technology. His experience spans B2B e-commerce, tech startups, and higher education. Having witnessed the early stages of the internet boom, Xavier developed an understanding of both the potential and the limitations of centralized systems. This led him to explore the possibilities of decentralized technologies and their ability to address existing gaps. His involvement in blockchain research and development, including the creation of accredited blockchain courses, makes him well-suited to lead BlockDAG’s educational efforts. Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice Xavier’s approach to education combines practical commercial experience with established educational methodologies. His background in managing multiple college campuses, and overseeing curriculum development and accreditation, has provided him with the skills to create structured and relevant learning programs. This expertise will be invaluable in developing the BlockDAG Academy, ensuring that the content is not only informative but also applicable to real-world scenarios. The academy will offer training for developers, blockchain enthusiasts, and business professionals, empowering them to effectively utilize and contribute to the BlockDAG network. The BlockDAG Academy: A Roadmap for Blockchain Proficiency The BlockDAG Academy will offer a range of courses covering blockchain fundamentals, smart contract development, and network operations. The curriculum will include practical training on BlockDAG’s architecture, tailored courses for different user groups, and programs designed for those entering the blockchain sector. Hands-on learning experiences will be a core component, enabling participants to develop practical skills. Xavier’s vision is to create a community of skilled individuals who can contribute to the BlockDAG ecosystem. By providing a clear learning pathway, the academy will facilitate the integration of blockchain solutions for new users, developers, and businesses. Education: A Catalyst for BlockDAG’s Expansion As BlockDAG’s presale continues its upward trajectory, with over $197 million raised and over 18.6 billion coins sold, the need for accessible education becomes even more pressing. The complexity of blockchain technology often acts as a barrier to wider adoption. The BlockDAG Academy is designed to address this challenge by offering clear and structured educational resources for all levels of expertise. This educational framework will not only drive developer engagement and encourage business adoption but also cultivate a knowledgeable user base. Xavier’s experience in structuring accredited learning programs ensures that the academy will be a valuable and recognized learning institution. The Future of the BlockDAG Academy The next phase for Xavier and the BlockDAG Academy involves finalizing course structures, building partnerships with industry experts, and launching the first courses. The academy is expected to begin offering courses in the near future. This initiative underscores BlockDAG’s long-term vision of building a sustainable blockchain ecosystem with practical applications. The success of BlockDAG, including the impressive presale numbers and the high ROI of 2380%, is closely tied to its ability to educate and empower its community. As the academy develops, Xavier’s leadership will be instrumental in ensuring that the educational content is engaging, relevant, and beneficial to all participants. Summing Up BlockDAG’s commitment to education, as demonstrated by the establishment of the BlockDAG Academy, is a significant step towards fostering widespread blockchain adoption. The project’s presale success, with over $197 million raised and more than 18.6 billion coins sold, provides a strong foundation for future growth. The focus on education, combined with the project’s technical advancements, positions BlockDAG as a project with considerable potential. As the project evolves, the BlockDAG Academy will play a vital role in shaping the future of blockchain technology.

While XRP has long been a dominant player in the crypto space, newer projects with real-world applications and cutting-edge innovations are starting to take center stage. PropiChain is one such project, gaining traction for its unique approach to real estate. With analysts predicting massive gains, early investors are seeing PropiChain as an opportunity too good to ignore. Why Crypto Traders Are Looking Beyond XRP XRP has been a key player in the crypto market for years, particularly in cross-border payments. Its fast transaction speeds and low fees have made it a favorite among financial institutions. However, despite its strengths, XRP has faced challenges, including regulatory battles and market competition. As the market evolves, crypto traders are looking for projects that not only provide fast transactions but also offer tangible real-world benefits. This is where PropiChain is making waves. Instead of focusing solely on financial transactions, PCHAIN is bridging the gap between blockchain and real-world asset ownership, particularly in real estate. Crypto traders recognize that the future of blockchain lies in practical use cases, and PropiChain’s unique approach is positioning it as a strong contender in the market. What Gives Propichain the Edge? One of the main reasons PropiChain is attracting attention is its ability to revolutionize real estate investment. Traditionally, buying property requires significant capital, complex legal processes, and time-consuming paperwork. PropiChain simplifies this by allowing investors to buy fractional shares of high-value properties. This means that instead of needing millions to invest in premium real estate, users can start with as little as a few hundred dollars. But PropiChain isn’t stopping at fractional ownership. Its AI-powered analytics help investors make smarter decisions by analyzing market trends and identifying high-potential real estate investments. It’s like having access to AI-driven insights that tell you when and where to invest for maximum returns. Additionally, the project integrates tokenization to ensure secure and transparent ownership of real-world assets. Each property listed on PropiChain is converted into a digital token on the blockchain, making it easy to buy, sell, or trade without the complexities of traditional real estate transactions. Beyond real estate, PropiChain is also venturing into the metaverse. With the growing popularity of digital assets, the platform allows investors to purchase virtual real estate and participate in the booming metaverse economy. This creates an entirely new way for investors to diversify their portfolios. To further enhance efficiency, PropiChain uses smart contracts to automate property transactions, rental agreements, and payments. Instead of relying on traditional legal and financial intermediaries, these contracts execute transactions securely and instantly, reducing costs and eliminating unnecessary delays. Additionally, PropiChain’s global accessibility ensures that investors from anywhere in the world can participate in real estate markets that were previously out of reach. With blockchain removing geographic barriers, users can invest in premium properties across different countries without having to go through the complexities of international property transactions. Security and Market Recognition Strengthen Confidence Security is always a major concern for crypto traders, which is why PropiChain has undergone a thorough security audit to ensure its smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure are secure. This level of transparency reassures investors that their assets are protected. Additionally, PropiChain has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a major milestone that boosts its visibility and credibility in the market. A CoinMarketCap listing signals legitimacy and increases exposure to a global audience of investors looking for the next high-growth crypto project. How Much Could Investors Earn with PropiChain? PropiChain is still in stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011, giving early investors a rare chance to buy in at a low price before major price movements occur. A $1,000 investment at the current presale price could grow exponentially, offering life-changing returns up to $100,000 if PropiChain reaches its expected 100x.. Interestingly, PropiChain is still in its early stages, presenting a unique opportunity for those looking to invest before the mainstream market catches on. With a solid foundation, real-world applications, and growing interest from crypto traders, PropiChain has the potential to deliver significant returns. XRP has had its moment, but as the blockchain landscape continues to evolve, newer projects like PropiChain are proving that the future belongs to altcoins with real utility. For those looking to get ahead of the curve, keeping an eye on PropiChain could be the smartest move yet, as it could be the next life-changing investment. Don’t miss out.

Bons argues that BTC is no longer sustainable, especially after having lost its desirable qualities According to Bons, BTC has lost all its attractive qualities, so it won’t last very long. He argued that without capacity, scarcity, privacy, DeFi, or long-term security, the asset has “no legs to stand on.” He even stated that Bitcoin’s other impressive qualities, such as censorship resistance, immutability, financial sovereignty, and decentralization, are long gone and only pioneered by other emerging assets, saying the top asset lost its key principles to corruption. He further commented: BTC was effectively captured by a relatively small group of people who managed to entirely pivot the purpose, vision, and fundamental design of BTC. This did not happen without a fight. That history is now known as the block size debates, cumulating in 2017 when “Bitcoin Core” “won” and Bitcoin lost. Justin Bons He believes a group of people is still controlling BTC, and unfortunately, traders are still in the dark about the token’s reality. He even compared the current BTC governance to more of a Github dictatorship, saying the Core deterred any future expansion to BTC’s capacity, as opposed to Satoshi’s wants. Furthermore, he argued that Bitcoin currently sees only about seven transactions in a second, meaning it cannot be utilized for anything vital. He said that the token has to continuously rely on centralized holders to grow, which was not part of Satoshi’s original plan. Moreover, he said the core altered the token’s economic design to depend on few transactions with really high fees rather than many transactions with low fees, claiming that this also destroyed the asset’s long-term security model. Bons says BTC could fall in the next 8-12 years Bons believes that high trading activity on the BTC blockchain could make transaction fees surge to peak levels, even forcing traders to leave. He pointed out that this trend has been playing out on a smaller scale in recent years, leading to occasional fee spikes. However, he warned that this cycle “spells doom” for Bitcoin in the long term. He even expects the digital asset to collapse in the next 8 to 12 years, saying that an inflation rise past the 21 million cap will be its only saving grace then. He also projects a “bank-run”-like situation for when the token collapses, seeing how difficult it would be for every trader to transfer or withdraw all their assets. To him, BTC can never be a medium of exchange without capacity and will be a horrible store of value without long-term security. He even claims that BTC will reach a point where its price can no longer rise, and a “reckoning” will happen then. He has urged his followers to support Bitcoin by abandoning it and seeing Satoshi’s vision materialize in BTC’s children.

40664423,https://coingape.com/?p=240330,1740185419,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Analyst Identifies Key Support For Cardano Price Bullish Momentum,https://coingape.com/analyst-identifies-key-support-for-cardano-price-bullish-momentum/,"Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has noted key support levels for Cardano (ADA) price between $0.67 and $0.80. He emphasized their role in sustaining the current bullish trend. According to Martinez’s analysis, these levels have historically acted as both resistance and support for the altcoin. The repeated interaction with this range indicates its significance in determining ADA price direction. Key Support Levels for Cardano Price Stability In a post on X , Ali Martinez highlighted that Cardano price has repeatedly tested the $0.67–$0.80 range. This zone has provided stability for ADA, preventing further declines and acting as a foundation for bullish movements. Historical price movements suggest that this support area has been critical during both uptrends and corrections. The ability of ADA to hold above this range signals strong buying interest. Recent market data indicates that ADA remains within this support range, maintaining its position despite market fluctuations. If buying pressure persists, Cardano price could establish a stronger footing and attempt an upward breakout. Meanwhile, Grok 3 AI highlighted Cardano’s strong decentralization as a driving force behind its potential rally to $5-$6 in this bull cycle. If Cardano price can break key resistance levels, it may gain the bullish momentum needed to reach these ambitious price targets. Technical Indicators Suggest Growing Buying Pressure Cardano price is about to cross the 20-day Exponential Moving Average, a significant indicator for short-term trend identification. The 20 EMA acts as a support level and a breakout above it may indicate a rally for the altcoin. Supporting the bullish sentiments, the 1-day Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicates Cardano price is holding above key support levels, providing a foundation for a altcoin rally. More so, the MACD line is above the signal line, signaling a bullish crossover. If ADA maintains its position above $0.75 and builds on this momentum, it will break the $0.80 resistance and push higher in the short term. Furthermore, there is the Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR) indicator whose dotted lines are placed below Cardano price, which is common in an upward trend . This suggests that ADA price has found a strong support base, further reinforcing the likelihood of an upward move. Source: TradingView ADA Price To $1? If Cardano price remains above the key support range of $0.67–$0.80 and manages to break above resistance levels, analysts project a potential rally toward $0.94. A successful test of this price point could pave the way for ADA to revisit the $1 mark. Conversely, if ADA fails to sustain support above $0.67, selling pressure could increase, driving the price lower. In such a scenario, the next key support level would be around $0.54, where buyers might re-enter the market. Moreover, another analyst shared the bullish sentiments, emphasizing that ADA price movements suggest a potential breakout. The expert highlighted that if Cardano surpasses the critical resistance at $0.9837, it could pave the way for a rally toward $1.35.

Major shifts are happening, with XRP coin drawing attention due to ETF speculation and Solana facing increased short positions as network activity declines. Despite Solana’s recent price dip, long-term interest in its ecosystem remains strong. Meanwhile, Web3Bay , a decentralized e-commerce platform, is transforming blockchain-based shopping by integrating crypto, fiat, and PayPal payments. This hybrid system offers users a smoother shift into decentralized commerce without giving up familiar payment methods. With regulatory decisions impacting XRP, market shifts affecting Solana, and Web3Bay’s payment model gaining traction, crypto adoption is evolving. Each project represents different aspects of this change—finance, blockchain infrastructure, and real-world use—making them key players in shaping the market’s next chapter. Web3Bay’s Hybrid Payment System Simplifies Blockchain Shopping For crypto to gain more users, it must be easy to use. Web3Bay tackles this by offering a decentralized e-commerce platform that accepts crypto, fiat, and PayPal payments. This hybrid approach is more flexible than most blockchain marketplaces, letting users choose the payment method that suits them. Whether they prefer stablecoins, bank transfers, or digital wallets, Web3Bay removes the barriers that often discourage people from trying decentralized commerce. The demand for this system is evident. Web3Bay’s presale has raised over $1.5 million, with more than 370 million 3BAY tokens sold. With a 6,430% ROI potential, early buyers are securing their positions before the final presale price of $0.1959. Spanning 28 stages, this structure rewards early supporters while ensuring steady value growth before the platform’s official launch. By merging crypto’s flexibility with fiat’s convenience, Web3Bay makes decentralized shopping more accessible for everyday use. Even XRP coin holders seeking practical ways to spend their crypto can benefit from Web3Bay’s smooth and user-friendly payment system. Analyzing XRP Coin’s ETF Speculation XRP coin is at a crucial point, with speculation rising over a potential XRP ETF approval. The SEC is currently reviewing an application that could allow institutional investors to access XRP through a regulated exchange-traded fund. Approval could boost demand and drive further market activity. Ripple is also expanding its ecosystem with Ripple USD (RLUSD), a stablecoin designed for enterprise use, strengthening XRP’s role in crypto payments. At $2.56, XRP has experienced high volatility, with analysts predicting a potential rise to $5–$7 in the coming months. While traders are split on short-term performance, long-term optimism remains, supported by growing institutional interest and improving regulatory clarity. With financial institutions watching closely, XRP’s next move could have a significant impact on the broader crypto market. Solana Price Drips as Market Sentiment Weakens The Solana price has dropped to $167.28, down 8.14% over the past 24 hours. A rise in short positions reflects bearish sentiment, partly due to declining network activity. On-chain data shows a 55% drop in active addresses since November 2024, raising concerns about user engagement. Despite this, Solana’s ecosystem remains a hub for growth, with developers continuing to create new applications. External factors are also playing a role. The recent U.S. presidential election has sparked discussions on crypto regulations, boosting interest in both Solana and XRP coins. Institutional inflows into Solana-based investment products indicate that demand remains strong despite recent price drops. Many analysts see this dip as a potential setup for future growth, depending on how the market responds to broader economic and regulatory trends. Final Remarks! Crypto is evolving quickly, with XRP coin, Solana, and Web3Bay driving different aspects of this shift. While XRP awaits regulatory clarity and Solana faces short-term volatility, Web3Bay is making crypto payments more practical for real-world use. As a decentralized e-commerce platform , Web3Bay’s hybrid payment system bridges the gap between traditional finance and blockchain, making it easier for users to engage in decentralized shopping. With over $1.5 million raised and a solid presale structure, Web3Bay shows the real demand for accessible and flexible payment solutions. Whether through investments, blockchain infrastructure, or real-world adoption, these three projects are shaping the future of crypto.

The Shiba Inu price has long been a favorite among retail investors, yet recent stagnation below $0.3 has raised concerns about its long-term viability. Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as a powerhouse, with a 750x growth potential that presents a lucrative opportunity for investors. The Ethereum-based AI’s ongoing presale is already attracting substantial investments, signaling massive confidence in its long-term success. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The 750x Growth Opportunity Drawing Investors In WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out as a transformative force in the multi-billion-dollar crypto wallet and AI security industry rather than being just another token. With a presale that is rapidly gaining traction, thousands of investors are securing early positions, enabling the DeFi wallet’s price to skyrocket once the next round begins. The current presale round has already seen record-breaking investments, with projections indicating a price surge of over 750x after the token launches publicly. WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a secure, AI-powered decentralized wallet that allows direct trading of over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. Presale investors gain access to discounted prices and benefit from lower transaction fees, exclusive features, and governance rights, which allow them to influence platform development. These benefits have attracted SHIB whales and DOGE whales looking to diversify into a token with tangible use cases and a strong financial model. Security remains paramount, with AI-driven technology proactively detecting threats and safeguarding digital assets against hacks. The integration of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) enables transactions and private keys to remain protected. More than just a wallet, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers an entire financial ecosystem where investors can earn, trade, and govern the platform’s future. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is launching its beta platform soon, offering early adopters access to its innovative AI-driven crypto wallet. This phase will highlight security features, trading options, and asset management tools, showcasing the future of decentralized finance. Additionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has passed a rigorous audit by SolidProof, certifying its smart contracts as secure and transparent. This commitment to compliance and security positions the Ethereum-based AI as a strong alternative to stagnant assets like the Shiba Inu price, instilling investor confidence. The MVP version of the WallitIQ (WLTQ) mobile app establishes it as a frontrunner in the development of crypto wallets. This launch will unveil cutting-edge features aimed at improving wallet management, incorporating real-time pricing, and offering sophisticated trading options. Selling at a discounted price of $0.0420 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a compelling opportunity as the Shiba Inu price stagnates below $0.3. With overwhelming demand and potential for 750x growth, a significant price increase appears inevitable, making it an appealing choice for savvy investors. Shiba Inu Price: A Struggle To Regain Momentum Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a popular token, but its inability to push past $0.3 has left investors questioning its ability to deliver sustained returns. The Shiba Inu price whales have continuously supported the token, but diminishing trading volumes suggest a weakening demand. Investors who once anticipated explosive growth are now watching as the token remains trapped in a cycle of minor rallies and corrections. Despite previous gains, the Shiba Inu price struggles to generate the same enthusiasm as it once did. Investors who rode the early wave of the Shiba Inu price success are now weighing alternative options, as meme-based speculation alone is no longer enough to sustain long-term growth. While the Shiba Inu price whales continue holding significant positions, the broader market sentiment remains lukewarm. With investors looking for the next high-reward opportunity, the focus is shifting toward WallitIQ (WLTQ) and its unprecedented growth potential. Conclusion: WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Top Investment Opportunity Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a well-known asset, but its stagnant price performance is causing investors to seek alternatives. With WallitIQ (WLTQ) offering a 750x growth potential, AI-driven security, and lucrative presale rewards, the decision for investors is clear. The presale is already attracting record-breaking investments , with thousands of investors recognizing the massive upside potential. SHIB whales and DOGE whales are investing in the Ethereum-based token, anticipating exponential gains once it launches publicly. Now is the time to secure a position in what could be the most profitable investment of the year.

The banks outlined the Q4 losses in “net charge-offs” statements, revealing loans that the banks have declared as uncollectible and removed from their books after exhausting efforts to recover the owed amounts. JPMorgan Chase reported the highest charge-offs at $2.4 billion, driven largely by customers with big unpaid balances on their credit cards. Bank of America recorded $1.5 billion in charge-offs, also primarily from its credit card portfolio. And Wells Fargo reported $1.288 billion in charge-offs, fueled by higher credit card losses and commercial real estate losses in its office portfolio. The new numbers come as US credit card debt hits a record $1.21 trillion, according to new numbers from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The collective losses at the three banks represent a $188 million increase over the previous quarter, and a $460 million increase from one year ago. Despite the losses, the banks reported major earnings in Q4, with JPMorgan Chase declaring $14 billion in profits, Bank of America reporting $6.7 billion and Wells Fargo coming in at $5.1 billion.

Amid this, XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs, has once again neared a crucial support level from the ascending trendline, which it has been testing since the beginning of February 2025. Considering the current market sentiment and XRP’s outlook, the token appears to have absorbed all the bearish pressure and is now recovering. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, as the XRP price reached the trendline support of $2.50 level a significant buying pressure was observed resulting in the formation of a bullish candlestick pattern. Besides this, the recent price drop has not affected XRP’s past ascending triangle price action pattern which it has formed. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if XRP holds above the $2.50 level, there is a strong possibility that the asset could soar significantly in the coming days and maintain its bullish momentum. However, if the token fails to hold this level and closes a four-hour candle below $2.45, a massive price drop could occur, potentially pushing XRP down to the $1.90 level. Despite the ongoing price recovery, the asset remains below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating that it is still in a downtrend. Current Price Momentum With these key levels in focus, XRP is currently trading near $2.58, having dropped over 3.75% in the past 24 hours. However, despite the decline, investors and traders have shown strong interest in the token, leading to a 44% increase in participation. $21.50 Million Worth XRP Outflow Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass revealed that this rise in participation is driven by significant investor accumulation of XRP tokens. Spot inflow/outflow data showed that as the price dropped, exchanges witnessed a substantial outflow of $21.50 million worth of XRP tokens, indicating potential accumulation. Source: Coinglass Combining this potential accumulation with price action, the current level appears to be an ideal buying opportunity, with $2.50 or $2.45 serving as a potential exit level if sentiment shifts toward the bearish side.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 01:11:47

TD Sequential Says Yes,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/is-it-time-to-buy-xrp-td-sequential-says-yes/,"A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential has just given a buy signal on the hourly XRP price chart. XRP Has Just Witnessed A Bullish Setup On TD Sequential In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a TD Sequential signal that XRP has seen recently. The “TD Sequential” here refers to an indicator from technical analysis (TA) that’s used for locating probable points of reversal in any asset’s price. The indicator consists of two phases: setup and countdown. In the first of these, candles of the same polarity (that is, whether red or green) are counted up to nine. Once these candles, which don’t have to be one after the other, are printed on the chart, the TD Sequential gives a reversal signal. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Plunges 58%: How Do Shiba Inu & Pepe Compare? The countdown phase begins as soon as the setup is over. This phase also works much in the same way, with the only difference being that candles here are counted up to thirteen, not nine. Once the countdown is finished, the asset can be assumed to have arrived at another potential turnaround. Where a TD Sequential signal might lead the price naturally depends on the type of candle that led to the phase’s completion. Green candles naturally mean a correction may be coming, while red ones suggest a bullish reversal. XRP has recently completed the former TD Sequential phase on its 1-hour price. Here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows this pattern forming for the cryptocurrency: As is visible in the above graph, the TD Sequential has finished a setup with nine red candles for XRP recently, which implies the cryptocurrency’s price can be considered to have reached a bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin RHODL Momentum Slowing Down—Analyst Warns Pattern ‘Not Ideal’ If the pattern indeed holds, then the asset would next see a rebound to the upside. Though, given the fact that this buy signal has formed on a short timeframe (1-hour), the surge resulting from the signal may not be too large. Speaking of the TD Sequential, XRP isn’t the only cryptocurrency that has displayed a bullish formation in its hourly price. As Martinez has pointed out in another X post, Steller (XLM) has also seen a buy setup recently. “Stellar $XLM is ready to rebound as the TD Sequential indicator shows a buy signal on the hourly chart!” notes the analyst. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the signal would come to fruition for XRP and XLM or not. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.67, down 1% in the last seven days.

The company was facing a potential lawsuit from the SEC over NFTs being classified as securities. Bloomberg reported on Friday that the SEC told OpenSea that the agency had closed its investigation without taking enforcement action. SEC issued Wells Notice, but OpenSea resisted NFT securities classification The development follows a Wells notice issued to the NFT marketplace last August, indicating the SEC’s intent to take legal action. The agency had been investigating whether some NFTs traded on OpenSea’s platform were actually securities, part of its wider push to regulate the crypto industry. A Wells notice is a formal communication from the SEC that allows the recipient to respond before the agency makes a final enforcement decision. Even though the notice indicated the SEC thought some NFTs might be subject to securities laws, OpenSea had taken the position that classifying them this way would misunderstand the current laws and choke innovation in the space. Devin Finzer, co-founder and CEO of OpenSea, welcomed the news and said the development is a win for everyone who is making and building in their space. He added that attempting to label NFTs as securities would have set them back. According to Finzer, every creator, no matter how small, should be able to build without undue friction.” Finzer’s comments echo the views of other NFT and broader web3 community members who have contended that NFTs are primarily a form of digital collectibles and art, not financial securities. OpenSea had already reserved $5 million in a legal defense fund to help NFT artists and developers who could be scrutinized by the SEC. Crypto community pushes back as SEC eases NFT and crypto regulations The SEC’s efforts to define NFTs as securities have been met with a widespread backlash from the crypto community who see such regulation as a barrier to innovation. For holders and creators of at least some NFTs, the SEC’s decision to close the investigation without enforcement action potentially signals a more lenient approach to enforcement regarding NFTs, which may be a relief for marketplaces, creators, and collectors that have been scrambling to parse existing regulatory guidance. Meanwhile, in a related development, the SEC has also dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase. The crypto exchange revealed earlier today that the SEC staff had agreed in principle to dismiss the case, subject to final approval by the commissioners. If formally adopted, the dismissal would be with prejudice, which would bar the SEC from reissuing similar charges against Coinbase in the future and could impact other ongoing legal fights involving other crypto platforms. The SEC’s decision not to pursue OpenSea any further is a landmark moment for the NFT space and confirms that digital assets as a whole should not be shoehorned into historical securities-based regulation. With OpenSea free from the concerns of regulatory action, creators and developers within the NFT space can focus on innovating as the specter of gory enforcement recedes.

33767162,[object Object],1740189610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Hoskinson Charts Cardano’s Three-Step Path To Quantum Resistance,https://bitcoinist.com/hoskinson-cardano-path-quantum-resistance/,"In a livestream broadcast titled “Post-Quantum Cardano,” ADA founder Charles Hoskinson laid out a roadmap for making the blockchain quantum-resistant. His remarks come amid rapid developments in quantum computing hardware, including breakthroughs from Microsoft and other tech heavyweights, as well as newly released US government standards for post-quantum cryptography. Hoskinson opened the session by highlighting the accelerating pace of progress in quantum computing: “The quantum computer world is heating up quite a bit, and a lot of magical amazing things are happening… It is my belief that in 5–10 years we’ll probably make substantial progress to the point where we really have to start thinking about updating and modernizing the cryptography.” He also pointed to the recent actions by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which, in August 2024, finalized several post-quantum encryption standards to begin guiding the industry forward: “Turns out it’s not just my belief—it’s the United States government’s belief as well The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proactively got together […] and they created some standards.” NIST has published new Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) numbered 203, 204, 205, and 206, which define algorithms intended to resist quantum attacks. Hoskinson noted the significance of this for the global cryptographic community, as these standards will likely spur hardware manufacturers to incorporate specialized circuitry that can handle post-quantum algorithms more efficiently. Currently, Cardano’s security model—like most major blockchains—relies heavily on elliptic curve cryptography. Hoskinson warned that Shor’s algorithm, which can run on large-scale quantum computers, poses a theoretical threat to such elliptic curve systems: “The problem is we have this thing called Shor’s algorithm […] if you have a quantum computer, it can kill the security of that [elliptic curve] […] So what a lot of people in the blockchain space do is they say, ‘Oh well, we got a post-quantum signature scheme, so we’re good.’ But that couldn’t be further from the truth.” He stressed that security in a post-quantum world extends beyond just swapping one signature scheme for another. Instead, blockchains must define comprehensive security models that consider what kind of adversaries they will face—an adversary with a quantum computer also has capabilities like side-channel attacks, hardware infiltration, or even “offline” brute force attempts against older, stored data. The Three-Step Plan For Cardano Hoskinson laid out a clear, three-phase approach for transitioning Cardano into a fully quantum-resistant system over the coming years. 1. Develop A Quantum-Secure Model Cardano’s foundational cryptographic protocols must be audited against a “canonical quantum adversary.” This means systematically reviewing every algorithm for potential vulnerabilities once a capable quantum computer emerges. “First, we have to develop a Quantum secure model for Cardano, end to end, so we would audit all the algorithms Cardano is using and ask which ones are vulnerable […] That in itself is an interesting question, because there are various opinions in the cryptographic community about what we should assume a quantum adversary can do,” Hoskinson said. 2. Separate Cardano Into Two Chains Hoskinson next proposed creating a separate, post-quantum proof chain—a “meta” layer that can serve as an immutable checkpoint system for Cardano’s main chain. “You want to separate Cardano into two pieces: there’s Cardano [main chain] […] then we have a proof chain […] basically it runs as an audit log of history so you have an unforgeable system with signatures related to the original history. Over time, this can become a programmable proof chain.” He pointed to Mithril —Cardano’s existing technology for generating compact certificates of state—as a potential starting point. Updating Mithril with a post-quantum signature scheme would create a secure companion to the classical elliptic curve-based main chain without immediately disrupting its performance. Hoskinson also mentioned new innovations like lattice fold plus—a compact “folding scheme” from researchers Dan Boneh and Binyu Chen—that could offer powerful cryptographic proof tools for this future proof chain. 3. Full Integration Finally, once the new proof chain matures and post-quantum schemes become more efficient (and gain hardware support), Cardano can merge these elements into the main chain. “Then the third phase is eventual integration […] as the PQSS schemes get more advanced plus we develop a post-quantum VRF […] we can put that into the chain and merge the meta chain and the main chain together.” This last phase would require substantial redesign of Cardano’s core protocols, possibly reconsidering the extended UTXO model and incorporating new authenticated data structures or ledger architectures. Hoskinson cautioned that post-quantum algorithms are typically 5–10 times slower and yield larger signatures than their classical elliptic curve counterparts. However, he expressed optimism that hardware manufacturers—prompted by NIST’s finalized standards—will incorporate specialized circuitry to speed up these new cryptographic techniques. “We had to wait for NIST to say, ‘Yo dawg, we have standards now,’ […] because now that they’re here, hardware manufacturers will start building custom capabilities to speed [post-quantum signature schemes] up,” Hoskinson remarked. He also clarified that no algorithm remains secure forever in the face of continuous advances in computing. This dynamic “cat and mouse” reality is common in cryptography: “Quantum computers are just another bomb, and the Enigma machine is the classical crypto […] It’s an eternal journey and they’re never going to stop.” According to Hoskinson, the timeframe for Cardano’s transition will likely span several years: 2025–2026: Establish a formal research agenda and define Cardano’s quantum security model. Mid-Term (2–3 years): Build out a post-quantum proof chain (e.g., via Mithril) to audit and checkpoint the main chain. Long-Term (3+ years): Merge the two chains, adopt post-quantum VRFs and signature schemes throughout, and possibly revamp the ledger model. Concluding his remarks, Hoskinson emphasized the need for collaboration both within and beyond the Cardano ecosystem. He expects discussions to take place at Intersect (the Cardano governance entity), the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), and with leading cryptographers at institutions like Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, and the University of Edinburgh. “Cardano is not caught with its pants down […] We have some of the best cryptographers in the world working at IO […] It’s a fundamental thing, and every protocol has to be systematically checked,” the Cardano founder concluded.

Additionally, ADA’s four-hour chart appears to be mirroring XRP’s , which looks bullish. Current Price Momentum Currently, ADA is trading near $0.77 and has dropped 3.25% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume surged by 45%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors. Cardano (ADA) Bullish and Bearish Levels Despite market fluctuations, the $0.74 level will play a crucial role today. Based on recent price momentum, this level will determine whether ADA sinks or gains upward momentum. Source: Trading View On the positive side, if ADA holds this level, there is a strong possibility it could soar 10% to reach $0.85 in the coming hours. Additionally, if the bullish rally continues, it could gain another 20% to reach $1.01 in the coming days. On the bearish side, if ADA fails to hold the $0.74 level and closes a four-hour candle below it, there is a strong possibility of a 10% drop to $0.65.

The DeFi token holds steady even as large wallet investors and whales holding MKR take profits in the ongoing price surge. On-chain and technical indicators support further gains in Maker. Table of Contents Maker derivatives and on-chain analysis Maker (MKR) weekly price forecast MKR holds steady amidst DAO drama Maker tokens worth $17 million burnt, support gains Maker derivatives and on-chain analysis Sky Protocol (formerly Maker’s) ( MKR ) MKR token has defied market trends in the past week. The token gained over 44% in value, according to price data on Crypto.news. Derivatives data and on-chain analysis supports a bullish thesis for the DeFi token for next week. Derivatives data from crypto intelligence platform Coinglass shows a large positive spike in Open Interest in MKR on February 21. The spike represents a massive increase in the total value of open contracts in MKR across derivatives exchanges. Coinglass data shows that MKR OI is $116.85 million at the time of writing on Friday, February 21. MKR Futures Open Interest | Source: Coinglass The total value of assets locked in MKR surged to $5.675 billion, as seen on DeFiLlama. This coincides with the rising price, relevance, and demand for tokens among traders. The rebranding to Sky protocol has proven effective for driving adoption in market participants. Maker TVL | Source: DeFiLlama Santiment data shows several negative spikes in Network realized profit/loss metric in the MKR chart since mid-January 2025. This shows several traders and MKR holders are shedding their holdings and realizing losses. Consistent realization of losses is typically considered a sign of capitulation and is consistent with an eventual recovery in the token’s price. MKR’s daily active addresses recorded a nearly three-month peak this week, signalling the rise in interest from traders. MKR token’s supply held by whales (excluding exchange wallets) has climbed, recovering from the decline noted in the first week of February. This is another bullish sign for the DeFi token. Maker on-chain analysis | Source: Santiment The In/Out of money around price indicator on IntoTheBlock shows that 30% of the wallet addresses holding MKR are currently sitting on unrealized losses. 65.55% of MKR token holders have unrealized gains in their portfolio. Combining the In/Out of the money with the Network realized profit/loss metric, it is less likely that profitable traders take profits as the current trend is that of capitulation. The likelihood of further selling pressure on MKR is low for next week, meaning the token could extend its gains and maintain the underlying positive momentum. In/Out of the Money around price | Source: IntoTheBlock Maker (MKR) weekly price forecast Maker broke out of its downward trend on February 12, since then the token has rallied, extending gains nearly everyday this week. At the time of writing, MKR is trading at $1,473, on Friday. The token is close to resistance at $1,632 and $2,050, two key levels in MKR’s upward trend between October 26 and December 4, as observed in the daily price chart. In the event of a correction, MKR could find support at $1,125. Two key technical indicators, the Moving average convergence divergence indicator and relative strength index flash bullish signs on the daily timeframe. MACD shows consecutive green histogram bars above the neutral line and RSI reads 74 and is sloping upwards. While this typically generates a sell signal, in the case of MKR, MACD and the underlying positive momentum in the MKR price trend support further gains.

Yesterday, an emergency proposal appeared on the MakerDAO @skyecosystem forum and voting portal. This proposal, which has passed but still pending timelock, dramatically increases both the amount and the LTV that Maker will lend against its own gov token.

Maker tokens worth $17 million burnt, support gains The second market mover for MKR this week is the $17 million token burn, identified on the blockchain.

The meme coin is facing massive sell pressure at the moment, prompting more bearish Dogecoin price movement. Smart market players have identified Panshibi (SHIBI) as the perfect Dogecoin alternative. The Asian-backed meme coin has maintained a positive outlook despite market conditions, and analysis suggests early presale investors could gain 100x from it. Let’s see what the Dogecoin price prediction says in comparison to Panshibi (SHIBI) Dogecoin Risks Further Price Drop As Sell Pressure Increases If the current trend persists, the Dogecoin dip could worsen in the coming days. Short-term Dogecoin holders are already abandoning the coin, as the new Panshibi (SHIBI) looks better primed for an imminent bullish run. The DOGE sell-off is affecting the meme coin's upward momentum, but Dogecoin has maintained its consolidation zone around $0.24 - $0.25 since last week. Despite Grayscale's ETF filing for several altcoins, including Dogecoin, demand on the meme coin has been unimpressive as bearish market trends persist. Technical analysis also identified a death cross on the meme coin, signaling an imminent bearish run. While the popular Dogecoin price prediction targets a surge to $1, recent market trends highlight a potential dip below $0.1. With growing volatility on DOGE, holders have been quick to explore other market opportunities to deliver better returns for investors in the short and long run. Panshibi (SHIBI) To Rally Impressively Soon, Despite General Market Woes Presale tokens are seemingly the best investment types in the crypto market. Even in high market volatility, they offer controlled market parameters that almost guarantee profit for early buyers. The ongoing Stage 4 Panshibi presale is an opportunity for early investors to get in cheap ahead of a higher listing price. Panshibi (SHIBI) is set for 15 presale stages over 60 days, and the ongoing Stage 4 is selling out fast at $0.005. While this entry allows investors to secure over 400% gains before the $0.026 listing, the bigger profit margin is available after the token launch. Panshibi is a new panda-themed meme coin that leverages its Asian influence to grow. To increase engagement in its community, the project will introduce quests, contests, and other reward-backed activities. To achieve this, the meme coin will integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with its Social-Fi mechanism. The new meme coin is currently enjoying much interest, and the fact that it's well-audited and declared safe by Coinsult has added to investors' confidence in it. Panshibi is expected to enjoy higher adoption, and early adopters may gain the most from the token. Additionally, Panshibi will implement a ten-year liquidity lock and lock team tokens for two years, establishing a long-term commitment to the project’s success. Once the presale is over, the Panshibi team will also renounce contract ownership. Conclusion Dogecoin (DOGE) is already at a market size without a margin for 100x gains. Therefore, investors are betting on the more promising prospect of a 100x profit on Panshibi (SHIBI) as the new meme coin does impressive numbers on presale. Unlike Dogecoin, Panshibi (SHIBI) is building momentum from presale and is likely to maintain it when it hits exchanges. The Panda-themed meme coin looks ready to yield good returns, and its prospects are clear for all to see.

This downward momentum casts doubt over the coin's future price trends. In the midst of this downturn, the Panshibi (SHIBI) token has caught the attention of shrewd investors seeking alternatives. Despite widespread market challenges, Panshibi maintains a bright outlook, with projections suggesting potential exponential growth for early presale participants. Considering the current Dogecoin forecast and contrasting it with the optimistic predictions for Panshibi (SHIBI) provides intriguing insights. The Uncertain Path for Dogecoin Amid Rising Sell-offs As selling pressure intensifies, Dogecoin faces the possibility of further depreciation. Investors are turning to Panshibi (SHIBI) for its potential upswing, as the established meme coin struggles to break past the $0.24 - $0.25 zone. Despite efforts like Grayscale's ETF initiatives for Dogecoin, the prevailing bearish sentiment poses challenges. Furthermore, technical indicators hint at potential downturns, marking a cautious outlook for its trajectory. While ambitions of a $1 price tag for Dogecoin exist, volatile conditions suggest a dip closer to $0.1 might be on the horizon. Such fluctuations are driving investors towards more promising ventures that promise lucrative returns in both short and long-term scopes. Panshibi (SHIBI) Sets the Stage for Remarkable Growth Despite Market Hurdles Cryptocurrency presales, with their predictable settings, have attracted those keen on securing early gains amidst market unpredictability. Panshibi's Stage 4 presale offers a gateway to potential profitability at attractive rates. Panshibi (SHIBI) is structured for 15 strategic presale stages, with the current phase advancing swiftly at a $0.005 rate. Investors anticipate substantial gains post-listing, but the true value lies beyond the presale. The Asian-themed panda coin capitalizes on its cultural allure, incorporating features like AI-driven Social-Fi components to boost community engagement through interactive events and rewards. Its rigorous audit process by Coinsult enhances its credibility and investor trust. Further securing its foundation, Panshibi has committed to locking liquidity and team tokens to ensure sustained growth. Post-presale, the project's commitment extends to relinquishing contract ownership, solidifying its long-term vision. Final Thoughts With Dogecoin's current market ceiling hindering dramatic returns, investors are eagerly eyeing the potential windfall that comes with Panshibi (SHIBI). This new entrant in the meme coin domain is making waves, thanks to its strategic presale success. Where Dogecoin falls short, Panshibi (SHIBI) shines by leveraging its early market momentum and anticipated post-listing performance. Its panda-themed appeal offers promising prospects for returns, capturing investor interest worldwide.

Optimists believe this could represent the start of a more general upward movement, backed by Cardano’s strong technical updates in 2024 and thorough plans for 2025. So, is this optimism reasonable to have, or should holders be more cautious? Cardano Price Prediction 2025: Can ADA Really Double? Cardano (ADA) has had a volatile ride in recent months, but analysts remain optimistic about its long-term potential. With key network upgrades in the pipeline, many experts believe ADA could double in value by 2025, potentially hitting $1.50 to $2.00 as adoption grows. One major factor supporting this Cardano price prediction is the blockchain’s commitment to scalability and decentralization. The upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade is set to increase transaction throughput, improving efficiency and making Cardano more competitive with Ethereum. Additionally, the move toward full governance, reinforced by the Plomin Hard Fork and Lace Wallet expansion, could attract more developers and institutional investors to the ecosystem. On-chain data suggests that Cardano accumulation is rising. The number of addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA has steadily increased , signaling that whales are positioning themselves for long-term gains. Currently, Cardano’s market cap sits at $26.58 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $879.83 million, demonstrating strong liquidity and continued investor interest So, is a 2x Cardano price prediction realistic for 2025? If scalability upgrades roll out smoothly and institutional interest continues growing, a strong rally is definitely on the table. A New Meme Coin Challenges The Status Quo Away from established blockchain giants, in the world of meme coins, Panshibi (SHIBI) is turning heads with its fresh take on what meme coins can achieve. With a rewarding staking program, a security-first approach and a unique real-world mission, this project is leading the evolution of the genre. Panshibi (SHIBI) shines for the financial incentives it offers native token holders. Any investor holding SHIBI tokens can earn competitive APYs of up to 1,200%. This creates an additional passive income stream in addition to any token appreciation returns. A generous 15% of the token’s total supply has been allocated to staking rewards, to ensure that these are sustainable for the long term. Panshibi has also gone the extra mile to protect investors as security becomes a more central concern in the crypto space. To give investor’s peace of mind, Panshibi (SHIBI) has had its smart contract thoroughly audited by Coinsult, verifying its stability. There is also a strategic liquidity lock in place of 10 years for general tokens and two years for team tokens, preventing insider sell-offs or price manipulation. With these measures in place, Panshibi is setting a new benchmark for safety in the meme coin space. Many meme coins burn out after launch, but Panshibi has structured its roadmap for sustained growth. Plans include listings on major decentralized and centralized exchanges, NFT partnerships and the expansion of a social-fi platform to keep users engaged and the community thriving. By maintaining an innovative approach, Panshibi is positioning itself as more than just another meme token - it’s building a full-scale ecosystem. Beyond its financial potential, Panshibi is actively contributing to a cause that matters. A portion of the ecosystem funds panda conservation efforts, helping restore habitats, protect natural reserves and support breeding programs. With conservation groups struggling for resources, Panshibi’s integration of crypto and wildlife preservation is attracting investors who want their money to make a difference. This unique approach has helped Panshibi stand out from the competition, proving that meme coins can be a force for good.
