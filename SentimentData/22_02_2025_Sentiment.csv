The leading decentralized computing network transferred 4,850 ETH from one of its associated wallets to top liquid exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. Binance Receives 3,800 Ethereum Noteworthy, the developer team working on the project performed the transfers to the two exchanges in nine separate transactions. All the transactions occurred on February 20 between 15:46 (UTC) and 18:19 (UTC). ETH traded at $2,818.08 at press time after recording a 3.26% increase within the last 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap data. This price level sums the computing network’s Ethereum dumping to over $13.6 million. A major portion of the assets went to Richard Teng-led Binance . The digital asset service provider received up to 3,800 ETH, worth $10.7 million. Blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence claimed that the other 1,050 ETH, valued at approximately $2.9 million, was moved to a Coinbase wallet address. No ETH Dump, Just Solo Staking With CEX Five months ago, the Ethereum ICO participant moved 2,000 ETH to the American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase in five transactions. Markedly, this was the last time that the project made such a transfer to a centralized exchange. At the time, users were concerned about CEX’s involvement in a solo staking process. In response, Golem Network explained to these concerned users that it wasn’t dumping the second-largest cryptocurrency by market. Instead, it claimed that the transfers were all part of a staking test to ensure operational security. “Our objective was to create a controlled environment where we could monitor the impact of various factors on the staking-related processes,” the team wrote. Golem Network’s ETH Dump Could Trigger Selling Pressure Historically, such huge transfers of tokens to exchanges are usually followed by sales into USDT. At other times, they are swapped to other digital assets. Whatever the case, a sell-off of this size could trigger market pressure and a downtrend in the price of ETH. However, this is highly dependent on the speed of liquidation. Though yet to be confirmed, Ethereum allegedly saw a sharp plunge around the time of the nine transactions from Golem to Binance and Coinbase. From trading around $2,764 an hour before the transaction, the ETH price went down to $2,708 just a few minutes after the first set of funds moved to Binance. Judging by the current price of the altcoin, there has been some price recovery for Ethereum.

In stark contrast, Web3Bay harnesses blockchain technology to forge a decentralized, peer-to-peer marketplace free from such constraints. This model abolishes the need for intermediaries, enabling direct interactions between buyers and sellers. This not only drastically cuts transaction fees—typically between 10% to 15% on conventional platforms—but also enhances profit margins for sellers and reduces costs for buyers. Moreover, the security and transparency of transactions are bolstered by smart contracts, eliminating fraud risks without the need for third-party verification. Momentum & Market Potential of Web3Bay’s Presale The Web3Bay 3BAY token presale is capturing significant investor interest, a testament to the growing confidence in decentralized commerce solutions. As of February, the initiative has garnered over $1.5 million and distributed nearly 370 million tokens over four stages. With the token currently priced at $0.004562625, its value is projected to climb through 28 stages to a potential launch price of $0.1959, promising a substantial return on investment of up to 6000% for early investors. The presale’s success is not isolated but reflects a broader shift towards blockchain integrations across sectors like finance, gaming, and now, e-commerce. Investors are drawn to Web3Bay’s potential for low-cost, autonomously governed, and user-directed trade, positioning it as a formidable alternative to established market leaders. Challenges & Forward-Looking Perspective for Decentralized E-Commerce Despite the allure of its zero-fee and self-governed model, Web3Bay confronts significant hurdles, including user and merchant onboarding, competition from entrenched players, and the need for seamless integration with existing cryptocurrency payment systems. The platform’s ability to attract a critical mass of users and provide a frictionless shopping experience will be crucial. Nevertheless, the increasing consumer and vendor disillusionment with traditional e-commerce behemoths, coupled with the rising demand for more equitable, blockchain-based systems, points to a promising trajectory for Web3Bay. Should it fulfill its strategic promises, Web3Bay is poised to challenge the dominance of Amazon and eBay, potentially revolutionizing online shopping with its blockchain-centric approach.

Each of these tokens has exhibited impressive momentum, attracting retail and institutional investors eager to capitalize on the next big breakout. While SUI and BONK have already made waves in the market, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is emerging as a powerful competitor, driven by AI integration and a record-breaking presale event. Analysts are weighing in on which project has the strongest fundamentals and growth potential to win this crypto race. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The AI Meme Coin Set To Win The Crypto Race To $5 As the 2025 crypto race continues, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to outshine SUI and BONK with its AI-powered ecosystem and rapid presale growth. While many meme coins rely on speculation, FloppyPepe (FPPE) combines artificial intelligence, passive income rewards, and a burn mechanism to create a high-value, long-term investment. Analysts predict that FloppyPepe (FPPE) will first surge past $5 and become the next breakout star in the crypto space. FloppyPepe (FPPE) allows traders to approach the volatile market with confidence with its AI-driven predictive model. Its AI video agent provides real-time market insights to help traders make well-informed decisions. Additionally, the upcoming AI text-to-image feature , set to launch on its Telegram community channel in just a week, enables users to monetize AI-generated content. FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers investors multiple ways to earn passive income and long-term rewards. Every transaction redistributes 3% back to token holders to guarantee steady earnings while promoting long-term investment. Its burn mechanism reduces supply to drive price appreciation. With stage-based pricing structures already delivering impressive returns, early adopters stand to gain massively as the token surges toward $5. Also, the network completed a smart audit with SolidProof to guarantee the platform’s freedom from scam attacks and bugs. As momentum builds ahead of the 2025 bull run, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining traction at an astonishing rate. This meme coin extends its impact beyond the crypto market by allocating some of its revenue to wildlife conservation efforts . At its current entry price of just $0.0000002 , investors have a rare opportunity to secure their positions before FloppyPepe (FPPE) outpaces SUI and BONK to hit the $5 milestone. As a forward-thinking project, FloppyPepe (FPPE) recorded over $900,000 inflow in its private round. This approach shows that this AI-powered memecoin is a forward-thinking crypto project. A popular YouTuber with over a million subscribers, NASS Crypto, has backed this AI meme coin to reach unprecedented heights in the coming years. These numbers show confidence in its formidable network and its potential charge. Sui (SUI) and Bonk (BONK) Gear Up For The Next Bull Run Analysts have begun to weigh in ahead of the next bull run. Having observed their performances, they are certain that FloppyPepe (FPPE) will outperform SUI and Bonk (BONK) . Despite trading above $3, the recent whale sell-off shows that investors have low confidence in SUI. Bonk (BONK), on the other hand, has received predictions for 20-25x growth in the next bull run. However, these gains pale in comparison to FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) astronomical ROIs. Why Expert Sentiments Favor FloppyPepe (FPPE) While SUI and BONK have shown strong market performances, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quickly proving to be the ultimate contender in the crypto race to $5. Unlike its rivals, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is backed by cutting-edge AI integration, a thriving community, and a presale event that has already shattered expectations. Its blend of advanced technology and meme culture gives it a competitive edge over SUI and BONK. With analysts predicting exponential growth and investors rushing to secure their positions early, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is emerging as the most promising token to reach the $5 milestone first. As excitement builds around its AI-driven ecosystem and market demand skyrockets, early adopters stand to reap the most rewards.

Cardano has long been viewed as one of the most promising blockchain projects, but its recent performance has sparked concern. With slow development progress and growing competition from newer, faster blockchains, traders are looking beyond Cardano for fresh opportunities. And one altcoin that’s capturing attention is PropiChain (PCHAIN) ; a project that combines blockchain with real-world applications and is showing strong bullish momentum. Cardano Price Struggles While Investors Look Elsewhere The Cardano price has been struggling to break out, frustrating investors who once believed in its potential to revolutionize blockchain technology. One of the main challenges has been the slow rollout of key updates, such as smart contract improvements and scalability solutions. While Cardano remains a technically advanced blockchain, its slower adoption compared to networks like Solana and Ethereum has dampened investor enthusiasm. So investors, who were once eager to support projects like Cardano, are being more cautious with their allocations. As the Cardano price action remains unpredictable, smart investors are exploring projects with clear utility and strong growth potential like PropiChain . Why PropiChain Is Attracting Attention While the Cardano price fluctuates, PropiChain is gaining momentum for all the right reasons. The project is built to solve real-world problems, particularly in real estate investment, which has traditionally been difficult for the average person to access. With PropiChain, investors can own a share of high-value properties without needing massive amounts of capital. For example, instead of requiring millions of dollars to buy a commercial property, investors can purchase fractional shares using blockchain-based tokens. This allows people to benefit from property appreciation and rental income, just like traditional real estate investors; but with significantly lower entry costs. Another key feature is AI-powered market insights, which help investors make better decisions. Instead of guessing which property or virtual asset will increase in value, PropiChain’s AI tools analyze market trends and provide recommendations based on data. This gives investors a competitive advantage, making it easier to identify high-growth opportunities before the broader market catches on. Additionally, the tokenization ensures that property ownership is secure and easily transferable. By converting real estate into blockchain-based tokens, transactions become seamless, cutting out intermediaries and unnecessary fees because these tokenized assets can be traded effortlessly. PropiChain also provides global accessibility, allowing anyone, anywhere, to invest in real estate markets that were previously out of reach. This means a person in Asia could invest in a high-growth real estate market in Europe, all through a decentralized and secure blockchain platform. On top of that, PropiChain is integrating with the metaverse, allowing users to buy and sell digital real estate. As virtual economies grow, owning property in the metaverse could be just as valuable as physical assets. PropiChain is positioning itself at the forefront of this shift, giving investors multiple avenues for growth. Market Validation and Security Assurance While many blockchain projects struggle to gain legitimacy, PropiChain is proving itself through security audits and market recognition. A third-party security audit confirmed that PropiChain’s smart contracts are robust and free of vulnerabilities. This gives investors confidence that their funds are protected from potential exploits; an important factor in today’s crypto space. Additionally, PropiChain has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a key milestone that enhances its credibility and visibility in the market. This listing signals to investors that PropiChain is a serious contender, drawing attention from both retail and institutional players. The Opportunity: How Much Can Investors Gain? With Cardano price failing to show clear bullish signals, many investors are shifting their focus to PropiChain , where momentum is building fast. The project is currently in stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at just $0.011 each. A $1,000 investment at the current price could yield $330,000 in 2025 if PropiChain sees the massive surge analysts are predicting. A Strategic Shift from Cardano to PropiChain While Cardano price remains uncertain, investors are pivoting toward projects with clearer upside potential. PropiChain is proving to be one of the most promising blockchain investments available today. With its low presale price of $0.011, early investors have a rare chance to position themselves for exponential returns before the market fully catches on. For those searching for the next big investment opportunity, PropiChain could be the altcoin that delivers life-changing gains in 2025.

The data reveals that Chainlink ( LINK ) rival Pyth Network ( PYTH ) and AI-based projects Kaito ( KAITO ) and Bittensor ( TAO ) all saw significant increases in price after gaining support from Coinbase. KAITO – an “InfoAI” protocol that aims to solve the problem of fragmentation within the digital assets industry – was recently listed by both Coinbase and the top global crypto exchange by volume Binance en route to nearly doubling up its price. Kaito is trading for $1.92 at time of writing, a staggering 99.89% rise during the last 24 hours. Moving on to the decentralized machine-learning network Bittensor, an open-source platform that allows investors to create and swap AI learning models, the data finds that TAO also saw a significant increase in price but eventually stabilized. TAO skyrocketed from a low of $445 to a peak of $484, a rise of 8.7%, in just a few hours after gaining support from Coinbase. The digital asset has since retraced and is moving for $453 at time of writing. Moving on to PYTH, the data shows the oracle provider also saw an increase in price after being listed followed by a subsequent retrace. On February 20th, PYTH jumped from a price of $0.235 to $0.263, a 12% increase. It was since retraced and is trading for $0.243 at time of writing.

Amid the uncertainty of whether GBP/USD and USD/CAD could continue to post gains, investors and other market participants have recognized a new meme coin named Panshibi (SHIBI). They believe SHIBI’s market potential of minting over 45,000% profits this year makes the token unavoidably the best crypto to buy. What’s the new meme coin about? And could Nasdaq hit $100? Let’s break it down. GBP/USD Outlook GBP/USD currency pair has experienced highs and lows, rising to 1.2670 in the early hours of Friday. The GBP/USD pair gained strength against the U.S. dollar, though, as it lost ground following dismal jobless claims data and mixed signals from the Federal Reserve (Fed). The GBP/USD currency pair posted gains on the back of improved market conditions after President Trump made remarks about potential breakthroughs in trade negotiations with China. However, caution remains in the air for the GBP/USD currency pair among traders due to the UK. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey’s warnings. With these conflicting signals, the GBP/USD pair may see further volatility in the next few weeks as traders watch both U.S. and U.K. economic reports closely to determine the pair’s direction. USD/CAD Might Stall Its Recovery The USD/CAD pair tanked in the Thursday North American session to 1.42. The decline of the USD/CAD pair was largely due to weakness in the U.S. currency, reflected in the decline of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) to 106.70. Despite an announcement from US President Donald Trump that new auto, chip, and pharmaceutical tariffs could become effective within the next month, the USD could not recover. However, the USD/CAD pair did rebound somewhat after dropping earlier in the week. The USD/CAD pair seems to have received a fresh supply for now, but this might stall its recovery. Trading activity around the USD/CAD is expected to slow down within the next 48 hours as the Bank of Canada (BoC) may rethink cutting rates. Could Nasdaq Hit $100? Nasdaq (NDAQ) is a global financial technology, trading, and market infrastructure provider. With a market cap of $47.6 billion. With a pegged price per stock of $82.54, the Nasdaq stock price has already risen above 5% this year. Market activity from TradingView suggests that Nasdaq is building upside momentum, and analysts are now more bullish on the stock than they were two months ago. Based on this growth potential, the possibility of Nasdaq hitting $100 per share might not be too far away. Panshibi: The Best Crypto to Buy Today Panshibi is undoubtedly one of the best crypto to buy on the market today. This meme coin has a Panda as its mascot, which was inspired by Asian culture. The community of this appealing project spans from memecoin enthusiasts, Panda lovers from every corner of the world, and, of course, Asians. The Panshibi community might be rapidly growing, but the Bamboo Valley could still accommodate even more. One aspect of Panshibi’s philosophy that investors cannot ignore is its fight against the corrupt financial higher-ups who have exploited hundreds of thousands of market participants. Panshibi keeps them safe in Bamboo Valley and gives them the power to revolt against corruption. Talk about Panshibi’s plan for Pandas. Many in the crypto community have embraced Panshibi’s interests, so it’s no surprise that the number of people in Bamboo Valley keeps increasing every day. Once the project is listed on the biggest exchanges, industry experts predict gains of up to 45,000%. SHIBI could possibly be the best crypto to buy today, selling at only $0.005 per token.

The stock is nearing a 14% weekly decline after dropping as much as 17%. On February 12, the trading platform reported exceptional fourth-quarter earnings, with revenue more than doubling. This contributed to a remarkable 162% surge in its stock price from November 5, following Trump’s election, through the end of last week. However, Citigroup Inc. and Wolfe Research LLC analysts noted that much of the company’s earnings growth potential was already reflected in the stock’s valuation. As a result, Wolfe’s Steven Chubak downgraded the stock from a buy rating to a hold-equivalent. “We had recommended to our clients that they take some chips off the table at a $60 to $70 share price,” Chubak said. The downgrade is a wake-up call to investors to be “more forensic” over the company’s potential. Crypto-fuelled growth after Trump’s elections spurred Robinhood stock Robinhood experienced serious growth, more than 700% in crypto revenue during the fourth quarter. During the same period, Bitcoin traded above $100,000 as people speculated that Trump would support digital assets. In an email, Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev explained that the pullback stemmed from concerns that the “animal spirits” driving the company’s strong fourth-quarter performance may not persist. However, he remains optimistic about the stock, citing ongoing tailwinds from digital assets and a growing user base on the trading platform. Dolev isn’t the only one with a bullish outlook. Nearly three-quarters of analysts tracked by Bloomberg rate the stock as a buy, with an average 12-month price target of $70.76—slightly above its 2021 record high. Still, Chubak cautioned that a rebound is not assured, pointing to industry data that indicates a decline in crypto activity so far this quarter. Chubak said he would not be surprised if the stock continued declining in a weaker crypto activity environment. Robinhood plans to expand to Singapore According to a Bloomberg report, Robinhood plans to introduce cryptocurrency trading products in Singapore through its Bitstamp subsidiary. While the online brokerage has not yet announced a launch date, it aims to begin rolling out services by late 2025. The report cited an interview with Johann Kerbrat, Robinhood Crypto’s vice president and general manager, highlighting Bitstamp’s existing licenses in Singapore as a key factor in the acquisition. “Part of the reason why Bitstamp was attractive was because of their licenses with Singapore and its institutional business,” Kerbrat reportedly told Bloomberg. Robinhood agreed to acquire Bitstamp in June last year for $200 million, a move intended to expand its reach among institutional crypto investors in the US and internationally. Bloomberg also noted that Bitstamp received in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore last year. The acquisition is expected to close this year, pending regulatory approval.

The exchange confirmed that law enforcement is involved, and forensic teams are working to demix hacker addresses to limit how the funds can be sold. Bybit announced the development on X, saying : “We have reported the case to the appropriate authorities and we will send an update as soon as we have any further information. We have fortunately worked quickly and extensively with on-chain analytics providers to identify and demix the implicated addresses. These actions will mitigate and counter the ability of bad actors in disposing and dumping the ETH on the markets via legitimate marketplace narrowing the available outlets of disposal.” CEO responds as Bybit fights to control the fallout Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, responded within 30 minutes of the first reports of the hack. He confirmed that the 401,000 ETH had been drained from Bybit’s cold wallet but assured users that the exchange remained fully operational. Zhou followed up with a livestream on X and YouTube, where he answered questions in real time. “We are handling withdrawals as usual,” he told users. “Retail withdrawals are being prioritized, and we are processing thousands of requests per hour.” Bybit’s transparency helped keep panic under control, with Zhou assuring traders that Bybit’s reserves were 1:1 backed and that no funds were frozen. The hack targeted Bybit’s Gnosis Safe multisig wallets, which Zhou admitted was the point of failure. Bybit has since revoked compromised access, but the damage was already done. The hacker, later linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group, executed the attack through exploited multisig processes. Bybit confirmed that 4,000 withdrawals were pending immediately after the breach, but Zhou said the exchange secured a bridge loan to maintain smooth operations. “We are processing every withdrawal request as fast as possible,” he said. “The attack was significant, but it does not impact Bybit’s financial health.” Bybit didn’t just report the hack—it took the fight straight to the hackers. Zhou made it clear that selling the stolen ETH would be extremely difficult, as Bybit had already flagged and blacklisted the wallets involved. On-chain analyst ZachXBT was the first to link the Bybit exploit to Lazarus Group, the North Korean hacking unit known for previous high-profile attacks. ZachXBT confirmed that Bybit’s case matched patterns seen in past Phemex and Atomic Wallet hacks. Bybit also turned to its partners, exchanges, and market makers like Binance and Bitget to prevent the stolen ETH from moving, so they’ve now blacklisted the wallets. Unlike when FTX needed help during its 2022 collapse, where crypto exchange distanced themselves, Bybit’s industry connections rallied around the exchange. Bybit took a direct approach with Lazarus , knowing they were likely watching the livestream, and Zhou repeatedly told them that moving the funds would be impossible and urged them to negotiate. Bybit then told its users that: “We want to assure our users and partners that all other Bybit cold wallets remain fully secure. All client funds are safe, and our operations continue as usual without any disruption. Transparency and security remain our top priorities, and we will provide updates asap.” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",News|Bybit,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ETH|MARKET|ASIA|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-21 23:12:10

Senate Committee to Debate Crypto Rules, Bitcoin Reserve Proposal According to the announcement , Tim Scott, the Republican senator from South Carolina who is now leading the committee, has expressed strong support for the crypto sector, raising hopes for more constructive discussions this time. Industry representatives, including legal experts from Kraken and Lightspark, are expected to provide insights on what regulatory frameworks could foster innovation and economic growth in the space. The session will be held in a hybrid format and will feature testimony from key industry figures, including Lewis Cohen, partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP; Jonathan Jachym, Deputy General Counsel and Global Head of Policy & Government Relations at Kraken; and Jai Massari, Chief Legal Officer at Lightspark. Additional witnesses may be added to the panel ahead of the hearing. Discussions are expected to cover critical topics such as market structure, stablecoin regulations, and the potential creation of a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Lawmakers are attempting to balance oversight and fostering innovation, positioning the U.S. as a leader in digital finance while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. This hearing comes at an important moment for the crypto industry, which has been grappling with increased regulatory scrutiny and calls for clearer compliance measures. The outcome could shape the direction of U.S. digital asset policy and influence its global standing in the crypto economy. The hearing will be webcast live, but access will only be available once proceedings begin.

U.S. Senate Banking Committee to Form Crypto Subcommittee According to FOX Business and Punchbowl News reports, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee is set to establish its first-ever crypto subcommittee , which Senator Cynthia Lummis is expected to lead. This comes a month after President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January. NEW: The Senate Banking Committee, led by @SenatorTimScott , is set to establish its first ever subcommittee dedicated to #crypto .

This is similar to the House Financial Services Committee, which launched its own crypto subcommittee in 2023. Lummis, a vocal crypto advocate, recently backed Trump’s push for a strategic Bitcoin reserve . She also filed an amicus brief supporting Coinbase’s appeal against the SEC, arguing the regulator has overstepped its authority in crypto enforcement. She stated that decades-old securities laws don’t always apply to modern digital assets and called for a clear legislative framework. “With lawsuits relying on the SEC’s overreach, it is vital that the Second Circuit halts this encroachment on Congress’s lawmaking powers,” the brief stated . Trump has pledged to curb regulatory overreach and position the U.S. as a crypto hub. The Senate Banking Committee oversees financial agencies like the SEC, making this subcommittee a key step in shaping future crypto policy. Looking forward, this hearing could be the starting point for clearer crypto regulation in the U.S. and might lead to similar regulatory clarity provided by MiCA. The meeting includes many key leaders in the space, and by bringing their opinions together, the outcome could mark the beginning of the U.S.’s goal of being the crypto hub of the world.

With Qubetics presale soaring past $13.5 million, Litecoin witnessing a massive trading volume surge, and Terra Classic attempting a comeback, traders are on high alert. But with so many choices, which project stands out as the top contender? Qubetics is stealing the spotlight with its game-changing decentralized VPN, designed to enhance privacy and security across blockchain networks. Meanwhile, Litecoin is drawing attention with its $580 million in daily trading volume, proving that investors still see value in this long-standing altcoin. On the other hand, Terra Classic continues to battle for market relevance, trying to recover from its previous crashes. But with Qubetics offering a staggering ROI potential of up to 12,286.96%, could it be the ultimate pick for crypto investors in 2025? Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN is Changing the Game As Web3 adoption accelerates, privacy and security have become top concerns for businesses and individuals. Qubetics is addressing these issues head-on with its Decentralized VPN (dVPN), a groundbreaking blockchain-based solution that eliminates centralized control and censorship. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on a single provider, Qubetics’ dVPN leverages a decentralized network, allowing users to browse anonymously, secure their data, and bypass restrictions without relying on third parties. For businesses, this means enhanced protection for sensitive transactions, preventing unauthorized tracking and data leaks. Imagine an international company managing cross-border payments—Qubetics’ dVPN ensures end-to-end encryption, shielding financial data from malicious actors. Meanwhile, individuals can use the dVPN to safeguard their browsing activity from intrusive government surveillance and advertisers. What makes Qubetics even more appealing is its multi-chain compatibility, ensuring seamless integration with various blockchain ecosystems. Whether you’re a trader looking for extra security or a developer seeking privacy-focused infrastructure, Qubetics is proving why it’s among the best cryptos to buy today. Qubetics Presale Surge and Investor FOMO With each Qubetics presale stage lasting just seven days and a 10% price hike every Sunday at 12 AM, investors are rushing to secure TICS tokens before the next increase. The project’s massive $13.5 million presale tally proves that interest is skyrocketing, with over 20,800 token holders already onboard. Analysts have made bold predictions, with TICS expected to reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a 209.67% ROI. If the token hits $1 post-presale, early buyers could see a 1138.69% return, while a $5 valuation would bring in an eye-watering 6093.48% gain. But the real speculation is around the $10 and $15 price targets, which could translate into 12,286.96% and 18,480.45% ROIs, respectively. To put this into perspective, a $1,000 investment at today’s price of $0.08073 could be worth over $122,869 if TICS reaches $10. As FOMO builds and the Qubetics presale stage 22 nears its end, investors are scrambling to lock in their tokens before the next price jump. Litecoin’s Trading Volume Skyrockets to $580 Million While Qubetics is dominating the presale space, Litecoin is making waves in the trading markets, recently hitting $580 million in daily trading volume. Despite newer altcoins entering the scene, Litecoin remains a staple for traders who value its fast transactions and low fees. This surge in trading activity signals renewed interest in the coin, especially as Bitcoin’s halving event approaches, historically benefiting Litecoin due to its similar proof-of-work model. Investors are speculating that Litecoin’s next big breakout could be around the corner, fueled by increased adoption and institutional attention. With crypto whales accumulating large amounts of LTC, traders are keeping a close eye on whether this trading volume surge is an early signal of a major price rally. While Litecoin doesn’t offer the astronomical ROI potential of Qubetics, its established market presence and steady growth make it a strong choice for risk-averse investors. Terra Classic’s Fight for Market Relevance Terra Classic remains one of the most debated cryptocurrencies, with investors divided on whether it has long-term potential or if it’s just a fading memory of its past collapse. The project is making attempts to regain trust, with ongoing community-driven efforts to restore value to its ecosystem. Despite these efforts, skepticism remains high, especially after the LUNA crash left many investors burned. Unlike Qubetics and Litecoin, which are showing clear signs of adoption and utility, Terra Classic is still struggling to prove itself as a viable investment for the future. However, speculative traders continue to bet on its potential price rebounds, believing that a community-led revival could breathe new life into the project. But with the crypto space evolving rapidly, the real question is whether Terra Classic can keep up with competitors like Qubetics, which is building real-world solutions for Web3 adoption. Conclusion: Is Qubetics the Best Crypto to Buy Today? Qubetics is making an undeniable case as one of the best cryptos to buy today, thanks to its Decentralized VPN technology, strong presale momentum, and jaw-dropping ROI potential. With $13.5 million raised and price hikes happening every week, investors are racing to get in before the next surge. Litecoin is also holding its ground, with a $580 million trading volume boost signaling strong investor interest. Meanwhile, Terra Classic remains a wildcard, with speculation driving its price movements rather than fundamental growth. For those looking for the top crypto presale with real-world utility, massive upside potential, and a growing investor base, Qubetics presale is where the real action is happening. With analysts predicting 5x to 100x gains, now might be the time to join the Qubetics presale before the price jumps again.

40661768,https://coingape.com/?p=240326,1740179847,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Lazarus Group Responsible For Bybit’s $1.4 Billion Ethereum Hack: Report,https://coingape.com/lazarus-group-responsible-for-bybits-1-4-billion-ethereum-hack/,"The Lazarus Group, a hacking organization linked to North Korea, has been identified as behind the recent $1.4 billion Ethereum theft from cryptocurrency exchange Bybit. This revelation was made after blockchain investigator ZachXBT provided strong evidence linking the attack to them. Lazarus Group Implicated in the Bybit Hack It is worth mentioning that ZachXBT’s investigation found a series of test transactions and connected wallets that led directly to the Lazarus Group. The research as shared on X included detailed graphs and time-based analysis, which have been shared with Bybit to help their ongoing investigation. Meanwhile, Arkham Intelligence, a blockchain data platform, had offered a reward of 50,000 ARKM tokens for information that could identify the hackers. After reviewing ZachXBT’s findings, Arkham confirmed the link to the Lazarus Group. They stated that his report included a full breakdown of test transactions, connected wallets, and forensic graphs showing how the attack happened. The Bybit Exploit: How Bad is it? Notably, the Bybit hack occurred on Friday, with about 401,346 ETH (worth $1.4 billion) stolen from Bybit’s cold wallet. While cold wallets are supposed to be safe since they are not connected to the internet, the hackers still managed to get in. It shows how desperate the hackers are and how fragile the cryptocurrency market is. This also raises a question of how genuinely decentralized or safe the crypto market is. On the flip side, reports also show that the stolen funds were transferred to different wallets, and at least $200 million worth of staked Ether (stETH) has already been sold on decentralized exchanges. In response to the event that has brought mixed feelings among the Bybit community and the cryptocurrency community at large, CEO Ben Zhou took to his page on X and reassured users that the exchange is financially stable and will still function well irrespective of the severity of the attack. Again, he confirmed that all client assets are fully backed and that the exchange remains solvent despite the large loss. Unfortunately, this attack has also affected the broader digital asset market. Ethereum’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) dropped sharply from 62.8 to 51.6 within hours. This shows a decrease in buying activity as the Lazarus Group carted away with the stolen ETH. While the RSI is still above the neutral 50 mark, this drop suggests investors are becoming more cautious. The Altcoin also decreased by 4% moments after the hack. The attack has also affected Bitcoin and other altcoins, with the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization reeling in loss. Lazarus Group and its Trend in Crypto In other news, the Lazarus Group has been responsible for some of the biggest hacks in crypto. There is speculation that the North Korean government is supporting the group. Put differently, they are a state tool that is used for stealing funds to bypass economic sanctions. In March 2022, they stole about $625 million from the Ronin Network, which is connected to the Axie Infinity game. A few months later, in June 2022, it was confirmed by the US. FBI that they had taken $100 million from Harmony’s Horizon bridge. More recently, in 2024, they stole over $300 million from Japan’s DMM Bitcoin exchange. Sadly, these attacks show that the Lazarus Group keeps changing its methods to exploit security gaps in cryptocurrency systems. The Bybit hack is another warning that stronger security measures are needed to protect digital assets. In January, the United States, Japan, and South Korea issued a joint statement to address threats from North Korean hackers. The joint statement noted that despite the threats, they are working to disrupt their potency.

Wrong trades, wild flips, and token launches — he’s turning madness into millions. Here’s how. Table of Contents The wrong LIBRA gamble Portnoy’s meme coin frenzy hits overdrive SEC heat or just noise? Hype over fundamentals, chaos over caution The wrong LIBRA gamble Dave Portnoy has never been one to shy away from the spotlight. From turning Barstool Sports into a media empire to his viral pizza reviews and high-stakes gambling, he has built a brand around being loud, unpredictable, and unapologetically himself. Lately, though, his name has been making the rounds for a different reason — crypto. And not just any crypto, but meme coins , accidental trades, and a deal he ultimately walked away from. One of the biggest stories revolves around Libra ( LIBRA ), a token that gained traction after Argentina’s President Javier Milei seemingly endorsed it. However, Portnoy’s involvement began with a different kind of LIBRA deal. Portnoy revealed that he had been paid roughly 6 million LIBRA tokens to promote the project, but after its founder, Hayden Davis , allegedly asked him to keep quiet about the arrangement, Portnoy decided to return the money. Then, in one of his most bizarre investment blunders, he mistakenly bought nearly $170,000 worth of the wrong LIBRA token — one with a completely different contract address than the high-profile version making headlines. Realizing his mistake, Portnoy took to X with his trademark mix of self-deprecation, writing, “Anybody wanna buy some fake Libra? Warning: This is a meme coin. I bought it by accident… It will be volatile. It will eventually go to zero.” Anybody wanna buy some fake Libra? Warning. This is a meme coin. I bought it by accident. It will be volatile. It will eventually go to zero. It may rip. It may tank. Don’t put on more than you can lose!!!

Milei himself is now facing accusations of financial misconduct, with some political opponents even calling for his impeachment. But that hasn’t slowed Portnoy down. If anything, it seems to have only fueled his full-throttle dive into meme coins. Let’s break down the swirling speculations and how the crypto community is reacting to the chaos. You might also like: LIBRA’s collapse becomes Solana’s biggest scandal since FTX: How Jupiter and Meteora left retail rekt Portnoy’s meme coin frenzy hits overdrive Just days after mistakenly buying the wrong Libra token and returning 6 million worth of the original LIBRA tokens, Portnoy decided to take matters into his own hands — launching his own tokens, flipping them within hours, and riding the wild volatility that defines the space. On Feb. 18, Portnoy introduced a new token called GREED through Pump.fun , a Solana ( SOL )-based platform designed to simplify meme coin creation. The branding was as on-the-nose as it gets, featuring an image of Michael Douglas’s Gordon Gekko from Wall Street, the character infamous for the line, “Greed is good.” pic.twitter.com/Iau8Xx0v9N — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 18, 2025 And for a brief moment, it was. The token skyrocketed, reaching a peak market cap of $41.5 million in just a few hours. As the excitement built, Portnoy embraced the moment, posting on X: “I kept hearing how meme coins were dead? I’m able to turn 2k into just about a million in 15 minutes if I felt like it. Doesn’t seem dead to me.” I kept hearing how meme coins were dead? I’m able to turn 2k into just about a million in 15 minutes if I felt like it. Doesn’t seem dead to me. Seems like as long as $greed exists and meme coins are legal there will be a big market for this shit. pic.twitter.com/VFo8AWNyei — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 18, 2025 But within a day, he moved all his GREED tokens into another project he had previously endorsed — JAILSTOOL — publicly declaring , “Just put all of #Greed into #jailstool which I’m never selling ‘cause I said I wouldn’t sell.” Then, on-chain data revealed that Portnoy had swapped every single GREED token he owned for JAILSTOOL tokens in a single transaction, worth an estimated $250,000 at the time, instantly crashing the price of GREED by 99%. His decision to cash out sparked backlash, with many accusing him of a “rug pull” — a term used when developers or influencers drain liquidity from a project, leaving late investors holding worthless tokens. 👀 Another wild and bloody scam story Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy ( @stoolpresidente ) just rugged his own audience. After losing $200K on fake LIBRA, he launched the GREED memecoin. It pumped to a $37M market cap, only for him to dump 35% of the supply, cashing out… pic.twitter.com/mQI9b59Du1 — Memento (@Memento_ai) February 19, 2025 Portnoy quickly defended himself, posting: “I have literally only said I will not sell 1 coin. That coin is #jailstool until it hits the 1 billion market cap.” He continued, claiming that he could have made over a million dollars from the sale but instead let GREED drop by 75% before exiting. Some facts not on this tweet. I warned people I could sell. I could have cashed out +1 million. I let it drop 75% before cashing out. Lots of people made money. I took the profits + poured it into #jailstool which I can’t touch. I didn’t make a dime on it. Some people won.… https://t.co/ARkeBKOVjX — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 19, 2025 “Lots of people made money. I took the profits + poured it into #jailstool, which I can’t touch. I didn’t make a dime on it. Some people won, some lost. Only the losers keep bitching.” Then, rather than retreating, Portnoy leaned into the controversy, boasting that he could create another token just as easily, and it would still “moon,” because, as he put it, “Nobody has principles. Just greed.” You can’t beat me. Not in this meme coin market. I could launch Greed 2 collectible coin right now and it would moon. Nobody has principles. Just greed. https://t.co/rmPxbMjQhM — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 18, 2025 Hours later, he followed through, launching GREED2 and warning investors not to put in more than they could afford to lose. *update. Just launched Greed 2. Don’t invest in this collectible coin with more than you can afford to lose. It’ll be volatile. I will not sell 1 penny till at least midnight est or maybe never. Be careful. GoL6RVGQFzTD7MdoNEHUQmNp6SgXBn6f9khxAW5Bpump https://t.co/kFuUCIgvYf — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 19, 2025 Unlike its predecessor, GREED2 struggled to gain traction. It briefly climbed to a $7 million market cap before plummeting 90% over the next five hours. On Feb. 20, he was back on X again, sharing screenshots of his Phantom Wallet balances, revealing staggering gains — 1,923% on GREED, 344% on GREED2, and various smaller profits across other meme coins. Critics condemned Portnoy’s actions as reckless, pointing to the damage they cause to retail investors who jump in late. As for Portnoy, he doesn’t seem concerned. If anything, he appears to be fully embracing the chaos. SEC heat or just noise? As Portnoy’s meme coin antics escalate, social media has become a hotbed for speculation, accusations, and unverified rumours. One of the biggest claims making the rounds is that Portnoy may be facing legal trouble. “Rumors emerging that court documents reveal Dave Portnoy is facing multiple SEC securities violations charges,” posted one user. 🚨BREAKING: Rumors emerging that court documents reveal Dave Portnoy is facing multiple SEC securities violations charges. Authorities allege serious financial misconduct, with further details expected as the case unfolds. pic.twitter.com/MOo6RMqRVs — jdub 🇮🇱 (@jdubz069) February 20, 2025 However, no actual filings or statements from regulators have emerged to confirm this. Adding to the speculation, the SEC recently unveiled the creation of a cybercrime unit aimed at tackling fraud in the crypto industry. The timing of this move has led some to suggest a direct link between Portnoy’s recent token flips and the regulatory shift. “Portnoy rugs five tokens live on a stream, two days later the SEC launches a cybercrime unit,” wrote one user. dave portnoy rugs five tokens live on a stream two days later the sec launches a cyber crime unit to target fraud in crypto enjoy crime season, retards — Zack Voell (@zackvoell) February 20, 2025 Another post adopted a more sarcastic tone: “Portnoy scammed so hard the SEC had to launch a new cyber division.” 🚨NEW: Dave Portnoy scammed so hard the SEC has to launch a new Cyber technology division💀 pic.twitter.com/gMMbJRT42f — Autism Capital 🧩 (@AutismCapital) February 20, 2025 Rather than addressing the allegations head-on, Portnoy opted to mock the situation, flipping the SEC’s announcement to jab at his critics. “Love it! So many scammers and liars out there. Let’s clean this space up! Take out the trash,” he posted, before taking a swipe at those calling him a fraud. “Can we arrest the crybabies who are told meme coins are a risk and then cry foul too?” Love it! So manny scammers and liars out there. Let’s clean this space up! Take out the trash. Together we can win. This is when it pays to be the cleanest man in crypto Ps – can we arrest the crybabies who are told not to risk more than they can lose and that Memecoins… https://t.co/JD7Nk6YfPo — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 20, 2025 So far, it’s all just noise—no official actions or formal accusations. But the growing uproar reveals how deeply his actions have divided the crypto community. Still, Portnoy isn’t backing down. If anything, he’s doubling down. Who am I to deny the will of the people. The heartbeat of trenches is Greed https://t.co/QaqknWr9vt — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) February 20, 2025 Hype over fundamentals, chaos over caution Portnoy’s foray into the meme coin market is quickly shaping up to be a masterclass in how hype, rather than fundamentals, can drive value in crypto. While most traders focus on returns, Portnoy seems more intrigued by the mechanics of attention. He leverages his massive following to trigger market movements, all while watching the real-time ripple effect unfold. “He’s discovered an infinite money glitch — he tweets a ticker to his 3.5M followers, and it instantly moons, then he does it again,” said Punk, the pseudonymous CCO at Memecoin ( MEME ), capturing how Portnoy’s reach alone is enough to spark immediate volatility. But it’s not just about the money. “He’s amused by the hamster wheel of traders blindly following his moves, so he keeps spinning it.” Portnoy creates a token, watches it surge, then either exits or moves on to the next. Traders know the risk but dive in anyway — not because they believe in the token, but because the activity itself is the draw. This phenomenon is far from isolated. Platforms like Pump.fun have made meme coin creation almost effortless. Since launching in January 2024, over 7.8 million tokens have been created on the platform as of Feb. 21, most offering little beyond speculative thrills. As a result, the market has become a revolving door of viral trends, where the next big token isn’t determined by innovation, but by how quickly it can spread. “Honestly, trust in crypto isn’t exactly at an all-time high,” said Tobin Kuo, CEO of Seraph Studios, in an interview with crypto.news. “At this point, even veterans are joking that the space is turning into the world’s largest casino.” That could explain why Portnoy has gone beyond just trading — he’s creating. As Punk puts it, “Every legal expert warning him only pushes him to do more. The backlash fuels his next move.” Whether this model can last or eventually collapse under its own weight remains to be seen, but as long as the hype keeps driving the market, the cycle isn’t stopping.",Feature|Influencers|Meme Coin|rug pull|SEC|United States,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|SOL,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-02-21 23:50:00

Notably, the pro-crypto stance of the Mark Uyeda-led SEC has ignited a possibility of XRP benefitting uniquely. Per the current trend, investors wonder if the coin could hit a $300 price target in the long term if the US SEC drops the XRP lawsuit. Is Ripple versus US SEC Lawsuit Suppressing XRP Price? In a recent update, Coinbase revealed that the SEC staff has agreed to drop its lawsuit , pending potential approval by the agency’s commissioners in the coming week. By a large margin, the Coinbase versus SEC lawsuit is considered the second biggest after Ripple Labs. Though similar, the Ripple lawsuit has advanced much more, with the end close as predicted. Gary Gensler fanned the lawsuit, alleging that XRP is a security when sold to the public, significantly impacting the price. Like Coinbase, there is speculation that the US SEC will dismiss its Ripple lawsuit appeal. If this happens, the price of XRP is expected to rise dramatically. Is XRP Price to $300 Feasible? In recent times, analysts have issued massive projections regarding the XRP price. As reported earlier by CoinGape, market analyst XRP Captain predicted that the XRP price could rally to $250 between now and 2026. While analysts justify this projection based on the current trend within the Ripple ecosystem, the economics presents a different picture. With XRP having more than 57.89 billion circulating supply per CoinMarketCap data , a $300 target will give it a valuation of $17.367 trillion for the coin. This fund is way bigger than the crypto industry, which is only worth $3.17 trillion, with Bitcoin dominating. However, this does not discount the likelihood of a massive rally if the lawsuit ends. The XRP ETF Advantage Meanwhile, the Ripple ecosystem has continued to expand at a unique pace. More than four asset managers are seeking approval to offer XRP ETF products to institutional investors. Canary Capital, Bitwise, and CoinShares are some of the firms pushing for this new product. With a 65% odds of approval , the community is somewhat pricing in this product already. With the likelihood of a new capital influx, the expectation is that the XRP price will benefit immensely in the long term.

Dogecoin Whales Liquidate 100 Million Coins,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/panic-or-opportunity-dogecoin-whales-liquidate-100-million-coins/,"The crypto market is paying attention to a massive Dogecoin (DOGE) transaction. A whale transferred 100 million DOGE, or about $25.42 million, to Binance. The move has raised questions about whether a sell-off is about to happen or if this is just another typical shift in holdings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Ready For ‘Take Off’—Analyst Reveals Key Signals Whale Activity Sparks Concerns When a major cryptocurrency holder moves a sizable amount of their holdings to an exchange, it usually means they want to sell. The price of DOGE may drop as a result, which would cause smaller investors to react. However, cryptocurrency expert Ali Martinez noted a decline in whale activity overall, suggesting that major investors are not acting aggressively for the time being. Whale activity on the #Dogecoin $DOGE network has declined by nearly 88% since mid-November! pic.twitter.com/6X4CIH3mf8 — Ali (@ali_charts) February 17, 2025 DOGE’s present market performance points to vagueness. As of the time of writing, the price is $0.255622; an intraday high is $0.257605 and a low is $0.250725. These swings imply a rather limited trading range; but, if more significant holders decide to sell their shares, volatility might increase. Market Sentiment Remains Divided According to certain traders, the whale transfer is a bearish signal, while others believe that its influence may be negligible unless an influx of additional coins occurs. Dogecoin has a history of reacting sharply to whale movements; however, the aggregate selling pressure appears to be subdued this time. The ongoing discussion regarding a potential DOGE exchange-traded fund (ETF) is another significant factor that affects sentiment. If an ETF acquires momentum, it may attract institutional investors, potentially counteracting any selling pressure from whales. Nevertheless, the market is currently in a state of supposition, as no official approvals or timelines have been announced. The Road Ahead For Dogecoin Despite the whale move, the price of DOGE continues to remain steady, but if market sentiment shifts, there could be a further drop. Further dumping may occur if the price of DOGE drops below $0.25, which might further lower the price. On the other hand, strong purchasing activity may act as a barrier to further decrease.

With meme coins showing signs of another pullback, experienced investors are looking for a more resilient alternative that can weather crashes and still deliver massive returns. That’s why many are shifting to this AI altcoin that doesn’t rely on hype alone but offers real utility, strong fundamentals, and cutting-edge technology that ensures long-term demand. This makes it the perfect hedge against market uncertainty. Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Face Growing Uncertainty Shiba Inu and Dogecoin have dominated the meme coin market, but their explosive growth may be fading. Over the past few months, SHIB has struggled to break out of its downward trend, slipping from highs of $0.000033 to nearly half that value. Key support levels have failed, raising concerns about further downside risks. Dogecoin isn’t faring much better. While Elon Musk’s influence has occasionally pumped its price, long-term investors see a pattern; sharp rallies followed by deep corrections. Even with Dogecoin’s potential integration into X, the lack of fundamental utility makes it a highly speculative asset. On-chain data reveals that major SHIB and DOGE holders are shifting capital into new projects with stronger fundamentals, and RCO Finance (RCOF) has emerged as a top choice. Why RCO Finance Is Gaining Momentum RCO Finance is a fully operational AI-powered trading platform that helps users make smarter investment decisions. At the heart of RCOF is its Robo Advisor, an advanced AI system that scans global financial markets, analyzes real-time data from sources like Bloomberg and Reuters, and provides actionable insights for traders. This AI tool can detect emerging trends before they go mainstream, allowing investors to capitalize on early-stage opportunities. Take recent examples like TRUMP and MELANIA tokens. These low-cap coins surged 100x in just days, but most traders missed out. RCOF’s AI is designed to spot these breakouts before they happen, giving users a major advantage. Beyond maximizing gains, the AI also protects investors from market downturns. It can identify weakening trends, recommend exit points, and even adjust portfolio allocations to optimize risk exposure. This strategic approach removes emotional decision-making and ensures smarter, data-driven trading. But RCOF goes beyond crypto investing. The platform offers access to 120,000+ investment options, including stocks, ETFs, bonds, and even tokenized real estate, all within a non-KYC environment. Investors can diversify seamlessly without lengthy verification processes, while RCOF’s crypto debit card allows instant spending without manual conversions. Early Investors Are Rushing Into RCOF’s Presale Shiba Inu and Dogecoin investors are moving into RCOF not just for its AI advantages but also for its lucrative presale opportunity. Unlike most early crypto projects, RCOF already has a live Beta Platform with 10,000+ active users testing its AI-driven tools. The Robo Advisor’s monitoring capabilities will continue improving, enhancing its predictive accuracy over time. This means early adopters are getting in before the AI reaches full optimization, setting them up for long-term gains. Currently, RCOF is in Presale Stage 5 , selling at $0.10 per token. The next stage will push the price up to $0.13, giving today’s buyers an instant 30% profit before the token even lists on major exchanges. A $1,000 investment today would become $1,300 in just weeks once the next presale stage begins. After exchange listings, analysts predict 10,000x growth, meaning an early $500 investment could potentially turn into $500,000. Additionally, RCOF has passed a security audit by SolidProof , confirming its smart contracts are safe and free from vulnerabilities. Unlike meme coins that fluctuate based on trends, RCOF is a fundamentally sound investment backed by real demand. Meme Coins Had Their Run; RCOF Is the Next Big Opportunity Shiba Inu and Dogecoin still have loyal communities, but their long-term upside is limited. Even if Dogecoin somehow climbs to $1, that’s only a 5x return; far below what RCOF is expected to achieve. Meanwhile, RCOF is just getting started, meaning the potential for rapid growth and mainstream adoption is far higher. With AI-driven trading tools, a working Beta platform, strong investor demand, and built-in real-world utility, RCO Finance is positioned for explosive gains in 2025. The opportunity won’t last forever. Investors who got in during earlier RCOF stages have already secured major profits, and with the presale moving quickly, prices will only go up from here. Waiting too long could mean missing out on one of the most profitable crypto launches of the year.

This achievement, coupled with a current price of $0.0248 per coin in Batch 27 and a 2380% surge, positions BlockDAG as a project to watch. But beyond the impressive numbers, BlockDAG’s commitment to education, exemplified by the appointment of Marcus Xavier as Head of Learning, suggests a long-term vision for the project. This article will explore the significance of structured blockchain education, particularly in the context of BlockDAG’s rapid growth and the broader adoption of decentralized technologies. The importance of understanding BDAG, DAG, and KAS within this evolving landscape will also be examined. BlockDAG’s Educational Initiative: Building a Foundation for the Future The addition of Marcus Xavier , with his extensive background in education and emerging technologies, signals BlockDAG’s dedication to fostering a knowledgeable community. As Head of Learning, Xavier will develop the BlockDAG Academy, a learning hub designed to provide structured blockchain education. This initiative is particularly relevant given BlockDAG’s presale success, which has seen over 18.6 billion coins sold and a nearly $200 million raise. The academy aims to equip users, developers, and businesses with the practical skills needed to engage with the BlockDAG ecosystem. This focus on education is a crucial component of BlockDAG’s strategy, demonstrating a commitment to more than just short-term gains. The BlockDAG team understands that widespread adoption depends on accessible and comprehensive educational resources. A Career Dedicated to Learning and Emerging Tech Xavier’s career path reflects a deep interest in the intersection of education and technology. His experience spans B2B e-commerce, tech startups, and higher education. Having witnessed the early stages of the internet boom, Xavier developed an understanding of both the potential and the limitations of centralized systems. This led him to explore the possibilities of decentralized technologies and their ability to address existing gaps.

Amidst these, TRUMP Coin experiences volatile price movements due to major exchange listings, and Chainlink (LINK) looks to rally, yet it’s Web3Bay’s approach to secure online shopping that may truly transform the e-commerce landscape. Leveraging smart contract escrow, Web3Bay not only promises but provides a safe, fraud-free environment, a stark contrast to the speculative nature of many digital assets. While the market dances to the tune of volatile meme coins and seasoned cryptos, Web3Bay introduces a grounded, practical blockchain application, ensuring secure and transparent e-commerce transactions—potentially redefining how we conduct online business. Innovative Escrow Systems Set Web3Bay Apart Online shopping often falls prey to scams, including prevalent issues like fake reviews and rampant chargebacks that compromise both buyer and seller confidence. Web3Bay directly addresses these vulnerabilities with its innovative smart contract escrow system, safeguarding transactions to ensure they are secure, transparent, and immune to disputes. By automating escrow, Web3Bay effectively shields against fraudulent listings and the common pitfall of chargeback fraud, bolstering security for all market participants. This system is particularly advantageous for small business owners who frequently face hefty losses from fraudulent disputes, and consumers who will benefit from interacting with verified, trustworthy sellers. The blockchain’s immutable nature also ensures that product reviews cannot be falsified, cultivating a reliable marketplace atmosphere. With these mechanisms, Web3Bay is not merely participating in e-commerce; it is setting new standards for it. As the platform progresses, Web3Bay’s presale success—having raised $1.5 million in stage 4 for $0.004562625, with over 370 billion tokens sold—underscores the market’s growing demand for secure, reliable online transactions. Web3Bay is quickly establishing itself as a frontrunner in combating e-commerce fraud. TRUMP Coin’s Market Fluctuations After Upbit Listing TRUMP Coin, associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump, saw its value spike over 20% following its introduction on South Korea’s largest exchange, Upbit. This listing expanded its availability, adding new trading pairs and sparking a surge in trading activity that pushed its valuation significantly. Although it has seen substantial fluctuations, falling from a high market cap back down to more modest levels, the recent exposure has reignited interest, with projections suggesting a potential rise to between $35 and $40 in the near term. This exemplifies the profound impact that major exchange listings can have on meme-based assets, especially in markets like South Korea where retail trading is fervent. TRUMP remains a token to watch, as speculation continues to drive its market dynamics. Chainlink’s Prospects: Aiming for $23 Chainlink (LINK) is presently priced at $18.59, firmly supported between $17 and $18. The TD Sequential indicator has recently given a buy signal close to these levels, pointing to a possible ascent to $21 and potentially extending to $23. This projection is bolstered by historical data indicating that $21 has served as a frequent consolidation area, while $23 has consistently posed a notable resistance level. Simultaneously, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 48.94, signaling a balanced market condition, and the Directional Movement Index (DMI) shows a tight contest between buyers and sellers. Furthermore, whales hold 67% of LINK’s circulating supply, with current statistics revealing that 57% of investors are seeing profits, whereas 40% are experiencing losses. Taking these elements into account, alongside trends in exchange outflows which suggest diminishing selling pressures, there’s a solid groundwork for anticipating a push towards the $23 threshold. Wrapping Up! As the crypto market continues to evolve with its typical unpredictability, the emphasis remains on security and utility for sustainable growth. TRUMP Coin’s dramatic swings underscore the impact of exchange dynamics, while Chainlink’s technical setup hints at possible gains. Amidst these, Web3Bay’s smart contract escrow emerges as a crucial development, addressing the core challenges of online shopping fraud. This approach not only mitigates common e-commerce risks but also provides a substantial foundation for trust and reliability in digital transactions. While many chase market highs and lows, Web3Bay is crafting a more secure future for online shopping, promising more than just speculative benefits.

While XRP has long been a dominant player in the crypto space, newer projects with real-world applications and cutting-edge innovations are starting to take center stage. PropiChain is one such project, gaining traction for its unique approach to real estate. With analysts predicting massive gains, early investors are seeing PropiChain as an opportunity too good to ignore. Why Crypto Traders Are Looking Beyond XRP XRP has been a key player in the crypto market for years, particularly in cross-border payments. Its fast transaction speeds and low fees have made it a favorite among financial institutions. However, despite its strengths, XRP has faced challenges, including regulatory battles and market competition. As the market evolves, crypto traders are looking for projects that not only provide fast transactions but also offer tangible real-world benefits. This is where PropiChain is making waves. Instead of focusing solely on financial transactions, PCHAIN is bridging the gap between blockchain and real-world asset ownership, particularly in real estate. Crypto traders recognize that the future of blockchain lies in practical use cases, and PropiChain’s unique approach is positioning it as a strong contender in the market. What Gives Propichain the Edge? One of the main reasons PropiChain is attracting attention is its ability to revolutionize real estate investment. Traditionally, buying property requires significant capital, complex legal processes, and time-consuming paperwork. PropiChain simplifies this by allowing investors to buy fractional shares of high-value properties. This means that instead of needing millions to invest in premium real estate, users can start with as little as a few hundred dollars. But PropiChain isn’t stopping at fractional ownership. Its AI-powered analytics help investors make smarter decisions by analyzing market trends and identifying high-potential real estate investments. It’s like having access to AI-driven insights that tell you when and where to invest for maximum returns. Additionally, the project integrates tokenization to ensure secure and transparent ownership of real-world assets. Each property listed on PropiChain is converted into a digital token on the blockchain, making it easy to buy, sell, or trade without the complexities of traditional real estate transactions. Beyond real estate, PropiChain is also venturing into the metaverse. With the growing popularity of digital assets, the platform allows investors to purchase virtual real estate and participate in the booming metaverse economy. This creates an entirely new way for investors to diversify their portfolios. To further enhance efficiency, PropiChain uses smart contracts to automate property transactions, rental agreements, and payments. Instead of relying on traditional legal and financial intermediaries, these contracts execute transactions securely and instantly, reducing costs and eliminating unnecessary delays. Additionally, PropiChain’s global accessibility ensures that investors from anywhere in the world can participate in real estate markets that were previously out of reach. With blockchain removing geographic barriers, users can invest in premium properties across different countries without having to go through the complexities of international property transactions. Security and Market Recognition Strengthen Confidence Security is always a major concern for crypto traders, which is why PropiChain has undergone a thorough security audit to ensure its smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure are secure. This level of transparency reassures investors that their assets are protected. Additionally, PropiChain has been listed on CoinMarketCap , a major milestone that boosts its visibility and credibility in the market. A CoinMarketCap listing signals legitimacy and increases exposure to a global audience of investors looking for the next high-growth crypto project. How Much Could Investors Earn with PropiChain? PropiChain is still in stage 2 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.011, giving early investors a rare chance to buy in at a low price before major price movements occur. A $1,000 investment at the current presale price could grow exponentially, offering life-changing returns up to $100,000 if PropiChain reaches its expected 100x.. Interestingly, PropiChain is still in its early stages, presenting a unique opportunity for those looking to invest before the mainstream market catches on. With a solid foundation, real-world applications, and growing interest from crypto traders, PropiChain has the potential to deliver significant returns. XRP has had its moment, but as the blockchain landscape continues to evolve, newer projects like PropiChain are proving that the future belongs to altcoins with real utility. For those looking to get ahead of the curve, keeping an eye on PropiChain could be the smartest move yet, as it could be the next life-changing investment. Don’t miss out.

Bons argues that BTC is no longer sustainable, especially after having lost its desirable qualities According to Bons, BTC has lost all its attractive qualities, so it won’t last very long. He argued that without capacity, scarcity, privacy, DeFi, or long-term security, the asset has “no legs to stand on.” He even stated that Bitcoin’s other impressive qualities, such as censorship resistance, immutability, financial sovereignty, and decentralization, are long gone and only pioneered by other emerging assets, saying the top asset lost its key principles to corruption. He further commented: BTC was effectively captured by a relatively small group of people who managed to entirely pivot the purpose, vision, and fundamental design of BTC. This did not happen without a fight. That history is now known as the block size debates, cumulating in 2017 when “Bitcoin Core” “won” and Bitcoin lost. Justin Bons He believes a group of people is still controlling BTC, and unfortunately, traders are still in the dark about the token’s reality. He even compared the current BTC governance to more of a Github dictatorship, saying the Core deterred any future expansion to BTC’s capacity, as opposed to Satoshi’s wants. Furthermore, he argued that Bitcoin currently sees only about seven transactions in a second, meaning it cannot be utilized for anything vital. He said that the token has to continuously rely on centralized holders to grow, which was not part of Satoshi’s original plan. Moreover, he said the core altered the token’s economic design to depend on few transactions with really high fees rather than many transactions with low fees, claiming that this also destroyed the asset’s long-term security model. Bons says BTC could fall in the next 8-12 years Bons believes that high trading activity on the BTC blockchain could make transaction fees surge to peak levels, even forcing traders to leave. He pointed out that this trend has been playing out on a smaller scale in recent years, leading to occasional fee spikes. However, he warned that this cycle “spells doom” for Bitcoin in the long term. He even expects the digital asset to collapse in the next 8 to 12 years, saying that an inflation rise past the 21 million cap will be its only saving grace then. He also projects a “bank-run”-like situation for when the token collapses, seeing how difficult it would be for every trader to transfer or withdraw all their assets. To him, BTC can never be a medium of exchange without capacity and will be a horrible store of value without long-term security. He even claims that BTC will reach a point where its price can no longer rise, and a “reckoning” will happen then. He has urged his followers to support Bitcoin by abandoning it and seeing Satoshi’s vision materialize in BTC’s children.

He emphasized their role in sustaining the current bullish trend. According to Martinez’s analysis, these levels have historically acted as both resistance and support for the altcoin. The repeated interaction with this range indicates its significance in determining ADA price direction. Key Support Levels for Cardano Price Stability In a post on X , Ali Martinez highlighted that Cardano price has repeatedly tested the $0.67–$0.80 range. This zone has provided stability for ADA, preventing further declines and acting as a foundation for bullish movements. Historical price movements suggest that this support area has been critical during both uptrends and corrections. The ability of ADA to hold above this range signals strong buying interest. Recent market data indicates that ADA remains within this support range, maintaining its position despite market fluctuations. If buying pressure persists, Cardano price could establish a stronger footing and attempt an upward breakout. Meanwhile, Grok 3 AI highlighted Cardano’s strong decentralization as a driving force behind its potential rally to $5-$6 in this bull cycle. If Cardano price can break key resistance levels, it may gain the bullish momentum needed to reach these ambitious price targets. Technical Indicators Suggest Growing Buying Pressure Cardano price is about to cross the 20-day Exponential Moving Average, a significant indicator for short-term trend identification. The 20 EMA acts as a support level and a breakout above it may indicate a rally for the altcoin. Supporting the bullish sentiments, the 1-day Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicates Cardano price is holding above key support levels, providing a foundation for a altcoin rally. More so, the MACD line is above the signal line, signaling a bullish crossover. If ADA maintains its position above $0.75 and builds on this momentum, it will break the $0.80 resistance and push higher in the short term. Furthermore, there is the Parabolic Stop and Reverse (SAR) indicator whose dotted lines are placed below Cardano price, which is common in an upward trend . This suggests that ADA price has found a strong support base, further reinforcing the likelihood of an upward move. Source: TradingView ADA Price To $1? If Cardano price remains above the key support range of $0.67–$0.80 and manages to break above resistance levels, analysts project a potential rally toward $0.94. A successful test of this price point could pave the way for ADA to revisit the $1 mark. Conversely, if ADA fails to sustain support above $0.67, selling pressure could increase, driving the price lower. In such a scenario, the next key support level would be around $0.54, where buyers might re-enter the market. Moreover, another analyst shared the bullish sentiments, emphasizing that ADA price movements suggest a potential breakout. The expert highlighted that if Cardano surpasses the critical resistance at $0.9837, it could pave the way for a rally toward $1.35.

Major shifts are happening, with XRP coin drawing attention due to ETF speculation and Solana facing increased short positions as network activity declines. Despite Solana’s recent price dip, long-term interest in its ecosystem remains strong. Meanwhile, Web3Bay , a decentralized e-commerce platform, is transforming blockchain-based shopping by integrating crypto, fiat, and PayPal payments. This hybrid system offers users a smoother shift into decentralized commerce without giving up familiar payment methods. With regulatory decisions impacting XRP, market shifts affecting Solana, and Web3Bay’s payment model gaining traction, crypto adoption is evolving. Each project represents different aspects of this change—finance, blockchain infrastructure, and real-world use—making them key players in shaping the market’s next chapter. Web3Bay’s Hybrid Payment System Simplifies Blockchain Shopping For crypto to gain more users, it must be easy to use. Web3Bay tackles this by offering a decentralized e-commerce platform that accepts crypto, fiat, and PayPal payments. This hybrid approach is more flexible than most blockchain marketplaces, letting users choose the payment method that suits them. Whether they prefer stablecoins, bank transfers, or digital wallets, Web3Bay removes the barriers that often discourage people from trying decentralized commerce. The demand for this system is evident. Web3Bay’s presale has raised over $1.5 million, with more than 370 million 3BAY tokens sold. With a 6,430% ROI potential, early buyers are securing their positions before the final presale price of $0.1959. Spanning 28 stages, this structure rewards early supporters while ensuring steady value growth before the platform’s official launch. By merging crypto’s flexibility with fiat’s convenience, Web3Bay makes decentralized shopping more accessible for everyday use. Even XRP coin holders seeking practical ways to spend their crypto can benefit from Web3Bay’s smooth and user-friendly payment system. Analyzing XRP Coin’s ETF Speculation XRP coin is at a crucial point, with speculation rising over a potential XRP ETF approval. The SEC is currently reviewing an application that could allow institutional investors to access XRP through a regulated exchange-traded fund. Approval could boost demand and drive further market activity. Ripple is also expanding its ecosystem with Ripple USD (RLUSD), a stablecoin designed for enterprise use, strengthening XRP’s role in crypto payments. At $2.56, XRP has experienced high volatility, with analysts predicting a potential rise to $5–$7 in the coming months. While traders are split on short-term performance, long-term optimism remains, supported by growing institutional interest and improving regulatory clarity. With financial institutions watching closely, XRP’s next move could have a significant impact on the broader crypto market. Solana Price Drips as Market Sentiment Weakens The Solana price has dropped to $167.28, down 8.14% over the past 24 hours. A rise in short positions reflects bearish sentiment, partly due to declining network activity. On-chain data shows a 55% drop in active addresses since November 2024, raising concerns about user engagement. Despite this, Solana’s ecosystem remains a hub for growth, with developers continuing to create new applications. External factors are also playing a role. The recent U.S. presidential election has sparked discussions on crypto regulations, boosting interest in both Solana and XRP coins. Institutional inflows into Solana-based investment products indicate that demand remains strong despite recent price drops. Many analysts see this dip as a potential setup for future growth, depending on how the market responds to broader economic and regulatory trends. Final Remarks! Crypto is evolving quickly, with XRP coin, Solana, and Web3Bay driving different aspects of this shift. While XRP awaits regulatory clarity and Solana faces short-term volatility, Web3Bay is making crypto payments more practical for real-world use. As a decentralized e-commerce platform , Web3Bay’s hybrid payment system bridges the gap between traditional finance and blockchain, making it easier for users to engage in decentralized shopping. With over $1.5 million raised and a solid presale structure, Web3Bay shows the real demand for accessible and flexible payment solutions. Whether through investments, blockchain infrastructure, or real-world adoption, these three projects are shaping the future of crypto.

The Shiba Inu price has long been a favorite among retail investors, yet recent stagnation below $0.3 has raised concerns about its long-term viability. Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is emerging as a powerhouse, with a 750x growth potential that presents a lucrative opportunity for investors. The Ethereum-based AI’s ongoing presale is already attracting substantial investments, signaling massive confidence in its long-term success. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The 750x Growth Opportunity Drawing Investors In WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out as a transformative force in the multi-billion-dollar crypto wallet and AI security industry rather than being just another token. With a presale that is rapidly gaining traction, thousands of investors are securing early positions, enabling the DeFi wallet’s price to skyrocket once the next round begins. The current presale round has already seen record-breaking investments, with projections indicating a price surge of over 750x after the token launches publicly. WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers a secure, AI-powered decentralized wallet that allows direct trading of over 1,000 cryptocurrencies. Presale investors gain access to discounted prices and benefit from lower transaction fees, exclusive features, and governance rights, which allow them to influence platform development. These benefits have attracted SHIB whales and DOGE whales looking to diversify into a token with tangible use cases and a strong financial model. Security remains paramount, with AI-driven technology proactively detecting threats and safeguarding digital assets against hacks. The integration of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) enables transactions and private keys to remain protected. More than just a wallet, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers an entire financial ecosystem where investors can earn, trade, and govern the platform’s future. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is launching its beta platform soon, offering early adopters access to its innovative AI-driven crypto wallet. This phase will highlight security features, trading options, and asset management tools, showcasing the future of decentralized finance. Additionally, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has passed a rigorous audit by SolidProof, certifying its smart contracts as secure and transparent. This commitment to compliance and security positions the Ethereum-based AI as a strong alternative to stagnant assets like the Shiba Inu price, instilling investor confidence. The MVP version of the WallitIQ (WLTQ) mobile app establishes it as a frontrunner in the development of crypto wallets. This launch will unveil cutting-edge features aimed at improving wallet management, incorporating real-time pricing, and offering sophisticated trading options. Selling at a discounted price of $0.0420 , WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents a compelling opportunity as the Shiba Inu price stagnates below $0.3. With overwhelming demand and potential for 750x growth, a significant price increase appears inevitable, making it an appealing choice for savvy investors. Shiba Inu Price: A Struggle To Regain Momentum Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a popular token, but its inability to push past $0.3 has left investors questioning its ability to deliver sustained returns. The Shiba Inu price whales have continuously supported the token, but diminishing trading volumes suggest a weakening demand. Investors who once anticipated explosive growth are now watching as the token remains trapped in a cycle of minor rallies and corrections. Despite previous gains, the Shiba Inu price struggles to generate the same enthusiasm as it once did. Investors who rode the early wave of the Shiba Inu price success are now weighing alternative options, as meme-based speculation alone is no longer enough to sustain long-term growth. While the Shiba Inu price whales continue holding significant positions, the broader market sentiment remains lukewarm. With investors looking for the next high-reward opportunity, the focus is shifting toward WallitIQ (WLTQ) and its unprecedented growth potential. Conclusion: WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is The Top Investment Opportunity Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a well-known asset, but its stagnant price performance is causing investors to seek alternatives. With WallitIQ (WLTQ) offering a 750x growth potential, AI-driven security, and lucrative presale rewards, the decision for investors is clear. The presale is already attracting record-breaking investments , with thousands of investors recognizing the massive upside potential. SHIB whales and DOGE whales are investing in the Ethereum-based token, anticipating exponential gains once it launches publicly. Now is the time to secure a position in what could be the most profitable investment of the year.

Story ( IP ) launched on February 13th at the listing price of $2.26 and is now trading at $5.98 at time of writing. It’s already the 71st-largest crypto asset by market cap and has surged by nearly 120% in the past 24 hours alone. Story is a scalable intellectual property solution that aims to serve as a blockchain where rights holders can upload IP, set the terms of use and monetize it throughout the protocol’s application ecosystem.

The banks outlined the Q4 losses in “net charge-offs” statements, revealing loans that the banks have declared as uncollectible and removed from their books after exhausting efforts to recover the owed amounts. JPMorgan Chase reported the highest charge-offs at $2.4 billion, driven largely by customers with big unpaid balances on their credit cards. Bank of America recorded $1.5 billion in charge-offs, also primarily from its credit card portfolio. And Wells Fargo reported $1.288 billion in charge-offs, fueled by higher credit card losses and commercial real estate losses in its office portfolio. The new numbers come as US credit card debt hits a record $1.21 trillion, according to new numbers from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The collective losses at the three banks represent a $188 million increase over the previous quarter, and a $460 million increase from one year ago. Despite the losses, the banks reported major earnings in Q4, with JPMorgan Chase declaring $14 billion in profits, Bank of America reporting $6.7 billion and Wells Fargo coming in at $5.1 billion.

Amid this, XRP, the native token of Ripple Labs, has once again neared a crucial support level from the ascending trendline, which it has been testing since the beginning of February 2025. Considering the current market sentiment and XRP’s outlook, the token appears to have absorbed all the bearish pressure and is now recovering. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, as the XRP price reached the trendline support of $2.50 level a significant buying pressure was observed resulting in the formation of a bullish candlestick pattern. Besides this, the recent price drop has not affected XRP’s past ascending triangle price action pattern which it has formed. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action, if XRP holds above the $2.50 level, there is a strong possibility that the asset could soar significantly in the coming days and maintain its bullish momentum. However, if the token fails to hold this level and closes a four-hour candle below $2.45, a massive price drop could occur, potentially pushing XRP down to the $1.90 level. Despite the ongoing price recovery, the asset remains below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating that it is still in a downtrend. Current Price Momentum With these key levels in focus, XRP is currently trading near $2.58, having dropped over 3.75% in the past 24 hours. However, despite the decline, investors and traders have shown strong interest in the token, leading to a 44% increase in participation. $21.50 Million Worth XRP Outflow Data from the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass revealed that this rise in participation is driven by significant investor accumulation of XRP tokens. Spot inflow/outflow data showed that as the price dropped, exchanges witnessed a substantial outflow of $21.50 million worth of XRP tokens, indicating potential accumulation. Source: Coinglass Combining this potential accumulation with price action, the current level appears to be an ideal buying opportunity, with $2.50 or $2.45 serving as a potential exit level if sentiment shifts toward the bearish side.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 01:11:47

TD Sequential Says Yes,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/is-it-time-to-buy-xrp-td-sequential-says-yes/,"A cryptocurrency analyst has pointed out how the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential has just given a buy signal on the hourly XRP price chart. XRP Has Just Witnessed A Bullish Setup On TD Sequential In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a TD Sequential signal that XRP has seen recently. The “TD Sequential” here refers to an indicator from technical analysis (TA) that’s used for locating probable points of reversal in any asset’s price. The indicator consists of two phases: setup and countdown. In the first of these, candles of the same polarity (that is, whether red or green) are counted up to nine. Once these candles, which don’t have to be one after the other, are printed on the chart, the TD Sequential gives a reversal signal. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Plunges 58%: How Do Shiba Inu & Pepe Compare? The countdown phase begins as soon as the setup is over. This phase also works much in the same way, with the only difference being that candles here are counted up to thirteen, not nine. Once the countdown is finished, the asset can be assumed to have arrived at another potential turnaround. Where a TD Sequential signal might lead the price naturally depends on the type of candle that led to the phase’s completion. Green candles naturally mean a correction may be coming, while red ones suggest a bullish reversal. XRP has recently completed the former TD Sequential phase on its 1-hour price. Here is the chart shared by the analyst, that shows this pattern forming for the cryptocurrency: As is visible in the above graph, the TD Sequential has finished a setup with nine red candles for XRP recently, which implies the cryptocurrency’s price can be considered to have reached a bottom. Related Reading: Bitcoin RHODL Momentum Slowing Down—Analyst Warns Pattern ‘Not Ideal’ If the pattern indeed holds, then the asset would next see a rebound to the upside. Though, given the fact that this buy signal has formed on a short timeframe (1-hour), the surge resulting from the signal may not be too large. Speaking of the TD Sequential, XRP isn’t the only cryptocurrency that has displayed a bullish formation in its hourly price. As Martinez has pointed out in another X post, Steller (XLM) has also seen a buy setup recently. “Stellar $XLM is ready to rebound as the TD Sequential indicator shows a buy signal on the hourly chart!” notes the analyst. It only remains to be seen, though, whether the signal would come to fruition for XRP and XLM or not. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.67, down 1% in the last seven days.

The company was facing a potential lawsuit from the SEC over NFTs being classified as securities. Bloomberg reported on Friday that the SEC told OpenSea that the agency had closed its investigation without taking enforcement action. SEC issued Wells Notice, but OpenSea resisted NFT securities classification The development follows a Wells notice issued to the NFT marketplace last August, indicating the SEC’s intent to take legal action. The agency had been investigating whether some NFTs traded on OpenSea’s platform were actually securities, part of its wider push to regulate the crypto industry. A Wells notice is a formal communication from the SEC that allows the recipient to respond before the agency makes a final enforcement decision. Even though the notice indicated the SEC thought some NFTs might be subject to securities laws, OpenSea had taken the position that classifying them this way would misunderstand the current laws and choke innovation in the space. Devin Finzer, co-founder and CEO of OpenSea, welcomed the news and said the development is a win for everyone who is making and building in their space. He added that attempting to label NFTs as securities would have set them back. According to Finzer, every creator, no matter how small, should be able to build without undue friction.” Finzer’s comments echo the views of other NFT and broader web3 community members who have contended that NFTs are primarily a form of digital collectibles and art, not financial securities. OpenSea had already reserved $5 million in a legal defense fund to help NFT artists and developers who could be scrutinized by the SEC. Crypto community pushes back as SEC eases NFT and crypto regulations The SEC’s efforts to define NFTs as securities have been met with a widespread backlash from the crypto community who see such regulation as a barrier to innovation. For holders and creators of at least some NFTs, the SEC’s decision to close the investigation without enforcement action potentially signals a more lenient approach to enforcement regarding NFTs, which may be a relief for marketplaces, creators, and collectors that have been scrambling to parse existing regulatory guidance. Meanwhile, in a related development, the SEC has also dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase. The crypto exchange revealed earlier today that the SEC staff had agreed in principle to dismiss the case, subject to final approval by the commissioners. If formally adopted, the dismissal would be with prejudice, which would bar the SEC from reissuing similar charges against Coinbase in the future and could impact other ongoing legal fights involving other crypto platforms. The SEC’s decision not to pursue OpenSea any further is a landmark moment for the NFT space and confirms that digital assets as a whole should not be shoehorned into historical securities-based regulation. With OpenSea free from the concerns of regulatory action, creators and developers within the NFT space can focus on innovating as the specter of gory enforcement recedes.

Additionally, ADA’s four-hour chart appears to be mirroring XRP’s , which looks bullish. Current Price Momentum Currently, ADA is trading near $0.77 and has dropped 3.25% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume surged by 45%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors. Cardano (ADA) Bullish and Bearish Levels Despite market fluctuations, the $0.74 level will play a crucial role today. Based on recent price momentum, this level will determine whether ADA sinks or gains upward momentum. Source: Trading View On the positive side, if ADA holds this level, there is a strong possibility it could soar 10% to reach $0.85 in the coming hours. Additionally, if the bullish rally continues, it could gain another 20% to reach $1.01 in the coming days. On the bearish side, if ADA fails to hold the $0.74 level and closes a four-hour candle below it, there is a strong possibility of a 10% drop to $0.65.

The token gained over 44% in value, according to price data on Crypto.news. Derivatives data and on-chain analysis supports a bullish thesis for the DeFi token for next week. Derivatives data from crypto intelligence platform Coinglass shows a large positive spike in Open Interest in MKR on February 21. The spike represents a massive increase in the total value of open contracts in MKR across derivatives exchanges. Coinglass data shows that MKR OI is $116.85 million at the time of writing on Friday, February 21. MKR Futures Open Interest | Source: Coinglass The total value of assets locked in MKR surged to $5.675 billion, as seen on DeFiLlama. This coincides with the rising price, relevance, and demand for tokens among traders. The rebranding to Sky protocol has proven effective for driving adoption in market participants. Maker TVL | Source: DeFiLlama Santiment data shows several negative spikes in Network realized profit/loss metric in the MKR chart since mid-January 2025. This shows several traders and MKR holders are shedding their holdings and realizing losses. Consistent realization of losses is typically considered a sign of capitulation and is consistent with an eventual recovery in the token’s price. MKR’s daily active addresses recorded a nearly three-month peak this week, signalling the rise in interest from traders. MKR token’s supply held by whales (excluding exchange wallets) has climbed, recovering from the decline noted in the first week of February. This is another bullish sign for the DeFi token. Maker on-chain analysis | Source: Santiment The In/Out of money around price indicator on IntoTheBlock shows that 30% of the wallet addresses holding MKR are currently sitting on unrealized losses. 65.55% of MKR token holders have unrealized gains in their portfolio. Combining the In/Out of the money with the Network realized profit/loss metric, it is less likely that profitable traders take profits as the current trend is that of capitulation. The likelihood of further selling pressure on MKR is low for next week, meaning the token could extend its gains and maintain the underlying positive momentum. In/Out of the Money around price | Source: IntoTheBlock Maker (MKR) weekly price forecast Maker broke out of its downward trend on February 12, since then the token has rallied, extending gains nearly everyday this week. At the time of writing, MKR is trading at $1,473, on Friday. The token is close to resistance at $1,632 and $2,050, two key levels in MKR’s upward trend between October 26 and December 4, as observed in the daily price chart. In the event of a correction, MKR could find support at $1,125. Two key technical indicators, the Moving average convergence divergence indicator and relative strength index flash bullish signs on the daily timeframe. MACD shows consecutive green histogram bars above the neutral line and RSI reads 74 and is sloping upwards. While this typically generates a sell signal, in the case of MKR, MACD and the underlying positive momentum in the MKR price trend support further gains. MKR/USDT daily price chart | Source: Crypto.news A rally to test resistance at $1,632 marks a nearly 15% rally in MKR price. Even as whales cash out their MKR holdings amidst price surges, they fail to influence prices negatively. While it is typical of a token to observe a decline in its price if large entities shed their holdings, MKR price is holding steady. A wallet address identified as inveteratus.eth on the blockchain sold 1,230 MKR worth 1.78 million USDC and secured a 30% profit of $418,000 within less than a month.

Yesterday, an emergency proposal appeared on the MakerDAO @skyecosystem forum and voting portal. This proposal, which has passed but still pending timelock, dramatically increases both the amount and the LTV that Maker will lend against its own gov token.

Maker tokens worth $17 million burnt, support gains The second market mover for MKR this week is the $17 million token burn, identified on the blockchain. When a large volume of tokens is burnt, they are removed from the supply permanently, and they reduce the selling pressure, supporting price gains.

The meme coin is facing massive sell pressure at the moment, prompting more bearish Dogecoin price movement. Smart market players have identified Panshibi (SHIBI) as the perfect Dogecoin alternative. The Asian-backed meme coin has maintained a positive outlook despite market conditions, and analysis suggests early presale investors could gain 100x from it. Let’s see what the Dogecoin price prediction says in comparison to Panshibi (SHIBI) Dogecoin Risks Further Price Drop As Sell Pressure Increases If the current trend persists, the Dogecoin dip could worsen in the coming days. Short-term Dogecoin holders are already abandoning the coin, as the new Panshibi (SHIBI) looks better primed for an imminent bullish run. The DOGE sell-off is affecting the meme coin's upward momentum, but Dogecoin has maintained its consolidation zone around $0.24 - $0.25 since last week. Despite Grayscale's ETF filing for several altcoins, including Dogecoin, demand on the meme coin has been unimpressive as bearish market trends persist. Technical analysis also identified a death cross on the meme coin, signaling an imminent bearish run. While the popular Dogecoin price prediction targets a surge to $1, recent market trends highlight a potential dip below $0.1. With growing volatility on DOGE, holders have been quick to explore other market opportunities to deliver better returns for investors in the short and long run. Panshibi (SHIBI) To Rally Impressively Soon, Despite General Market Woes Presale tokens are seemingly the best investment types in the crypto market. Even in high market volatility, they offer controlled market parameters that almost guarantee profit for early buyers. The ongoing Stage 4 Panshibi presale is an opportunity for early investors to get in cheap ahead of a higher listing price. Panshibi (SHIBI) is set for 15 presale stages over 60 days, and the ongoing Stage 4 is selling out fast at $0.005. While this entry allows investors to secure over 400% gains before the $0.026 listing, the bigger profit margin is available after the token launch. Panshibi is a new panda-themed meme coin that leverages its Asian influence to grow. To increase engagement in its community, the project will introduce quests, contests, and other reward-backed activities. To achieve this, the meme coin will integrate artificial intelligence (AI) with its Social-Fi mechanism. The new meme coin is currently enjoying much interest, and the fact that it's well-audited and declared safe by Coinsult has added to investors' confidence in it. Panshibi is expected to enjoy higher adoption, and early adopters may gain the most from the token. Additionally, Panshibi will implement a ten-year liquidity lock and lock team tokens for two years, establishing a long-term commitment to the project’s success. Once the presale is over, the Panshibi team will also renounce contract ownership. Conclusion Dogecoin (DOGE) is already at a market size without a margin for 100x gains. Therefore, investors are betting on the more promising prospect of a 100x profit on Panshibi (SHIBI) as the new meme coin does impressive numbers on presale. Unlike Dogecoin, Panshibi (SHIBI) is building momentum from presale and is likely to maintain it when it hits exchanges. The Panda-themed meme coin looks ready to yield good returns, and its prospects are clear for all to see.

This downward momentum casts doubt over the coin's future price trends. In the midst of this downturn, the Panshibi (SHIBI) token has caught the attention of shrewd investors seeking alternatives. Despite widespread market challenges, Panshibi maintains a bright outlook, with projections suggesting potential exponential growth for early presale participants. Considering the current Dogecoin forecast and contrasting it with the optimistic predictions for Panshibi (SHIBI) provides intriguing insights. The Uncertain Path for Dogecoin Amid Rising Sell-offs As selling pressure intensifies, Dogecoin faces the possibility of further depreciation. Investors are turning to Panshibi (SHIBI) for its potential upswing, as the established meme coin struggles to break past the $0.24 - $0.25 zone. Despite efforts like Grayscale's ETF initiatives for Dogecoin, the prevailing bearish sentiment poses challenges. Furthermore, technical indicators hint at potential downturns, marking a cautious outlook for its trajectory. While ambitions of a $1 price tag for Dogecoin exist, volatile conditions suggest a dip closer to $0.1 might be on the horizon. Such fluctuations are driving investors towards more promising ventures that promise lucrative returns in both short and long-term scopes. Panshibi (SHIBI) Sets the Stage for Remarkable Growth Despite Market Hurdles Cryptocurrency presales, with their predictable settings, have attracted those keen on securing early gains amidst market unpredictability. Panshibi's Stage 4 presale offers a gateway to potential profitability at attractive rates. Panshibi (SHIBI) is structured for 15 strategic presale stages, with the current phase advancing swiftly at a $0.005 rate. Investors anticipate substantial gains post-listing, but the true value lies beyond the presale. The Asian-themed panda coin capitalizes on its cultural allure, incorporating features like AI-driven Social-Fi components to boost community engagement through interactive events and rewards. Its rigorous audit process by Coinsult enhances its credibility and investor trust. Further securing its foundation, Panshibi has committed to locking liquidity and team tokens to ensure sustained growth. Post-presale, the project's commitment extends to relinquishing contract ownership, solidifying its long-term vision. Final Thoughts With Dogecoin's current market ceiling hindering dramatic returns, investors are eagerly eyeing the potential windfall that comes with Panshibi (SHIBI). This new entrant in the meme coin domain is making waves, thanks to its strategic presale success. Where Dogecoin falls short, Panshibi (SHIBI) shines by leveraging its early market momentum and anticipated post-listing performance.

Optimists believe this could represent the start of a more general upward movement, backed by Cardano’s strong technical updates in 2024 and thorough plans for 2025. So, is this optimism reasonable to have, or should holders be more cautious? Cardano Price Prediction 2025: Can ADA Really Double? Cardano (ADA) has had a volatile ride in recent months, but analysts remain optimistic about its long-term potential. With key network upgrades in the pipeline, many experts believe ADA could double in value by 2025, potentially hitting $1.50 to $2.00 as adoption grows. One major factor supporting this Cardano price prediction is the blockchain’s commitment to scalability and decentralization. The upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade is set to increase transaction throughput, improving efficiency and making Cardano more competitive with Ethereum. Additionally, the move toward full governance, reinforced by the Plomin Hard Fork and Lace Wallet expansion, could attract more developers and institutional investors to the ecosystem. On-chain data suggests that Cardano accumulation is rising. The number of addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million ADA has steadily increased , signaling that whales are positioning themselves for long-term gains. Currently, Cardano’s market cap sits at $26.58 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $879.83 million, demonstrating strong liquidity and continued investor interest So, is a 2x Cardano price prediction realistic for 2025? If scalability upgrades roll out smoothly and institutional interest continues growing, a strong rally is definitely on the table.

This has led this Dogecoin analyst to believe a $50 billion market cap for DOGE is within reach. In addition, the potential introduction of a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has generated considerable excitement for the meme coin mania. The Dogecoin analyst predicted that a DOGE ETF could drive the price of Dogecoin up to $15 despite on-chain metrics suggesting stagnation. Furthermore, the prospect of Donald Trump’s re-election as U.S. President and the Federal Reserve’s decision to lower interest rates have created a favorable environment for crypto growth.

Particularly, so far, BTC has managed to regain some of the losses shedded in recent weeks with its price now hovering above $98,000, marking a 2.6% increase in the past 7 days. Alongside this price movement, new data have emerged highlighting significant activity among large holders on exchanges, suggesting a shift in market dynamics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Climbs—Is a Market Breakout Around the Corner? Bitfinex Whales Show Increased Activity A CryptoQuant analyst known as Mignolet has recently shared a detailed outlook on exchange whales and their influence on the current price action in Bitcoin. Mignolet’s observations focus on leverage ratios across major trading platforms. According to his analysis, the “all exchange leverage ratio” is at an all-time high. This measure, which captures the amount of leverage being used on exchanges, reflects heightened activity that could precede significant price moves. Interestingly, while Binance has seen its leverage ratio drop back to levels last seen during last year’s consolidation phase, Bitfinex tells a different story. On Bitfinex, leverage ratios have surged sharply, aligning with a rise in open interest. Mignolet highlights that this activity points to a sudden increase in whale movements within the ongoing consolidation range. While these leverage ratios alone don’t guarantee a specific price direction, the sharp uptick on Bitfinex suggests a shift in market dynamics that bears watching. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the question now is: What are these whales aiming for? Mignolet’s analysis stops short of providing a definitive answer, but it raises the possibility of a major price shift soon. With Bitcoin’s price holding steady above $98,000, the actions of these large-scale traders could influence whether the market breaks higher or retreats back into a more extended consolidation phase. Bitcoin Encounters Potential Strong Support Zone Meanwhile, Bitcoin has continued to inch closer to the six-digit price mark which it recently fell below in the previous week. Although the asset is still roughly an 8.7% decrease away from its all-time high (ATH) above $109,000 established in January, it has managed to see an uptick in price in the past few days. At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $98,091 marking a 1.2% increase in price over the past day. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the asset appears to be seeing a formation of a “massive demand zone just below the current price.” IntoTheBlock highlighted that should the market face further downward pressure around this area, the zone may act as strong support.

Amidst these market dynamics, Web3Bay is confronting a critical issue: the prevalence of online shopping fraud. Web3Bay employs a smart contract-based escrow system that acts as a robust safeguard for both buyers and sellers, ensuring that payments are released only once contractual conditions are satisfied. This system also combats the issue of falsified reviews by utilizing blockchain technology for verification, thereby fostering increased trust in online marketplaces. Web3Bay’s Smart Contract Escrow System: Transforming Security in Online Retail The menace of online shopping scams is escalating, with consumers and merchants facing losses in the billions due to fraudulent listings and payment disputes. Web3Bay’s response is a blockchain-driven escrow mechanism that not only secures transactions but also safeguards against fraudulent activities by both parties. By automating the transaction process, the platform ensures that funds are transferred only after both buyer and seller have met the agreed-upon terms. This security is further enhanced by Web3Bay’s approach to tackling counterfeit reviews, a significant issue in e-commerce. The platform ensures that only verified purchasers can leave reviews, which minimizes the chances of manipulation and boosts the integrity of online feedback. This transparency not only increases consumer trust but also promotes fairness among businesses. Amidst its ongoing presale, Web3Bay has successfully sold over 370 million coins, raising $1.5 million and progressing to stage 4 of its token offering at a price of $0.004562625 per token. This robust presale activity underscores the market’s growing interest in blockchain solutions that address fraud prevention. Uniswap’s (UNI) Price Predictions: Looking Towards 2025 As of February 15, 2025, Uniswap (UNI) stands at $9.79, marking a minor decline of 4.21% from its last closing price. The past year has seen UNI’s price undergo substantial swings, reflecting its volatile nature. Future projections for UNI suggest it could oscillate between $7.95 and $16.26 in the coming year, potentially realizing a growth of up to 63.59%. These estimates derive from comprehensive market analysis and historical trends, though they warrant cautious consideration due to the inherent unpredictability of the cryptocurrency sector. Investors are encouraged to keep abreast of ongoing market trends and perform detailed analyses before engaging in trading activities. While growth prospects for UNI are plausible, it’s imperative to weigh the potential risks and market forces that could influence its trajectory. Hedera (HBAR): On the Verge of a Market Uptrend Currently, Hedera (HBAR) is priced at $0.227554, showing a nominal decrease of 0.03534% from its previous closing. The trading session saw HBAR reach a high of $0.239214 and dip to a low of $0.227527. Technical analysis suggests that HBAR might be wrapping up its corrective Wave 4, with its position near the 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels hinting at an impending upward movement. The RSI indicates oversold conditions, typically a precursor to a rally. A breakout from a descending wedge on the hourly chart further points to a potential bullish phase, with target resistance levels at $0.31, $0.35, and $0.39. Conversely, a fall below $0.218 could negate this bullish forecast, with $0.177 acting as crucial support. In Conclusion While Uniswap (UNI) and Hedera (HBAR) continue their unpredictable market performance, Web3Bay is making a tangible impact on enhancing online transaction security. Beyond just analyzing price trends, Web3Bay provides concrete solutions to real-world problems faced by consumers and businesses, utilizing its escrow system to minimize fraud, avoid wrongful chargebacks, and promote equitable dealings. With its blockchain-validated system bolstering confidence in online reviews, Web3Bay introduces much-needed transparency to e-commerce.

In a post on X, Martinez shared a chart highlighting a potential buy signal on XLM’s hourly chart, based on the TD Sequential indicator. #Stellar $XLM is ready to rebound as the TD Sequential indicator shows a buy signal on the hourly chart! pic.twitter.com/qFvbOkvD02 — Ali (@ali_charts) February 21, 2025 The TD Sequential Buy Signal Traders use the TD Sequential indicator to identify potential trend reversals. On the hourly chart of XLM/USDT, the signal appears as a green “1” candle following a red “9” count, which typically suggests that selling pressure has been exhausted and a price reversal could be imminent. Martinez’s chart reflects this setup, with a black arrow marking the point where the buy signal was triggered. The chart also shows a period of downward price movement leading up to the signal, followed by several small-bodied candles indicating consolidation. If the TD Sequential setup plays out as expected, XLM could see a short-term upward move. Recent Price Action and Market Context When the chart was published, XLM traded at approximately $0.33944 on Binance. The price had previously declined, forming a series of lower highs and lower lows, but the emergence of the buy signal could indicate a shift in momentum. Technical traders often seek confirmation before acting on a TD Sequential buy signal. A bullish candle following the signal, increased trading volume, or a break above key resistance levels would strengthen the case for a rebound. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analyst Ali Martinez’s Broader Market Outlook Ali Martinez actively provides cryptocurrency market analysis, covering various assets beyond XLM. Recently, he has also made notable predictions about XRP. In one of his analyses , he suggested that XRP is “ready for an upswing” based on market structure and technical indicators. In another, he pointed to a cup-and-handle pattern on XRP’s chart , which could signal a major breakout above $3. Additionally, Martinez highlighted a critical support level for XRP , stating that a retest of the $3 level could be on the horizon if it holds. While these predictions focus on XRP, his overall analytical approach remains consistent across different cryptocurrencies. What’s Next for XLM? While the TD Sequential indicator provides a buy signal, traders should remain cautious and seek further confirmation. Market sentiment, broader cryptocurrency trends, and external factors such as macroeconomic conditions can all influence XLM’s price movement. If buying pressure increases and the price starts forming higher highs, XLM could confirm the reversal and move toward resistance levels around $0.345 or higher. However, if the price fails to gain upward momentum, the buy signal may not play out as expected, and further downside could be possible.

Shouting “dismantle the finance ministry!” attendees brandished signs saying things like “we are not your ATM” and mocking prime minister Shigeru Ishiba. Compared to other demonstrations and protests around the world, Friday evening’s (JST) MinFin protest may be seen as relatively tame, but by Japan’s typically polite standards, the growing anger is palpable. Around 1,000 people were estimated to have attended, according to participants. A small but swelling crowd chanted “demolish the ministry!” in unison in one video shared to social media, with the ostensible poster of the film noting the heavy police presence. Lightning Network advocate and Blockstream Japan leader Koji Higashi posted to X that the protest was “so exciting.” Others noted a stark lack of media coverage other than TV Tokyo, and indeed, coverage even at the time of writing is sparse. At a previous “demolish the finance ministry” event on February 17, a high school student visiting Tokyo for university entrance exams expressed frustration at the current statist paradigm, saying that he was sleeping in a park as hotels are now too expensive, and consumption tax keeps going up, while corporations are given breaks. “[The politicians] say if enterprise gets richer, we’ll all get richer. But is anyone here rich?” he asked to a passionate gathering of supporters. A sign at the protest reads: “The citizens are not your ATM.” Source: X . Reasons for the anger, Bitcoin advocates in attendance The February 21 protest is reportedly the fifth of its kind around Japan, and individual reasons for attending seem to be myriad. The 2016, Abe-era Moritomo Gakuen scandal in which the finance ministry admitted to falsifying documents, and essentially cheating the public out of money, is once again in the news . Beyond this issue, as Cryptopolitan has reported previously, residents of Japan are increasingly suffering palpable fiscal pain from inflation, overtourism, skyrocketing food prices, ostensible rice “shortages,” unlivable or non-existent pensions for the elderly, and a government and new prime minister that is hellbent on dumping literal trillions of yen into overseas initiatives and war, instead of helping the people. A street-side display at the “Demolish the Ministry of Finance” demonstration, featuring unflattering images of Japan’s prime minister Shigeru Ishiba. Source: X . “When I thought about the suffering of the people, with children unable to eat three meals a day and sales of rice seasoning at an all-time high, I started screaming and crying,” one protest attendee posted to social media , along with a video. Rice seasoning called furikake is often used in Japan to make cheap, plain meals consisting of mostly just rice, more palatable. Bitcoin advocates also attended the event via their own “Bitcoin Demo” in the same area. However, much like the murky origins of the “demolish the finance ministry” protests, it’s not immediately clear who these individuals are, or what their true agendas may be. Everyday individuals on the ground seemed to be protesting in earnest, but other elements of the demo could be construed by some as “ controlled opposition .” BTC “rebels” illogically appeal to Japanese to “pay taxes in Bitcoin” as a means to stop state spending. Source: X. For example, one photo shared by Blockstream Japan’s Koji Higashi shows a group of demonstrators in Guy Fawkes masks advising people to “pay your taxes with Bitcoin” — hardly the cypher-punk crypto freedom ethos their image might suggest, as BTC is now championed by banks and governments worldwide, including in Japan. And they’d be paying the exact entities they have deemed fiscally irresponsible. Like much cookie-cutter rebellion in the land of the rising sun, aesthetics and images are borrowed from the West, and adopted outrage which is out-of-place or counterproductive is the result. Whatever intentions may be, true crypto advocates are right about one thing: peer-to-peer, permissionless electronic cash with privacy protocols in place can indeed be a means to rein in and completely stop political spending.

However, after a much-hyped launch, the price experienced a sharp drop, falling by 65%. At the time of writing, Pi Coin is trading at $0.75 and has seen a decline of more than 7% in the past 24 hours. Despite the aggressive selling pressure fueled by market uncertainty, analysts, including Kim Wong, remain hopeful about the coin’s future trajectory. Initial Trading Activity and Price Movements When Pi Coin first launched on February 20, it traded at $2, reaching a high of $2.20 and a low of $0.09. Since then, its price has been relatively volatile, and as of February 22, Pi Coin has been trading within a range of $0.60 to $0.80. According to Wong , once Pi Coin manages to break above the $0.80 mark, it is likely to quickly move toward the $1 range. Once it surpasses $1, the $2 level could be within reach. A possible trigger for such a breakout could come from news regarding a Binance listing or progress in Pi’s ecosystem development. Disappointment and Market Misunderstandings Some early investors have voiced their disappointment over what they perceive as a low price for Pi Coin. However, this low price may be misleading, primarily due to confusion surrounding the circulating supply. The market has listed Pi’s circulating supply at 6.35 billion coins, which represents the total number of migrated Pi. However, the actual number of unlocked Pi is only 554 million coins, a figure that should be considered as the true circulating supply. Many new investors may not be aware of this distinction, but once they do, analysts believe the price of Pi could rise significantly — possibly ten times its current value. Pi Coin’s Relative Value in the Crypto Market Even at a price of $0.72, Pi Coin’s valuation is considered by some experts to be reasonable. For comparison, other projects with similar circulating supplies, such as Supra, are trading at a much lower price of $0.012. Projects with a similar supply, like Pi Coin, typically have higher initial listings. This makes Pi Coin’s current price quite favorable when compared to other crypto assets with similar supply and market factor.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ZRX|MARKET|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 03:32:08

Get ready for a game-changer! Apple’s latest iOS 18.4 developer beta introduces ‘Priority Notifications,’ a smart feature powered by the groundbreaking Apple Intelligence . This innovative update promises to transform how you manage alerts, ensuring you stay focused on what’s important without missing crucial updates. Let’s dive into how this feature will revolutionize your iPhone Notifications experience. Unveiling Priority Notifications: How Does Apple Intelligence Enhance Alert Management? Imagine a world where your iPhone intelligently filters through the noise, presenting only the notifications that demand your immediate attention. That’s precisely what ‘Priority Notifications’ aims to deliver. Powered by Apple Intelligence , this feature analyzes your notifications and categorizes them based on importance. Instead of a chronological list, your Lock Screen will now feature a dedicated section for these prioritized alerts. Think of it as having a smart assistant managing your digital interruptions. Here’s a breakdown of how Priority Notifications changes the notification game: Intelligent Prioritization: Apple Intelligence algorithms work behind the scenes to determine which notifications are most relevant to you. This means messages from close contacts, urgent app alerts, or time-sensitive reminders are more likely to be flagged as ‘priority.’ Separate Lock Screen Section: Important notifications are neatly organized in their own section on the Lock Screen, ensuring they don’t get lost in the shuffle of less critical alerts. Chronological View Still Available: Don’t worry about missing anything! You can still swipe up to access the traditional chronological view of all your notifications, ensuring complete oversight. Reduced Digital Clutter: By filtering out less important notifications, ‘Priority Notifications’ helps minimize distractions, allowing you to focus on tasks at hand and improve your overall digital well-being. Mastering Notification Management : Enabling and Customizing Priority Notifications in iOS 18.4 Ready to take control of your iPhone Notifications with this smart feature? Enabling ‘Priority Notifications’ in iOS 18.4 is straightforward. While the feature is initially turned off by default, activating it is a breeze through your iPhone settings. This user-friendly approach puts you in charge of when and how you want to experience prioritized alerts. Follow these simple steps to enable Priority Notifications: Open Settings App: Locate and tap the ‘Settings’ app icon on your iPhone’s home screen. Navigate to Notifications: Scroll down and select the ‘Notifications’ option within the Settings menu. Find ‘Prioritize Notifications’: Look for the ‘Prioritize Notifications’ section within the Notifications settings. Toggle it On: Simply toggle the switch to the ‘on’ position to activate the ‘Priority Notifications’ feature powered by Apple Intelligence . Once enabled, you’ll immediately start experiencing a more streamlined notification experience. The intelligent filtering will begin working, and you’ll notice important alerts surfacing to the top, right where you need them. Beyond Priority Notifications : What Else is New in iOS 18.4 and Apple’s AI Push? iOS 18.4 isn’t just about smarter notifications. Apple’s developer beta release hints at a broader push towards integrating Apple Intelligence across its ecosystem. The announcement that Apple Intelligence is also coming to Vision Pro as part of visionOS 2.4 further emphasizes this commitment. This expansion suggests a future where AI-driven features become increasingly central to the Apple experience, enhancing user interaction and device functionality across various platforms. In addition to Priority Notifications and Vision Pro integration, Apple also unveiled Apple News+ Food. This upcoming section within Apple News+ will allow users to search and save recipes from numerous publishing partners, showcasing Apple’s continued diversification of its services and content offerings. The Impact of Smart Notification Management : Benefits and Future Implications The introduction of ‘Priority Notifications’ in iOS 18.4 signals a significant step forward in Notification Management . By leveraging Apple Intelligence , Apple is directly addressing the growing concern of notification overload and its impact on user focus and productivity. This feature offers several key benefits: Enhanced Focus and Productivity: By minimizing distractions from unimportant notifications, users can better concentrate on their tasks, leading to increased productivity. Reduced Digital Fatigue: Constant notification bombardment can lead to digital fatigue and stress. ‘Priority Notifications’ helps alleviate this by filtering out the noise. Improved User Experience: A more organized and intelligent notification system contributes to a smoother and more enjoyable user experience on iPhones. Potential for Further AI Integration: ‘Priority Notifications’ is likely just the beginning. We can expect to see even more sophisticated AI-powered features integrated into iPhone Notifications and other aspects of iOS in the future. As Apple Intelligence continues to evolve, features like ‘Priority Notifications’ will become increasingly refined and personalized, adapting to individual user needs and preferences. This move towards intelligent automation in Notification Management is not just a convenience; it’s a crucial step in creating a more user-centric and less disruptive mobile experience. Embrace the Future of iPhone Notifications with iOS 18.4 With iOS 18.4 and ‘Priority Notifications,’ Apple is handing users the reins to master their digital world. This Apple Intelligence -powered feature is poised to redefine how we interact with our iPhones, moving away from notification chaos towards a more controlled and focused experience. By intelligently filtering and prioritizing alerts, ‘Priority Notifications’ promises to be a valuable tool for anyone seeking to reclaim their attention and enhance their digital well-being. Keep an eye out for the public release of iOS 18.4 to experience this transformative feature firsthand and unlock the full potential of smart Notification Management .

40669776,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132991,1740196228,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealing Court Documents: Meta’s Risky AI Training Tactics Using Copyrighted Content,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-risky-ai-copyright-content/,"In a startling revelation shaking the foundations of AI ethics, court documents unsealed this week expose internal discussions at Meta regarding the use of copyrighted materials for training their cutting-edge AI models. This news arrives amidst growing concerns in the cryptocurrency and tech world about the ethical sourcing of data powering artificial intelligence. As blockchain technology grapples with its own copyright and intellectual property challenges, this case throws a spotlight on the broader AI landscape and its potential pitfalls. Are tech giants like Meta pushing the boundaries of legality in their relentless pursuit of AI dominance? The Heart of the Matter: Meta’s AI Training Data Dilemma The lawsuit, Kadrey v. Meta , is a landmark case in the burgeoning field of AI copyright law. Plaintiffs, including prominent authors Sarah Silverman and Ta-Nehisi Coates, are challenging Meta’s assertion of “fair use” when it comes to training AI models on copyrighted books. Previous filings indicated CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s approval for using copyrighted works and a halt to licensing talks. However, these newly unsealed documents provide a far more granular and concerning look into Meta’s internal strategies. They consist largely of internal work chats between Meta employees, painting a vivid picture of how the tech giant might have incorporated copyrighted data into models like the Llama family. Let’s break down the key revelations from these court filings: “Ask Forgiveness, Not Permission” Mentality: A Meta research engineer, Xavier Martinet, explicitly suggested an “ask forgiveness, not permission” approach to acquiring books for Meta AI training data . This suggests a deliberate strategy to bypass traditional licensing and risk potential legal repercussions later. Retail Ebooks as Training Sets: Martinet proposed purchasing ebooks at retail price to circumvent licensing agreements with publishers, highlighting a potential loophole exploitation strategy for gathering copyrighted content AI training material. Dismissal of Legal Risks: Despite acknowledging the potential for legal challenges, Martinet downplayed these concerns by pointing to the likely widespread use of “pirated books” by AI startups. This reveals a potentially reckless attitude towards copyright law within Meta’s AI research teams. Libgen and the Pursuit of State-of-the-Art AI Models Perhaps the most alarming revelation is the discussion around using Libgen, a notorious “links aggregator” known for providing access to copyrighted works. Internal communications reveal that some Meta decision-makers considered Libgen “essential to meet SOTA numbers” (State-of-the-Art) for their AI models. Sony Theakanath, a Meta product management director, emphasized Libgen’s importance for achieving top-tier AI performance. This underscores the immense pressure within Meta to compete at the highest levels of AI development, even if it means venturing into legally murky territories to acquire Libgen AI data . To mitigate potential legal fallout from using sources like Libgen, Meta reportedly considered these “mitigations”: Data Scrubbing: Removing data from Libgen that was “clearly marked as pirated/stolen.” However, the effectiveness of such a superficial scrubbing process in addressing underlying copyright issues remains questionable. Non-Disclosure: Concealing the use of Libgen datasets in public disclosures about their AI models. This raises serious questions about transparency and ethical reporting in AI development. “IP Risky Prompts” and Data Scarcity Further complicating matters, the filings suggest Meta tuned its models to avoid “IP risky prompts.” This involved programming models to refuse requests that might directly reveal their training data sources or reproduce copyrighted content verbatim, such as asking for excerpts from copyrighted books. This reactive measure highlights an awareness of the legal sensitivities surrounding their AI model training lawsuit but also points to a potentially superficial approach to addressing the core copyright concerns. Moreover, the documents indicate that Meta’s leadership considered “overriding” previous decisions against using certain data sources, including Quora content and licensed books, due to a perceived need for “more data.” Chaya Nayak, a Meta product management director, stated that first-party data from Facebook and Instagram was insufficient, revealing a potential data scarcity problem driving the exploration of ethically and legally questionable data acquisition methods. What Does This Mean for the Future of AI and Copyright? Meta’s aggressive stance, evidenced by hiring Supreme Court litigators for their defense team, signals the high stakes involved in this legal battle. The outcome of Kadrey v. Meta could set significant precedents for how copyrighted content AI training is legally viewed and regulated in the future. For the cryptocurrency community and the broader tech world, this case serves as a critical reminder of the ethical and legal complexities intertwined with rapid AI advancement. Here are some key takeaways: Legal Precedent: The case could establish crucial legal boundaries for the use of copyrighted material in AI training. Ethical Implications: It raises profound ethical questions about data sourcing, transparency, and the responsibilities of AI developers. Industry Impact: The outcome could significantly influence how AI companies approach data acquisition and licensing in the future. Transparency Concerns: The revelations about non-disclosure of data sources highlight the need for greater transparency in AI development practices. As the legal proceedings unfold, the world watches to see if Meta’s pursuit of AI innovation will be deemed “fair use” or a reckless disregard for copyright law. The implications for the future of AI development and the rights of content creators are immense.

Crypto fund manager Canary Capital is making waves once again in the digital asset investment space. They’ve just submitted an amended S-1 form to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a highly anticipated exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks HBAR, the native cryptocurrency of the innovative Hedera Network. This development, spotlighted by Bloomberg’s ETF expert Eric Balchunas on X, signals a significant step forward in bringing HBAR closer to mainstream investment avenues. Could this be the breakthrough the Hedera community has been waiting for? Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development. What’s the Buzz Around the HBAR ETF Filing? For those unfamiliar, an S-1 form is a crucial document in the U.S. It’s the initial registration statement that companies must file with the SEC before they can offer securities, like an ETF, to the public. Canary Capital’s amended S-1 filing indicates they are actively pursuing the launch of an HBAR ETF , a financial product that would allow investors to gain exposure to HBAR without directly holding the cryptocurrency itself. This is a big deal because ETFs can make investing in crypto more accessible to a wider range of investors, including institutional players who often prefer regulated and familiar investment vehicles. This isn’t Canary Capital’s first rodeo with crypto ETFs. They previously navigated a similar process for a Litecoin (LTC) ETF, showcasing their experience in this complex regulatory landscape. However, it’s important to note that while the amended S-1 is a positive step, a Form 19b-4, which is also required for ETF approval and is filed by the exchange listing the ETF, has not yet been submitted for the HBAR ETF . This means there are still regulatory hurdles to clear before the ETF can become a reality. Why is a Crypto ETF a Game Changer? Crypto ETFs represent a significant evolution in the cryptocurrency market. They bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning world of digital assets. Here’s why they are considered so important: Accessibility: ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible to retail investors through brokerage accounts they already use. No need to navigate crypto exchanges or worry about wallet security. Regulation and Security: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering investors a sense of security and oversight that may be lacking in the often-unregulated crypto space. Diversification: A crypto ETF focused on HBAR would allow investors to diversify their portfolios and gain exposure to the potential of the Hedera Network without needing to invest directly in HBAR and manage private keys. Institutional Investment: Many institutional investors are restricted from directly holding cryptocurrencies. ETFs provide a compliant and familiar way for them to enter the crypto market, potentially bringing significant capital inflows. Hedera Network: The Foundation of the HBAR ETF At the heart of this ETF buzz is the Hedera Network, a public distributed ledger platform that positions itself as a faster, more secure, and more energy-efficient alternative to traditional blockchains. Hedera Network utilizes Hashgraph, a patented distributed ledger technology, which offers several key advantages: Feature Hedera Hashgraph Traditional Blockchain Transaction Speed Thousands of transactions per second Slower, often single-digit TPS Transaction Cost Low, fixed fees Variable, often higher fees Energy Efficiency Highly energy-efficient More energy-intensive Security Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) Probabilistic finality in some cases HBAR, the native cryptocurrency of Hedera Network , fuels the ecosystem and is used for network services like transactions, smart contracts, and file storage. The network has been gaining traction with various real-world applications, from supply chain management to decentralized identity solutions, making an ETF tracking its performance an increasingly appealing prospect for investors. Canary Capital’s Strategic Move in the Crypto Space Canary Capital ‘s persistent efforts to launch crypto ETFs, starting with Litecoin and now HBAR, highlight their strategic vision for the future of digital asset investment. Their amended S-1 for the HBAR ETF, following their initial filing in November, demonstrates their commitment and belief in the long-term potential of both HBAR and the broader crypto market. By proactively navigating the complex SEC regulatory process, Canary Capital is positioning itself as a key player in bringing innovative crypto investment products to market. The fact that they are following a similar process to their Litecoin ETF application could suggest a degree of familiarity and potentially increased efficiency in their approach. However, the SEC’s stance on crypto ETFs remains cautious, and the absence of a Form 19b-4 filing for the HBAR ETF underscores that regulatory approval is not guaranteed. The crypto community will be watching closely for further developments. What’s Next for the Anticipated HBAR ETF? The submission of the amended S-1 is undoubtedly a positive step, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. The next key milestone to watch for is the filing of the Form 19b-4 by an exchange seeking to list the HBAR ETF . This form essentially requests permission from the SEC for the exchange to list and trade the ETF shares. Once both the S-1 and 19b-4 are under review, the SEC will then assess whether the proposed ETF meets the necessary regulatory requirements for investor protection and market integrity. The timeline for SEC review and potential approval is uncertain and can vary significantly. The crypto ETF landscape in the U.S. is still evolving, and while there’s growing optimism, regulatory hurdles remain. However, Canary Capital’s continued efforts and the increasing institutional interest in crypto suggest that the path towards a crypto ETF for HBAR, and potentially other digital assets, is gradually becoming clearer. Conclusion: A Hopeful Sign for HBAR and Crypto ETFs Canary Capital’s amended S-1 filing for an HBAR ETF is a significant development that injects renewed optimism into the crypto market, particularly for the Hedera community. It represents a tangible step towards greater accessibility and mainstream adoption of HBAR. While regulatory approval is not a certainty and further steps are needed, this move underscores the growing momentum behind crypto ETFs and the increasing recognition of digital assets as a legitimate investment class.

However the signing message was to change… — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 21, 2025 “However, the signing message was to change the smart contract logic of our ETH cold wallet,” posited Zhou. “[The] hacker took control of the specific ETH cold wallet we signed and transferred all ETH in the cold wallet to this unidentified address.” Shortly afterward, Zhou reassured users and the broader crypto industry that it would be able to deal with the loss. “Bybit is solvent even if this hack loss is not recovered, all of clients’ assets are 1 to 1 backed, we can cover the loss,” he wrote , adding that all other cold wallets were secure and withdrawals were normal. Flashbots strategy head Hasu also observed on X that the hack has not doomed Bybit. “If you want my serious take, Bybit has way more than 1.4 billion of revenue per year,” Hasu opined . “They are good for the money and will make all customers whole. It doesn’t matter for ETH because Bybit will honor customers’ ETH liabilities and buy back the assets on the open market.” Biggest Crypto Hack In History The amount stolen from Bybit on Friday is enormous, even by crypto standards. Decentralized finance (DeFi) commentator Patrick Scott said on X that the hack represents “16% of ALL previous crypto hacks.” This Bybit exploit is the largest of all time, representing 16% of ALL previous crypto hacks. pic.twitter.com/XWs6xZvmdm — Patrick Scott | Dynamo DeFi (@Dynamo_Patrick) February 21, 2025 In 2024, Japanese-headquartered exchange DMM fell victim to the largest crypto hack of that year when hackers pilfered Bitcoin worth over $300 million at the time. Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX was hacked for over $475 million in 2022. Meanwhile, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao has offered to help Bybit while also recommending that the exchange should pause withdrawals as a security measure. “Not an easy situation to deal with. Might suggest to halt all withdrawals for a bit as a standard security precaution. Will provide any assistance if needed.

There has been widespread criticism amongst certain sectors that Ethereum is not doing enough to support blockchain casinos. Buterin responded that he would leave the crypto space if such a “moral reversal” occurred and that the very notion of a crypto casino goes against his fundamental beliefs. “Perhaps the most disappointing thing for me recently,” says Buterin, “was when someone said that Ethereum is bad and intolerant because we don’t respect the ‘casinos’ on the blockchain enough, and other chains are happy to accept any application, so they are better.” This comes at a critical time for the Ethereum Foundation. Buterin has suggested neutrality for the application layer and only limited support for specific projects. Financial concerns have consumed many discussions about the Foundation. Pure neutrality at the application layer would allow for more gambling. A more limited approach, conversely, would allow the Ethereum Foundation to uphold their own ethical standards, while making calculated and frugal decisions regarding funds. Buterin expressed disappointment at the online meetings, noticing an over-focus on issues such as crypto gambling. But he conceded that when he meets people in person they often express similar views to him, having a moral focus on the issue of casinos, rather than a purely financial concern. There may be other issues that Buterin is addressing by targeting online casinos. He may be taking a swipe at other tokens like Solana that have promoted meme coins without restraint. There may be other so-called ‘Ethereum killer’ tokens that Buterin is taking a swipe at. Perhaps the ‘ethical approach’, according to this perspective at least, is a case of sour grapes. The Ethereum price, after all, has been struggling in comparison to other tokens. This all comes as the Ethereum Foundation changes its strategy concerning funding, responding to concerns of the community that the foundation should fund projects with decentralized finance instead of merely selling Ethereum tokens. The foundation responded to this request by allocating 45,000 ETH, valued at $120 million, to defi solutions. This would involve funding platforms like Compound. The community agreed to the measures proposed.",Ethereum|News|Ethereum News|Vitalik Buterin,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-22 04:09:19

This new challenger is fast rising with a project introduced with what has been dubbed the best crypto presale of 2025. This project delivers a PayFi solution that is quicker, easier to use and attracts lesser fees. This disruptor, Remittix (RTX) , has entered the PayFi market, making a resounding statement by enabling users to convert crypto to FIAT while making transfers to bank accounts worldwide with full control and anonymity. Remittix Presents the Best Crypto Presale of 2025 Backed by a rapidly growing community, massive investor influx and tangible real-world utilities, Remittix is fast gaining a hefty portion of the global payments market and competing with established players. Its success speaks for itself, as the project’s presale has now raised over $12.6 million, and investor interest continues to increase astronomically. This achievement explains why investors say it has all the makings to become the best crypto presale of 2025 RTX tokens are currently selling at $0.0628, making this a perfect time for early investors hoping to get in before the price rises further. Key Drivers Behind Remittix’s Thriving Adoption Seamless Crypto-to-FIAT Conversion and Transfers Despite the spike in the rate of crypto adoption lately, processing times for converting digital assets into FIAT haven’t improved while remaining pricey and mostly inefficient. With traditional exchange platforms, you battle high charges, lengthy withdrawal times, and cross-border transfers that feel just as restrictive as conventional banking systems. Businesses also have to deal with volatility, liquidity challenges, and the intricacies of crypto payment settlements. Enters Remittix, a new project that is getting rid of these hindrances. The PayFi platform facilitates users to instantly convert over 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT and send funds directly to any global bank account in their preferred currency. Remittix users do not experience unexpected fees when transacting. They also enjoy full control over their money as there are no intermediaries. Users also stay anonymous when making these payments. Remittix has introduced a simple, seamless and efficient way to leverage crypto for everyday people. Finally, with Remittix, users can send crypto assets globally and their payments get reflected in their preferred FIAT currency that same day, without the additional charges or delays. Global Remittance Ease With Uncompromised Privacy While financial privacy has become more difficult to come by in the modern financial market, no thanks to banks and payment intermediaries getting increasingly scrutinized, Remittix comes with a discreet alternative that replaces traditional payment services lacking privacy. Remittix guarantees that your payment recipients get a standard bank transfer alert that reveals no trace of the payment coming from a crypto source. This process allows users to easily move their funds without having to endure invasive financial tracking. Remittix Presale Capital Soars Past $12.6 Million Remittix (RTX) is the new kid on the block, having raised over $12.6 million in only a few weeks of its record-breaking presale . As the current phase sells out fast, savvy investors can start accumulating their share of the promising RTX tokens for an affordable price of $0.0628. Thanks to the innovative upgrade this project brings to crypto-to-FIAT transactions, analysts dub its ICO the best crypto presale this year. They also predict it will deliver 800% price returns before the presale ends, with more profits expected as the project gains widespread acceptance and usage.

Among the many emerging and established cryptos, Qubetics ($TICS), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Bittensor TAO (TAO) stand out. These digital currencies aren’t just numbers on a screen—they have massive growth potential. The big question is: Which of these top cryptos will skyrocket in 2025 and beyond? Well, the answer lies in their unique use cases and market strategies. Qubetics ($TICS) is currently in its presale stage, catching eyes with its innovative solutions for cross-border transactions. It has already raised more than $13.5 million and sold over 483 million tokens, which speaks volumes about its growth trajectory. On the other hand, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) continues to maintain its place in the crypto landscape due to its low-cost and fast transaction capabilities. Bittensor TAO (TAO) is also a fascinating option, as its decentralized machine learning framework positions it as a unique crypto player. Together, they make up an exciting trio of cryptocurrencies ready for massive growth. But here’s where it gets really interesting: Qubetics isn’t just offering another digital currency for transactions—it’s solving real-world problems in the crypto space. From simplifying cross-border transactions for individuals and businesses alike, to providing scalability and efficiency, Qubetics is built to address the challenges that Bitcoin Cash and Bittensor TAO haven’t fully tackled yet. As these projects continue to develop, it’ll explore how each can pave the way for the future of digital finance. Qubetics ($TICS): Solving Real-World Problems with Blockchain Tech Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency—it’s the next level of blockchain technology. Currently in its 22nd stage of presale, Qubetics has already sold over 483 million tokens, raising more than $13.5 million. And with over 20,800 holders already on board, it’s clear that this project is heating up. So, what’s all the buzz about? One of the biggest challenges in the global economy today is the inefficiency of cross-border transactions. Whether you’re a business, a freelancer, or an individual, sending money across borders can be costly, slow, and riddled with intermediaries. Qubetics aims to change that by providing a more streamlined, affordable solution. With a focus on cross-border transactions, Qubetics is creating a platform that enables businesses and individuals to send money quickly and with minimal fees. For many people, this feature is a game-changer, especially in the age of remote work and international business. What makes Qubetics different from others like Bitcoin Cash and Bittensor TAO is its emphasis on solving real-life problems. Bitcoin Cash might be fast, but its use in cross-border payments still involves certain limitations in scalability and transaction fees. Bittensor TAO, while innovative, is more focused on decentralized machine learning rather than optimizing cross-border payment systems. Qubetics ($TICS), however, bridges that gap with its blockchain solution that simplifies and speeds up cross-border transactions while ensuring security and transparency. At $0.08073 per token in this best crypto presale , many analysts are predicting substantial ROI once the presale ends, with expectations of $1 after the presale and possibly $5 post-mainnet launch. Imagine the potential here—over 6093% ROI if it reaches $5, which could create a serious buzz in the crypto space. Bitcoin Cash (BCH): Keeping Speed and Low Costs at the Forefront Bitcoin Cash (BCH) was born from a hard fork of the original Bitcoin network, designed to address scalability issues and reduce transaction fees. By increasing the block size, Bitcoin Cash has been able to process transactions more efficiently compared to Bitcoin (BTC), making it a popular choice for day-to-day payments. But despite its clear advantages, BCH has its own set of challenges. One of the biggest factors that affect Bitcoin Cash’s adoption is competition. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Binance Coin, and even newer projects like Qubetics are vying for the top spot, offering similar or superior solutions for fast, low-cost transactions. Still, Bitcoin Cash continues to be one of the most widely used and traded altcoins, especially for those who need to make quick transactions across borders without high fees. In the face of emerging competitors, Bitcoin Cash has focused on improving scalability and expanding its network to ensure that it remains a viable alternative to traditional financial systems. Bitcoin Cash’s low transaction fees and fast speeds make it a solid contender in the world of payment-based cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin Cash is not without its hurdles. As the market evolves, Bitcoin Cash will need to continue innovating and adapting to the changes brought on by new technologies like Qubetics. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin Cash has shown resilience in maintaining its status as a top cryptocurrency. With steady growth and a dedicated user base, BCH is expected to remain a significant player in the crypto space for the foreseeable future. Bittensor TAO (TAO): Machine Learning Meets Decentralization Bittensor TAO (TAO) is a unique cryptocurrency that focuses on decentralized machine learning. It’s designed to allow developers to build and share machine learning models in a decentralized network, opening up opportunities for innovation in AI and blockchain. The project’s primary focus is to create a more open, scalable, and efficient way of training and deploying machine learning models, making it a highly technical yet incredibly promising blockchain solution. While Bittensor TAO is a fascinating concept, it faces a different challenge than Bitcoin Cash or Qubetics—adoption. The world of decentralized machine learning is still in its infancy, and while the potential for revolutionizing AI is immense, it may take time for Bittensor TAO to achieve widespread use. Bittensor TAO’s price and demand fluctuate based on the interest in decentralized machine learning, and its growth will largely depend on the success of its technology in attracting developers and companies to its network. The machine learning space is already competitive, with giants like Google and OpenAI leading the charge in AI development, so Bittensor TAO will need to find a unique niche to succeed in the crowded space. However, the potential for Bittensor TAO is clear. The ability to decentralize AI training and development could reshape industries, from healthcare to finance to entertainment. As move forward, it’ll likely see more use cases emerge that prove just how disruptive Bittensor TAO can be in the world of machine learning. Cross-Border Transactions: Why They’re Crucial for the Future of Finance Cross-border transactions are one of the most fundamental use cases for cryptocurrency. With traditional banks and financial institutions, sending money across borders can take days and involve steep fees. In contrast, cryptocurrency can make cross-border payments faster, cheaper, and more secure. That’s why projects like Qubetics are so important—they’re not just about offering a new digital currency, but creating a seamless financial ecosystem that addresses the real-world problems of international payments. In today’s global economy, businesses and individuals need a way to send money across borders quickly and efficiently. Cryptocurrency offers a solution to this problem by allowing transactions to be processed in minutes, rather than days. Qubetics aims to make cross-border transactions not only faster but also more accessible, reducing the barriers to entry for people in underbanked regions. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the demand for faster, more affordable cross-border payments will continue to grow. Cryptocurrencies like Qubetics are poised to meet this demand, offering a more efficient solution than traditional financial systems ever could. Conclusion: The Future of Digital Finance The cryptocurrency space is rapidly evolving, and projects like Qubetics, Bitcoin Cash, and Bittensor TAO are leading the charge in redefining how people think about money, transactions, and decentralization. With Qubetics focusing on solving real-world problems like cross-border transactions, Bitcoin Cash remaining a fast and affordable alternative to traditional payment systems, and Bittensor TAO exploring the world of decentralized machine learning, the future of crypto is looking brighter than ever. So, what’s the takeaway here? Qubetics has a unique opportunity to be the solution to a significant global challenge. If you’re looking to invest in a project with top cryptos for massive growth potential, now’s the time to get in on the Qubetics presale.

Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the country is still actively seeking membership in the economic alliance led by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa after decades of being shut out of the European Union. Speaking to Bloomberg on Friday, Fidan confirmed that Turkey is “exploring joining groups including BRICS” because it needs more economic options. “The EU was our first choice,” he said. “If we cannot be part of the EU, then other alternatives are always on the table.” Turkey, while officially a NATO member, has increasingly positioned itself as a neutral power between the East and West. The country has refused to join Western sanctions on Russia and has maintained strong trade and energy ties with Moscow, even as NATO allies criticize its decision-making. Turkey officially applied for BRICS membership in November 2024 but was only given “partner-country status,” a secondary position that does not come with voting rights or full membership benefits. Fidan made it clear that Ankara is not satisfied with that status. “We are interested, but we have not been offered a membership yet,” Fidan said at the G-20 foreign ministers’ summit in Johannesburg, South Africa on Friday. As aforementioned, Turkey’s push toward BRICS is a direct result of its longstanding failure to gain entry into the EU. The country first applied for EU membership in 1987, but its candidacy has been stuck in negotiations for over three decades now. Brussels has repeatedly blocked Ankara’s entry, citing concerns over human rights, democratic standards, and political differences. During his interview , Fidan dismissed those reasons, saying that the real issue is cultural discrimination. Ankara has long accused the EU of deliberately stalling its membership because it is a Muslim-majority nation. Turkey’s push for multilateral action is reflected in its approach to Africa, where it has forged ties with countries like Somalia on counterterrorism. “Turkey is offering an opportunity for some African countries,” Fidan said. The BRICS expansion and de-dollarization The BRICS group has added five new members in the past year, including Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Indonesia. Saudi Arabia has also been invited but has not made a final decision yet. Turkey, along with Malaysia and Thailand, is one of the latest nations who want to join the group. Fidan told Bloomberg that: “In the modern world, no one country can alone overcome economic and political issues. Self-help is on the menu for every nation-state.” Turkey is particularly interested in BRICS’s financial cooperation, which includes efforts to reduce reliance on the US dollar in global trade. The bloc has been pushing for de-dollarization, with many members already settling oil and trade transactions in their local currencies instead of the dollar. This has drawn a direct response from Donald Trump, who will return to the White House in 2025. US President Donald Trump has threatened economic retaliation against any country that ditches the greenback. “The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is OVER. We are going to require a commitment from these seemingly hostile countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty US dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US economy,” Trump said in a Truth Social post even before he won the Nov. 5 elections. Russia and China, the two leading voices in BRICS, have been the biggest drivers of de-dollarization. Moscow, which has been cut off from Western financial systems due to US sanctions, is pushing for a BRICS-based cross-border payment system that would operate outside Washington’s influence. The New Development Bank (NDB), the BRICS-led financial institution, has also ramped up lending. Since its launch in 2015, the bank has approved nearly $33 billion in loans, focusing on infrastructure and development projects in member states. But that figure is still much lower than the World Bank’s $117.5 billion in commitments for 2024. BRICS’s ultimate goal is to create a multipolar world order, moving power away from the United States and Europe. China, in particular, has been actively pulling Global South nations into its economic orbit to challenge Western financial dominance. But the expansion has created tensions within BRICS itself as India is against it, in fears that it would turn into a pro-China alliance. Brazil was hesitant too, worried about damaging its carefully-cultivated ties with the US and Europe. When Biden was president, Russia was the leading voice behind sticking it to America, but Trump’s win might’ve messed with that plan as presidents Putin and Trump rekindle their friendship, so the former said he was no longer interested in dethroning USD.

Trump’s Statement on Cryptocurrency and the SEC A video attached to a tweet from crypto enthusiast JackTheRippler featured Trump discussing the treatment of cryptocurrency under the Biden administration. In his remarks, Trump criticized regulatory agencies, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for a “hostile” approach toward digital assets. He claimed that these agencies engaged in politically motivated indictments and only softened their stance near the end of Biden’s term due to the large number of cryptocurrency users. Trump suggested that his intervention helped many individuals who were facing legal scrutiny, stating, “I saved your life,” about those who were indicted. He framed his actions as part of a broader effort to position the United States at the forefront of technological innovation, particularly in AI and blockchain. BREAKING: Donald Trump says: “I have signed executive orders to keep the United States at the forefront of artificial intelligence and to end Joe Biden's war on Bitcoin and crypto. We ended that war totally, that war is over!” The SEC v. RIPPLE case is coming to an end! #XRP pic.twitter.com/SEUlSCafWE — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) February 20, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Implications for the SEC v. Ripple Case One of the key takeaways from JackTheRippler’s tweet was the suggestion that the SEC v. Ripple case may soon end. The lawsuit, which began in December 2020, revolves around the SEC’s allegations that Ripple conducted an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP. The case has had significant implications for the regulatory landscape of digital assets. Both investors and industry participants highly anticipate its resolution. While Trump did not directly reference the SEC v. Ripple case in his remarks, his strong criticism of the agency’s actions suggests that regulatory policies could shift if he returned to office. The SEC’s treatment of cryptocurrency firms, including Ripple , has been a contentious issue, with many in the industry calling for clearer and more favorable regulations. Potential Impact on Crypto Policy Trump’s announcement signals a potential departure from the current regulatory stance on digital assets. His remarks suggest that, under his leadership, cryptocurrency could receive more government support and fewer regulatory restrictions. If this policy shift materializes, it could encourage innovation, attract institutional investors, and provide greater clarity for blockchain-based projects operating in the U.S. However, it remains to be seen how these executive orders will be implemented and what specific actions will follow. Given the complex regulatory landscape and ongoing legal battles, including the SEC v. Ripple case, the cryptocurrency community watches closely for further developments.

The shared chart focuses on historical resistance levels, Fibonacci extension points, and a multi-phase Parabolic Arc formation. XRP Eyes $6—But This Key Level Stands In The Way Egrag Crypto’s chart shows XRP trading near $2.67, coming off a notable bullish surge but now contending with a red horizontal band between roughly $2.75 and $3.00. The upper boundary at $3.00 holds dual significance: it marks a psychologically important level and also corresponds to a critical area from previous cycle peaks. A monthly close above this line would strongly suggest a bullish continuation, potentially setting the stage for a move toward the next Fibonacci extension marks. “XRP current price action is trading at $2.67, showing a strong bullish move but facing resistance at the red horizontal zone (~$2.75-$2.83-$2.910 and $3.00),” Egrag states. The analyst particularly highlights Fib 1.414 near $4.30 and Fib 1.618 around $6.40 as the next barriers if $3.00 is decisively broken. A volume surge would strengthen the bullish case and provide extra confirmation for the run to unfold. Related Reading: XRP Price Consolidation Completed: Will Wave 3 Propel Prices Beyond The $5 Barrier? Failure to overtake $3.00, however, could trigger a correction back into the $1.90–$2.00 support region identified by earlier candle closes. Egrag Crypto notes that if $1.90 fails to hold, a more extensive drop toward $0.90–$1.00 could ensue, which the analyst labels as a potential “Black Swan” scenario likely driven by broader market turmoil rather than XRP-specific weakness. Egrag writes: “Breaking below $1.90 could shift sentiment to bearish, introducing downside risks toward the $0.90-$1.00 range. This would signal a potential Black Swan event across all markets! Such a collapse would be a challenging prelude before the ignition stage for XRP. Honestly, I don’t favor this scenario, as it would be stressful for all of us, including many OGs. Could the upcoming fort knox auditing be the catalyst for this Black Swan.” Related Reading: Pundit Who Correctly Predicted XRP Price Crash To $2.5 Says Demand Zone Will Send It Soaring In the long term, the chart presents three sweeping parabolic arcs—colored yellow, green, and blue—which suggest that XRP may be building a broad-scale bullish structure. Price targets in the $33–$60 range reflect these arcs and channel extensions, though much hinges on whether a monthly close above $3.00 can usher in sustained momentum. Beyond the $6.40 level at Fib 1.618, Egrag Crypto identifies additional Fibonacci-related checkpoints, such as $8, $13, $27, and $67 (Fib 1.888). These higher levels would remain speculative until XRP clears the nearer hurdles and demonstrates stable volume influx and price structure. “Volume and momentum confirmation would be crucial in the[se] coming phases,” he adds. While the path forward depends on technical breakouts, Egrag Crypto underscores that near-term movement around $3.00 will be pivotal for setting the tone. A successful break above resistance could confirm targets in the $4–$6 window, and eventually open the door to the lofty parabolic objectives. At press time, XRP traded at $2.6198.

One such asset is Ondo (ONDO), the native token of the Ondo ecosystem. It is a decentralized finance (DeFi) network that leverages blockchain technology to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs). ONDO Dominates RWAs Space According to a tweet by the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, ONDO is currently dominating the real-world assets space. The asset has outperformed most RWA tokens and has the highest transaction volume. $ONDO is dominating the RWA space, posting the highest transaction volume and significantly outperforming other tokens, even in the current sluggish market pic.twitter.com/j7KV79dL1K — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) February 19, 2025 IntoTheBlock data shows Ondo’s transaction volume hovering close to $300 million, compared to other projects whose numbers are less than $40 million. A few weeks ago, Ondo’s transaction volume spiked to roughly $450 million before a steep plunge that saw the metric hover around $200 million. However, it has begun to rise again and is well on its way to smashing the $300 million mark. Although ONDO dominates transaction volumes, the same cannot be said for asset prices. As the fifth-largest RWA by market cap, ONDO was worth $1.23 at the time of writing, recording a slight uptick in the past 24 hours. The asset was down 7% weekly and 6% monthly, according to data from CoinMarketCap. ONDO is among the most visited tokens on CoinMarketCap, but the asset still lacks the daily and monthly momentum seen among its rivals. Ondo Records Significant Developments Nevertheless, the Ondo project has recorded several developments lately. The team recently unveiled the Ondo Chain, a layer-1 blockchain built for institutional-grade RWAs. The developers said Ondo Chain was built to end the lack of features necessary for regulated assets to thrive on-chain. The new network aims to crush infrastructure barriers for tokenized regulated securities. The barriers include incompatibility with DeFi, cross-chain liquidity fragmentation, high and volatile transaction fees, and inadequate security. Ondo Chain combines the openness of public blockchains with the compliance and security features of permissioned networks. Besides the introduction of the Ondo Chain, Ondo Finance recently secured a strategic collaboration with the U.S. President Donald Trump-backed DeFi protocol, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), to accelerate the adoption of tokenized RWAs. The alliance sees WLFI exploring the integration of Ondo’s tokenized assets into the WLFI network as treasury reserve assets.

Primarily against Bybit’s recent $1.4 billion hack, over $566 million was liquidated across the broader market in the last 24 hours. As a result, BTC price price lost nearly 2% and slipped back to the $96K level on Saturday. Further, ETH and other leading altcoins have also followed the waning trajectory. Crypto Market Today: BTC, ETH & Altcoins Suffer Amid Bybit’s Hack & Massive Liquidations Notably, the crypto exchange behemoth Bybit recently suffered an exploitation attack, resulting in the theft of $1.4 billion ETH from the platform. CoinGape reported that the mastermind behind this hack was ‘The Lazarus Group ,’ a North Korean cybercriminal organization. As a response to the hack, the crypto market saw $566.64 liquidated in the last 24 hours, per Coinglass data. The massive liquidations, underscoring panic selling, in turn brought significant heat to cryptocurrency prices. Further, the global cryptocurrency market cap slipped 1.98% from yesterday to reach $3.17 trillion. BTC Price Backtracks To $96K In sync with the colossal liquidations, BTC price witnessed a 2% loss in value over the past 24 hours, resting at $96,170. The flagship coin’s intraday bottom and peak were $94,852.96 and $99,497.97, respectively. Coinglass data showed that Bitcoin recorded $199.44 million worth of liquidations in the past 24 hours. Simultaneously, its market dominance slipped marginally by 0.01% to 60.29%. ETH Price Takes Heat Amid Crypto Market’s New Hack ETH price tanked nearly 3% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $2,674. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $2,616.92 and $2,842.83, respectively. Ethereum recorded liquidations worth $141.76 million in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, market watchers remain cautious about the coin’s future movements in light of the massive Bybit hack. Given that the hackers decide to sell the stolen funds ahead, heightened selling pressure could pull the price further down. XRP Price Cracks 3% XRP price fell by 3% intraday and is now sitting at $2.57. The coin hit a bottom and peak of $2.51 and $2.71 in the last 24 hours. Notably, the Ripple-backed asset saw liquidations worth $14.95 million over the past day and followed the broader market trend to dip in the red zone. SOL Price Slips 2% SOL price saw a 2% decline in the past 24 hours and is now trading at $170. The coin swooped to a low of $167.31 and a high of $180.43 in the last 24 hours. Solana recorded liquidations worth $22.24 million intraday, aligning with the market trend. Meme Crypto Market Also Tumbles Dogecoin: DOGE price saw a 4% drop to $0.2417 amid $14.03 million liquidated in the Dogecoin market. Shiba Inu : SHIB price waned by 2% in the past 24 hours and is currently trading at $0.00001516, mirroring the market trend. Even Pepe Coin (PEPE) and Official Trump (TRUMP) prices cracked 2%-5%, reaching $0.000009188 and $16.08, respectively. The meme coin market has primarily mirrored the broader market trend as the week comes to a close.

The coin has erased all the gains made in the last seven days and is down by more than 8%. According to analysts, the immediate support zone might be used as a foundation for a rally if the price continues to hold strong. There are two possible scenarios for XRP’s price movements: one where it could be nearing the end of a correction, or another where it might be starting a new phase of upward movement. The First Scenario: A Correction Almost Done? In this scenario, XRP might have completed its correction phase and is ready to begin moving higher. After a significant price drop on February 3, the market saw a rally and a subsequent pullback. If this correction has now finished, we could see XRP start moving upwards again, potentially pushing the price to new all-time highs. If this scenario plays out, price could expect the price to rise towards $3.40, which was the previous high point. However, this scenario will be invalid if the price falls below the critical level of $2.47 or the support zone at $2.52. The Second Scenario: A Deeper Pullback Ahead In the second scenario, XRP might still be in the middle of a deeper correction, and the price could fall even further before resuming its upward trend. In this case, the price might find support at levels around $2.22, $2.10, or even $1.95. If the price breaks below $2.52, this would confirm that the price is in the midst of a deeper pullback. If this happens, we could see the price target in the $2.26 to $2.31 range before any recovery begins.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 05:04:56

Bybit CEO Allegation A recent controversy stems from Ben Zhou’s comments , who pointed to a 2023 warning from Chinese police that called Pi Network a scam. The police said Pi Network targeted elderly people, collected their data, and caused financial losses, including their pensions. Additionally, Zhou also denied claims about Bybit and Pi Network.

Just as Coinbase celebrated the SEC dropping its lawsuit, Bybit got drained of $1.5 billion, the biggest crypto theft ever recorded. The Dubai-based exchange, which handles $36 billion in daily trades, confirmed the breach almost immediately as CEO Ben Zhou shared via a post on X that hackers took over an Ethereum cold wallet and emptied it into an unknown address. The hack of course shook Bitcoin up a bit as it tumbled by over 3% from $98,000 to around $96,000, according to data from CoinGecko. The Bybit hack is now fueling concerns about crypto security under deregulation. With the SEC pulling back, exchanges are facing fewer compliance checks, making them easier targets for hackers. Hilary Allen, a professor at American University, warned , “Deregulated markets sound good until you have this type of attack. In the short term, we are seeing a lot of cheering for the peeling away of a lot of regulations. But be careful what you wish for.” Meanwhile, on-chain detective ZachXBT has since traced the stolen Ethereum of Bybit to wallets linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. The notorious state-sponsored cybercrime unit has been responsible for some of the biggest crypto heists in history, including the $235 million WazirX attack and $50 million Radiant Capital breach. Lazarus follows a long-term laundering process, making fund recovery nearly impossible. They convert stolen tokens to Ethereum, swap it for Bitcoin, and mix transactions before cashing out through Chinese OTC brokers. The process can take years, and in some cases, Lazarus has been known to sit on stolen funds for over six years before moving them. Even though Bybit secured a loan to cover withdrawals, it still has to pay it back. The stolen funds are gone for good, which means Bybit will be forced to buy Ethereum on the market to settle its debts. That creates an unusual dynamic: Bybit’s buy pressure could push ETH prices up, while Lazarus dumps ETH for Bitcoin, keeping downward pressure on BTC over time. For traders, that means Ethereum may hold steady, but Bitcoin could face long-term sell pressure as North Korea slowly cashes out its gains. Bybit faces a bank run run on withdrawals Crypto traders noticed unusual outflows from Bybit before the company even made an announcement. Soon after his statement, Zhou went live on X to properly address the community. “Hacker took control of the specific ETH cold wallet we signed and transferred all ETH in the cold wallet to this unidentified address,” Zhou said. Bitget CEO Gracy Chen downplayed the impact, saying in Chinese that: “Bybit is a respectable competitor and partner. Although the loss this time is huge, it is only their annual profit. I believe that customer funds are 100% safe. There is no need to panic or run on the bank. Come on, Ben!” By then, panic had set in. Bybit faced a massive bank run, receiving 350,000 withdrawal requests within 10 hours. The flood of exits outpaced the platform’s processing speed, leaving 2,100 requests stuck in the queue as Bybit’s team worked through the night. Even though Bybit had $16.2 billion in reserves, losing $1.5 billion in Ethereum and derivatives meant 9% of its total assets were wiped out. Zhou kept reassuring users that the exchange was solvent, but traders were not taking chances. With billions gone, Bybit had to act fast to avoid insolvency fears. Rival exchange Bitget stepped in with a 40,000 ETH ($106 million) loan to help stabilize withdrawals. Bitget( @bitgetglobal ) transferred 40,000 $ETH ($106M) to Bybit( @Bybit_Official ) as a loan to handle customer withdrawals. https://t.co/FQPc0gSLxX pic.twitter.com/y5BigWoONf — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 22, 2025 Zhou, running on zero sleep, told users, “Since the hack, we have experienced the most number of withdrawals that we have ever seen.” Bybit’s team processed 99.994% of requests, asking customers to “leave a comment if your withdrawal is completed.” Lazarus Group launders funds for North Korea’s weapons program Security experts at Chainalysis say Lazarus funnels stolen crypto into North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile program. The group has been a top target of U.S. and U.N. sanctions, but their methods keep evolving. In 2021 alone, Lazarus stole $400 million from centralized exchanges and investment firms. Interestingly, in terms of dollar value, Bitcoin now accounts for less than one fourth of the cryptos stolen by the hackers. In 2021, only 20% of the stolen funds were Bitcoin, whereas 22% were either ERC-20 tokens or altcoins. And for the first time ever, Ether accounted for a majority of the funds stolen at 58%. The laundering process has grown more complex, with Lazarus using mixers to hide transactions. Chainalysis data shows that in 2019, only 21% of stolen funds were mixed, but by 2021, that number jumped to 65%. Chainalysis said in its report, “Chainalysis has identified $170 million in current balances—representing the stolen funds of 49 separate hacks spanning from 2017 to 2021—that are controlled by North Korea but have yet to be laundered through services.” Meanwhile, Zhou updated the users that, “12 hr from the worst hack in history. ALL withdraws have been processed. Our withdraw system is now fully back to normal pace, you can withdraw any amount and experience no delays. Thanks for your patience and we are sorry that this has happened.” He added that Bybit will come out with full incident report as well as security measurement in the next few days.

The emerging project 1Fuel has gained substantial market attention because of its potential for 100x returns after the crypto presale. Bonuses exceeding 40% remain available before February 23, making this opportunity an ideal chance to maximize substantial returns. Pepe price volatility pushes investors to consider new opportunities Because of its position as a meme coin, Pepe’s price faces huge wide swings, influenced by market sentiment and crypto whales. Investors who hold Pepe for the long term now doubt that the coin will sustain its upward trajectory during the next market boom. The price of Pepe, as depicted on CoinMarketCap, decreased by 39.94%, within the past month, leading traders to change their investment strategies. Industry experts predict that Pepe will encounter difficulties returning to previous price levels unless new significant utility systems and ecosystem innovations become available. Pepe holders are increasingly showing interest in 1Fuel due to its practical usage and successful crypto presale so far. The new project every PEPE investor should consider 1Fuel stands apart from meme coins because it creates a revolutionary crypto infrastructure that simplifies the process of cross-chain transactions. It provides users with a convenient platform to exchange digital assets among networks without needing multiple wallets. The 1Fuel platform prioritizes user privacy through built-in safety features, such as cold storage solutions, which combine with a transaction mixer to provide complete anonymity. PEPE, on the other hand, has not implemented these security measures. The best factor encouraging owners to explore 1Fuel is its exceptional crypto presale offers. This project’s public presale is in stage 4, with $2.3 million raised. Once $2.5 million is raised, it will provide a 20% bonus to all buyers who purchase before February 23. All purchasers will also receive a 40% bonus for all purchases until February 23 and 20% on all purchases to date for the presale target of $3 million. Why 1Fuel could be a 100x opportunity after launch The cryptocurrency field anticipates 1Fuel to turn into one of the top investments of 2024 after launch because analysts predict a 100x price increase following its release. The anticipated growth comes from innovative features like making transactions across networks easy and cost-effective with the help of AI. The platform provides three essential features: users can benefit from P2P transactions and 30% staking rewards with the planned development of virtual and physical crypto debit cards. Experts anticipate 1Fuel will experience extreme price growth after it lists on significant exchanges. Conclusion The market events impacting Pepe have led numerous investors toward choosing 1Fuel as their upcoming solution. The combination of revolutionary interchain operation features, robust security standards, and lucrative pre-sale events makes 1Fuel an exceptional entry point for diversifying crypto investments at a rapidly growing rate. Participating in the presale is likely a wise choice, as a 100x surge is possible. There is also excellent bonus potential: up to 40% on tokens bought before February 23 and 20% on all past tokens once the presale reaches $3 million.

40673543,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=680269,1740202521,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40673543.jpeg,Trump revives tariff probe over foreign digital taxes on US Tech,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/trump-revives-tariff-probe-digital-taxes/,"President Trump ordered the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) to propose import tariffs on countries that levy digital taxes on US tech companies. According to a White House fact sheet, Trump wants the US Trade Representative office to reopen investigations initiated during his first term into countries that impose digital service taxes ( DSTs) to discriminate against US companies. With this move, he hopes to discourage foreign governments from taxing major US tech corporations like Alphabet and Meta. Trump even commented, “What they’re doing to us in other countries is terrible with digital.” Trump’s administration imposed tariffs on countries with DSTs in 2019, during his first term. When asked to give more details on Trump’s plans, a white house official stated that the president will not have other countries “appropriate America’s tax base” for their own gains. This is not Trump’s first time raising concerns about foreign government taxation policies. In 2019, the USTR investigated the tax systems of France, Italy, India, Spain, and other countries under Trump’s orders. It concluded then that their digital service taxes were discriminatory and harmed American tech firms. Thus, the office launched Section 301 unfair trade practices against these countries, necessitating tariffs on some imports. Since then, some countries opted to pull back their tax plans and even settled for international talks on reduced taxes on tech firms. However, there’s not really been much progress from their discussions. Currently, France, Turkey, Spain, Britain, Italy, India, Canada, and Austria have all imposed taxes on US tech sales revenues. Moreover, the Computer and Communications Industry Association estimates that roughly 30 countries have levied DSTs in the last few years, with Canada imposing them in 2024. Trump’s plans to counter DSTs could escalate tensions between the US and Europe France’s finance minister, Eric Lombard, has insisted that they will not withdraw their digital service taxes on US tech multinationals. In an interview with Bloomberg, he stated, “It’s not changing.” arguing that their tax policy is not a negotiating tool. He also argued that taxes are a question of sovereignty and that every nation has its policies, hoping that their stance would not result in a conflict with the US government. The European nation was actually one of the first to implement DSTs, and they had previously started negotiations with the US to reverse some of its tax plans. However, the two countries never completed their negotiations, and France’s taxes are still hitting hard American tech corporations. With the Trump administration considering retaliatory measures against France and other European nations, tensions could escalate—especially since most of Europe opposes Trump’s decision to negotiate a truce directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the Ukraine war. Aside from the digital service tax issue, the Trump administration wants to check whether any European Union or UK practices incentivize US companies to develop products that undermine free speech. Trump and Vice President JD Vance have spoken over some of European regulations that they claim have stifled conservative voices.

By the time the market closed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had plunged 748.63 points (1.69%) to 43,428.02. The S&P 500 lost 1.71%, finishing at 6,013.13, while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.2% to 19,524.01. Traders offloaded stocks as fears mounted about the weekend—another 48 hours where Trump could drop more tariff bombs after already threatening (repeatedly) to slap a 25% duty on cars, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals. Meanwhile, a closely watched measure of consumer confidence issued by the University of Michigan fell sharply in February from January. The survey also showed long-term inflation expectations reached the highest level since 1995. The housing market is breaking down. Sales of existing homes fell 4.9% in January, a far sharper decline than expected. Buyers are pulling back, squeezed by sky-high mortgage rates and rising home prices. That wasn’t the only red flag. The US services sector just shrank at its fastest rate in over two years, according to the latest S&P Global data. Business activity is slowing, and tariffs are making it worse. “The upbeat mood seen at the start of the year has evaporated,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global. “Uncertainty is rising, business activity is stalling, and inflation remains a serious issue.” Wall Street’s biggest names take a hit Big tech got crushed as investors bailed on high-growth names like Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Palantir, and other investor favorites. According to data rom Google Finance, the risk-off sentiment sent cash pouring into defensive stocks, with Procter & Gamble rising 1.8% and General Mills and Kraft Heinz gaining over 3%. Walmart felt the pain too. The stock dropped 2.5%, its second straight day of declines, after the company warned that the consumer outlook is weakening. For the week, the S&P 500 slid 1.7%, while the Dow and Nasdaq both lost 2.5%. The sell-off was accompanied by a rally in Treasury notes, as investors sought the relative safety of government debt, and come at the end of a week of continued geopolitical uncertainty. The Federal Reserve is now in focus. Market bets on interest rate cuts changed fast, with traders now seeing a 55% chance that the Fed will cut rates two to three times by the end of 2025, bringing them down to 3.50%-3.75% from the current 4.25%-4.50%. On Thursday, those odds were just 44.4%. By October, futures suggest a 50-50 chance of a deeper cut between half and three-quarters of a percentage point—a massive change in expectations from just a day before, when the probability was only 38%. Options expiry adds to market chaos Friday was also a major options expiration day, which meant huge volumes and wild price swings. Nearly 80% of stocks in the S&P 500 finished lower, while small-cap stocks took an even bigger beating, with the Russell 2000 sinking more than 2%. “It’s pretty clear that markets are waking up to the consumer impact of tariffs,” said Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group. “Even if these tariffs never take effect, consumers are already changing their behavior.” Wall Street is starting to price in the full effects of Trump’s trade war. Investors had initially brushed off the White House’s tariff threats, assuming they were just negotiating tactics. But now, it’s looking real. The administration has already promised tariffs on Canada and Mexico, two of America’s largest trading partners. Manufacturers are feeling the heat as well—rising input costs and wage pressures are making it more expensive to operate. “That buy-the-dip mentality, it’s never been higher at the retail level … it’s just the widespread exuberance in the market,” Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, told CNBC. “It’s kind of a Pavlovian response. They’ve bought the dip for two, three years plus and it’s paid off, so they feel very confident about their stock-picking ability and trading this bull market,” Turnquist added.

CryptoQuant CEO Says Altseason Already Begun,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/altcoins-ready-for-round-two-cryptoquant-ceo-says-altseason-already-begun/,"As the cycle progresses, many investors are awaiting the long-anticipated Altseason, with opinions split on whether it will happen. Several market watchers have affirmed that Altcoins (Alts) are getting ready for an explosive breakout, but others, including CryptoQuant’s CEO, have suggested a different outlook. Related Reading: Nansen’s Bitcoin On-Chain Analytics Reveal 42% Increase In BTC Transactions Few Cryptocurrencies To ‘Survive’ The Altseason On Friday, Ki Young Ju, CryptoQuant’s founder and CEO, affirmed that the Altseason has begun. In an X thread, Ju suggested that there will not be a direct Bitcoin-to-alt rotation this cycle, noting that “stablecoin holders are favoring” Altcoins. According to Ju, Bitcoin is no longer a quote cryptocurrency, adding that Bitcoin (BTC) Dominance doesn’t define the altseason anymore. In a December post, he explained that “Altcoins used to move together based on their correlation with BTC,” however, this pattern has now broken. Instead, he stated that trading volume is the metric that defines it, with Altcoins currently having 2.7x the volume of Bitcoin. Ju also considers this to be a very selective and challenging altseason, with only a few Altcoins with strong user cases and narratives expected to thrive. He added that, despite good market sentiment, there isn’t fresh liquidity, which “feels like a PvP fight over a fixed pie.” As a result, Altcoin battles “are getting fiercer,” and only a few are pumping this altseason and attracting new liquidity. Altcoin markets are currently a zero-sum PvP game. While Bitcoin has doubled its market cap, the alt market cap is still below its previous ATH, rotating among themselves without fresh capital inflows. Only a few Alts with strong use cases and narratives will survive. Altcoins Ready For Next Leg Up Trader Crypto Yoddha suggested that Altcoins are “ready for round 2” after its recent performance. According to the post, the crypto market, excluding BTC and ETH, is following 2020-2021’s playbook. During the last cycle, Altcoins experienced two legs towards its cycle top and all-time high (ATH) of $1.13 trillion. In the “first round,” they broke out from its accumulation period, seeing a small re-accumulation phase before surging to the previous top. After reclaiming this resistance level, Altcoins started “round two,” achieving various new highs before hitting a new cycle top. Yoddha pointed out that the market is finishing the first round, as it tested last cycle’s top during the post-election pump. Analyst Rekt Capital affirmed that the crypto market cap, excluding the top 10 tokens, “has completed the second part of its Double Bottom formation.” He explained that Altcoins had been consolidating between the $250 billion to $280 billion range since the February 3 correction.

Analyst Says Longer ETH Consolidation Is Needed Per the post, Alts must close above $280 billion and retest this level as support to confirm a breakout from its three-week resistance and attempt to reclaim the $300 billion mark. Similarly, analyst Carl Runefelt stated that Altcoins have a parabolic move after breaking out of its two-month descending channel. Alts saw a 120% climb after breaking out of a 2024 multi-month descending channel. Altcoins must reclaim the $300 billion resistance to break from this pattern.

As questions arose about who was behind the attack, renowned blockchain investigator ZachXBT stepped forward with concrete evidence, linking the hack to the infamous North Korean state-sponsored cybercriminal group, Lazarus. Lazarus Group Behind Bybit Hack Blockchain data platform Arkham Intelligence recently offered a bounty of 50K ARKM (about $30K) to help & identify who was behind the massive $1 billion Bybit hack. However, well-known blockchain investigator ZachXBT took on the challenge and uncovered the truth. Using his deep on-chain analysis skills, he provided solid proof that the Lazarus Group carried out the attack. His investigation revealed test transactions, wallet links before the hack, forensic charts, and timing breakdowns, all pointing directly to the group. ZachXBT’s findings showed that Lazarus first made small test transactions before launching the full attack. Hackers use this common technique to ensure their methods will work before moving large sums. Later by carefully tracking wallet movements and transaction timestamps, he was able to trace the stolen funds back to addresses controlled by the Lazarus group. Waiting For Bybit’s Response Arkham Intelligence confirmed that ZachXBT has shared his findings with Bybit’s team to assist in their investigation. While Bybit has yet to release a detailed statement, this new evidence could help them take action to recover lost funds or strengthen their security measures. History Of Notorious Act By Lazarus Group Lazarus is known for targeting crypto firms and has been behind several major crypto thefts, making it a main suspect from the start. However, it’s not just one team but several groups with different skills behind this group. Some focus on phishing scams, others carry out complex blockchain attacks, and some use fake identities to trick crypto companies. Last year alone, the group managed to steal over $1.3 billion from different projects, making up 61% of all stolen crypto in 2024.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ARKM|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 06:29:24

RUNE gains momentum as major upgrade nears The RUNE price is showing strong momentum ahead of its highly anticipated V3.20 upgrade. Currently, the RUNE price stands at $1.18, with a market cap of $428.32 million. Trading activity has surged, with daily volume increasing by 36.3% to $209.43 million. The upcoming update will remove the controversial mimir key, a move designed to enhance decentralized governance. The THORChain community has widely supported this decision, which could increase demand for RUNE. Analysts suggest that if RUNE price breaks above $1.39, it could rally to $1.70, while a failure to do so may push it down toward $1.11. With governance improvements and rising investor interest, THORChain’s latest upgrade could set the stage for a major rally. Investors are closely monitoring the RUNE price movements, anticipating potential breakout opportunities as momentum builds ahead of this key development. Kusama (KSM) eyes potential surge with upcoming DOT 2.0 upgrade Kusama remains an essential element of the Polkadot ecosystem, although well below its all-time high of $621.71 in May 2021. With DOT 2.0 due for release in March, market experts think Kusama could reach $50 with Polkadot’s expanded interoperability and governance enhancements. Historically, Kusama has acted as Polkadot’s experimental network, meaning any major Polkadot upgrade tends to impact KSM’s value directly. Currently trading near multi-month highs at $19, Kusama still holds long-term potential. As speculation around DOT 2.0 intensifies, KSM could see renewed bullish momentum, making it a token to watch as March approaches. With Kusama’s historical volatility, its next breakout could be closer than expected. 1Fuel (OFT): The future of seamless trading and real-world crypto payments 1Fuel (OFT) is redefining crypto transactions by introducing fast, cross-chain compatibility and a universal wallet that interacts effortlessly with decentralized applications across multiple networks.

40675014,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=132996,1740205905,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Hopeful Comeback: 79% of FTX Creditors Plan Bold Crypto Reinvestment, Eyeing Solana & Memecoins",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ftx-creditors-crypto-reinvestment/,"In a surprising turn of events, even amidst the fallout from the FTX collapse, a beacon of optimism shines through the crypto community. A recent survey has unveiled a fascinating trend: a significant majority of FTX creditors are not deterred but are in fact gearing up to double down on the digital asset space. This news sparks a wave of hopeful anticipation for the future of the crypto market. Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing survey and explore what it means for the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. Why FTX Creditors Crypto Reinvestment Signals Market Resilience Despite the financial setbacks experienced by FTX users, their unwavering belief in the potential of cryptocurrencies is truly remarkable. The survey, conducted by NFTevening, polled 1,016 FTX creditors and revealed that a staggering 79% of them are planning to reinvest their recovered funds back into the crypto ecosystem. This isn’t just a small fraction; it represents a strong majority signaling robust confidence in the long-term prospects of digital assets. This planned FTX creditors crypto reinvestment demonstrates a powerful resilience within the crypto community. Instead of being discouraged by past events, these investors are seeing the FTX situation as a chapter, not the end of the story. This collective decision to reinvest is fueled by several factors: Long-term Belief: Many creditors view the FTX incident as an isolated case of mismanagement rather than a fundamental flaw in cryptocurrency technology or its potential. Opportunity in the Dip: The market correction following events like the FTX collapse can be seen as a buying opportunity. Savvy investors often look to accumulate assets when prices are lower, anticipating future growth. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Innovation: The core principles of DeFi, offering transparency and control, remain attractive. The continuous innovation within the crypto space, with new projects and technologies emerging, keeps the sector vibrant and promising. This hopeful outlook from FTX creditors provides a strong counter-narrative to the negative sentiment that often follows market downturns. It highlights the enduring appeal and perceived potential of cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class. Solana Investment: The Preferred Choice for Reinvestment Delving deeper into the survey, it’s clear where a significant portion of this reinvestment is headed. Among the 79% planning to reinvest, a notable 62% have their sights set on acquiring Solana (SOL). This makes Solana investment the clear frontrunner for these returning crypto enthusiasts. But why Solana? Solana has consistently been recognized for its high transaction speeds and lower fees compared to some other major blockchains. Despite facing its own challenges, including network outages and price volatility, Solana’s technology and vibrant ecosystem continue to attract developers and investors. Here are some compelling reasons why FTX creditors are leaning towards Solana: Technological Advantages: Solana’s architecture is designed for scalability, making it suitable for high-volume applications and transactions, which is crucial for the future of decentralized applications (dApps). Growing Ecosystem: The Solana ecosystem boasts a wide array of projects, including DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and gaming applications. This diverse ecosystem offers numerous opportunities for investors. Community Support: Despite challenges, Solana has a strong and active community that remains committed to its growth and development. Potential for Growth: Many investors believe Solana is undervalued and has significant potential for future price appreciation, especially as the broader crypto market matures. Furthermore, the survey revealed that 44% of these creditors are specifically looking to invest in Solana-based projects. This indicates a strong belief not just in the Solana token itself, but in the entire ecosystem built upon it. This targeted Solana investment suggests a strategic approach, focusing on platforms and applications leveraging Solana’s capabilities. The Allure of Memecoin Surge: A Risky Yet Tempting Bet While Solana takes the lead in planned reinvestments, another intriguing trend emerges from the survey: one-third of FTX creditors are considering investing their repayments in memecoins. The world of memecoins is known for its volatility and high-risk, high-reward nature. Investing in memecoins is akin to riding a rollercoaster – it can be thrilling, but also comes with significant risks. The potential for a sudden memecoin surge and exponential gains is undeniably attractive, especially for those looking to recoup losses or make quick profits. Why are memecoins drawing attention from FTX creditors? High Potential Returns: Memecoins, driven by community hype and social media trends, can experience massive price surges in short periods. This potential for quick, substantial returns is a major draw. Lower Entry Barrier: Often, memecoins are priced very low, allowing investors to acquire large quantities with relatively small investments. This accessibility makes them appealing to a broader range of investors. Community Driven: The value of memecoins is heavily influenced by community sentiment and online trends. A strong and active community can drive significant price appreciation. Speculative Opportunity: For some, memecoins represent a purely speculative play – a gamble with the potential for outsized gains. This speculative aspect can be particularly enticing in a recovering market. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the inherent risks associated with memecoin investments. Their volatility is extreme, and prices can plummet just as quickly as they rise. Investors must approach memecoins with caution, understanding that they are highly speculative assets and should only allocate funds they can afford to lose. Navigating the Crypto Market Recovery: A Strategic Digital Asset Strategy The planned reinvestment by FTX creditors is occurring within a broader context of crypto market recovery . After periods of market downturn and uncertainty, there are increasing signs of stabilization and renewed growth in the crypto space. This recovery is characterized by: Institutional Interest: Continued and growing interest from institutional investors is injecting significant capital into the market and lending credibility to cryptocurrencies as an asset class. Technological Advancements: Ongoing developments in blockchain technology, including scalability solutions and interoperability, are enhancing the functionality and usability of cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Clarity (in some regions): Increased regulatory clarity in certain jurisdictions is providing a more stable and predictable environment for crypto businesses and investors. Mainstream Adoption: We are seeing increasing mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, with more businesses accepting crypto payments and individuals integrating digital assets into their financial portfolios. For FTX creditors and new investors alike, navigating this recovering market requires a strategic digital asset strategy . Here are some actionable insights to consider: Strategy Description Benefits Risks Diversification Spread investments across different cryptocurrencies (e.g., Solana, established coins, and a small allocation to memecoins) and asset classes. Reduces overall portfolio risk, captures growth potential across sectors. May dilute potential gains if one asset class significantly outperforms others. Due Diligence Thoroughly research any cryptocurrency or project before investing. Understand the technology, team, use case, and market sentiment. Informed investment decisions, reduces the risk of investing in scams or poorly conceived projects. Time-consuming, requires continuous learning and adaptation to the rapidly evolving crypto space. Risk Management Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders and take profits strategically. Protects capital, manages emotional trading decisions. May miss out on potential further gains if stop-loss orders are triggered prematurely. Long-Term Perspective Focus on the long-term potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies rather than short-term market fluctuations. Reduces stress from market volatility, potentially captures significant long-term growth. Capital may be tied up for extended periods, market conditions can change significantly over time. Conclusion: A Testament to Crypto’s Enduring Appeal The survey results are clear: the spirit of crypto remains resilient. The fact that a significant majority of FTX creditors are planning to reinvest their repayments into the crypto market, with a keen interest in Solana and even memecoins, speaks volumes about the enduring appeal and perceived future of digital assets. This is not just about recovering losses; it’s a powerful statement of belief in the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. As the market continues to evolve and mature, the hopeful reinvestment of these creditors could very well contribute to the next wave of crypto growth and innovation, proving that even setbacks can pave the way for remarkable comebacks.

This news, initially reported by Tree News citing Bloomberg, signals a potential turning point for the platform and offers a glimpse into the evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets. Are you wondering what this means for OpenSea and the broader NFT ecosystem? Let’s dive into the details of this crucial update. What Triggered the OpenSea SEC Probe? The shadow of regulatory scrutiny loomed over OpenSea when it received a ‘Wells notice’ from the SEC back in August. But what exactly is a Wells notice, and why did OpenSea receive one? A Wells notice is essentially a formal notification from the SEC to a company or individual, informing them that the agency is considering recommending enforcement action against them. It provides the recipient an opportunity to present their case as to why such action should not be taken. In OpenSea’s case, the specifics of the SEC investigation were not publicly disclosed, but it’s widely speculated that the probe revolved around whether certain NFTs listed on the platform could be classified as securities. This concern stems from the ongoing debate within the crypto industry about the classification of digital assets. The SEC has been actively examining various crypto projects and platforms to determine if they fall under securities laws. If an NFT is deemed a security, it would subject the platforms trading them to stricter regulations, including registration requirements and compliance with securities laws. This is a critical issue for the burgeoning NFT marketplace sector. The Relief: SEC Investigation Concludes The recent announcement that the OpenSea SEC probe is concluding brings a wave of relief to the platform and the wider NFT community. While the exact details of the conclusion are still awaited, the fact that the SEC is reportedly wrapping up its investigation without any publicly announced enforcement action is a positive sign. This suggests that either OpenSea successfully addressed the SEC’s concerns or the SEC decided not to pursue further action in this instance. This development is significant for several reasons: Reduced Regulatory Uncertainty: The conclusion of the probe removes a major cloud of uncertainty hanging over OpenSea. Regulatory ambiguity can stifle innovation and investment, and clarity in this area is crucial for the continued growth of the NFT space. Positive Signal for NFT Market: The news can be interpreted as a positive signal for the broader NFT marketplace . It might suggest a more nuanced approach from the SEC towards NFTs, at least in this particular case. This could boost confidence among creators, collectors, and investors in the NFT market. OpenSea Can Focus on Growth: With the SEC investigation seemingly behind them, OpenSea can now fully focus on its core business – enhancing its platform, expanding its offerings, and driving further adoption of NFTs. This could lead to new features, partnerships, and initiatives from the leading marketplace. What Does This Mean for Crypto Regulation and the Future of NFTs? While the conclusion of the OpenSea SEC probe is encouraging, it’s important to remember that the regulatory landscape for crypto, including NFTs, is still evolving. This instance could provide some valuable insights into how the SEC is approaching NFTs, but it doesn’t necessarily set a precedent for all NFT platforms or projects. Here are some key takeaways and considerations: Aspect Implications Ongoing Crypto Regulation The need for clear and consistent crypto regulation remains paramount. The OpenSea case highlights the complexities and uncertainties surrounding the classification of digital assets. NFT Scrutiny While this probe concluded, it’s likely that NFTs will continue to be under regulatory scrutiny, particularly as the market matures and becomes more mainstream. Platform Compliance NFT marketplaces must prioritize compliance and engage proactively with regulators to navigate the evolving legal framework. Industry Dialogue Continued dialogue between the crypto industry and regulatory bodies is crucial to foster innovation while ensuring investor protection and market integrity. Navigating the Regulatory Maze: Actionable Insights for NFT Enthusiasts So, what can you, as an NFT enthusiast, creator, or collector, take away from this situation? Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory developments in the crypto and NFT space. Follow industry news, legal updates, and announcements from regulatory bodies like the SEC. Understand Risk: Recognize that the regulatory environment for NFTs is still developing, and there are inherent risks associated with digital assets. Do your own research and understand the projects you are involved in. Support Responsible Platforms: Favor NFT marketplaces that demonstrate a commitment to compliance and transparency. Platforms that engage proactively with regulators are more likely to navigate the regulatory landscape successfully. Engage in the Conversation: Participate in discussions about crypto regulation and the future of NFTs. Your voice and perspective are valuable in shaping the regulatory landscape. A Breath of Fresh Air for OpenSea and the NFT World The conclusion of the OpenSea SEC probe is undoubtedly a positive development. It provides a sense of closure for OpenSea and injects renewed optimism into the NFT marketplace . While the broader regulatory questions surrounding digital assets persist, this instance offers a glimmer of hope and suggests a path forward for the responsible growth of the NFT ecosystem. The industry will be keenly watching for further details and any official statements from both OpenSea and the SEC to fully understand the implications of this conclusion. For now, it appears to be a moment of victory for OpenSea and a sign of resilience for the ever-evolving world of NFTs.

The digital world is buzzing with a potential game-changer. A colossal hack at crypto exchange Bybit, reportedly siphoning off a staggering $1.4 billion in Ethereum (ETH), has ignited a fiery debate within the crypto community – could this lead to an Ethereum Fork ? What Shocked the Crypto World? The Massive Bybit Hack Conor Grogan, a key figure at Coinbase as Director of Product Strategy and Business Operations, dropped a bombshell on X (formerly Twitter). He declared the Bybit breach as potentially the “largest theft in history.” This isn’t just pocket change; we’re talking about a sum that could send ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem. According to Wu Blockchain, Grogan hinted that this monumental crypto theft could spark serious discussions about an unprecedented move – an Ethereum Fork to recover the stolen funds. Why is Everyone Talking About an Ethereum Fork? For those unfamiliar, an Ethereum Fork , particularly a rollback, is a drastic measure. Imagine rewinding a blockchain to a previous state, effectively undoing transactions. It’s like hitting the ‘undo’ button on the entire history of transactions after a specific point. This concept, while technically feasible, is fraught with controversy and raises fundamental questions about blockchain immutability and decentralization. Here’s a breakdown of why an Ethereum Fork in this situation is such a hot topic: Scale of the Theft: $1.4 billion is an unprecedented amount. Recovering such a sum would be a massive win for Bybit and potentially set a precedent for future large-scale hacks. Community Sentiment: The crypto community is deeply divided on the issue of blockchain immutability. Some believe in the ‘code is law’ principle, arguing against any form of rollback, while others prioritize protecting users and recovering stolen funds, especially in cases of blatant theft. Precedent Setting: Forking to reverse transactions, even in extreme cases like this, could open a Pandora’s Box. It could raise concerns about the security and finality of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain in the long run. Arthur Hayes Jumps into the Ethereum Fork Debate: Support for Rollback? Adding fuel to the fire, none other than Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX and CIO of Web3 venture firm Maelstrom, weighed in on the matter. In his own X post, Hayes stated that if the Ethereum community decides to perform a blockchain rollback to retrieve Bybit’s pilfered assets, he would throw his weight behind the move. Hayes’ support, a prominent voice in the crypto space, further amplifies the gravity of this potential ETH recovery scenario. The Burning Question: To Fork or Not to Fork? The core dilemma revolves around the very essence of blockchain technology. Blockchains are designed to be immutable, meaning once a transaction is recorded, it’s permanent and irreversible. However, extreme situations like this Bybit crypto theft force us to confront the limitations and potential trade-offs of this immutability. Let’s consider the arguments: Arguments FOR an Ethereum Fork (Rollback) Arguments AGAINST an Ethereum Fork (No Rollback) Recovery of Stolen Funds: A fork could potentially return the $1.4 billion ETH to Bybit, mitigating significant financial damage. Deterrent to Future Hacks: It might send a message to hackers that even seemingly successful heists can be reversed. Community Protection: Prioritizes the protection of a major crypto exchange and potentially its users from a devastating loss. Violation of Immutability: Undermines the fundamental principle of blockchain permanence, potentially eroding trust in Ethereum. Centralization Concerns: Decision-making power for such a significant event raises questions about decentralization within the Ethereum community. Precedent Risk: Could encourage future fork requests for various reasons, weakening the integrity of the blockchain. Technical Complexity and Risks: Executing a fork is technically complex and carries risks of unforeseen consequences and network instability. Navigating the Uncharted Waters of ETH Recovery The situation is undeniably complex. While the prospect of recovering $1.4 billion in ETH recovery is undeniably attractive, the potential ramifications of an Ethereum Fork are equally significant. The Ethereum community now faces a monumental decision – one that will not only impact Bybit but could also reshape perceptions of blockchain security and governance for years to come. This isn’t just about Bybit; it’s about the future trajectory of Ethereum and the broader crypto space. Will the allure of recovering a massive crypto theft outweigh the principles of blockchain immutability? The coming days and weeks will be critical in understanding how this unprecedented situation unfolds and the path the Ethereum community chooses to take. Stay Tuned for Updates on the Ethereum Fork Debate The debate surrounding a potential Ethereum Fork is just beginning. Expect intense discussions, proposals, and potentially even votes within the Ethereum community. The outcome of this situation will be closely watched by everyone in the crypto world, as it could set a new precedent for how blockchains respond to extreme security breaches. This is a developing story, and we will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available. Keep an eye on this space for the latest developments in the unfolding saga of the Bybit hack and the potential blockchain rollback discussion within the Ethereum ecosystem.

In a post on X, Martinez highlighted that the TD Sequential indicator has signaled a buy opportunity on XRP’s hourly chart. The signal comes after a period of sideways movement, suggesting a potential shift in momentum. The attached chart illustrates a series of bearish candlesticks leading into what appears to be a stabilization phase. Notably, Martinez predicted this decline in mid-February. Following this, the asset saw multiple days of bearish closes, before a brief consolidation phase. $XRP looks set for a rebound as the TD Sequential indicator flashes a buy signal on the hourly chart! pic.twitter.com/PYN6TuyI8W — Ali (@ali_charts) February 21, 2025 The TD Sequential Indicator Turns Positive The chart presents a compelling buy signal due to the TD Sequential indicator’s structure, which is designed to identify trend exhaustion and potential reversals. In this case, the appearance of a green “1” after a completed bearish sequence suggests that selling pressure may weaken and buyers could begin regaining control. The consolidation phase, which often precedes a reversal, has added to the bullish sentiment. The slight upward movement following the signal further supports the idea that buying interest is increasing, making this a key technical point for traders watching for a shift in momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 At the time of Martinez’s post, XRP was trading around $2.6557, reflecting a slight increase of 0.30%. The indicator suggests buyers may begin entering the market, potentially reversing the previous downtrend. However, as with any technical signal, confirmation through additional indicators and price action is necessary before establishing a definitive trend direction. Where is XRP Going Next? Martinez has previously provided insights into XRP’s price movements, identifying both bullish and bearish patterns. Recently, he noted that XRP could be gearing up for a rebound following a bullish signal similar to the current one. XRP’s broader trend remains influenced by factors beyond technical indicators. Market sentiment, overall cryptocurrency trends, and external developments such as regulatory updates continue to play a role in price fluctuations. Martinez pointed out that if XRP maintains certain support levels, it could retest higher price points , including the $3 range. While Martinez’s analysis suggests a possible shift in momentum, broader market conditions will ultimately determine whether XRP can sustain an upward move. However, the market is leaning toward a bullish run in the short term, and XRP could begin smashing records soon.

It operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are overly worried, often a sign of potential buying opportunities. 25-49: Fear – Anxious market conditions, suggesting caution but also possible entry points. 50-75: Greed – Growing optimism, hinting at potential market tops and need for careful consideration. 76-100: Extreme Greed – Overheated market, often signaling an impending correction. 49-51: Neutral – Balanced sentiment, market indecision, could go either way. Currently sitting at 49, the index is firmly in the ‘Neutral’ zone. This suggests that the dominant emotions driving the crypto market are neither extreme fear nor excessive greed. It’s a state of equilibrium, a pause for breath, and a moment for investors to reassess and strategize. What Factors Influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The crypto analysis tool isn’t based on guesswork. It’s a calculated metric that considers a range of market dynamics. Six key factors are meticulously weighed to arrive at the daily index value: Volatility (25%): Measures the current volatility and max drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it with the 30-day and 90-day averages. Unusually high volatility can signal fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current market momentum and trading volume to recent averages (30 and 90 days). High buying volumes indicate greed, while low volumes can point to fear. Social Media (15%): Primarily analyzes sentiment on Twitter, particularly crypto-related hashtags and engagement levels. A surge in positive interactions can reflect greed, and vice versa. Surveys (15%): Weekly polls conducted on platforms like StrawPoll, asking crypto investors about their market sentiment. These provide direct insights into investor feelings. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s dominance compared to the rest of the crypto market. Increased Bitcoin dominance can sometimes stem from fear as investors flock to the perceived safety of Bitcoin during market uncertainty. Google Trends (10%): Analyzes Google Trends data for Bitcoin-related search queries. Spikes in searches like “Bitcoin price prediction” or “Bitcoin crash” can indicate fear, while general interest in buying Bitcoin can signal greed. The recent shift to ‘Neutral’ indicates a combined effect of changes across these factors. Perhaps volatility has subsided slightly, or social media sentiment has become less overwhelmingly positive. It’s a nuanced picture, and understanding these components helps in interpreting the index effectively. Neutral is the New Normal? Navigating Market Indecision The market sentiment moving into ‘Neutral’ doesn’t necessarily mean the crypto party is over, nor does it signal an impending crash. Instead, it suggests a period of market indecision. Investors are taking a pause, evaluating the current landscape, and waiting for clearer signals before making decisive moves. This phase can be characterized by: Sideways Price Action: Expect to see less dramatic price swings and more consolidation as the market searches for direction. Reduced Trading Volume: With less conviction in either direction, trading volumes might decrease as investors hold back. Increased Scrutiny: Investors become more selective and analytical, focusing on project fundamentals and long-term potential rather than just hype. Potential Accumulation Phase: For astute investors, ‘Neutral’ can be an opportune time to accumulate positions in fundamentally strong cryptocurrencies at potentially favorable prices. However, ‘Neutral’ can also be a calm before the storm. It’s crucial to monitor other market indicators and news developments to anticipate the next market move. Will the market tip back into ‘Greed’ or slide further into ‘Fear’? The answer likely lies in upcoming macroeconomic events, regulatory news, and technological advancements in the crypto space. Bitcoin’s Role in the Neutral Zone: What to Watch For Bitcoin , as the flagship cryptocurrency, plays a pivotal role in influencing the overall market sentiment and, consequently, the Fear & Greed Index. When the index is neutral, Bitcoin’s price action becomes even more critical. Here’s what to keep an eye on: Bitcoin Price Levels: Monitor key support and resistance levels for Bitcoin. A break above resistance could signal a return to ‘Greed,’ while falling below support might push the index towards ‘Fear.’ Bitcoin Dominance Shifts: Watch for significant changes in Bitcoin dominance. A sharp increase could suggest a flight to safety amid broader market concerns, while a decrease might indicate renewed risk appetite in altcoins. Bitcoin On-Chain Metrics: Analyze on-chain data such as transaction volumes, active addresses, and miner activity. These metrics can provide insights into the underlying strength and health of the Bitcoin network and its potential price trajectory. Institutional Interest in Bitcoin: Track news and developments related to institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Continued institutional interest can be a strong bullish signal, even in a neutral market. For instance, if we see institutional buying increasing during this ‘Neutral’ phase, it could be a strong indication that smart money is accumulating before the next bull run. Conversely, negative regulatory news or macroeconomic headwinds could quickly shift sentiment towards ‘Fear’. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Neutral Crypto Market So, what should you do when the Crypto Fear & Greed Index flashes ‘Neutral’? Here are some actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Now is the perfect time to double down on research. Identify fundamentally strong projects, understand their use cases, and assess their long-term potential. Portfolio Rebalancing: Consider rebalancing your portfolio. Take profits from overextended positions and strategically allocate capital to undervalued assets. Risk Management: Neutral markets can be unpredictable. Ensure your risk management strategies are in place. Use stop-loss orders and avoid over-leveraging. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory updates, and technological advancements. Information is your best tool in navigating uncertain times. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in the long-term potential of crypto, ‘Neutral’ periods can be excellent for implementing a DCA strategy, gradually building your positions over time. In essence, a ‘Neutral’ reading on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a call for prudence, analysis, and strategic positioning. It’s a time to be neither overly bullish nor bearish, but rather, intelligently prepared for whatever the market throws next. Conclusion: Embracing Market Equilibrium The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s dip into ‘Neutral’ territory serves as a valuable reminder of the cyclical nature of market sentiment. It’s a signal to pause, reflect, and strategize. While extreme fear or greed can sometimes present clear buy or sell signals, ‘Neutral’ demands a more nuanced approach. By understanding the factors that drive the index and closely monitoring market dynamics, investors can navigate this phase of market indecision with confidence and prepare for future opportunities. The crypto market is ever-evolving, and staying informed and adaptable is the key to long-term success.

Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence confirmed the group’s involvement, citing evidence from onchain sleuth ZachXBT. The attackers executed the breach using a method known as “ Blind Signing ,” which allows transactions to be approved without full visibility into their contents. Bybit’s ETH cold wallet was compromised, leading to the transfer of nearly $1.5 billion worth of assets into a single wallet before being dispersed across multiple wallets. The Hunt for the Hackers Before Arkham confirmed Lazarus’ involvement, the firm offered a 50,000 ARKM bounty for anyone tracking the perpetrators. ZachXBT provided a detailed analysis, tracing the stolen funds through test transactions and forensic data. His findings left no doubt that the attack was the work of Lazarus. Blockchain security firm Blockaid’s CEO Ido Ben Natan explained that Blind Signing attacks have become a go-to strategy for sophisticated hackers, including North Korea. Similar methods, like the Radiant Capital and WazirX incidents, were used in previous breaches. Funds on the Move Blockchain data firm Nansen revealed that the stolen funds were initially placed in a primary wallet before being divided among over 40 different wallets. The attackers then converted all stETH, cmETH, and mETH holdings to ETH, systematically transferring chunks of $27 million to more than 10 additional wallets. This method made tracking and recovering the funds significantly harder. North Korea’s Cyberwarfare & Financial Motivations 10x Research highlights that Lazarus’s cyberattacks are not merely criminal activities but a state-sponsored initiative to fund North Korea’s military projects. The U.S. government estimates that crypto-related cybercrimes finance up to 30% of North Korea’s missile programs. Hackers are selected from a young age and trained extensively, with top talents sent to China for advanced cyber education. The Lazarus Group’s exploits include infamous breaches like the Ronin Network ($625m), KuCoin ($285m), and Binance Bridge ($570m). Their techniques remain undetected, adapting to the latest security protocols while using social engineering and malware to penetrate even the most secure platforms. Moreover, they rely on DeFi platforms like Uniswap to launder money since these platforms don’t require KYC checks. Interestingly if North Korea is behind all this then they will become the 14th largest holder of Ether, beating the holdings of Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin as per data . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pi Network Clears the Air After Bybit CEO Calls It a Scam, Pi Coin Rises by 20% , Bybit Responds Bybit CEO Ben Zhou confirmed that despite the loss, the exchange remains financially stable.

With North Korea’s Lazarus Group repeatedly pulling off high-profile crypto heists, the industry faces increasing pressure to bolster security against such sophisticated threats. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

40675310,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133007,1740206481,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unraveling the Crypto Laundering Secrets of Lazarus Group: Years to Cash Out Stolen Funds,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lazarus-group-crypto-laundering-secrets/,"Ever wondered what happens to millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency stolen by notorious hacker groups? It’s not as simple as just cashing it out and buying a fleet of Lamborghinis! Crypto expert Eric Wall recently shed light on the intricate and surprisingly lengthy process employed by North Korea’s Lazarus Group to launder their ill-gotten digital gains. Let’s dive into the fascinating, and frankly alarming, world of crypto laundering and how these cybercriminals operate. Decoding Lazarus Group’s Crypto Laundering Strategy According to crypto investor Eric Wall, the Lazarus Group, a hacking entity linked to North Korea, isn’t just grabbing crypto and running. They have a well-defined, multi-stage process to convert their stolen crypto into usable fiat currency. It’s like a digital obstacle course designed to obscure the origin of the funds. Here’s a breakdown of their laundering playbook: Step 1: ERC-20 Token Swap for Ether (ETH): Initially, many of the cryptocurrencies stolen are in the form of ERC-20 tokens, which operate on the Ethereum blockchain. The first step involves swapping these diverse tokens for Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum. This consolidation simplifies the holdings into a more liquid and widely accepted cryptocurrency. Step 2: Ether (ETH) to Bitcoin (BTC) Conversion: Next, the laundered Ether is converted into Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin, being the oldest and most dominant cryptocurrency, offers broader accessibility and liquidity across various exchanges globally. This step is crucial for further obfuscation and easier movement of funds. Step 3: Bitcoin (BTC) Cash Out via Asian Exchanges to Chinese Yuan: The final and perhaps most challenging step is cashing out the Bitcoin into traditional fiat currency, specifically Chinese Yuan. This is reportedly done through Asian cryptocurrency exchanges. This stage aims to convert the digital assets into a usable currency that can be accessed and utilized, presumably by the North Korean regime. Wall’s insights, shared on X (formerly Twitter), highlight the patience and persistence of the Lazarus Group . This isn’t a quick smash-and-grab operation; it’s a calculated, long-term strategy to extract value from their cyber heists. Why Does Crypto Laundering Take So Long? You might be thinking, “Years to cash out? In the fast-paced world of crypto?” Yes, years! And there are several reasons why crypto laundering , especially at this scale, is a marathon, not a sprint: Blockchain Transparency: While cryptocurrencies offer pseudonymity, blockchain transactions are transparent and traceable. Every transaction is recorded on a public ledger, making it possible for blockchain analysis firms and law enforcement agencies to track the flow of funds. Laundering efforts are all about trying to break or obscure this chain of traceability, which takes time and complex maneuvers. Exchange Scrutiny and KYC/AML Regulations: Cryptocurrency exchanges are increasingly under regulatory pressure to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. Large or suspicious transactions can trigger red flags, leading to account freezes and investigations. Launderers need to navigate these regulations carefully, often using multiple exchanges and smaller transactions to avoid detection, slowing down the process significantly. Liquidity Constraints: Cashing out massive amounts of cryptocurrency, especially into fiat currency like Chinese Yuan, can be challenging without attracting attention. Exchanges have liquidity limits, and trying to offload huge sums quickly can depress the price and raise suspicions. Therefore, the process often involves smaller, incremental cash-outs over extended periods. Evolving Security and Tracking Technologies: The cryptocurrency industry is constantly evolving, with advancements in blockchain analytics and security measures. As tracking tools become more sophisticated, launderers need to adapt their techniques, leading to a cat-and-mouse game that prolongs the laundering timeline. The Chilling Example: Funds Stolen in 2016 Still Held in 2022 To underscore the protracted nature of this process, Eric Wall pointed out a stark example: North Korea was still holding onto funds stolen crypto in 2016 as late as 2022! This six-year gap vividly illustrates the immense time and effort involved in successfully laundering large sums of cryptocurrency. It’s a testament to the challenges even sophisticated cybercriminal organizations face in converting digital loot into usable assets. What Does This Mean for the Crypto World? The Lazarus Group’s meticulous and lengthy crypto theft and laundering operation has significant implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem: Increased Security Awareness: It highlights the ongoing and evolving threat of state-sponsored hacking groups targeting the crypto space. Exchanges, DeFi platforms, and individual investors need to remain vigilant and continuously improve their security measures. Importance of Regulatory Compliance: The need for robust KYC/AML regulations within the crypto industry is further emphasized. While regulations can be burdensome, they are crucial in deterring and disrupting money laundering activities and maintaining the integrity of the crypto market. Advancements in Blockchain Analytics: The ability to track and trace stolen funds, even years later, demonstrates the growing sophistication of blockchain analytics tools. Continued development in this area is vital for law enforcement and security firms to combat crypto crime effectively. Long-Term Impact on Crypto Prices and Trust: Large-scale thefts and subsequent laundering attempts can impact market sentiment and potentially exert downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices, at least temporarily. Furthermore, it erodes trust in the security and stability of the crypto ecosystem if not addressed effectively. Can Lazarus Group Ever Be Stopped? Stopping a group like Lazarus Group is a complex international challenge. It requires a multi-pronged approach involving: International Cooperation: Cybercrime transcends borders, necessitating strong collaboration between law enforcement agencies worldwide to track, investigate, and prosecute these groups. Enhanced Cybersecurity Measures: Continuously improving cybersecurity defenses across the crypto industry is paramount. This includes strengthening exchange security, promoting secure wallet practices, and developing more resilient blockchain infrastructure. Sanctions and Financial Countermeasures: Governments can impose sanctions and financial restrictions to limit the Lazarus Group’s access to the global financial system and disrupt their funding sources. Blockchain Analytics and Intelligence Sharing: Leveraging advanced blockchain analytics and sharing intelligence about known laundering patterns can help identify and intercept illicit transactions more effectively. The Lingering Shadow of Crypto Theft The saga of Lazarus Group’s crypto theft and laundering activities serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threats in the digital asset landscape. While the transparency of blockchain offers tools to track illicit funds, the determination and sophistication of groups like Lazarus Group highlight the ongoing need for vigilance, innovation in security, and global cooperation to safeguard the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The years-long laundering process is a testament to both the challenges faced by cybercriminals and the slow but steady progress in combating crypto crime.

Is the Bull Run Losing Steam? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News At the start of this month, the price of Bitcoin was around $102,398.17. Since then, the market has experienced a decline of 5.77%. In the previous month, the market witnessed a surge of at least 9.54%. Unsurprisingly, a report suggests that large BTC holders have seen lower realised profits this month compared to January. Let’s take a closer look. Bitcoin Whales Made Less Profit in February According to the report, earlier in the year, large BTC holders made approximately $3 billion in realised profits. The same report shows that large BTC holders, holding 10 to 10,000 BTC, have seen lower realised profits this month compared to January. Huge Profits in January – But Why the Change? At the beginning of the year, the price of BTC was $93,569.38. Between January 1 and 6, the market sharply climbed by 9.25%. However, between January 7 and 9, the market dropped by 9.46%. Later, with a sharp upward momentum of 14.61%, the market recovered from the previous correction. Between January 16 and 31, the market remained within the range of $99,995 and $106,190. At a point on January 20, the market touched as high as $109,603.27. In January, 2025, the BTC market recorded a growth of 9.54% – far higher than the 0.87% growth experienced the same month in the previous year. It appears that market conditions may have encouraged large BTC holders to take profit in January. Bitcoin Price Remains Strong Above $90,000 in February Notably, though large BTC holders have seen lower realised profits in February, the BT market has not experienced significant price drops. In the first two days of February, the Bitcoin market plummeted sharply by 4.68%. At a point on February 3, the market touched a low of $91,235.33. However, on February 5, the market entered a range of $98,305.18 and $95,666.64. As of now, the BTC price stands at $96,472.30, indicating that the market still remains inside this range. The current price trend indicates that the Bitcoin market remains stable above $90,000. Are Bitcoin Whales Changing Their Market Strategy? The stability suggests that selling pressure from whales is controlled. Instead of mass selling, large holders seem to be adjusting their approach. What this indicate is a long-term confidence among large Bitcoin holders in the price of BTC. In conclusion, if whales continue holding rather than selling aggressively, Bitcoin could maintain strong price levels.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 06:44:54

However, it’s essential for the OG meme to remain above a certain support, which has historically led to impressive runs. The most critical support zone for #Dogecoin $DOGE is between $0.19 and $0.16. If this level holds, the $3 target remains a strong possibility. pic.twitter.com/VZyqSM2p8U — Ali (@ali_charts) February 22, 2025 It’s safe to say that the post-US-election mania has faded for many crypto assets, and some, such as DOGE, has returned to levels close to those before November 5. Recall that Dogecoin’s price had soared to roughly $0.5 after Trump won the elections but now struggles to remain above $0.25 after a 31% monthly decline. Nevertheless, the OG meme token has seen worse, even during this cycle, as it slumped toward $0.2 on a couple of occasions in times of substantial price crashes. According to the popular analyst Ali Martinez, though, the asset still has a chance to resume its rally and head toward uncharted territory. To do so, it needs to sustain the $0.19 support line, which he labeled as ‘the most crucial’ zone. He added that DOGE has been trading inside an ascending channel for years and has ‘tended to rebound’ from the lower boundary since 2014 and head toward the upper one. The most recent such bounce-off occurred during the early February massacre , which could be the propeller for a surge toward $3 and even $4. “If history repeats, as long as Dogecoin holds above $0.19, it could rally to the resistance trendline at $4.” – Martinez concluded . There’re certainly some bullish developments happening in the Dogecoin ecosystem, such as the multiple filings for a spot DOGE ETF in the US, which many experts believe have a great chance of succeeding under Trump’s administration. Consequently, analysts have outlined impressive price targets for the largest meme coin, and many agree there will be a new all-time high. However, investors should be wary before allocating funds to any assets, particularly meme coins, about the risks of significant volatility and rapid crashes, especially in times of uncertainty that could rattle the entire market, just like yesterday’s hack against Bybit.

Recent analysis suggests a fascinating, and potentially critical, relationship between Bitcoin and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). According to Jamie Coutts, a respected analyst from Real Vision, the inverse correlation between Bitcoin and the DXY has reached extreme levels. This intriguing development could signal significant shifts in global liquidity and market dynamics, creating both opportunities and challenges for crypto investors. Let’s dive deep into what this means for your crypto portfolio and the broader market. Decoding the Bitcoin DXY Correlation: What’s the Hype? For those new to market analysis, understanding the Bitcoin DXY correlation is crucial. The DXY, or U.S. Dollar Index, measures the dollar’s strength against a basket of six major world currencies. Historically, Bitcoin, often seen as a hedge against traditional financial systems, has exhibited an inverse relationship with the DXY. This means when the dollar weakens, Bitcoin tends to rise, and vice versa. But why is this happening now, and why is it considered ‘extreme’? Jamie Coutts highlighted this unusual situation on X, noting that the current Bitcoin inverse correlation with the DXY is reaching levels rarely seen before. He suggests that while a weaker dollar is generally seen as favorable for risk assets like Bitcoin, political factors are currently exerting influence on the DXY. This creates a complex scenario that demands careful attention from investors. Why is the Inverse Correlation Between Bitcoin and DXY Important? Understanding this correlation offers valuable insights into broader market trends and potential investment strategies. Here’s why this relationship matters: Global Liquidity Indicator: A weakening dollar often signals increased global liquidity. When the DXY falls, it generally becomes cheaper for other countries to borrow and invest in dollar-denominated assets, including cryptocurrencies. Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: A strong dollar often indicates a “risk-off” environment, where investors flock to the safety of the dollar. Conversely, a weaker dollar can suggest a “risk-on” sentiment, encouraging investment in riskier assets like Bitcoin. Investment Strategy Implications: Monitoring the DXY impact on Bitcoin correlation can help investors anticipate potential market movements and adjust their portfolios accordingly. An extreme correlation could indicate either an overextended market condition or an impending significant shift. To illustrate, consider a simplified scenario: DXY Trend Typical Bitcoin Reaction Market Sentiment DXY Decreases (Dollar Weakens) Bitcoin Price Tends to Increase Risk-On DXY Increases (Dollar Strengthens) Bitcoin Price Tends to Decrease Risk-Off Political Factors and the Dollar: What’s Influencing DXY? Coutts points out that political factors are playing a significant role in the current DXY dynamics. This is a crucial element to consider because traditional economic models might not fully capture the impact of geopolitical events on currency valuations. These political influences can include: Geopolitical Instability: Global events, such as conflicts or political uncertainty, can drive investors towards the perceived safety of the U.S. dollar, strengthening the DXY. US Fiscal Policy: Government spending and debt levels can influence investor confidence in the dollar. Aggressive fiscal policies might weaken the dollar over time. Federal Reserve Policy: Interest rate decisions and monetary policy by the Federal Reserve are primary drivers of dollar strength. Hawkish policies tend to strengthen the dollar, while dovish policies can weaken it. These political and economic factors are creating a tug-of-war, potentially contributing to the ‘extreme’ correlation observed. It’s not just about typical market forces; external pressures are adding layers of complexity to the DXY impact on Bitcoin . The Critical Level: 106 on the DXY Coutts specifically mentions the 106 level on the DXY as a critical threshold. He suggests that a drop below 106 would be a “strong bullish signal for global liquidity.” Why is this level so important? Technical Indicator: 106 likely represents a significant support level for the DXY. Breaking below this level could indicate a sustained weakening of the dollar. Liquidity Release: A weaker dollar, as discussed, typically translates to increased global liquidity. This liquidity often flows into various markets, including cryptocurrencies, potentially boosting Bitcoin’s price. Market Confidence: Breaching a key support level can also shift market sentiment. A DXY drop below 106 might instill greater confidence in risk assets and trigger further investment in Bitcoin. Therefore, keeping a close watch on the DXY, particularly around the 106 mark, is vital for anyone involved in the crypto market. This level could act as a key trigger for significant market movements and shifts in the Bitcoin DXY correlation . Navigating the Extreme Correlation: Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors So, what should crypto investors do with this information? Here are some actionable insights based on the current Bitcoin market analysis and the extreme DXY correlation: Monitor DXY Closely: Keep an eye on the U.S. Dollar Index, especially the 106 level. Use financial websites or trading platforms to track its movement in real-time. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin shows a strong inverse correlation, diversification remains key. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Explore other cryptocurrencies and asset classes to mitigate risk. Stay Informed on Global Politics: Be aware of major geopolitical events and policy changes that could influence the dollar and, consequently, Bitcoin. Use Technical Analysis: Combine DXY analysis with other technical indicators for Bitcoin to make informed trading decisions. Look at Bitcoin’s price charts in conjunction with DXY movements. Manage Risk: Extreme correlations can sometimes revert to the mean. Be prepared for potential shifts in the relationship and manage your risk accordingly. Don’t overextend your positions based solely on this correlation. Is This Extreme Correlation a Golden Opportunity? The current crypto market signals are mixed but intriguing. While an extreme inverse correlation might seem like a straightforward bullish signal for Bitcoin if the DXY weakens, it’s essential to approach with caution. ‘Extreme’ conditions are often unsustainable and can be followed by sharp corrections or shifts in market dynamics. However, this situation also presents a potential golden opportunity. If Coutts is correct and a DXY drop below 106 unleashes significant global liquidity, Bitcoin could indeed see a substantial upward movement. The key is to be prepared, stay informed, and manage risk effectively. This period of extreme correlation could be a time of significant profit potential for those who understand and navigate it wisely. Conclusion: Riding the Waves of Correlation The extreme inverse correlation between Bitcoin and the DXY is a powerful reminder of the interconnectedness of global markets. Jamie Coutts’ analysis highlights a critical juncture where political factors and traditional market dynamics are converging to create unique opportunities and risks in the crypto space. By understanding the Bitcoin DXY correlation , monitoring key levels like 106 on the DXY, and staying informed about broader market influences, investors can better navigate these complex waters and potentially capitalize on the evolving market landscape. The current situation demands vigilance and informed decision-making, but for those prepared, the rewards could be substantial.

This heightened enthusiasm coincides with steady growth in overall crypto market capitalization. KAITO, SEI, and GROK’s Popularity According to Santiment’s February 21 report , KAITO, the native token of AI platform Kaito, is generating significant buzz due to its listings on major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and KuCoin. Crypto enthusiasts are actively discussing its trading activity, price predictions, and ongoing airdrop claims. The project’s features and tokenomics are further fueling excitement, making it one of the most talked-about assets in the community. Additionally, YAP has emerged as a key term in discussions related to Kaito due to its innovative “tweet-to-earn” mechanism. Developed by the AI platform, the YAP leaderboard incentivizes users to post about crypto on social media. After linking their accounts and crypto wallets, individuals can earn points called “Yaps” based on the engagement on their posts. Santiment highlighted that this system has led to the colloquial use of “yap” as a unit of value or transaction within the Kaito ecosystem. On the other hand, SEI has seen heightened attention following Trump-backed World Liberty Financial’s purchase of 547,990 SEI tokens for $125,000, on its way to amassing a $370 million crypto stash. The analysis reveals that this acquisition has started debates about institutional interest in SEI and its potential impact on the broader crypto market. Grok is trending due to its association with Elon Musk’s latest AI initiative, Grok 3. People have been sharing their experiences with the platform’s real-time knowledge, deep search functionalities, and potential impact on the financial advisory space. Users are also comparing its capabilities to other AI models, particularly in the context of crypto and investment strategies. The excitement is further fueled by the project being free to use. More Trending Tokens Other coins on Santiment’s list include Bitcoin (BTC) and Bittensor (TAO). Bitcoin remains a focal point of conversation, with analysts forecasting significant price milestones. Some projections suggest the coin could go back above $100,000 in the near future and break past the $200,000 level by 2027. Discussions on the flagship cryptocurrency are focused on its current trading status, market cap, and external influences, such as U.S. economic conditions, which could impact its price trajectory. Meanwhile, TAO has gained traction following its recent listing on Coinbase. This has led to speculation about its growth potential and optimism surrounding the dTAO launch. There is also talk about its price movements, with many users expressing positivity about its future performance. Analysts suggest that the token could be entering a bullish phase after a prolonged downtrend, adding to the excitement surrounding its market activity.

The hack triggered reactions from various corners. Elliptic’s Chief Scientist called the hack “the largest crypto theft of all time, by some margin.” Bybit Suffers Largest Hack In History The hack was noticed by on-chain investigator ZachXBT, who flagged suspicious outflows of over $1.4 billion from the crypto exchange. The investigator also listed addresses that were receiving the outflows. Meanwhile, Bybit reported an unauthorized Ethereum (ETH) transfer from its cold wallets due to masked UI spoofing accounts. However, the exchange assured its customers that all other wallets remained secure. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou took X to confirm the hack, stating that the exchange’s multisig cold wallet had been transferred to their warm wallet. According to Zhou, the hackers musked this specific transaction as all the signers saw the masked UI, showing them the correct address and the URL were from the SAFE platform. However, he added that the signing message was to change the smart contract logic of their ETH cold wallet, allowing them to take control of the specific ETH cold wallet they signed and transfer it to an unidentified address. Zhao also assured customers that other wallets were unaffected and that withdrawals were normal. He also called upon teams that could help track the stolen funds. Here is Zhou’s post in full, “Bybit ETH multisig cold wallet just transferred to our warm wallet about 1 hr ago. It appears that this specific transaction was musked, all the signers saw the musked UI, which showed the correct address, and the URL was from @safe. However, the signing message was to change the smart contract logic of our ETH cold wallet. This resulted in Hacker taking control of the specific ETH cold wallet. We signed and transferred all ETH in the cold wallet to this unidentified address. Please rest assured that all other cold wallets are secure. All withdrawals are NORMAL. I will keep you guys posted as more develops. If any team can help us to track the stolen funds, it would be appreciated.” Crypto Ecosystem Reacts Elliptic’s Chief Scientist, Tom Robinson, called the hack the biggest crypto theft of all time by some distance, pointing out the next largest was the $611 million stolen from the Poly Network in 2021. “This makes it the largest crypto theft of all time, by some margin. The next largest crypto theft would be the $611 million stolen from Poly Network in 2021. It may even be the largest single theft of all time. We've labeled the thief's addresses in our software to help prevent these funds from being cashed out through other exchanges.” Binance founder and former CEO Changpeng Zhao offered Bybit assistance and suggested pausing withdrawals. “Not an easy situation to deal with. Suggest stopping withdrawals for a bit as a standard security precaution. Will provide any assistance if needed.” Meanwhile, Arkham Intelligence offered a bounty to track down the individual or individuals responsible for the hack. “We’ve created and funded a bounty to help identify the person or organization behind today’s [over] $1 billion Bybit hack. Submissions to this bounty will be shared with the Bybit team to support their investigation. Reward: 50,000 ARKM.” ZachXBT later revealed that the Lazarus Group was responsible. Tron founder Justin Sun said they are closely monitoring the Bybit hack and would offer all assistance in tracking the relevant funds. Bybit Remains Solvent Bybit CEO Zhou assured customers the exchange remains solvent even if the stolen $1.4 billion is not recovered, adding that all client funds are covered 1 to 1, and the exchange can cover all losses. Data from CoinMarketCap shows the exchange had reserve assets worth $16.2 billion before the hack. The stolen funds account for around 8.60% of the platform’s reserves. “Bybit is Solvent, even if this hack loss is not recovered, all of the client assets are 1 to 1 backed. We can cover the loss.” Flashbots strategy head Hasu also stated that despite the scale of the hack, it would not lead to the demise of Bybit, assuring followers the exchange was good for the money. “If you want my serious take, Bybit has way more than 1.4 billion in revenue per year. They are good for the money and will make all customers whole. It doesn't matter for ETH because Bybit will honor customers's ETH liabilities and buy back the assets on the open market.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As market jitters grow of a looming ETH sell-off when these hackers start cashing out, crypto traders are rushing to identify the best crypto to buy if Ethereum price experiences violent swings. With Ethereum price under bearish pressure, let us explore the top three Korean altcoins with the potential to perform well. Top 3 Korean Crypto to Buy After Bybit’s $1.5B Ethereum Hack The $1.5 billion Bybit hack shook the crypto markets as Bitcoin and most altcoins retraced, leading to the total crypto market cap dropping by 2% to $3.17 trillion. Despite this dip, three altcoins have stood out due to their potential to swiftly recover from these headwinds. Pi Network Token (PI) Pi Network Token, a newly launched crypto that has already secured the backing of major cryptocurrency exchanges is the best crypto to invest in due to rising market interest. Despite the pullback across the broader market today, Pi Coin is up by 8.5% to trade at $0.756. The altcoin has jumped by 23% from its all-time low of $0.61 registered on February 20, 2025. After experiencing intense selling activity in the last two days, Pi Coin is recovering to target resistance at $0.80. A swing above this level could lead to gains past $1, paving the way for a rally to the $3.4 all-time high . Given that the Pi network token is barely three days old, its Relative Strength Index (RSI) to measure buying activity and momentum can only be tracked on a 15-minute chart. The RSI has risen to 64 after making a series of highs, suggesting that buying pressure is growing and the momentum is bullish. PI/USDT: 15M Chart This bullish outlook makes the Pi token a top crypto to buy to mitigate the risks of a possible Ethereum selloff. Ripple (XRP) Ripple price has retained its bullish outlook despite the recent pullback, making it a top crypto to buy for Korean investors. XRP price today trades at $2.58 and continued to defend support at an ascending channel, suggesting a bullish continuation. After bouncing yet again from the lower trendline of the ascending parallel channel, XRP needs to flip the midline for a sustained uptrend to the upper trendline. The key resistance level to watch for this altcoin is $2.83. XRP/USDT: 4H Chart Ripple is also on the verge of a breakthrough in its legal case with the US securities regulator, which is bullish for the XRP price. According to Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terett, the SEC is likely to “ favorably settle cases ” with crypto firms under the new SEC Chair. Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin has outperformed the altcoin market in the last month, making it one of the best cryptos to buy after the Bybit hack. For context, Bitcoin’s dominance has gradually risen and recently reached its highest level since 2021. Bitcoin Dominance When Bitcoin’s dominance rises, it shows that BTC is outperforming altcoins, or that its declines have been marginal compared to those of altcoins. Such a rise also shows that crypto investors are moving from riskier altcoins to Bitcoin. Therefore, it makes sense that investors could start buying Bitcoin after the $1.5 billion Ethereum hack on Bybit. Conclusion: Best Korean Crypto to Buy Traders looking for the best crypto to buy after the Bybit hack can explore Pi Network Token, XRP, or Bitcoin. These coins have a strong bullish setup and the ability to gain or outperform the broader market even if the North Korean Lazarus hacker group starts selling off ETH.

Buterin was yet to reply as of time of publication. The Bybit hack came into light on Friday when on-chain analyst ZachXBT noted suspicious outflows of over $1.4 billion from the exchange, with the attacker quickly swapping mETH and stETH for ether through a decentralized exchange. The attacker then split 10,000 ETH to 39 different addresses and another 10,000 ETH to nine addresses, Gautham Santhosh, co-founder of Polynomial.fi, explained on X. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou said that the hacker ""took control of the specific ETH cold wallet and transferred all the ETH in the cold wallet to this unidentified address."" Zhou confirmed that the exchange ""is solvent even if this hack loss is not recovered."" One of the potential ways to address hacking is to roll back the blockchain. It involves reverting the blockchain to a state before the occurrence of a specific event, in this case, the hack. That way, malicious transactions resulting from the hack can be erased, effectively restoring lost or stolen funds. Implementing a rollback requires consensus from the network participants. For instance, in 2016, the Ethereum network was rolled back using a hard fork to reverse a theft of $60 million in ether from The DAO (30% of all ETH in circulation back then). The hard fork split the chain into two – Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. In 2019, Binance's CEO Changpeng Zhao and his team considered pushing for a rollback on the Bitcoin network following a $40 million hack. However, the Bitcoin mining community criticized the idea of going back against the principle of decentralization and immutability, which are fundamental to blockchain technology. Immutability is a security feature that prevents data from being changed after it's added to the blockchain to make it trustworthy and tamper-proof. There are similar concerns regarding a potential Ethereum rollover. ""I wish we could roll back for the Bybit hack, I'm not against the idea. But the DAO hack was 15% of ETH with a clean recovery path. Today, a rollback would break bridges, stablecoins, L2s, RWAs and so much more. ETH ecosystem is just too interconnected now for a clean solution like 2016,"" Santhosh said. Sina 21st Capital explained that Ethereum is now stuck between a rock and a hard place. ""Ethereum is toast. They can roll back the chain and destroy what is left of the decentralization claim or allow North Korean baad actors to keep $1.4B of ETH and unleash an eternal internal battle. Either way, it is terrible,"" Sina 21st Capital said on X . Ether has dropped nearly 3% in 24 hours, but continues to trade rangebound between $2,600 and $2,800, CoinDesk data show.",Markets|Hack|Ethereum|Bybit|Vitalik Buterin|Arthur Hayes,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FORKS|BLOCKCHAIN|ETC|BTC,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-22 07:09:37

This article dives into the negative implications of memecoins, exploring how they distort markets, invite scams, undermine the promise of blockchain technology and interfere with market cycles by diverting and diluting liquidity that would otherwise go to promising projects with actual utility. AI agents in cryptocurrency are autonomous software programs powered by artificial intelligence that operate within blockchain and crypto ecosystems to perform specific tasks with little to no human intervention. The cryptocurrency market has always been a rollercoaster of innovation, speculation, and volatility. In recent years, memecoins — cryptocurrencies born from internet memes or humorous concepts like Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ), Shiba Inu ( SHIB-USD ), and newer entries like $TRUMP or $HAWK — have surged into the spotlight. Fueled by social media hype, celebrity endorsements, and retail investor fervor, memecoins have ballooned into a $100 billion-plus market segment by late 2024. While they’ve brought new users and excitement to crypto, their rise comes with serious downsides that threaten the industry’s credibility, stability, and long-term growth. This article dives into the negative implications of memecoins, exploring how they distort markets, invite scams, undermine the promise of blockchain technology and interfere with market cycles by diverting and diluting liquidity that would otherwise go to promising projects with actual utility. A Distorted Market: Speculation Over Substance Memecoins thrive on hype, not utility. Unlike Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), designed as a decentralized currency, or Ethereum, a platform for smart contracts, most memecoins offer little to no real-world function. Their value hinges on viral attention — think Elon Musk tweeting about Dogecoin or Iggy Azalea launching Mother Iggy (MOTHER) with a cheeky butt-themed logo. This speculation-first approach sucks oxygen from projects with genuine innovation. In Q1 2024, top memecoins posted returns over 1,300%, outpacing many fundamentally strong altcoins. Retail investors, chasing quick riches, pour money into these tokens, leaving less capital for decentralized finance (DeFi), privacy coins, or scalable blockchains. This skews the market’s priorities. Developers and founders of legitimate projects struggle to stand out amid the memecoin noise. Why grind on a complex protocol when a dog-themed token can hit a billion-dollar market cap overnight? The result is a “clown show” perception — regulators and traditional finance see crypto as a casino, not a transformative technology. Posts on X echo this frustration, with users lamenting how memecoins have “fucked the altcoin market” by turning it into “literal gambling.” The data backs this up: by December 2024, memecoins dropped 30% in market cap in a single month, dragging down broader sentiment as speculative bubbles burst. More recently, we can see the following declines for leading memecoins in the past month: DOGE -34% SHIB -27% PEPE ( PEPE-USD ) -41% TRUMP ( TRUMP-USD ) -57% BONK ( BONK-USD ) -54% Memecoins turn crypto into a speculative gamble, akin to a slot machine. Memecoins’ low entry barriers — thanks to platforms like Pump.Fun, which spawned 4.7 million tokens in 2024 — make them a breeding ground for scams. Rug pulls, where creators hype a coin then vanish with liquidity pool funds, are rampant. Take WSB Coin: launched in 2023 by a WallStreetBets moderator, it crashed after an insider dumped tokens, wiping out investors. Or $HAWK, tied to the “Hawk Tuah” meme, which peaked at $490 million in December 2024 before plummeting 95% as promoters cashed out. Nansen’s February 2025 report on Argentina’s $LIBRA memecoin is even grimmer: 86% of traders lost $251 million, while insiders pocketed $180 million. Pump-and-dump schemes are just as common. Influencers and celebrities — like Caitlyn Jenner or Andrew Tate in 2024 — hype tokens on social media, driving prices up before selling at the peak. Cointelegraph notes influencers now face fines for such antics, but the damage is done: latecomers, often less savvy retail investors, bear the losses. The blockchain’s transparency catches some culprits — X posts from 2024 warned “it’s forever immutable” — yet enforcement lags, and scammers adapt with fake presales or phishing tricks. This erodes trust in crypto, especially among newcomers lured by memecoin hype only to get burned. Investors should be careful trusting social media personalities that only show their wins and ignore all of their losses. Most memecoin pumps require investors to be in within the first hour and out within another hour or two to capture any profit. It is mostly insiders that know about a coin launching ahead of the public that are able to capture large gains. In the equity markets, this is considered insider trading and is illegal and punishable by jail time. Regulatory Blowback: A Hammer Waiting to Fall Memecoins' antics don’t just hurt wallets — they invite regulatory crackdowns. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has long eyed crypto for securities violations, and memecoins are low-hanging fruit. A July 2024 Cointelegraph piece flagged how celebrity shilling — like Jason Derulo’s token flops — could breach U.S. laws if marketed as investments. The Howey Test, which defines securities, considers “marketing” a factor; memecoin ads screaming “to the moon” fit the bill. Dogwifhat’s (WIF) $600,000 Las Vegas Sphere stunt in 2024? That’s a red flag to regulators. When memecoins dominate, they paint crypto as unserious, slowing mainstream adoption. Serious players — banks, governments — hesitate to engage with a market where a squirrel-themed coin (PNUT) hits $1.2 billion after a viral euthanization story. Institutional investors, who tripled memecoin holdings to $204.8 million by March 2024, might rethink their bets if regulators clamp down. An X user in February 2025 warned Solana’s memecoin craze risks it becoming a “meme chain” under scrutiny, not a credible Layer 1 blockchain. The fallout? Tighter rules, higher compliance costs, and a harder road for legitimate projects. The industry has worked too hard for regulatory clarity and to remove regulatory risk, just to allow a small group of shady KOLs to profit from the demise of other crypto investors in a zero-sum game. Memecoins’ wild ride could bring down the regulatory gavel on crypto. Liquidity and Volatility: A House of Cards Memecoins’ speculative nature creates a liquidity nightmare. With prices driven by tweets or TikTok trends, not fundamentals, they’re prone to violent swings. December 2024 saw a 32% memecoin market cap drop — from $137 billion to $92 billion — in weeks, per CoinMarketCap. Low liquidity amplifies this: sparse traders mean wide bid-ask spreads and easy manipulation. Whales can spike prices, then yank liquidity, leaving others stranded. High leverage in memecoin markets — common on decentralized exchanges — turns small dips into cascading sell-offs, as OneSafe’s blog noted in 2024. This volatility spills over. When Dogecoin tumbled 25% post-Fed meeting in December 2024, it hit harder than Bitcoin’s dip, per Fortune Crypto. Memecoins’ “beta bet” status — leveraged plays on native tokens like Solana’s SOL — means their crashes can drag down bigger ecosystems. ScienceDirect’s 2021 study found memecoins’ positive net spillovers signal bubbles that crash leading coins like Bitcoin. Retail investors, burned by these swings, may abandon crypto entirely, shrinking the market’s base. The Cultural Cost: Undermining Crypto’s Vision Crypto began with a promise: decentralization, financial sovereignty, a better system. Memecoins mock that. They’re not about empowerment — they’re about “degeneracy,” as Azeem Khan told WIRED in January 2025. The focus shifts from building to gambling, from utility to absurdity. Medium’s Gaze All Over argued in 2024 that memecoins “represent everything wrong” with crypto’s value system, burying meaningful projects under hype. Even their upside — drawing newbies — fades when those newbies lose it all and leave disillusioned. The community angle, a memecoin selling point, often masks grift. Shiba Inu’s ecosystem (Shibarium, ShibaSwap) tries to add utility, but most memecoins remain digital collectibles at best, Ponzi schemes at worst. X posts in 2025 called them “thousands upon thousands” of gambling tokens, diluting crypto’s ethos. If the market becomes a meme-fueled casino, the dream of a decentralized future fades. AI Agents Offers Better Promise than Memecoins AI agents can offer the same artistic and comedic value of a memecoin, but with actual utility. AI agents in cryptocurrency are autonomous software programs powered by artificial intelligence that operate within blockchain and crypto ecosystems to perform specific tasks with little to no human intervention. Think of them as smart digital assistants tailored for the fast-paced, decentralized world of crypto. Unlike traditional trading bots that follow rigid, pre-set rules, AI agents can learn, adapt, and make decisions based on real-time data, leveraging machine learning (ML), large language models (LLMs), and other AI techniques. They’re reshaping how users interact with cryptocurrencies, from trading to managing decentralized finance ((DEFI)) protocols, and even sparking new market trends. Some AI agents have even built businesses autonomously, given access to crypto wallets to deploy capital into the real world. Some have created music, promoted it on social media and generated revenue from streaming songs, all with little to no human intervention. Other AI agents are able to manage investment portfolios, filtering through magnitudes more data than a human could ever accomplish and doing it 24/7. Imagine a personal trader that never sleeps, constantly scans the market, and adjusts your portfolio while you’re offline — that’s an AI agent in crypto. With this great access to data, financials, emerging trends and the ability to trade faster on news, AI Agent investing bots or AI Agent hedge funds are already showing the promise to outperform human-led hedge funds or investment advisors by a wide margin. AI agents follow a dynamic process: Data Collection: They pull in massive amounts of data — blockchain transactions, market prices, social media sentiment (e.g., X posts), news feeds, or even key opinion leader (KOL) chatter. Analysis: Using ML algorithms or LLMs (like those behind ChatGPT), they process this data to spot patterns, predict trends, or assess risks. For example, an agent might analyze 400+ influencers’ takes to gauge a token’s hype. Decision-Making: Based on their analysis, they decide what to do — buy, sell, swap tokens, adjust a portfolio, or even mint a new coin. Execution: They act on-chain, interacting with smart contracts or wallets to carry out trades or other tasks autonomously. Learning: Over time, they refine their strategies, getting smarter with each cycle. Of course, not all AI agents are created equally and many are just glorified chatbots. So, investors need to be analyze the market closely and be very selecting when investment in AI Agent tokens. By February 20, 2025, AI agent tokens hit a $7 billion market cap (CoinGecko), with forecasts eyeing $40 billion in five years. They’re not just tools — they’re becoming economic players, holding wallets, driving trends, and reshaping crypto’s narrative. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong predicts “hundreds of millions” of agents, while Crypto.com’s Eric Anziani sees “trillions of transactions” on-chain. Posts on X hype them as “the future of trading,” flagging scams or minting memecoins in seconds. Until today, AI Agents mostly traded on decentralized exchanges and were not able to secure listings on major centralized exchanges. But Coinbase just listed Bittensor (TAO-USD) and the token is up 22% in the past week alone. Bittensor is an open-source protocol that utilizes blockchain technology to create a decentralized machine learning network. It is the largest market cap token focused on AI in the crypto sector, but is still not well understood. Bittensor’s vision for a decentralized AI company has captivated a large number of people in the arenas of Artificial Intelligence and computer science, who have yearned for an alternative to the top-down world being created by our current technology giants. At Nicoya Research, we think there is significant upside ahead for TAO over the next 6 months. But we also hold a number of smaller-cap AI plays that are more focused on the development of AI agents. Most of these tokens had a massive run higher at the end of 2024 and into January 2025. Many of these tokens that we hold or track increased 10x or more in value during that time period, but have since given back most of those gains. This dip following the initial mania might provide investors that missed the first explosive move higher with another opportunity to buy at oversold valuations. Conclusion: A Reckoning Looms Memecoins are a double-edged sword. They’ve injected energy and users into crypto, but the cost is steep: distorted markets, rampant scams, regulatory risk, destabilizing volatility, and a tarnished mission. The $100 billion memecoin market of 2024 may grow “crazier,” as Khan predicts, but bubbles burst. When they do, the fallout could stall crypto’s progress for years. Investors should tread carefully — blockchain tracks every move — and the industry must refocus on substance over memes. A better alternative for cryptocurrency investors may be in Artificial Intelligence Agents that run on blockchains and have access to capital (crypto) to actually generate value in the real world. This generated value can be returned to token holders. Taking it a step further, AI Agents have the potential to free humanity from monotonous busy work and allow more free time to pursue true passions during our short trip on this planet. There is an upside to humanity in their development, which is more than can be said about the current memecoin craze.

40676556,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133014,1740208764,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent Relief: Bybit Withdrawals Fully Restored After Lazarus Group Hack, Security Overhaul Coming",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bybit-withdrawals-restored-security/,"In a sigh of relief for Bybit users, CEO Ben Zhou has officially announced the complete restoration of the exchange’s withdrawal system. This welcome news follows a challenging period sparked by a significant security breach. If you were among those anxiously awaiting access to your funds on Bybit, you can now breathe easy. But what exactly happened, and what steps are being taken to prevent future incidents and enhance crypto exchange security ? Let’s dive into the details of this developing story. Bybit Withdrawals Back Online: What Happened? The crypto world was recently shaken by news of a substantial hack targeting Bybit, with reports indicating a staggering $1.46 billion in ETH stolen from their cold wallets. Attribution pointed towards North Korea’s notorious Lazarus Group, known for their sophisticated cybercriminal activities. This attack understandably caused panic and disruption, leading to temporary suspension of Bybit withdrawals . Here’s a quick rundown of the key events: Security Breach: Bybit experienced a sophisticated cold wallet hack, allegedly perpetrated by the Lazarus Group. Withdrawal Suspension: As a precautionary measure, Bybit temporarily halted withdrawals to address the security vulnerability and secure user funds. Swift Response: The Bybit team worked diligently to investigate the breach, restore the withdrawal system, and implement enhanced security protocols. Full Restoration: CEO Ben Zhou confirmed via X (formerly Twitter) that Bybit withdrawals are now fully operational, with all pending requests processed without delay. CEO Ben Zhou’s Assurance: More Security Measures on the Horizon In his official announcement, Ben Zhou , CEO of Bybit, conveyed a message of transparency and reassurance. He apologized for the inconvenience caused by the withdrawal suspension and expressed gratitude to the Bybit community for their patience and support. Crucially, Zhou emphasized that this incident is a catalyst for strengthening Bybit’s security infrastructure. Here are the key takeaways from Ben Zhou’s statement: Withdrawals Fully Restored: The primary message is clear – users can now access their funds without any issues. Incident Report Coming: Bybit is committed to transparency and will release a detailed incident report outlining the events that transpired. New Security Measures: Zhou promised the imminent implementation of enhanced security measures to prevent similar incidents in the future and bolster overall crypto exchange security . Gratitude and Commitment: He thanked users, partners, and friends for their support, acknowledging that strengthening security is an ongoing process. Lazarus Group Hack: A Stark Reminder of Crypto Security Threats The alleged involvement of the Lazarus Group hack in this incident underscores the persistent and evolving threats within the cryptocurrency space. The Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking organization, is notorious for targeting financial institutions and cryptocurrency platforms to generate revenue for the regime. Their methods are sophisticated, often involving advanced persistent threats (APTs) and meticulous planning. This incident serves as a potent reminder of several critical aspects: Cold Wallet Vulnerabilities: Even cold wallets, designed for offline storage and enhanced security, are not entirely impervious to sophisticated attacks. State-Sponsored Actors: The involvement of state-sponsored groups like the Lazarus Group signifies the high stakes and resources involved in cryptocurrency cybercrime. Importance of Vigilance: Both exchanges and individual users must remain vigilant and proactive in adopting robust security practices to mitigate risks. Ongoing Security Evolution: The cybersecurity landscape is constantly changing, requiring continuous adaptation and improvement of security measures within the crypto industry. Strengthening Crypto Security Measures: What Can Exchanges Do? In the wake of incidents like the Lazarus Group hack targeting Bybit, the spotlight intensifies on the crucial need for robust crypto security measures . What concrete steps can cryptocurrency exchanges take to safeguard user assets and maintain trust in the ecosystem? Here are some key areas of focus: Security Measure Description Benefit Multi-Signature Wallets Requiring multiple private keys to authorize transactions, adding layers of security. Reduces single points of failure and makes unauthorized access significantly harder. Regular Security Audits Independent security firms conduct thorough assessments of systems and infrastructure. Identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Advanced Intrusion Detection Systems Real-time monitoring of network traffic and system activity to detect and respond to threats. Enables rapid response to security breaches, minimizing potential damage. Employee Security Training Educating employees about phishing attacks, social engineering, and secure coding practices. Reduces human error, a significant factor in many security breaches. Bug Bounty Programs Incentivizing ethical hackers to identify and report security vulnerabilities. Leverages the wider security community to proactively find and fix weaknesses. Enhanced KYC/AML Procedures Strengthening Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes. Helps prevent illicit activities and reduces the risk of the platform being used for illegal purposes. Actionable Insights: What Crypto Users Should Consider While exchanges bear the primary responsibility for platform security, individual users also play a vital role in safeguarding their crypto assets. Here are some actionable insights for crypto users to enhance their personal security: Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Employ complex passwords and avoid reusing them across multiple platforms. Consider using a password manager. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Activate 2FA on all crypto exchange accounts and wallets for an extra layer of security. Be Phishing Aware: Exercise caution with emails, messages, and links, especially those requesting personal information or login credentials. Use Hardware Wallets: For long-term storage of significant crypto holdings, consider using hardware wallets for offline cold storage. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with the latest security news and best practices in the cryptocurrency space. Conclusion: A Renewed Focus on Crypto Exchange Security Bybit’s swift response to the security breach and the full restoration of Bybit withdrawals are positive developments. However, the incident, allegedly linked to the Lazarus Group hack , serves as a critical wake-up call for the entire cryptocurrency industry. The promise of enhanced security measures from Bybit, and hopefully from other exchanges as well, signals a renewed commitment to protecting user assets and fostering a more secure crypto ecosystem. As the industry matures, prioritizing robust security will be paramount to building trust and ensuring the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies.

40676611,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133015,1740208854,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Sudden $67M ETH Exodus: Why Galaxy Digital Pulled Funds from Bybit Crypto Exchange?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/galaxy-digital-eth-withdrawal-bybit/,"In a noteworthy crypto market move, prominent institutional player Galaxy Digital has initiated a significant withdrawal of Ethereum (ETH) from the Bybit exchange. On-chain data reveals that an address linked to Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter (OTC) trading operations transferred a substantial 25,000 ETH, valued at approximately $67.12 million, out of Bybit just an hour ago, according to insights from Arkham Intelligence. This sudden and substantial transaction has sparked curiosity and speculation within the cryptocurrency community, raising questions about the motivations behind this large-scale asset movement. Why Did Galaxy Digital Initiate This Massive ETH Withdrawal? The withdrawal of 25,000 ETH by Galaxy Digital from Bybit is not an isolated event. Data from Arkham Intelligence further indicates that within the preceding 40 minutes, the same address associated with Galaxy Digital also executed withdrawals of around 200,000 USDC and an additional 90 ETH. This series of transactions suggests a deliberate and potentially strategic asset reshuffling by Galaxy Digital. But what could be driving this activity? Let’s delve into some potential reasons: Strategic Asset Rebalancing: Institutional investors like Galaxy Digital frequently manage vast portfolios across multiple exchanges and custody solutions. This ETH withdrawal could be part of a routine asset rebalancing strategy, optimizing their holdings based on market conditions, risk assessments, or internal investment mandates. They might be consolidating assets for better management or redeploying capital into different opportunities. OTC Trading Desk Operations: Galaxy Digital’s OTC trading desk facilitates large-volume cryptocurrency trades for institutional clients. Withdrawals of this magnitude could be directly related to fulfilling client orders or managing inventory for upcoming trades. The crypto exchange landscape is dynamic, and OTC desks need to ensure they have sufficient liquidity to meet client demands. Risk Mitigation Post-Bybit Hack: It’s crucial to remember that Bybit recently experienced a significant security breach, suffering a $1.4 billion ETH theft attributed to the North Korean Lazarus Group. While Bybit has taken steps to address the aftermath of this hack, institutional investors like Galaxy Digital, known for their risk-averse approach, might be proactively reducing their exposure on exchanges that have faced recent security challenges. This ETH withdrawal could be a precautionary measure to safeguard assets. Seeking Better Yield Opportunities: The decentralized finance (DeFi) space offers various yield-generating opportunities. Galaxy Digital might be moving these assets to participate in staking, lending, or other DeFi protocols to enhance returns. Institutional investors are increasingly exploring DeFi for yield enhancement, and moving ETH off centralized exchanges could be a step in this direction. Understanding Galaxy Digital’s Role in the Crypto Ecosystem Galaxy Digital, founded by Michael Novogratz, is a leading financial services and investment management innovator in the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. They are a prominent player catering to institutional investors seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Their services span across: Service Area Description Significance Asset Management Offers a range of crypto investment funds and strategies. Provides structured investment vehicles for institutional participation. Trading Operates an OTC trading desk facilitating large crypto transactions. Enables discreet and efficient execution of substantial trades. Investment Banking Advises crypto companies on fundraising and M&A activities. Supports the growth and maturation of the crypto industry. Mining Engages in Bitcoin mining operations. Contributes to the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Galaxy Digital’s activities provide crucial infrastructure and access points for traditional financial institutions to enter the crypto space. Their movements, like this recent ETH withdrawal , are closely watched as indicators of institutional sentiment and broader market trends. Bybit’s Security Challenges: A Lingering Concern? Bybit, while a popular crypto exchange with a wide range of trading products and services, has recently been under scrutiny due to a significant security breach. The $1.4 billion ETH theft, attributed to the Lazarus Group, is a stark reminder of the inherent risks associated with centralized exchanges. While Bybit has reportedly taken measures to compensate affected users and bolster its security protocols, the incident undoubtedly casts a shadow. For institutional investors like Galaxy Digital, security is paramount. The Lazarus Group hack might have prompted a reassessment of risk exposure on Bybit, leading to a more cautious approach. This doesn’t necessarily imply a lack of confidence in Bybit’s future security measures, but rather reflects a prudent risk management strategy in the wake of a major security event. The timing of this ETH withdrawal shortly after reports about the hack recovery certainly raises questions about a possible correlation. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market? While the exact reasons behind Galaxy Digital’s ETH withdrawal remain speculative, this event offers several actionable insights for crypto market participants: Institutional Activity is a Key Market Driver: Transactions of this scale highlight the growing influence of institutional players in the crypto market. Their actions can significantly impact market liquidity and price movements. Monitoring institutional flows becomes increasingly important for understanding market dynamics. Security Remains Paramount for Exchanges: The Bybit hack underscores the critical importance of robust security measures for crypto exchanges . Users, especially institutional clients, will likely prioritize exchanges with a proven track record of security and transparency. Exchanges must continuously invest in and enhance their security infrastructure to maintain trust and attract large capital inflows. Risk Management is Crucial for Crypto Investors: Whether you are an individual investor or a large institution, risk management is essential in the volatile crypto market. Diversifying holdings across multiple exchanges and custody solutions, and staying informed about security risks, are vital practices. Monitor On-Chain Data for Market Signals: On-chain analytics tools like Arkham Intelligence provide valuable insights into market activity. Tracking large withdrawals and inflows can offer early signals of potential market shifts and institutional strategies. Conclusion: A Calculated Move or a Sign of Shifting Tides? Galaxy Digital’s substantial ETH withdrawal from Bybit is a significant event that warrants attention. Whether it’s a routine portfolio rebalancing, OTC desk operations, a risk mitigation strategy following Bybit’s security incident, or a combination of factors, this move underscores the increasing sophistication and institutionalization of the cryptocurrency market. It serves as a reminder of the complex interplay between market dynamics, security considerations, and the strategic decisions of major players like Galaxy Digital. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, keeping a close watch on these large-scale movements will be crucial for navigating the market effectively.

Analyst Explains",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/as-bitcoin-sell-pressure-fades-could-a-local-bottom-be-forming-analyst-explains/,"According to an X post by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin (BTC) is witnessing a decline in sell-side pressure, indicating that a local market bottom may soon form for the premier cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Local Bottom On The Horizon? Bitcoin continues to trade just below the psychologically significant $100,000 level, hovering at $98,650 at the time of writing. However, the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization is witnessing a notable drop in sell-side pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin 4-Year CAGR Drops To 14.45% But Still Outshines Gold, Stocks – Details Martinez shared the following Bitcoin Sell-Side Risk Ratio chart from crypto analytics platform Glassnode, highlighting a sharp decline in the metric since mid-January 2025. This drop suggests that BTC may be forming a local price bottom, potentially leading to a new accumulation phase. For those unfamiliar, a declining sell-side risk ratio typically indicates that investors are holding onto their BTC rather than selling, signalling the early stages of an accumulation phase where prices may stabilize or begin to rise. Martinez’s analysis aligns with broader crypto market cycle theories, which suggest that market bottoms are often followed by an accumulation phase. This phase, in turn, paves the way for a potential price increase. However, BTC must hold above key support levels to confirm this outlook. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital weighed in on Bitcoin’s price action, emphasizing the importance of a weekly close above $97,000 to maintain its higher low as support. The analyst shared a Bitcoin weekly chart, noting that while BTC has seen multiple wicks below its symmetrical triangle structure, the overall bullish pattern remains intact. However, failure to close above $97,000 on the weekly timeframe could increase the risk of further downside. Similarly, fellow analyst Daan Crypto Trades shared a bullish perspective, pointing out that BTC recently had a “solid break” from a descending channel structure. The analyst added: Just need to see the continuation now into the weekend to get a good base going into next week. $98K is key in the short term. Is BTC Primed For A New All-Time High? While Martinez suggests that BTC may be forming a local bottom, other analysts believe the cryptocurrency is gearing up for a move beyond $108,000, potentially reaching a new all-time high (ATH). Analyst Kevin, for instance, predicts that a short squeeze could propel BTC to $111,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin At Risk? Analyst Says Breaking This Price Level Could Spark Significant Volatility Similarly, recent analysis by Rekt Capital highlights that BTC is showing early signs of a bullish divergence which could break the digital asset’s bearish price momentum. At press time, BTC trades at $98,650, up 0.1% in the past 24 hours.

The firm’s registration statement explicitly mentions staking, which marks a significant move in the evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency-based investment products. According to the filing document, Franklin Templeton’s proposed Solana ETF would allow the fund to engage in staking activities and earn rewards in the form of SOL. “In exchange for any staking activity in which the Fund may participate, the Fund will receive certain staking rewards in Solana tokens, which rewards may be treated as income for the Fund,” the filing said. Franklin Templeton’s move comes amid growing interest in launching Solana ETFs, particularly following changes in SEC leadership and a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Under the previous administration, former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler took a cautious stance on crypto-related products. However, the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs following Grayscale’s landmark lawsuit against the SEC paved the way for Ethereum ETFs and potentially other crypto-based investment vehicles. Related News: Critical Levels to Watch for in Bitcoin Price Amid Hot News Firms seeking approval for their Solana ETFs are now in contact with the SEC to discuss the inclusion of staking. Last week, the agency’s newly formed crypto task force met with Jito Labs and Multicoin Capital to explore the feasibility of staking in exchange-traded products. Similar discussions have occurred regarding Ethereum ETFs. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is seeking permission for staking in Grayscale’s Ethereum ETFs, while Cboe BZX Exchange is seeking approval for 21Shares’ staking-enabled Ethereum ETF. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, believes that staking will eventually be allowed for all proof-of-stake assets within ETF structures: “At this point, it’s just a matter of when.” While regulatory clarity is still needed, Ethereum ETF staking applications are expected to be reviewed before those for Solana, according to Seyffart. Previously, many firms have removed staking from their ETF applications due to regulatory uncertainty. The SEC has noted that proof-of-stake tokens could be classified as securities, creating hurdles for their inclusion in regulated investment products. *This is not investment advice.

With a 40% purchase bonus and innovative tokenomics, 1Fuel is sparking excitement among crypto enthusiasts and industry experts alike for unprecedented long-term financial gains. Read on to discover how this innovative DeFi coin revolutionizes the market and creates fresh opportunities for seasoned investors and newcomers. JUP investors burned as the so-called best meme coin to invest in collapses Over the past week, the price of JUP tumbled, falling 20% from $0.996 to $0.782 . This decline appears linked to troubles in the Jupiter ecosystem following the Libra token launch. Promoted as the best meme coin to invest in, Libra’s value plummeted within hours, resulting in millions of dollars in losses. In response, Jupiter issued an official statement denying any involvement in the token’s issuance or fundraising and confirmed that no misconduct or insider trading had occurred. These developments have alarmed both investors and market analysts, as trust in JUP and its ecosystem is now at an all-time low. Following this event, JUP traders are beginning to eye 1Fuel, a new DeFi coin that has taken center stage and is expected to surge 100x post-launch. Institutional staking for NEAR goes live amid market volatility On February 20, 2025, Laser Digital launched the NEAR Adoption Fund, providing institutional investors with long-term exposure to NEAR tokens through staking. Powered by TruFin’s TruStake, the fund allows participation in blockchain consensus while earning staking rewards. This initiative aims to drive broader institutional adoption of NEAR, enhancing network security and scalability through increased staking activity. Over the last 20 days, NEAR’s value has fallen by more than 20%, dropping from $4.64 to $3.38 . This decline could be due to NEAR investors taking profits to invest in a new DeFi coin. In recent weeks, NEAR traders have been shifting their focus to 1Fuel, a new DeFi coin that offers a 40% purchase bonus and has 100x growth potential. 1Fuel’s 100x potential: Why traders are making the switch Following significant losses suffered by JUP and NEAR investors, many are now shifting focus to 1Fuel , an innovative DeFi coin offering renewed stability. 1Fuel’s robust tokenomics and advanced features have captured the attention of those seeking a safer investment.

Recently, analysts have revealed a staggering 15,000% ROI potential on emerging 1Fuel (OFT) , a new cryptocurrency with a unique cross-chain transaction feature. Investors from established crypto communities such as XRP and KAS are pouring into 1Fuel’s ongoing presale as talks of two new CEX listings begin. Priced at $0.018 per token, 1Fuel is emerging as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy for massive gains this year. So, why are key token holders buying 1Fuel? Let’s find out. What drives XRP RLUSD and Kaspa Investors? Compared to Bitcoin which uses a distributed blockchain whose transactions are processed and secured by proof-of-work mining, XRP processes transactions through a network of trusted validators on the XRP Ledger. The XRP RLUSD ledger adoption continues to grow as its total supply exceeded $120 million recently, according to Cryotoquant data. Kaspa on the other hand is driven in recent times by its GHOSTDAG protocol for super-fast transactions and unique blockDAG architecture that boosts scalability within its network. Investors who hold KAS and XRP are known in the crypto market for their adeptness in spotting projects with advanced transaction utility and scalability. This trend is driven by the idea that 1Fuel’s unique offering is far greater than most traditional tokens. In a market where investors are known to hunt for the best cryptocurrencies, this mass migration from XRP and KAS investors is a clear signal of 1Fuel’s high potential Is a 15,000% Potential Possible For 1Fuel? If there’s anything that has proven over the years, it’s that anything is possible in the crypto market. 1Fuel is quickly establishing itself as a game-changing project in the blockchain space. The question then remains, is 1Fuel’s cross-chain interoperability and ultra-fast transaction speed enough to get it to 15,000% ROI? 1Fuel users enjoy a variety of benefits. First, the cross-chain one-click feature brings a new meaning to privacy and affordability. With just one platform, traders can swap KAS for XRP, RLUSD for ADA, and more tokens across 10+ networks without ever leaving the 1Fuel platform. 1Fuel’s in-built privacy mixers and cold-storage solutions are there to ensure that users can move their assets quietly. This is evidenced by the current underground moves XRP and KAS investors are making. No one except the investors knows what’s up. The ongoing 1Fuel presale at just $0.018 has garnered over $2.3 million. With the upcoming launch of 1Fuel’s Beta Wallet, massive limited-time bonuses of up to 40% are currently up for grabs for investors who join the presale early . 1Fuel and CEX listings In One Sentence? What’s happening? As of the time of writing, rumors of two upcoming centralized exchange listings have surfaced in the market. When a token hits a CEX, it is expected to dramatically increase liquidity and expose such crypto to a broader audience. This includes retail and institutional investors alike. If 1Fuel makes it to a major CEX platform, this would not only validate 1Fuel’s credibility in the market but also provide a new gateway for investors using top cryptocurrency wallets to manage their assets. If the listing talks materialize soon, then XRP and KAS investors could see even more dramatic price surges in 1Fuel’s value. Conclusion Innovation and strategic growth are two factors XRP and KAS investors are considering as they shift to 1Fuel. With talks of two major CEX listings on the horizon, 1Fuel is well on its way to becoming a major utility token in the larger crypto market. Join 1Fuel today and enjoy an instant 40% bonus on your purchase!

Crypto analyst David Leung has provided a detailed breakdown of how the attack unfolded, revealing major lapses in Bybit’s security. Arkham reports that the bybit bybit - Centralised Exchange Crypto trading and Information hack happened through “ Blind Signing ,” a method that lets transactions be approved without seeing all the details. The attackers compromised Bybit’s ETH cold wallet, moving nearly $1.5 billion in assets into one wallet before spreading them across multiple wallets. Draining funds from the most secured platforms reveals the true nature of crypto assets since there are no uniform laws for international crimes it will be difficult for Bybit to recover the losses. In this context, Bybit has announced a 50,000 ARKM bounty for the attackers further investigations are on. Let’s see what happened and how to stay protected. https://twitter.com/dhkleung/status/1893073663391604753 How the Attack Happened The hackers deployed a trojan contract along with a backdoor contract, setting up a trap for Bybit’s upgradeable multisig wallet. They tricked the wallet’s signers into authorizing a seemingly harmless ERC-20 token transfer. However, this transaction contained a delegate call, a function that allowed them to alter the contract’s core logic. Instead of a simple transfer, the attackers used the trojan contract to replace the wallet’s master contract with their own backdoor contract, giving them full control. Once in control, the hackers executed commands to sweep all available ETH, mETH, stETH, and cmETH tokens from the wallet. Interestingly, the backdoor contract was built to do just two things—transfer ETH and ERC-20 tokens to an address of their choosing. This allowed them to quickly drain the funds before Bybit could react. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : North Korean Lazarus Group Behind $1B Bybit Hack – Arkham Intelligence , Security Red Flags Ignored Leung further pointed out several red flags that should have halted the transaction. First of all, the transfer was directed to an unlisted contract that wasn’t ERC-20 compliant, involved zero tokens, and used a delegate call, which modifies contract logic. These loopholes should have triggered a compliance check, yet the transaction was still approved. The fact that these security measures failed suggests the attackers had inside knowledge of Bybit’s operations. Could This Have Been Prevented? David emphasized that stronger pre- and post-signing security checks could have prevented the attack. If independent security layers had reviewed the transaction, they could have identified the suspicious elements before approval. The hack highlights the growing sophistication of crypto attacks and the urgent need for better security protocols in the industry. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Market dips like these often discourage investors, and to see how well XRP will fare for the rest of February, we consulted ChatGPT to predict what the asset’s price will be by March 1. The AI chatbot outlined three potential scenarios for the digital asset based on market factors and historical data. Despite the short-term dip, ChatGPT predicts a bullish scenario is more likely for XRP as it moves toward the end of the month. ChatGPT’s XRP Price Predictions ChatGPT emphasized that its predictions are speculative. However, based on market trends and potential catalysts, the AI model outlines these key scenarios: Bearish Case ($1.50 – $2.00) – If the crypto market faces continued pressure from regulatory uncertainty or economic downturns, XRP could struggle to maintain upward momentum. ChatGPT notes that “if the broader crypto market struggles and regulatory concerns resurface, XRP may face downward pressure.” Neutral Case ($2.50 – $3.00) – In a scenario where XRP continues its current trajectory without major disruptions, the cryptocurrency could remain within a stable range. This would reflect consistent market sentiment without significant bullish or bearish catalysts. This could also place the asset at $3, a level that an analyst recently predicted it would hit . Bullish Case ($3.50 – $5.00+) – If institutional adoption increases and the broader market enters a strong bullish phase, XRP could experience significant upward movement. ChatGPT suggests that rapid institutional growth this month and a market resurgence could push XRP to a new all-time high by March 1. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Will XRP Hit a New All-time High? Another well-respected crypto expert recently stated that banks revealing their partnerships with Ripple to use XRP could play a significant role in the asset’s growth . This massive institutional adoption suggested by ChatGPT could take this form, potentially pushing the digital asset to $5. The SEC has also agreed to dismiss its lawsuit against Coinbase , pending approval from its commissioners. This breakthrough has led many to speculate that the Ripple lawsuit will be dismissed next, and this could send XRP toward the $5 mark if it happens soon. While the current downturn has led to short-term losses, market conditions can rapidly shift in the cryptocurrency space. The potential for increased adoption, regulatory clarity, and improved sentiment in the broader financial markets could help drive XRP higher in the next two weeks.

Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) look set for a strong comeback as their fundamentals remain intact. Meanwhile, Rollblock (RBLK), the fastest growing Web3 gaming platform, could be the biggest winner of the year as analysts predict a potential 50x rally in 2025. Rollblock (RBLK): Disrupting A $500 Billion Industry With Blockchain Transparency Rollblock (RBLK) is bringing a revolutionary blockchain-powered approach to online gaming, eliminating shady, unfair practices and finally returning trust to an industry worth over $500 billion. This approach is clearly paying dividends—In December, the platform saw a 600% surge in new users, with over $1.75 million in wagered bids being placed . With more than 7,000 games on offer and a growing sports prediction league, Rollblock is capturing the attention of both crypto and traditional gaming enthusiasts. All bids are backed up on the immutable Ethereum blockchain to prevent any unscrupulous bid manipulation behind closed doors. Investor demand for RBLK has been rising lately, with the presale already attracting $10.5 million in inflows. Stage 10 tokens are currently priced at $0.06, and with major exchange listings on the horizon, prices are set to rise exponentially this year. For just one week, RBLK is offering an extraordinary 50% bonus on all RBLK purchases, making now the perfect time to take a position. The platform allocates up to 30% of its weekly revenue to buy back RBLK, with 60% of these tokens burned to reduce circulating supply while the remaining 40% funds staking rewards of up to 30% APY. This system supports long-term price appreciation and rewards long-term holders, making RBLK a compelling investment for crypto gem hunters. Cardano (ADA): Coming Upgrade Could Trigger A Recovery Cardano (ADA) has been trading around $0.81 today after gaining 3.3% in the last 24 hours. This is an encouraging sign, although Cardano still has work ahead of it to reverse its 20% decline in the last 30 days. Cardano was unable to sustain its price above $1 and has been struggling to regain any hint of bullish momentum in recent weeks. Despite this, Cardano developers have continued to ship improvements to the chain and the upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade could easily be the most bullish yet. Cardano CEO Charles Hoskinson recently announced that his teams are working around the clock to enable this upgrade, which could make Cardano one of the fastest blockchains in existence. If successful, this could propel the Cardano price beyond $3 this year. Solana (SOL): TVL Still Rising Despite Meme Controversy Solana (SOL) has rebounded 4.3% in the past 24 hours, currently trading at $179 after bouncing off support at $160. The Solana network has faced criticism over its handling of recent meme coin launches such as Libra and Melania, which resulted in investors losing hundreds of millions of dollars to insider snipers. However, Solana remains a crypto powerhouse, and its decentralized exchanges processed hundreds of billions of dollars last year. Solana DeFi is booming with $9.3 billion in total value locked right now. The Solana price will likely chop around here for some time before making another run towards $300 in the coming months. Rollblock Blows Its Competition Out Of The Water While Cardano and Solana are set for stunning rebounds, it is becoming clear that Rollblock (RBLK) presents the highest potential for returns this year. With its blockchain-based gaming model, RBLK is poised to challenge major industry players. Early investors could see explosive gains as many predict that its token price could reach $1 this bull run. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

While some traders anticipate a swift move past $2.46, others watch from the sidelines as a newer meme coin, Panshibi (SHIBI) – priced at $0.005 and over $1 million raised – captures attention as it is gearing up for a Coinbase listing. Whether XRP rebounds sharply or Panshibi emerges as the next star, both projects showcase the market’s appetite for high-upside assets. XRP Price Prediction: Eyeing $5? The XRP price prediction often hinges on technical patterns. Ripple’s coin sits at a pivotal $2.40 level, threatening either a breakout to $2.46 or a deeper slip. Some experts foresee a run toward $3.30, $4.20, or even $5.00 if bullish momentum holds. They note a classic triangle formation, a sign of indecision that often leads to volatile moves. Crossing $2.46 could validate an Elliott Wave pattern, ushering in a new cycle of gains. Conversely, losing support near $2.29 might tip XRP below $1.96, dimming hopes for a rally. Beyond charts, speculation about an XRP ETF fuels the XRP price prediction hype. Analysts see regulatory strides following Ripple’s partial legal victories, boosting investor confidence in the token’s longevity. Broader sentiment also matters: if altcoins like Ethereum or top meme coins rally, liquidity may flow into XRP. On the flip side, any negative legal twist or sudden meme coin mania could divert capital elsewhere. Thus, while a break above $2.46 opens a bullish path, caution abounds in an environment still prone to swift reversals. Panshibi (SHIBI): Panda Meme Meets Security While attention centers on the XRP price prediction, Panshibi (SHIBI) emerges as a promising underdog. Its presale, currently trading at $0.005/token, has attracted over $1 million from backers who see comedic branding married to stronger tokenomics. Liquidity is locked for 10 years and team tokens remain locked for two – moves aimed at limiting rug-pull risks that plague smaller meme coins. The panda motif stands out in a world dominated by dog-themed tokens, offering novelty that might appeal to risk-tolerant fans. Panshibi’s AI-driven “social-fi” platform encourages holders to stake, undertake quests and stay active, contrasting tokens that rely solely on fleeting hype. Early adopters argue that with its Coinbase listing soon, $SHIBI could mirror or outpace the gigantic gains once seen by dog-themed peers. This structured approach has lured in some whales who typically favor large-cap projects but now hunger for bigger payoffs. Chart Setups vs. Comedic Fervor While XRP price prediction hinges on chart formations and potential ETF sparks, Panshibi banks on its ability to maintain community interest and attract the interest of big players like Coinbase. Meme tokens flourish or flop on hype cycles and $SHIBI aims to keep traders interested beyond the initial push. By combining comedic flair and tangible security, the coin reflects a pivot in the meme sector, where long-term success might require more than social media surges. If XRP remains range-bound at nearly $2.40, some investors might rotate funds into meme plays like Panshibi. Conclusion This XRP price prediction highlights how traders hope for a break above $2.46, potentially paving the way to $3.30, $4.20, or even $5.00. Yet technical patterns and market sentiment can shift quickly, leaving XRP at risk if it fails to clear resistance or if the broader crypto scene turns negative. Meanwhile, Panshibi (SHIBI) offers a structured meme coin alternative, blending a panda theme with locked liquidity and a structured presale to curb volatility. Whether XRP mounts a significant rally or Panshibi seizes the spotlight, both tokens illustrate the crypto market’s thirst for dramatic returns, driven by chart setups on one side and comedic vigor on the other.

What Is Setting TRUMP Apart From Other Memecoins Trump, with his controversial token launch days before the inauguration, has ushered in a new era of political memecoins. $TRUMP is much more than just a memecoin; it sets the tone, and other politicians worldwide are likely to pay close attention to this development, especially in the context of political fundraising and campaign financing. “Many ‘old school’ politicians will not believe me. In America, at least, the 2026 elections will feature a raft of new personal political brands created via memecoins, and they will defeat supposedly unbeatable incumbents.” (Arthur Hayes, “Zero Knowledge Proof”) At the same time, political tokens are more difficult to regulate. Since they are hosted on blockchains and tradable on decentralized exchanges, they remain accessible to anyone online. This potentially makes them a near-perfect tool for measuring political momentum in real time with minimal government interference. But we are still at the very beginning of this trend and have not yet significantly impacted the mechanics of the memecoin market , known for its (in)famous pumps and dumps. People buy memes to ride another rocket with the multiplier of 10-20x and more. Most traders don’t care about the longer-term developments; they want to make those gains right now. In such a market, buying already ‘shot’ memecoins that have gone through their ‘pump and dump’ cycle is usually not the best idea: most of these tokens will not repeat past returns — largely due to the trivial value dispersion. Few people talk about it in this market, but the value of older memecoins is constantly eroded by the creation of numerous newer ones. A token already delivered 100x gains to early holders faces both profit-taking pressure and competition from fresh narratives. Rather obviously, $TRUMP seems set to break this pattern as it blazes the trail for the emerging #PolitiFi market of real political tokens. But with a market cap of $10.78B, it’s on the verge of becoming an ‘established’ memecoin. Could be a solid investment. But make no mistake – a broader memecoin gambling market grown addicted to pumping low-cap semi-random coins will keep hunting for (and finding) fresh objects for those sweet 20-100x gains, leaving older coins with more “established” profits. “I believe that if crypto sentiment is improving, $TRUMP will lead Bitcoin. If some policy that those in the political know believe will positively impact crypto, $TRUMP will surge well before the positive news is announced, and then Bitcoin will follow.” (Arthur Hayes, “Zero Knowledge Proof”) In Conclusion So those hunting for real 20-100x pumps might want to look at ‘hidden gems’ – tokens positioned to be “next in line” for a pump: trendy enough to be next up, but not yet obvious enough to be ‘priced in’ by the market. As far as I can tell, one such ‘hidden gem’ multiplied by the potential of #PolitiFi as a whole, emerged the day after Trump’s inauguration, when the White House website suddenly removed its Spanish-language version, replacing it with a stern “GO HOME” button under a 404 error message. Though it was quickly amended to “GO TO HOME PAGE,” the internet never forgets, and the incident sparked the creation of the $GOHOME memecoin, which cleverly plays on both immigration sentiment and — smartly enough — the iconic GME (GameStop) ticker. $GOHOME’s origin narrative creates an intriguing positioning play: while clearly resonating with Trump’s immigration stance, the token team carefully avoids explicit political endorsements. This delicate balance keeps the door open for Democratic buyers while maintaining a cheeky undertone that invites all sides to settle their differences through the order book. (Follow @GoHome_Token on X) In light of our earlier discussion about democratizing political markets, this approach feels almost prescient. It turns trading activity itself into a new form of political discourse. Beyond price action, this represents a new form of political engagement where market signals could potentially influence policy decisions more directly than traditional polling or campaign contributions. Easy to Understand: Do you like this politician and want to show your support? Do you believe that other people like this politician or will like this politician in the future? These are the only two questions you have to answer before you decide to buy a political memecoin.” (Arthur Hayes, “Zero Knowledge Proof”) What makes $GOHOME particularly interesting is its timing and positioning. Unlike many PolitiFi tokens that just ride politician popularity, it taps into a core policy issue likely to remain central to Trump’s presidency. And unlike $TRUMP, which has already captured mainstream attention, $GOHOME remains relatively unknown. The project’s approach to treasury management also sets it apart. Rather than selling tokens, the team plans to use them as collateral for loans, reinvesting the proceeds into buying back $GOHOME from the market. This strategy could help maintain price momentum while building longer-term sustainability. While the market cap on some platforms might show around $350M, that represents the Fully Diluted Value (FDV). Given that 95% of the token supply is locked for a considerable period, the actual market cap is closer to 5% of that figure, around $10-15M. This makes the community’s expectation of a potential x50 return in the next 5 months far more plausible. Interestingly, $GOHOME displays a similar cult-like community of HODLers that is reminiscent of SPX6900. However, $GOHOME is at a much earlier stage of development, making it easier to envision significant growth compared to SPX, which already boasts a market cap of $750 million. The whitepaper outlines an ironic “roadmap” with price targets of $100 by the end of March, $1,000 by year-end, and eventually “trading higher than BTC.” This aligns perfectly with the project’s self-aware style — simultaneously embracing and satirizing the meme coin hype cycle. Their four-year token lock also appears to fit this narrative, expiring just in time for the 2029 election “when, hopefully, we are still alive and having fun.” While $TRUMP grabbed headlines and $GOHOME plays 4D chess with policy markets, PolitiFi memecoins post-irony continues to unroll at breakneck speed. ETF500 (Elon Trump Fart Price) puts a $16.5M bet on the Trump-Musk alliance that birthed the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Then there’s DUM (FreeDum Fighters), which turns partisan warfare into a game with its MAGATRON vs. Kamacop 9000 narrative. At a $7.1M market cap, it might seem like a playful take, but there’s ambition here—trading the political divide rather than individual players. In a sense, each project represents a different ill-minded approach to political capital in the degen markets era: policy ($GOHOME), power alliances (ETF500), or systemic conflict (DUM). The market will decide which thesis dominates — or perhaps reward all. Either way, the democratization of political markets is a reality; it’s just happening. You can like it or not, but still, you can play it. Or you can go home — and let other plebs trade your political future without you.

The latest burn metrics indicated that nearly 128 million SHIB was burnt over the past week. In turn, market sentiments about the dog-themed meme coin’s future outlook remain bullish, with technicals further highlighting that a potential 300% breakout looms. Can Shiba Inu Price Leverage SHIB Burn Impact? Shiba Inu price has been trading sluggishly against the backdrop of broader crypto market trends for quite a while now. The meme coin was down 2.5% to $0.00001522 as of press time, whilst its weekly and monthly losses totaled 9% and 24%, respectively. It’s noteworthy that this waning action primarily aligns with broader trends, such as macroeconomic heat over the past month and the recent Bybit hack. Nevertheless, current burn metrics underscored a significant blow to the asset’s circulating supply, sparking investor bullishness. As per Shibburn’s X post on February 22, a whopping 128.22 million coins were burnt in the last week. Per this data, the supply reduction resulted in a 120.3% uptick in the weekly SHIB burn rate. Market watchers weigh substantial optimism in light of this burn rate surge, aligning with the law of supply of supply and demand. For context, the meme coin’s burn mechanism sends tokens to a null address, thereby permanently removing them from the circulating supply by making retrieval impossible. How Much SHIB Burnt To Date? Upon further investigation, CoinGape found that 410.72 trillion Shiba Inu coins were burnt to date, which is bullish news for the leading meme coin ‘s price watchers. The circulating supply at the time of reporting was evaluated as 584.30 trillion tokens. Source: Shibburn site Meanwhile, the community registered 180.59 million tokens burnt this month (February), with approximately 90 burn transactions recorded. Besides, the previous month saw a whopping 1.16 billion tokens removed from the supply via 124 burn transactions. Altogether, the massive blow to the supply has pushed investors to be optimistic about Shiba Inu price despite its sluggish performance. Is SHIB Eyeing 300% Breakout? A recent SHIB price analysis by CoinGape Media further revealed that the meme coin could surge nearly 300% ahead amid strong market technicals. As the token sees heightened active addresses and whale activity, on-chain metrics reflect rising market optimism. Further, the asset’s MVRV ratio also aligns with bullish historical trends, entering the opportunity zone. Back then, the same scenario resulted in a 55% pump, per the analysis. However, traders and investors exercise some caution as past trends do not always guarantee future performances. Also, Shiba Inu price recently showcased signs of forming a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. Given that the crypto market recovers ahead, SHIB could take charge and lead, per the analysis. Key resistance for the token lies near $0.0000326, a sustained hold above which bolsters the path for 300% gains.

Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 652,900 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin needs to break through resistance at the $101,000 level to have an explosive move to the upside. “We like what we see. This is why I’ve been saying to just chill. It takes a whole three daily candles to make the mood swing the other way again. To me, $99,000-$101,000 is the last resistance before new ATHs (all-time highs). Break that and we start marching upwards again.” Source: DonAlt/X The analyst also says that Bitcoin’s market structure is improving but it is still too early to turn bearish. “BTC update: looks like it was a good choice not to doom post the lows. Just took two days and BTC looks much better. Greater than $100,000 and the party starts. Until then, it’s a bit too early to celebrate the win yet.” Source: DonAlt/X The analyst also says that Bitcoin is showing strength after the negative news that the Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit suffered a major security breach involving its Ethereum ( ETH ) cold wallet as well as Friday’s broad stock market sell-off . “Pretty good reaction to bad news especially given it’s coupled with the traditional finance markets selling off.” Bitcoin is trading for $ 96,127 at time of writing. The analyst also believes that Ethereum is trading below its fair market value, while payment token XRP has reached its market value range. “When I was bull posting XRP at $0.50-$0.60 I felt like XRP was mis-priced relative to everything else in the market Now it’s at around $3, which seems much fairer. I kinda feel the same way about ETH now at $2,800, mis-priced by quite a bit.” ETH is trading for $2,647 at time of writing, down 3.1% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, XRP is trading for $2.56 at time of writing, down 4.5% on the day.

Cynthia Lummis introduced her Bitcoin reserve bill, explicitly articulating that it is aimed to reduce U.S. debt. The new VanEck research reveals that if the act is adopted, Bitcoin may offset 18% of the national debt before the government gains the right to sell Bitcoin reserves. On Feb. 21, 2025, an investment management company VanEck released a tool indicating the potential impact of Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on U.S. debt at the specified conditions. It allows the government to set the number of bitcoins purchased by the government annually, the average price at which bitcoins are being bought in 2025, and the average compound growth rate of the BTC price and U.S. debt. The calculator tool is based on VanEck research outlining how soon the debt may be offset by the BTC reserve at the set parameters, such as the BTC price, etc. It’s worth noting that the research assumes that the Bitcoin Act introduced by Lummis is getting adopted this year without serious changes. You might also like: US Senator Lummis unveils Bitcoin reserve legislation following Trump’s keynote The research webpage contains a disclaimer that the calculations are based on past trends and don’t necessarily reflect the future Bitcoin value or the national debt amount. What can we learn from VanEck’s research? The research is based on the idea of the U.S. treasury collecting a million bitcoins in five years and holding them for 20 years. According to the act, during the 20 years, the bitcoins held in treasury could only be spent to cover the national debt. Based on VanEck research made in December 2024, the U.S. will amass one million bitcoins by 2049. The total value of these bitcoins will amount to $21 trillion and will offset around 18% of the national debt, which will reach around $116 trillion by 2029, according to VanEck. These figures will be correct at specific average compound growth rates of U.S. debt and BTC price. The VanEck researchers assume national debt will be growing by 5% per year, going from the current $36 trillion evaluation to $116 trillion in 2049. VanEck predicts that, on average, BTC value will be growing by 25% each year, increasing from nearly $100,000 to $21 billion per coin in 2049 when the federal bitcoins are no longer barred from selling. Source: VanEck The government may amass more than one million bitcoins as it may accumulate additional coins through seizing, donations, and other ways. All in all, VanEck research indicates that Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will hardly pay off U.S. debt anytime soon which is in line with what Lummis claimed in July 2024 when she was talking about reducing the debt, not covering it. To fully pay off the national debt (if the growth rates are correct), the government will need to purchase over five million bitcoins. Could Bitcoin ever pay off U.S. debt completely? In August of 2024, in an interview broadcast on Fox, Donald Trump assumed that Bitcoin would probably pay off trillions of U.S. debt. JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Donald Trump says ""maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion debt by handing them a little crypto check, handing them a little #Bitcoin ."" pic.twitter.com/V5WlYiAQw0 — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) August 2, 2024 Even if we don’t factor in potential debt growth (according to the Congressional Budget Office, debt may reach around $50 trillion by 2035), the U.S. government will need 36 million bitcoins at $1,000,000 (the evaluation often named by various Bitcoin enthusiasts as the near future Bitcoin price). The problem is that such an amount of bitcoins is impossible to get as the maximum supply of Bitcoin is set at only 21 million, and its pre-programmed scarcity is seen as one of the main drivers of its value. The company holding the biggest BTC bag is BlackRock. As of February 2025, it owns over half of a million bitcoins. Another avid bitcoinist, Strategy’s Michael Saylor, claimed that “there’s only room for one nation-state to buy up 20% of the Bitcoin network.” Note that he is not even considering a third part of the supply for any nation while he owns around half a million bitcoins. 🇺🇸 SAYLOR: “There’s only room for one nation-state to buy up 20% of the #Bitcoin network, and obviously, I think it should be the United States.” pic.twitter.com/dbNNbJNULg — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) February 21, 2025 Amassing even one million bitcoins is a hassle–no wonder a strong Bitcoin proponent Sen. Lummis gives the U.S. government five years to complete the task of accumulating one million BTC. The BTC price must reach $36 billion by 2030 so that the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve can be used to cover U.S. debt (however, most probably, the debt value will grow by that time). Even the most bullish predictions are not bullish enough to claim something like that. Another problem is that exchanging these bitcoins for cash won’t be an easy task, as the U.S. will need to find enough buyers. The dumping of this huge amount will affect the price negatively, discounting the remaining reserves. In general, it’s safe to say Bitcoin may be seen as a partial solution while Trump’s words about Bitcoin paying off U.S. debt are pretty baseless at the current stage.

The Blockchain sector maintains growth but multiple fields experience decreased momentum in their development. From the beginning of 2025 until now, investors have lost billions of dollars from Meme coins, Real World Asset projects and AI-driven tokens. The XRP and XLM payment giants maintain leadership of their sector, which has witnessed significant growth this year with Remittix collecting more than $12.6M. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Presale Stuck in the Past Rexas Finance (RXS) a few months ago did create quite a buzz by promising something innovative in DeFi solutions. However, the market conditions for DeFi have made it less attractive for investors as funds continue to drain from speculative projects. RXS stands in stark contrast to Remittix because Remittix thrives on payment growth. Without a clear real-world solution for RXS, one may characterize it merely as a DeFi experiment with its very survival now under serious threat. A lingering sourness among investors is due to the failure of DeFi projects to gain mass adoption in the past. If things go wrong, RXS might find itself in the same boat, having neither reputable institutional backing nor any solid regulatory compliance strategy. The level of complexity and risk in the DeFi ecosystem alienates normal crypto users from finance and real estate issues. Here lies an opportunity for Remittix. Lightchain AI (LCAI): Hype-Driven, But Lacking Real Utility Lightchain AI (LCAI) moved into the spotlight with a new hybridization of AI and blockchain, promising an AI-powered Proof-of-Intelligence consensus mechanism. Yet, AI coins are bleeding billions in value as investors understand that AI-based blockchains are unemphatic and speculative still. While LCAI is still searching for practical applications, Remittix, on the other hand, has begun integrating itself into international finance to solve real problems through crypto-to-FIAT transactions. The hype around AI-driven blockchain technologies has waned in the last couple of months as many projects tend to offer very few real-world cases. Investors wonder if AI blockchains can significantly improve efficiency over non-AI blockchains or if they are simply a re-wrap of technology already available in the market. No partnerships with major institutions have promised to make Lightchain AI mature in the long run, still in its starting phase. Solaxy (SOLX): A Mystery Wrapped in Uncertainty Solaxy (SOLX) has been working on the RWA tokenization wave for some time; however, this niche seems attractive, whereas real-life results have faced restlessness due to regulatory uncertainties. Billions of dollars have fled RWA tokens, leaving Solaxy lacking investor confidence and transparency. Remittix, on the opposite side of the spectrum, is prospering as the payment model does not rest on speculation; that is how the growing problem in finance gets cured. Regulatory scrutiny has made mass adoption of Real World Asset tokens increasingly difficult. Governments across the globe are cracking down on projects that want to tokenize real estate, commodities and other assets without compliance with the law. Thus far, this has left projects like SOLX uncertain, never knowing where they stand legally. Remittix is Redefining the Crypto Payments Landscape Remittix, unlike other competition, has a payment story like that of XRP and XLM, which has made great gains in 2025. Connecting with amazing users, Remittix now allows crypto to FIAT conversion direct deposit into banks, thus eliminating the greater rub of global crypto payments. Currently selling at $0.0628, Remittix’s uniqueness is that it renders on-the-spot value to users without depending on future price increases to sustain themselves. Investors see that solutions like Remittix will make more headway in increasing utility-and-adoption-focused markets. The ability to send internationally without foreign remittance charges and on the same day transaction processing fundamentally marks Remittix as a giant in financial efficiency. The brightness of the Remittix model is evidenced by over $12.7 million raised so far into the project beyond its competition level. Unlike RXS, LCAI and SOLX, present in concept, Remittix is real. Final Thoughts: Why Investors Are Choosing Remittix Over RXS, LCAI, and SOLX The cryptocurrency market shows Remittix (RTX) is demonstrating that practical applications succeed better than Meme coins, AI tokens and RWA projects during 2025. The decrease in DeFi activity challenges Rexas Finance. At the same time, Lightchain AI experiences the downfall of AI tokens and Solaxy encounters regulatory obstacles. Still, Remittix presents a solution for worldwide financial needs and maintains a specified business pathway.

Data from CoinGecko shows that $OM, $ETH, and $BERA are now three of the most sought-after assets in the space, enjoying an uptick in both interest and investment. Alongside these more familiar names, freshly minted coins such as $IP, $BERA, and $KAITO are also enjoying an interest explosion, marking a clear shift in investor focus toward unknown but exciting opportunities in crypto. Top 20 Trending Coins on CoinGecko This week, $OM ( @MANTRA_Chain ) leads the pack, followed by $ETH ( @ethereum ) in second place and $BERA ( @berachain ) in third. Keeping an eye on these? https://t.co/wR2b6z7a17 pic.twitter.com/EfUvWn19aP — CoinGecko (@coingecko) February 21, 2025 $OM Takes the Lead At the top of CoinGecko’s trending list is $OM, the token related to MANTRA Chain, a project bringing decentralized finance (DeFi) to the masses. Exploding token interest has solidified $OM’s position as this week’s leading token. What is driving this newfound enthusiasm? For starters, MANTRA Chain is built on some strong, and increasingly relevant, foundations. It has clear solutions regarding staking and governance—two aspects of not only $OM but also MANTRA Chain’s DeFi ecosystem that underpin the next phase in the evolution of decentralized finance. Furthermore, their ambitious community governance model is actually a real-world project governed by the users of the platform in ways that traditional finance’). Ethereum ($ETH) Remains a Strong Contender Right behind $OM is Ethereum ($ETH), one of the most recognized and oldest cryptocurrencies in the market. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum continues to hold the esteem of a bespoken base of investors and developers. For all intents and purposes, Ethereum remains a goliath in the space and the only serious competitor to Bitcoin, owing to its long-standing reputation in the blockchain ecosystem and the urgency of ongoing windfall developments—namely, the Ethereum 2.0 “upgrade” that promises to put the platform on par in terms of network scalability with BTC, by far the most durable coin in the space. This week, Ethereum not only staved off some near-term “competition” from its own doppelgänger, $OM, but it has also been trying to shake off the effects of some “bad news” that keeps haunting it from the past. $BERA: A Rising Star In the third-place position, we have BERA, a native token for Berachain. This is an up-and-coming blockchain ecosystem that is attracting attention for its distinctive way of mixing two different blockchain consensus protocols, the one used by Ethereum and the one used by Bitcoin. By focusing on combining ideas from these two successful projects while also being rigorously “ecosystem-centric” (meaning the way it is built and functions is largely in service of the projects that want to run within it), Berachain is offering what seems to be a solid, well-thought-out proposition. Consequently, BERA has been gaining attention and reaping up substantial rewards this week for being part of seemingly the next big thing. We should also note that Berachain is a project built by a team that has become well known for being able to execute ideas effectively. Newly listed coins are on fire! • $IP spiked to $9.5 in a short squeeze, now sitting at $5—still up 189% this week. • $BERA & $KAITO also hitting fresh highs. Momentum is building—who’s catching these moves? pic.twitter.com/tgxHowPnxe — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) February 21, 2025 New Listings on Fire: $IP, $KAITO, and More While established tokens such as $OM, $ETH, and $BERA lead the charts, coins recently listed have also shown exceptional growth this week, seizing the interest of traders and investors. One of the highlights this week is $IP, which enjoyed a short squeeze that sent its price from $3.5 up to $9.5, before it settled around $5. Even so, $IP is now up an incredible 189% for the week. If we didn’t know better, we’d think that the untapped potential of new listings was the cause of the superb price action seen with $IP. Four days into the week, some traders had already concluded that the $IP listing was going to be a buy-and-hold affair. Surprise, surprise, $IP is still one of the tokens up for grabs in the buy-and-hold category, even as its price retraced nearly 48% from the almost-$10 highs we saw earlier in the week. In addition to $IP, we have $KAITO—no, not a character from an anime series—also seemingly hitting fresh highs each day this week. The Rising Trend of New Cryptocurrencies The tremendous value increase of recently launched cryptocurrencies, such as $IP, $KAITO, and $BERA, highlights a new aspect of the crypto ecosystem: the constant quest for youthful projects with serious potential to grow and capture the market’s imagination. More and more, our society is trying to find tomorrow’s big thing, and that’s happening right now with the nascent wave of newly minted cryptos. These episodes have been occurring with ever-increasing regularity in the past year or so as a growing number of exchanges have started offering new tokens and an even larger number of shows have started to feature them. Conclusion: A Week of Growth and Excitement CoinGecko’s trending coins this week reveal the vast and varied opportunities emerging in the world of cryptocurrencies. When one takes a closer look at our list of trending coins, one finds that a lot of the projects and tokens making waves this week are new and relatively undocumented, which seems to be in keeping with the cryptocurrency space’s current phase of “project discovery.” The future feels bright not just for established tokens, which are holding their value nicely (see above), but also for the many new coins seemingly on the verge of something exciting.

A Complete Guide for New Investors,https://coinpedia.org/beginners-guide/what-is-nft-marketplaces/,"The post What Are NFT Marketplaces? A Complete Guide for New Investors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Have you ever heard of someone spending thousands of dollars on a digital picture of a cat or a pixelated punk? Sounds crazy, right? Welcome to the fascinating world of NFTs! If you’ve been curious but don’t know where to start, this guide will walk you through everything you need to understand about NFT marketplaces. What Are NFTs, Anyway? Before we explore marketplaces, let’s get the basics down. NFT stands for Non-Fungible Token . That’s a fancy way of saying it’s a unique digital item that can’t be replaced with something else. You can think of it like a one-of-a-kind baseball card or a rare piece of art. Unlike your regular dollars or Bitcoins (which are fungible and interchangeable), NFTs are special. Each one has its own value and identity. NFTs can represent anything digital—art, music, videos, tweets, virtual real estate, and even in-game items. They’re powered by blockchain technology, which is like a public ledger ensuring everyone knows who owns what. Why Are NFTs So Popular? Okay, imagine owning a piece of art from a famous artist but in digital form. It’s yours. You can show it off, sell it, or trade it. That’s what makes NFTs exciting. Plus, the scarcity factor—there’s only one or a limited number of each NFT. It’s like finding a golden ticket in a chocolate bar. Another reason NFTs are booming? They give creators more control. Artists can earn royalties every time their NFT is sold. So, instead of being at the mercy of galleries or record labels, creators get direct access to their audience. What Is an NFT Marketplace? Now that you know about NFTs, let’s talk about where the magic happens: NFT marketplaces . Think of these platforms as digital art galleries or auction houses where you can buy, sell, or even create your own NFTs. Each marketplace has its vibe, features, and focus. Some cater to high-end digital art, while others are playgrounds for gaming enthusiasts or music lovers. If you’ve ever used eBay or Amazon, the concept isn’t too different. The key difference? Instead of physical goods, you’re dealing with digital assets. How Does It Work? Let’s break it down into simple steps: Create an Account : First, you’ll need to sign up on a marketplace. Connect a Wallet : To buy or sell NFTs, you’ll need a crypto wallet (more on that later). Think of it as your digital purse. Browse the Listings : Scroll through collections, discover trending pieces, and pick your favorites. Buy, Bid, or Mint : Depending on the platform, you can purchase NFTs instantly, place a bid, or create your own NFT (called minting). Own It : Once the transaction is complete, the NFT is all yours. It’ll sit safely in your wallet. There’s more to consider. Popular NFT Marketplaces Here are some of the top NFT marketplaces you’ll want to know about: 1. OpenSea The giant of NFT marketplaces. OpenSea is like the Amazon of NFTs. You’ll find everything here—from art to domain names and gaming items. It’s user-friendly, making it perfect for beginners. 2. Rarible A bit more community-focused, Rarible lets users vote on platform upgrades. It’s popular among creators who love its easy minting process. 3. Foundation This one’s all about high-quality art. It’s invite-only, so not everyone can sell here. Think of it like a VIP art club. 4. NBA Top Shot Into sports? This marketplace focuses on officially licensed NBA highlights. It’s like owning a piece of basketball history. 5. Axie Marketplace For gamers, Axie Infinity is the go-to place for buying and trading in-game items and characters. It’s fun and addictive! What About Crypto Wallets? To interact with NFT marketplaces, you’ll need a crypto wallet . This is where you store your cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum) and NFTs. Popular wallets include: MetaMask : A browser extension wallet. Simple and widely used. Trust Wallet : Great for mobile users. Coinbase Wallet : User-friendly, especially if you’re already using Coinbase. Connecting your wallet to a marketplace is straightforward. Just follow the on-screen prompts, and you’re good to go. How Do You Buy an NFT? Alright, so you’ve found an NFT you love. Now what? Here’s the process: Check the Price : Some NFTs have a fixed price, while others are auctioned. Auctions mean you place a bid and hope it’s the highest. Pay with Crypto : Most marketplaces operate on Ethereum, so you’ll need ETH. Some also accept other cryptocurrencies. Confirm the Purchase : Once you pay, the NFT is transferred to your wallet. You’ll also pay a small transaction fee (called a gas fee). Show It Off : Your NFT is now yours. Display it in a virtual gallery or keep it as a valuable collectible. Can You Sell Your NFTs? Absolutely! Selling NFTs is just as easy as buying them. Upload your digital item, set a price, and list it on the marketplace. When someone buys it, the proceeds (minus marketplace fees) go directly to your wallet. Remember, you can also earn royalties if you’re the original creator. This means you’ll get a percentage of every future sale of that NFT. It’s a great way to keep earning long-term. Risks and Challenges It’s not all sunshine and rainbows, though. Here are some things to watch out for: High Gas Fees : Ethereum transactions can be expensive during peak times. Imagine paying $50 just to buy a $20 NFT. Frustrating, isn’t it? Scams and Fakes : Not all marketplaces are trustworthy. Stick to reputable platforms and double-check the authenticity of NFTs. Volatility : Crypto prices and NFT values can swing wildly. Invest only what you can afford to lose. Environmental Impact : Some blockchains consume a lot of energy. Fortunately, newer platforms are finding eco-friendly solutions. Real-Life Example: Beeple’s $69 Million Sale Let’s talk about the NFT that took the world by storm. In 2021, a digital artist named Beeple sold an NFT titled “Everydays: The First 5000 Days” for a whopping $69 million at a Christie’s auction. It’s essentially a collage of 5,000 digital images he created over 13 years. This sale put NFTs on the map. It showed the world that digital art can be just as valuable as physical masterpieces. Mind-blowing, right? The Future of NFT Marketplaces NFTs are still in their early days. But the potential is enormous. Imagine: Virtual Real Estate : People already buy and sell land in virtual worlds like Decentraland. Music Rights : Artists can sell songs directly to fans without middlemen. Tickets : NFTs could replace traditional event tickets, reducing fraud. The possibilities are endless. And with more people jumping in, NFT marketplaces will only get bigger and better. What next? There you have it! The NFT marketplace might seem like a wild jungle at first, but once you understand the basics, it’s an exciting place full of opportunities. Whether you’re an artist, collector, gamer, or just curious, there’s something for everyone. Start small. Explore a marketplace like OpenSea or Rarible. Browse, learn, and maybe even buy your first NFT. Who knows? You might discover a hidden gem or create something that takes the world by storm. FAQs What is an NFT marketplace and how does it work? An NFT marketplace is a platform where users can buy, sell, and create NFTs using blockchain technology and crypto wallets for secure transactions. Which are the best NFT marketplaces for beginners? OpenSea and Rarible are great for beginners due to their user-friendly interfaces, low barriers to entry, and wide variety of digital assets. Do I need cryptocurrency to buy NFTs? Yes, most NFT marketplaces require cryptocurrency, like Ethereum (ETH), which you store in a digital wallet to complete transactions. Can I sell my own digital art as an NFT? Yes! You can mint your artwork on platforms like OpenSea, Rarible, or Foundation and set a price or auction it for potential buyers. Are NFT marketplaces safe to use? Reputable marketplaces are generally safe, but users should beware of scams, fake NFTs, and high gas fees when trading digital assets.",Beginners Guide,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS|AXS|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 08:35:00

Table of Contents Grayscale’s ETF proposal: A new path for institutional exposure to Cardano price FloppyPepe challenges Cardano’s dominance with AI-powered growth The future of AI crypto: FloppyPepe leading the charge The Cardano (ADA) price has long been a fixture in the crypto world, but recent news of Grayscale’s ETF proposal has sparked a renewed sense of optimism for its future. However, as ADA dominates the market, a new AI crypto is drawing attention with community-driven growth, AI insights, and meme culture. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is taking the lead as the battle for market dominance is heating up. You might also like: Meme coin frenzy: Why FloppyPepe is gearing up for a $1 billion market cap Grayscale’s ETF proposal: A new path for institutional exposure to Cardano price Grayscale’s ETF proposal has ignited a wave of optimism in the crypto world, as it represents the first of its kind in the U.S. and the 60th crypto ETF application filed this year, according to Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas. This Grayscale’s ETF proposal offers a unique chance for regulated exposure to ADA , allowing investors to engage with the Cardano price without directly owning the token. The excitement surrounding Grayscale’s ETF proposal has raised hopes for increased institutional interest in ADA, further influencing the Cardano price. However, while Grayscale’s ETF proposal gave an initial boost to the Cardano price, ADA faced resistance, and the price has struggled to break key levels. ADA is currently trading at 0.798, according to CoinGecko. As analysts continue to digest the potential impact of Grayscale’s ETF proposal, the future of ADA remains closely tied to broader market dynamics, leaving the long-term outlook uncertain despite the optimism sparked by Grayscale’s ETF proposal. FloppyPepe challenges Cardano’s dominance with AI-powered growth Grayscale’s ETF proposal has undeniably sparked optimism around ADA, drawing institutional interest and fueling hopes for a future surge in Cardano price. However, a new AI crypto could put Cardano’s dominance to the test. FloppyPepe, inspired by the viral legacy of meme coins and the playful spirit of Pepe, has captured the attention of investors. While ADA tries to maintain its dominance, FloppyPepe’s rapidly growing community, and its focus on decentralization and security, the AI crypto is dominating more. Its Telegram and X communities are buzzing with high engagement, built on a foundation of trust, further solidified by a SolidProof audit that emphasizes safety and transparency. A unique burn mechanism, which eliminates 1% of every FloppyPepe transaction, increases scarcity, while redistribution rewards encourage long-term holding that fuels the coin’s stability and profitability. Investors are already speculating that this AI crypto could outperform the Cardano price soon. FloppyPepe is tapping into the AI trend with its Meme-o-Matic, an AI agent that powers decentralized meme coin creation. The AI analyzes text, images, and videos, merging creativity with cutting-edge technology. FloppyX, an intelligent video AI bot, increases the meme coin experience with dynamic videos and interactive storytelling. As the Cardano price faces resistance even after Grayscale’s ETF proposal, FloppyPepe might just be the next big thing to shake up the market. With a private round that sold out in just 24 hours, raising over $900,000, this AI crypto is generating massive momentum. Its stage-based pricing structure, designed to reward early investors, is only adding fuel to the fire, setting the stage for potentially bigger gains. The future of AI crypto: FloppyPepe leading the charge There will be explosive growth in the AI agent crypto market as AI becomes more pervasive in digital interactions. FloppyPepe is outshining even bigger-cap AI tokens with its impressive AI features, cheap presale price, and enormous growth potential. Investors have taken notice of FloppyPepe’s distinctive posture and believe that the AI crypto value could soon surpass Cardano’s. As its beta AI agent is about to be released, FloppyPepe is setting itself up to become a frontrunner in the meme coin industry by using AI to drive its expansion. Many cryptocurrency veterans are keeping a careful eye on this AI crypto because they believe it has the potential to become very popular soon. During its fast-selling presale, FloppyPepe is priced at a remarkably reasonable $0.0000002. With demand continuing to climb, it is ready to generate considerable returns.

Right now, Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (ASIA) is gaining attention with a 45% surge signal, making it a key player in the AI and blockchain space. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) has faced some setbacks, recently losing an important support level, but increasing whale accumulation suggests a potential 250% price pump could be on the horizon. Another project making strides is Qubetics ($TICS), which is building a decentralized VPN (dVPN) to enhance privacy and security in the Web3 space. Unlike traditional VPNs, Qubetics’ peer-to-peer network ensures unrestricted internet access without centralized control. As its presale continues to gain momentum, investors are looking at Qubetics as a project with long-term utility and strong market potential. Let’s take a deeper look at these three cryptos and what’s driving their recent growth. Qubetics: Pioneering Decentralized VPN for Ultimate Privacy In an era where online privacy is paramount, Qubetics steps up with its innovative decentralized VPN (dVPN) service. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralized servers, Qubetics’ dVPN operates on a peer-to-peer network, enhancing security, privacy, and access to an unrestricted internet. This architecture ensures that user data isn’t logged or controlled by any single entity, offering true digital freedom. Imagine a journalist in a country with strict censorship laws. Accessing unbiased information becomes a daunting task with conventional internet services. Qubetics’ dVPN empowers this journalist to bypass governmental restrictions, accessing the global internet securely and anonymously. Similarly, businesses handling sensitive data can utilize Qubetics to safeguard their communications from potential breaches, ensuring client information remains confidential. By integrating blockchain technology, Qubetics not only decentralizes data pathways but also incentivizes users to share their bandwidth in exchange for $TICS tokens. This creates a self-sustaining ecosystem where privacy and profitability go hand in hand. For those scouting the best coin to buy today, Qubetics offers a compelling blend of innovation and real-world application. Qubetics Presale: Seize the Opportunity The buzz around the Qubetics crypto presale is hard to ignore. Currently in its 22nd stage, the token is priced at $0.08073, with over 483 million $TICS tokens sold, raising more than $13.5 million. Each presale stage lasts just seven days, culminating every Sunday at 12 AM with a 10% price increase. This structure not only rewards early participants but also builds momentum as the presale progresses. Looking ahead, the Qubetics mainnet launch is slated for Q2 2025. Early investors are eyeing significant returns, with projections suggesting that $TICS could reach $0.25 by presale’s end, translating to a 209.67% ROI. Post-presale, targets of $1 and $5 per token could yield returns of 1138.69% and 6093.48%, respectively. For instance, an investment of $1,250 at the current price would secure approximately 15,483.71 $TICS. If the token hits $1, that investment balloons to $15,483.71; at $5, it soars to $77,418.55. Such potential gains position Qubetics as one of the best coins to buy today. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance: Eyeing a 45% Surge Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance (FET) has been showing strong bullish momentum, surging 9.50% in the last 24 hours and currently trading near $0.778. Trading volume has also increased by 17%, indicating growing interest from investors. With the asset forming a bullish double-bottom pattern, analysts predict a possible 45% surge, pushing FET to $1.10 in the coming days. Despite the positive outlook, on-chain data from Coinglass reveals that some investors are taking profits, with $1.50 million worth of FET tokens flowing out of exchanges. However, traders betting on the upside are currently dominating, with $1.03 million in long positions at $0.731 and $270,000 at $0.785. If the asset maintains support above $0.70, analysts expect a potential recovery toward $2.05, a key level lost in December 2024. With increasing investor activity and a strong technical setup, FET is positioned as one of the trending assets in the AI and blockchain space. Traders are closely monitoring its movement, as a break above $1.10 could confirm a larger uptrend. Solana: Navigating Market Challenges with Potential for Growth Solana (SOL) recently faced a setback, surrendering a crucial support level, which has raised concerns among traders. Despite this, significant whale activity indicates a potential bullish reversal. Large investors have accumulated approximately $18.5 million in SOL, signaling confidence in its long-term prospects. Analysts project that, with sustained momentum, Solana price could experience a substantial 250% increase in the coming months. This optimism is tempered by the need for Solana to reclaim and maintain key support levels to confirm an upward trend. Conclusion In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, identifying the best coin to buy today requires careful consideration of innovation, market potential, and current developments. Qubetics stands out with its groundbreaking decentralized VPN service and a presale structure offering substantial ROI potential. The Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance presents an enticing opportunity with indicators pointing toward a significant surge. Meanwhile, Solana continues to demonstrate resilience, with whale activity suggesting possible upward movement. As always, thorough research and timely action are essential to capitalize on these opportunities. For More Information: Qubetics: https://qubetics.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/qubetics Twitter: https://twitter.com/qubetics FAQs What makes Qubetics the best coin to buy today?

Its ongoing presale provides early investors with the chance for significant returns, positioning it as a top contender in the crypto market. Is Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance a good investment now? Current technical analyses indicate a bullish divergence for ASIA, suggesting a potential 45% price increase. This presents a promising opportunity for investors seeking growth in the AI and blockchain sectors. What is the Solana price prediction for the near future? Despite recent challenges, analysts project that Solana’s price could potentially increase by 250%, driven by substantial whale investments and the network’s growing adoption. Large investors have accumulated approximately $18.5 million in SOL, signaling strong confidence in its long-term potential. However, for this bullish scenario to play out, Solana must reclaim key support levels and maintain upward momentum in the coming weeks.",Sponsored,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 08:41:07
40679236,https://nulltx.com/?p=145606,1740213835,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Futures Markets Experience Cooling Trend as Open Interest Drops Across Major Cryptocurrencies,https://nulltx.com/futures-markets-experience-cooling-trend-as-open-interest-drops-across-major-cryptocurrencies/,"The most recent development within worldwide cryptocurrency markets is that, while spot markets are declining, futures markets are also beginning to cool off. One key metric that we monitor to gauge the health of the futures market is called open interest. Open interest measures the total number of outstanding futures contracts that have not been settled. Over the past few weeks, open interest has not only been declining but has also been declining at an accelerated rate. This decline has been seen across the board with all of the major cryptocurrencies. Open Interest Plummets Across Major Assets In the past 30 days, the leading cryptocurrencies have seen a pronounced reduction in open interest, indicating less speculative trading and a more subdued futures market. Entailing some of the most substantial declines are Bitcoin ($BTC) and Ethereum ($ETH), albeit for different reasons. While Bitcoin has seen open interest drop by 11.1%, Ethereum’s drop of 23.8% is not simply following in Bitcoin’s footsteps. Solana ($SOL), which had been one of the more high-profile tokens in the past year, saw open interest decline by 6.2%. Memecoins experienced the most dramatic reduction across the board, with open interest plummeting by 52.1%. Futures markets are cooling alongside spot markets, with a sharp drop in open interest (OI) across all major assets. Over the last 30 days: $BTC OI: -11.1% $ETH OI: -23.8% $SOL OI: -6.2% #Memecoins OI: -52.1% https://t.co/ZTBHOv4p0M pic.twitter.com/7PTmRjNEqE — glassnode (@glassnode) February 20, 2025 This decline in open interest can be viewed as a lessening of speculative interest and a pulling back from leveraged positions, especially in the risky parts of the market, like memecoins. The dip in open interest suggests that a significant number of traders have either closed out their positions or have chosen to stay on the sidelines while the market steadies itself—creating a situation with less potential for market manipulation and a reduced chance of seeing sharp price swings. Funding Rates and Short Positions Signal Market Shift The cost of holding a futures position is determined by funding rates, and these rates allow us to see just how much sentiment in the market has changed for the better. In the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum, their funding rates are slightly positive, nudging ever so gently into the territory of being healthily optimistic. The same cannot be said for Solana, which has funding rates that are now negative. This tells us right away that traders in the futures market have a not-so-furtively bearish outlook on Solana and that they are predominantly betting against the token’s price movement. Funding rates for memecoins have fallen sharply and seem to be the best indicator of today’s market environment. These coins, which were all the rage in late 2024 when they staged a rally of 90.2%, have been pummeled and now find their funding rates squarely in negative territory. This indicates that most market participants are shorting the coins and that levered long trades are being forcefully unwound in what has become a highly speculative and much more cautious market segment. Traders have now moved on to other better-risk-adjusted trading opportunities. Price Action Reflects the Cooling Sentiment The evident cooling in sentiment in futures markets is clearly visible in the actual price formations of the major cryptocurrencies. Since February, Bitcoin has fallen by 5.9%, retreating from earlier momentum that aimed for new price discovery levels. Ethereum, which had been riding high recently on upbeat sentiment from network upgrades, has seen a sharper decline, falling 16.9%. Meanwhile, Solana, which reigned lately as one of the more impressive altcoin performers, has traced back an even steeper 33.1% decline. Market's momentum has stalled after an attempt to push #Bitcoin into price discovery. $BTC is down 5.9% since Feb, while $ETH and $SOL have dropped 16.9% and 33.1%. Memecoins, which surged 90.2% in late 2024, have seen the sharpest correction at -37.4% https://t.co/r3bgR1WY9E pic.twitter.com/SFLnwCFn70 — glassnode (@glassnode) February 20, 2025 Memecoins, which had captivated traders and investors, are now experiencing the sharpest correction. Since the end of 2024, the tokens are down 37.4%. Following that corrective trend, it is now believed that Memecoins are just a natural market component, unable to escape the gravity of a trend following downward steps. What will happen next is anybody’s guess. Examining the wider movement of the market since the beginning of 2023, Bitcoin (BTC) has preserved a steady upward movement, always positioned at around 3.4 times its value of April 2023. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, traded at an astounding high of 11.8 times its April 2023 worth but has since fallen back to 7.6 times. Ethereum (ETH) has been less impressive, with its worth veering between 1.3x and 2.0x—indicative of not nearly hitting the higher growth marks of either Bitcoin or Solana. The Market Is Cooling, but What’s Next? The current bullish momentum of major cryptocurrencies and meme tokens appears frail. While Bitcoin definitely has a steady upward path and Ethereum and Solana strive to overcome recent downturns, the risk of high-leverage positions recently played out in a sharp correction across assets viewed as risky. These include the meme tokens that sell for a fraction of a penny. Right now, a lot of traders are taking a more careful, cautious approach. They’re after not-profit-with-loss scenarios—in other words, conditions that are in their favor—with the hope that the market is going to become more stable and adjust to recent, um, turbulence. With reduced open interest and negative funding rates, what are these traders doing? Well, they’re most likely sitting on their hands and waiting—for what, exactly? They want to see the market’s next moves and—most importantly—its next big money-making catalyst. As we progress into 2025, the cryptocurrency market’s power of adaptation will be put to the test. Whether investors or traders, all market participants will collectively hold their breath to see what renewed interest or further cooling signs will surface next. Overall market sentiment remains in beta as the evolving conditions push and pull various sentiment drivers. At the same time, the market’s leading assets, Bitcoin and Ethereum, may serve as principal indicators of the market’s overall movement. It remains to be seen whether these two will hold their fort atop the crypto asset hierarchy, or if up-and-coming assets like Solana and the memecoins will claw back to dominance in the month’s upcoming.

40679349,https://nulltx.com/?p=145605,1740214068,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Top Trending Tokens Dominating Crypto Conversations Across Social Media Platforms,https://nulltx.com/top-trending-tokens-dominating-crypto-conversations-across-social-media-platforms/,"Lately, the trajectory of growth for crypto markets has been quite positive. As a result, many tokens have surged to the forefront of social media discussions. Our perpetual chatter engine—X (formerly Twitter)—courses restlessly with our latest tokens of obsession. Meanwhile, on Telegram, Reddit, and the other residences of our digital agora—4Chan, Farcaster, and Bitcointalk—these same tokens have found discussion threads all their own. For various reasons, including institutional investment, new listings, and the prospect of upcoming airdrops, some of these tokens have achieved a level of file-sharing sociality that merits a closer look. Kaito (KAITO): The Rising Star of Crypto Communities In recent days, social media platforms have put Kaito, represented by the $KAITO token, right in the middle of the spotlight. The project has stirred a lot of interest because it’s rumored to be listing soon on major exchanges—the kind of places you want your token to be, like Binance, Coinbase, or KuCoin. And if there’s one thing on the Kaito Telegram or X communities that you can count on, it’s that there will be plenty of speculation going around about when the Kaito token will actually make its appearance on those exchanges. The project’s tokenomics and the potential market value have crypto enthusiasts especially excited about $KAITO. The palpable excitement surrounding this token is expressed in conversations about its present features and future growth prospects. $KAITO is a token that has surely captured the undivided attention of traders and investors who are awaiting the next event in its unfolding narrative. SEI Network (SEI): The Institutional Interest Grows Another cryptocurrency making waves in the crypto space is SEI ($SEI), which has recently surged in interest due to a notable acquisition by Trump-backed World Liberty Financial. This firm recently purchased 547,990 SEI tokens for a sum of $125,000 USDC. This move has sparked some serious conversations on Reddit and Telegram, with users trying to parse what institutional backing means for the future of SEI. One analyst I spoke to this week said the development is definitely worth monitoring and could carry real implications for SEI, as well as for the broader crypto market. Gaining recognition, the SEI token is appealing to not just retail traders but also institutional investors, creating the kind of optimism seldom seen in crypto these days. With backing like this, it almost has to pump, and that’s what everyone is excited about (and predicting) in the crypto space right now. Yap Global (YAP): Connected to KAITO and Growing in Influence With $KAITO’s meteoric rise, Yap Global ($YAP) has also been a prominent subject of discussion. Many crypto enthusiasts appear to be connecting the valuation of $YAP with that of $KAITO, making the two seem linked. In some conversations, “yap” has become a shorthand way of referring to a unit of value or a transaction—especially when talking about movements of the KAITO token. This relationship is making $YAP much more interesting. Along with the price and activity of $YAP, more and more users seem to be talking about $YAP. The interactions between the two tokens indicate that an ecosystem is developing where the values of the two assets are influencing one another. As the community keeps digging into this dynamic, it’s going to be fascinating to watch how $YAP develops alongside $KAITO. Grok (GROK): The AI-Backed Token Making Waves Elon Musk’s AI project, Grok, has become a hot topic in crypto circles. Linking Grok ($GROK) to Musk’s latest AI adventure, Grok 3, has given the token not just liftoff but also attention because of its supposed advanced AI capabilities. And discussions on X and Telegram these days generally find users contrasting Grok 3 with other AI models, gabbing most about Grok 3’s imminent capabilities in the areas of financial advising and cryptocurrency investment strategies. With crypto enjoying decent market cap growth today, these are the top trending tokens across X, Reddit, Telegram, 4Chan, Farcaster, and Bitcointalk: 1⃣ @kaitoai $KAITO : Kaito is generating significant interest in the crypto community. Discussions on platforms like Telegram… pic.twitter.com/1fujrO0vjW — Santiment (@santimentfeed) February 20, 2025 Furthermore, the reality that Grok 3 is being distributed at no charge to users has only intensified the enthusiasm that surrounds the token. As Musk pushes forward with his innovations in the AI sector, it surely will be the case that Grok’s influence and presence within the crypto ecosystem will continue to expand. Bittensor AI (TAO): New Listing Sparks Bullish Sentiment The popularity of Bittensor AI ($TAO) is reviving after its recent appearance on Coinbase, one of the most famous and commonly used exchanges worldwide. This development has ignited discussions on Telegram and Reddit, where traders are currently batting about the price Florida of $TAO and what the future may hold for it. The chatter on these two platforms seems to have intensified since the latest Coinbase listing, and there’s no question that both $TAO and Bittensor are very much on the minds of crypto enthusiasts right now. The enthusiasm surrounding the soon-to-happen dTAO launch has stirred up the anticipation even more, with some people daring to venture that this might be a significant development for the project. The fact that it’s now being mentioned with the likes of Coinbase has also upped the interest in how $TAO itself is going to do in the next little while. Bitcoin (BTC): The Constant Conversation Naturally, any list of popular new cryptocurrencies would have to include Bitcoin, the original and still the most talked-about digital asset. Almost everyone from Reddit to Telegram seems to have an opinion about where Bitcoin’s price is headed, and just as surely, traders and investors are dissecting the price action for whatever clues it might yield. Today, we’re breaking down the latest on Bitcoin’s price forecasts—and what the next big moves could mean for the flagship cryptocurrency’s market supremacy. Bitcoin’s talks are multifaceted, centering on its stability, price predictions, and the wider economic forces affecting its value. With always-interesting developments from both retail and institutional investors, Bitcoin daily remains the anchor for a good portion of the crypto market. Conclusion: The Crypto Landscape is Vibrant and Evolving The cryptocurrency world is still evolving and emerging tokens like $KAITO, $SEI, $YAP, $GROK, and $TAO are making waves on social media. It’s not just their technological innovations and market potential that are getting people excited. It’s the bleeding-edge discussions and audacious predictions surrounding them. What next? The next phase of crypto adoption and market developments promises to be heavily influenced by these trending tokens. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

A new survey reveals that 79% of FTX creditors plan to reinvest their repayments into cryptocurrencies, with 62% Solana, 44% backing Solana projects, one-third into meme coins, and AI tokens being the top picks. This came after Trump showed his interest in meme, AI and Solana also the new SEC panel is creating a bullish scenario. Solana Leads the Reinvestment Wave According to the survey by NFTevening partnering with Storible, out of 1016 respondents, 62% of creditors are eager to buy Solana, seeing it as a top contender for the next bull run. Despite the LIBRA rug pull and Meteora scandal , 44% of FTX creditors still plan to reinvest in Solana projects. Interestingly, the survey’s structure suggests a strong bias toward Solana supporters. Only those with at least 10% of their portfolio in Solana or those holding $100 worth of SOL for over a year were eligible to participate. This raises questions about whether the results truly reflect the broader pool of FTX creditors or if they mainly capture the sentiment of dedicated Solana investors. Notably, Solana has remained a popular choice despite its recent price fluctuations. Others in the Pool Party Meme coins and AI tokens are also on the radar, as investors chase high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Ethereum ranks second, with 31% allocating funds to its ecosystem, while 16% favor BNB Chain and 9% explore other networks. Meanwhile, the next FTX repayment is set for May 30, covering more creditors, while claims must be verified by April 11 to qualify. Market Trends and the “Buy the Dip” Mentality Beyond the survey, FTX creditors’ reinvestment plans also depend on market conditions. If Solana drops below $145, 71% of them plan to hold or buy more, showing strong faith in the asset’s long-term potential. This suggests that despite past losses, many investors are still willing to double down on Solana rather than cash out. Meme coins and AI tokens, which also went down in February, could also benefit from this reinvestment wave. If even a portion of the funds flow into these assets, it could breathe new life into these booming sectors that have struggled to maintain momentum. Is This a True Bullish Signal? While the survey paints a bullish picture, it’s essential to take it with a grain of salt. The results mainly reflect the views of Solana-heavy investors, and it’s unclear whether the broader FTX creditor base shares the same enthusiasm. However, the fact that so many creditors are planning to reinvest rather than exit the market shows that confidence in crypto remains strong. So whether Solana and meme coins can capitalize on this trend remains to be seen, but one thing is clear—FTX creditors are far from giving up on crypto.",News|Altcoins,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 08:49:45

As the crypto market evolves, BeerBear emerges as a promising low-cap token with play-to-earn and decentralized incentives. Table of Contents What sets BeerBear apart? Market conditions and growth potential Security and transparency as a growth factor Challenges and considerations Conclusion The cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, with investors and analysts closely monitoring projects that demonstrate potential for sustained growth. While established tokens dominate the market, emerging projects with unique value propositions often capture the attention of early adopters.One such project, BeerBear , is positioned as a promising low-cap token that combines play-to-earn gaming mechanics with decentralized incentives. As market trends shift and adoption increases, understanding BeerBear’s potential trajectory is crucial for those looking at new opportunities in the crypto space. What sets BeerBear apart? BeerBear differentiates itself by integrating blockchain-based gaming into its ecosystem. Unlike purely speculative tokens, BeerBear provides users with an interactive play-to-earn gaming model through its arcade-style game, “Bar Brawl.” Players can engage in gameplay while earning in-game tokens and NFTs, which can be redeemed for ecosystem perks. This additional utility creates a compelling use case that extends beyond simple trading. Another key element of BeerBear’s strategy is its structured presale model. Launched at $0.0004, the token is set to increase incrementally to $0.0020. This pricing approach rewards early adopters while ensuring a gradual, sustainable growth pattern. Additionally, the Beer Points system incentivizes user engagement, allowing participants to accumulate redeemable rewards based on their level of participation within the ecosystem. You might also like: Crypto investors bet on BeerBear as it exceeds expectations Market conditions and growth potential Several factors influence the potential growth of emerging crypto projects. One of the key drivers for BeerBear’s success could be the increasing adoption of blockchain gaming. The play-to-earn sector has shown significant expansion, with more users seeking immersive experiences that integrate financial rewards. As blockchain gaming continues to gain traction, tokens that offer well-structured ecosystems may benefit from sustained interest and demand. Additionally, community-driven engagement plays a critical role in the success of new crypto projects. BeerBear’s governance model allows token holders to participate in key decision-making processes, fostering long-term engagement. By creating an active and involved user base, BeerBear has the opportunity to develop a strong community foundation, similar to how early adopters helped propel other successful tokens in the past. Security and transparency as a growth factor Security is an essential consideration for any crypto project, and BeerBear has taken proactive steps to reinforce confidence among participants. The project has undergone three independent security audits, ensuring the integrity of its smart contract framework. This level of verification sets BeerBear apart from many low-cap tokens that lack extensive auditing. As regulatory scrutiny increases across the crypto market, transparency and security measures will be crucial in determining long-term viability. Challenges and considerations Despite its strong fundamentals, BeerBear, like any emerging project, faces challenges that could impact its growth. Market volatility remains a key factor, as broader cryptocurrency trends often influence the performance of low-cap tokens. Additionally, competition within the play-to-earn gaming sector continues to grow, requiring BeerBear to maintain user engagement and expand its ecosystem to stay competitive. Another factor to consider is regulatory developments. While BeerBear currently benefits from a decentralized governance model, evolving regulations in different jurisdictions may shape the broader blockchain gaming industry. Adapting to these changes will be essential for sustaining long-term growth. Watch BeerBear in action: View the project’s gameplay and features in its official video . Conclusion As the crypto market progresses, BeerBear presents itself as a project with strong potential for notable growth. By integrating gaming, decentralized incentives, and a structured presale model, it differentiates itself from purely speculative assets. While external factors such as market conditions and regulatory developments will play a role in shaping its future, BeerBear’s foundation offers a compelling case for continued adoption. Investors and enthusiasts looking at emerging tokens should keep a close eye on BeerBear as it navigates its path within the evolving crypto landscape.

40679464,https://nulltx.com/?p=145604,1740214275,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Ondo Finance: A Game Changer in Real-World Asset (RWA) Integration and Financial Innovation,https://nulltx.com/ondo-finance-a-game-changer-in-real-world-asset-rwa-integration-and-financial-innovation/,"In the blockchain and finance industries, Ondo Finance is riding the wave with an impressive $450 million+ in Real-World Asset (RWA) volume, demonstrating its clout in the sector. As the finance world moves toward the embracing of blockchain technology, Ondo is at the tip of the spear, launching its own Layer 1 blockchain, striking partnerships with firms like BlackRock, and making its stablecoins available to both institutions and individuals. Recent progress and announcements place Ondo on a path to reshape the look and feel of future financial markets. $ONDO dominates #RWA with $450M+ in volume, $HBAR boosts #Blockchain via #ChainGPT #AI , and $QNT expands global interoperability with Overledger! https://t.co/i1Y0rBJEtP #Crypto #Defi #NFT @intotheblock @Altcoinbuzzio — Daily Crypto Post (@DCryptopost) February 20, 2025 A Notable Presence at the Ondo Summit and Trump Jr.’s Unexpected Appearance The recent Ondo Summit event in New York on February 6, 2025, was an impressive demonstration of Ondo Finance’s growing stature. The summit served as not only a platform for the company to connect with potential investors and partners but also as a stage for the firm’s demonstrations of blockchain-based product offerings. The event, however, garnered a bit more interest when it was announced that former President Donald Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., would be attending. Given Trump Jr.’s background in business and investments, his presence made quite a few people sit up and take notice. In addition, Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLFI) became a major force in the Ondo ecosystem, purchasing 361.46K $ONDO tokens. This relationship gives Ondo’s platform added legitimacy and shows that institutional investors are increasingly interested in blockchain-based financial products. Ondo also declared its working relationship with WLFI, further establishing the partnership between the two organizations. Ondo’s Layer 1 Blockchain: A Tailored Solution for Financial Institutions To expand its clout in the financial sector, Ondo Finance has developed a Layer 1 blockchain. The decision to develop a blockchain came from Ondo’s understanding that current platforms do not deliver the requisite toolset for financial institutions to interact openly in the real-world asset space. Ondo’s blockchain will focus on standards. It will create RWAs (real-world assets) that comply with financial regulations. The target market remains unchanged: institutions that need a secure, reliable, and compliant environment to carry on their affairs. Ondo’s Layer 1 blockchain, with a profound grasp of the particular needs of financial institutions, is built to fit seamlessly within—and operate in compliance with—the current monetary ecosystem. By providing this kind of tailored blockchain solution, Ondo is creating a bridge between the worlds of traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi), where institutions can adopt blockchain technology without being bound to using its less specialized, existing predecessors. Strategic Partnerships with BlackRock and Circle Working with globally recognized financial institutions like BlackRock and Circle, Ondo proclaims to have “redefined” its standing in the financial world. The partnership with BlackRock seems particularly auspicious, given that BlackRock is the world’s largest investment firm, with more than $10 trillion in assets under management. Employing the investing “wisdom” of Ondo, along with the fund that Circle manages (the Circle Invest Fund I, L.P., which invests in U.S. Treasury securities), and using Ondo’s stablecoin, OUSG, as an investment vehicle, makes participating in this “BUIDL” fund with investments that feel relatively safe a real possibility. $ONDO năm 2025 Hôm nay không lẻ tẻ nữa, làm cái tổng hợp tình hình Ondo cho anh em tiện theo dõi nha: Ondo – Một trong những dự án #RWA top đầu (con OM thì thôi khỏi bàn, có ai hold đâu ) Tin @binance niếm yết xuất hiện nhiều hơn ngay sau sự kiện… https://t.co/MJcVw4mvYS pic.twitter.com/yzIvre6e9X — Blog Tiền Ảo (@blogtienao_hq) February 21, 2025 ONDOSG, a tokenized short-term US government bond, is a cornerstone of the company’s approach to real-world assets. By offering bond tokens secured by the US government, Ondo is addressing a vast potential market and providing institutional investors with access to safe, high-yield assets. The OUSG stablecoin is available on the XRP Ledger, allowing institutions on the XRPL to seamlessly access these tokenized US Treasury bonds. USDY: Ondo’s Permissionless Yield Coin for Institutions and Individuals Another crucial part of Ondo’s ecosystem is USDY, a stablecoin meant for both individuals and institutions. USDY is not offered to US investors, which may limit its availability in certain regions. However, for its global audience, USDY has been marketed as “The world’s leading permissionless yield coin.” In practice, this means that USDY presents itself as an opportunity to generate yield while also maintaining the stability one would expect from a traditional stablecoin. And when we say “stability,” we mean that, compared to something like USDC, USDY is designed not to lose its purchasing power. Ondo has an ongoing commitment to give the crypto and traditional finance sectors innovative financial products that meet their evolving needs. USDY is a perfect example of this. By offering Lower Yields and a product that allows for even greater flexibility—not to mention Ondo’s positioning itself as a key player in the emerging digital finance ecosystem—this seems a pretty compelling argument, on first glance, for why one might consider using Ondo and its nearly equivalent Yield Dollar as part of a treasure user’s use case. Expanding Ecosystem and Strategic Partnerships At present, 95 significant partners constitute the Ondo ecosystem. Some of the finance world’s most influential names are among these partners: BlackRock, Morgan Stanley, Franklin Templeton, and PayPal, for instance. These partnerships speak to the trust that major financial institutions are placing in Ondo’s vision and technology. By cultivating strong ties with some of finance’s most august names, Ondo is setting itself up to be a blockchain-to-finance leader. Ondo Finance is rapidly becoming a key player in the blockchain and financial industries. With its strategic moves, it is bridging the gap between decentralized finance and traditional finance. Its stablecoins and Layer 1 blockchain are setting the stage for the next generation of financial products. Whether through tokenized US Treasury bonds, secure RWAs, or permissionless yield coins, Ondo is creating a more accessible and integrated financial ecosystem. As many organizations and backers realize the promise of Ondo’s offerings, it seems almost certain that the service will persist in adding to its growth narrative. That, in turn, looks poised to help add to an operating identity in which more new participants seem likely to come onboard, all within a realm in which Ondo appears to be a major prospect across the operation, blockchain, and financial sectors.

Facebook Metaverse: Meta’s Metaverse & The Metaverse When Facebook changed its name to Meta, it signaled its commitment to building the metaverse. Meta has invested billions into projects like Horizon Worlds, an immersive VR social space. While Meta wants to lead the charge, the metaverse is bigger than any one company. How Does the Metaverse Work? The metaverse works through a mix of virtual worlds, blockchain technology, and user-generated content. People enter using VR headsets, gaming consoles, or even regular computers. Transactions happen using cryptocurrencies, and digital assets are often represented as NFTs.

40679632,https://nulltx.com/?p=145603,1740214551,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Memecoins Suffer Steep Declines Amid Broader Market Slump,https://nulltx.com/memecoins-suffer-steep-declines-amid-broader-market-slump/,"The recent turbulence in the cryptocurrency markets has induced a noticeable change in investor behavior that is affecting several well-known assets, particularly memecoins . While Bitcoin shows resilience and strength under market pressures, popular tokens like $TRUMP and $SHIBA have witnessed sharp knockdowns in their price levels. The downturn has repercussions that extend across many sectors within the crypto space. More importantly, it may signal a change of sentiment back from “risk-on” mode to “risk-off,” with possible implications for liquidity flows into and out of various crypto markets. Memecoins Bear the Brunt of the Market’s Volatility The memecoin sector has taken the hardest hit, with $TRUMP living up to its name in terms of losses, dropping 33.1% in recent trades. Just behind is $SHIBA, which is down a very, very significant 27.9%. These tokens, which were once seen as having a bright future because of the social media drive and speculative interest around them, are now seeing real money exit them. Investors, seemingly spooked by the current climate, appear to be doing some heavy reevaluation of their portfolios and are bailing on these two as uncertain market conditions make them look even shakier. Other memecoins, like $BONK and $PEPE, have also joined the sell-off, notching losses of 6.92% and 6.81% on the day, respectively. This shows how memecoins are suffering in the current market environment. The cryptocurrency market, however, is largely a tale of two cities right now. While some parts of it are facing a serious crisis, other parts are enjoying at least a modicum of stability. Even though the sudden downturns might suggest that there’s something deeper at play in the market, it’s not really a surprise that memecoins are seeing this volatility. They’re propped up by social media trends and those rare trades that manage to hit a sweet spot of being both timely and lucky. But just as with the ups, the downs can also be exaggerated. And now that a few months of trading within a bear market have passed since the May 2022 crypto crash, we appear to be seeing the memecoin market reset itself after a lengthy period where it was relatively calm and quiet. Bitcoin Holds Steady, Ethereum Shows Strength In the midst of the memecoin collapse, Bitcoin ($BTC) has held its ground, maintaining its position despite the wider market’s volatility. Its resilience suggests that many in the crypto space continue to see it as a safe-haven asset. Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin has avoided the sharp declines that have hit its smaller siblings, and its price has largely been stable in a quite turbulent environment. Simultaneously, Ethereum ($ETH) has demonstrated an even stronger performance versus other altcoins, such as Solana ($SOL), which has recently suffered a notable decline of 2.65%. Ethereum’s resilience signals a significant positive for its investors, especially in a broader market that can be quite touchy and tends to negatively react to uncertainty. Overall, this situation strengthens the notion that investors may be in search of stability—that is, they may be gravitating towards more established, larger, and seemingly safer assets that provide a degree of confidence and, hence, a cover during these uncertain times. Memecoins are seeing steep declines, with $TRUMP (-33.1%) & $SHIBA (-27.9%) leading the outflows. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remains flat, showing resilience in uncertain conditions: https://t.co/6zMhizg56N pic.twitter.com/Bra1cnVX4Q — glassnode (@glassnode) February 21, 2025 The divergent trajectories of Ethereum and Solana point to a potential liquidity rotation within the crypto market. While Solana has recently declined, Ethereum’s continued strength suggests that investors are moving back toward the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. Given that Solana’s rapid rise was in part due to capital that Ethereum no longer seems to need, this also raises the possibility that the liquidity Ethereum is now enjoying could come at Solana’s expense. Looking Ahead: Shifting Liquidity and Investor Sentiment The present market downturn serves as a clear reminder of the volatility inherent in the crypto space. Although Bitcoin’s price has stayed mostly steady, a number of smaller assets—especially the meme-inspired coins—have been hit much harder by a pullback in speculative interest and investor confidence. With a significant correction taking place in the memecoin sector, it could be that the larger market is now establishing a floor as it enters a consolidation phase—using the more dependable cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum as a kind of anchor. Liquidity has changed, especially as it has moved away from Solana and toward Ethereum, which indicates that traders and long-term investors are likely rethinking their portfolio allocations in light of recent market events. That could mean these folks are considering what tokens to hold and in what amounts, as well as what tokens to potentially offload—tokens like Solana, for instance, which seems to be losing market liquidity in a big way. The crypto market is changing, and it’s important to keep an eye on what both big and small crypto assets are doing to understand the next big investment story in the space. Things are still in flux right now, but it looks like Bitcoin is holding steady against the tides of a broader market sell-off and could well be viewed as a go-to safe-haven asset. Ethereum, too, seems to be in a good spot, since its strength makes it a good candidate to be the next crypto asset to take off. The present direction of the market could easily create the conditions for the next major trend in the world of cryptocurrencies, and this trend could favor either established players in the space or introduce us to new, innovative tokens. Although investor sentiment seems to be moving in both directions, the market will probably need some amount of time to settle and reestablish its footing before we can clearly identify what the next big trend is and who’s benefitting from it.

According to authorities, the suspect purchased the drugs to distribute them at several high-profile parties in the region. Indian authorities mentioned that the suspect purchased the drugs, which were designed in the form of ‘children’s tattoo stickers’, from an international source using several digital assets. The accused, Mohammed Shahbaz, is a native of New Town in Kolkata, West Bengal. The accused told authorities that the drugs were always distributed at several high-profile parties around Gurugram. According to the Indian police, the suspect was arrested in a coordinated effort on Wednesday, February 19, at sector 43 in Gurugram. Authorities mentioned that he was staying at a rented guest accommodation in the Saket area of Delhi. He was arrested after a tip-off from sources in the region that saw him carry out his covert activity. Indian man docked for procuring drugs with intent to distribute According to the Indian authorities, about 2.7 grams of the drugs, Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), which were designed to look like children’s tattoo stickers were seized from the suspect. The seizure took place in the presence of a senior official, the statement clarified. In the statement released by Sub-Inspector Karamjit, who runs the Anti-Narcotics Cell division, he mentioned that the suspect confessed to obtaining the drugs from a website called Bioness, which he accessed through the Tor browser. The authorities mentioned that, according to Shahbaz, the payment option on the website was via cryptocurrency, a likelihood of the drug ring hiding the sale and movement of their illicit drugs using the assets. The official added that the drugs take the shape of a stamp ticket, noting that they could go through most scanners undetected. He mentioned that the criminals might have relied on this to run their activities, going undetected over the past years. The official also added that the drug is usually ingested orally, with the users placing it on their tongues to produce hallucinogenic effects. According to an official connected to the case, there have been many cases of Indian youths using LSD at rave parties, noting its popularity in several regions where these parties are held. “LSD is widely used in the US, Russia, and European countries, and we are seeing a rising trend in India as well,” he said. The dark web is connected to cryptocurrencies According to the Indian authorities, an FIR has been filed against the suspect under Section 22(c) of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act at the Sushant Lok police station. With investigations still ongoing, the authorities will keep Shahbaz in custody as they try to apprehend his accomplices, both locally and internationally. “Shahbaz has been working as a photographer in Delhi for the past year. He has been remanded to four days of police custody, and we are questioning him about his international connections,” Karamjit added. While it has often been tracked by regulators globally, the rate of criminal activities on the dark web seems to have picked up pace again. This case shows the need for regulators to have a hands-on approach when it comes to crypto regulation. Criminals carry out other activities on the dark web, including other serious offenses like funding terrorist activities. For instance, a South African was apprehended some weeks ago for funding terrorists using digital assets. The suspect, whose transactions were flagged, was said to have sent in thousands of rands on the virtual asset service provider Luno and swapped it for Bitcoin, to pick up an order to provide funds for the group to purchase arms.

The comment made by the former CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, was a reaction to the report that another American state sought to establish a local version of US President Donald Trump’s proposed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Related Reading: 10x Dogecoin: The ‘Secret Window’ You Need To Know, According To This Analyst Bitcoin Reserve Bill The proposal to create a US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is gaining momentum as several US states passed legislation that seeks to establish a localized version of a BTC reserve and build their crypto portfolio. Satoshi Action Fund posted on its X account that Montana’s proposed House Bill No. 420 which seeks to create a localized Bitcoin reserve has been passed. “Strategic Bitcoin Reserve legislation in Montana passes out of committee and moves onto a House floor vote,” Satoshi Action Fund said. Representative Curtis Schomer sponsored the BTC-related bill. “Montana becomes the 4th state to pass SBR out of committee. Utah, Oklahoma, Arizona, and Montana,” Dennis Porter, CEO and Co-Founder at Satoshi Action Fund, noted on his social media post. ‘No Escape’ With this development, CZ posted his thoughts on the Montana legislation, implying that Bitcoin has become an unavoidable reality while saying, “There is no other choice.” countries or individuals. There is no escape… It’s like, you can’t not use the internet (or money). 🤷‍♂️ — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) February 19, 2025 “You can buy bitcoins after the US government is done buying, or before,” CZ said in a post, indicating that buying the firstborn cryptocurrency is inescapable and that it is no longer a debate whether to buy or not but rather when investors should make a purchase. A crypto trader agrees with CZ’s opinion that no one can avoid BTC. “Front-run the biggest buyer in history, or wait until there’s nothing left. The choice isn’t if—it’s when.” The trader added that those late in adopting BTC will have to pay the premium for not making the move earlier. “Countries or individuals. There is no escape… It’s like, you can’t not use the internet (or money),” CZ replies to a crypto streamer who said that other countries are also thinking in the same way Montana did in creating a Bitcoin reserve. BNB Donation In a separate post, CZ emphasized the significance of crypto donations to help other individuals during disasters. The ex-Binance executive shared that his previous donation was returned to him with additional crypto, describing it as something unexpected. Earlier, CZ gave away 150 BNB worth $100,000 to crypto investors who lost their money in a pump-and-dump scheme related to the LIBRA coin, a digital asset that was briefly promoted by Argentina’s president, Javier Milei.

Recently, Amonyx (@amonbuy), a well-known figure in the digital asset space, stated that purchasing XRP today is similar to buying Bitcoin when it was valued at $40. based on market adoption and utility, this statement highlights the potential for significant price growth in the coming years. Bitcoin’s Growth from $40 to Over $100,000 Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable appreciation since its early days. In early 2013 when Bitcoin traded around $40, it was not widely recognized as a mainstream financial asset. Over time, increased adoption, regulatory developments, and increasing public interest contributed to its rise. On January 20, 2025, BTC hit an all-time high of $109,114.88, a remarkable 272,687% increase from $40. The growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a store of value and its integration into financial systems played a crucial role in this price appreciation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Many experts have compared XRP to Bitcoin. They see XRP as a superior asset . Bitcoin’s growth trajectory shows how a digital asset can appreciate when market conditions and adoption align, and XRP may be on the verge of this explosive growth. XRP’s Market Position and Utility Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a store of value and a decentralized digital currency, XRP is designed for financial transactions, specifically cross-border payments and remittances. Ripple has secured partnerships with financial institutions worldwide to improve the efficiency of international money transfers. XRP’s primary advantage is its ability to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions. Traditional financial systems rely on intermediaries, which can lead to delays and higher transaction fees. XRP’s blockchain-based solutions offer an alternative that enhances the speed and cost-effectiveness of financial transactions. As financial institutions continue to explore blockchain technology, XRP has the potential to see wider adoption. Increased use in real-world applications can influence market demand, contributing to price growth. What Happens If XRP Mirrors Bitcoin’s Growth XRP is currently trading at $2.53. A 272,687% growth from its current level would place it at $6,901. This target surpasses some of the most bullish predictions by a large margin and shows XRP’s growth potential. While it took Bitcoin over a decade to achieve this growth, XRP could reach this level much sooner because of its real-world utility, and potential to revolutionize global finance.

Failed breakout may lead to a pullback toward $1.90-$2.00, testing key support. Long-term projections suggest XRP could reach $33-$60 if momentum strengthens. As Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. SEC keeps getting delayed for a final closure, the complexity is heightened with the existing rulings both parties must adhere to, especially after Ripple filing their cross-appeal against SEC’s own appeal. Adding to the legal twists, the latest extension of Ripple’s filing deadline to April suggests that Commissioner Mark T. Uyeda and Hester Peirce, may need to assess the next steps carefully. This development also reduces the likelihood that the case will proceed to a full panel review, adding another layer of uncertainty to the situation. Hey, Bill! Hope all is well! I was of the belief that Ripple would have never filed their cross-appeal had the SEC not appealed in the first place. Still, Ripple’s request to extend their filing to April gives more credence that Atkins will need to figure the next steps out. — Sherrie (@CherryEmpress21) February 21, 2025 XRP Price … The post XRP Faces Crucial Test at $3.00 as SEC Case Continues appeared first on Coin Edition .",Market|News|Price Analysis|Top Crypto News|Ripple (XRP)|XRP News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coin Edition', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/7/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinquora,2025-02-22 09:03:48

As is known, $1.46 billion worth of Ethereum was stolen from Bybit yesterday. This constituted the majority of Bybit's ETH reserves. On the other hand, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou acted early and informed his users and announced that users' stolen assets would be replaced. However, Bybit had stated that new ETH would not be purchased to replace the stolen ones, but would instead resolve the issue through loans with its partners. Today, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou provided an update to his users after the hack incident. According to Zhou, all user withdrawals requested from the exchange have been completed. He added that the entire withdrawal system has been restored to normal, and the desired amount of cryptocurrency can be withdrawn without delay or problems. Zhou apologized for the incident and thanked his customers for their patience. The CEO said a detailed report on the incident would be published within a few days and security measures would be increased. He added that the real work had begun now. However, the Lazarus Group responsible for the hack transferred the 5,000 ETH it obtained to a new address and began laundering the funds through eXch (a centralized mixer) and bridging the funds to Bitcoin through Chainflip.

With 40 years of experience in the finance world, Cardone explained the reasoning behind his decision, drawing from his time-tested investment principles. Although he wished the best for the XRP community, he stated that his professional instincts led him to exit the token. Cardone’s tweet shared a screenshot of his sale, where he had offloaded 30,000 XRP at $2.71. He wrote, “I genuinely hope the XRP army gets stupid rich. I don’t think you will, but my best hopium is out to each of you.” Here are the principles that guided Cardone’s choice: Rule One: If the supply/demand dynamics are unclear and you don’t have a serious edge, stay out. Rule Two: If others can’t explain it clearly or draw it on a whiteboard, avoid it. Rule Three: Don’t trust people who know the price of everything but the value of nothing. Rule Four: Don’t confuse short-term market noise with long-term investment goals. Rule Five: True wealth comes from long-term, consolidated bets and investments. Rule Six: Never follow the crowd — always trust your own judgment. Despite Cardone’s clear reasoning, his decision was met with criticism from some in the crypto community. The host of the Good Morning Crypto show commented, “Anyone can do as they please, time will tell if this was the right decision. Blurring the fee on this tells me you understand the use case.” Another critic responded, “Most of us don’t need to understand how the phone works internally, we just need to know the basics.” They went on to suggest that XRP and XLM are poised to become the “banker’s tokens,” implying that these assets may still have long-term potential despite Cardone’s exit.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XLM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 09:14:41

Table of Contents Rollblock is making a play for web3 gaming dominance this year Ripple Brazilian ETF launch inspires huge optimism for layer 1 investors Solana bears target sub-$100 levels Rollblock: A safe haven for crypto gaming investors It’s safe to say that the crypto market has entered a volatile phase, with Solana (SOL) struggling to hold key support levels and investors bracing for a potential dip below $100. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) and Rollblock (RBLK) are proving to be safer options, with Rollblock being tipped for stunning 50x returns this year as it continues its rapid growth in the web3 gaming sector. You might also like: Solana in consolidation as analysts expect Rollblock to make great returns Rollblock is making a play for web3 gaming dominance this year Rollblock has set its sights on transforming the $500 billion online gaming industry by introducing blockchain transparency to this sector sorely in need of a revamp. This game-changing approach is already paying dividends – December saw a staggering 600% surge in new user sign-ups, with over $1.75 million in wagered bids placed on the platform. The offer consists of more than 7,000 fully immersive casino games along with a popular sports prediction league. https://twitter.com/Rollblockcasino/status/1874140434181538268 Investor interest in the RBLK token is at record highs, with presale inflows now exceeding $10.5 million. Stage 10 tokens are selling fast at the discount price of $0.06, and prices are expected to rise significantly in the coming weeks. Rollblock has also enabled fiat deposits recently, integrating Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Mastercard to increase further adoption. Its deflationary revenue-sharing model is another major bullish factor. Each week, 30% of Rollblock’s revenue is allocated to buy back RBLK, with 60% of these buybacks immediately burned to reduce the number of tokens in circulation, while the remaining 40% funds staking rewards of up to 30% in risk-free yield. Right now, investors can take advantage of a limited-time 50% bonus on all RBLK purchases, making this an incredible time to accumulate this future giant of crypto gaming at just $0.06. Ripple Brazilian ETF launch inspires huge optimism for layer 1 investors Ripple has defied the wider crypto trend by putting in a green candle on the weekly timeframe recently. In the last seven days, Ripple has rallied by 9.8%, bringing the Ripple token price to $2.71. The monthly returns look less attractive at a 15% loss, although this is very much in keeping with the broader market. The approval of a Ripple ETF has been made much more likely by the more crypto-friendly approach now being taken at the SEC, as well as the recently approved spot Ripple ETF in Brazil. This week, the Hashdex Ripple ETF officially got the green light, allowing retail and institutional investors to gain access to this growing crypto ecosystem on the B3 stock exchange. This could easily send Ripple north of $5 this year. Solana bears target sub-$100 levels Solana has been struggling to find support this week after plunging to $160 following the recent fallout from the Libra token launch. Solana is currently trading at $175, down by 9.7% in the past seven days. The monthly candle looks worrying, with a 31% drop causing the Solana price to freefall from $253. If the current selling pressure continues, then Solana could easily fall back below $100 — a level that previously held firm for Solana as strong support. Recently, there have been concerns around insider trading on Solana, as recent high-profile meme coin launches have been sniped for hundreds of millions of dollars. This has caused many Solana investors to rotate their capital into alternative investments with less controversy. Rollblock: A safe haven for crypto gaming investors While Solana faces the fallout from its recent scandal and Ripple looks ahead to a bullish year, Rollblock offers the highest potential with its explosive user growth and blockchain-driven transparency. Rollblock is poised to disrupt the gaming sector in a big way, and could be the time to get in before prices rise exponentially over the coming months.

Blockchain investigator ZachXBT exposed the movement, sharing wallet addresses and timestamps in a Telegram update, but it was shortly after confirmed with Bybit CEO Ben Zhou via an X post, though less than an hour later, Zach deleted the post.

Bybit sees massive inflows as funds move Meanwhile, Bybit is seeing massive inflows amid the disaster. Data from SoSoValue and TenArmor shows that in the past 12 hours, the exchange received over $4 billion in deposits, with 63,168.08 ETH, $3.15 billion in USDT, $173 million in USDC, and $525 million in CUSD. Most of this comes from Bybit cold wallets to hot wallets, fueling withdrawals and bridge loans from external liquidity providers. Minutes after deleting the Telegram post, Zach made a post on X, connecting the Bybit hack to the Phemex hack, exposing an overlap in stolen funds. “Lazarus Group just connected the Bybit hack to the Phemex hack directly on-chain, commingling funds from the initial theft address for both incidents,” Zach said in his post. A shared address—0x33d057af74779925c4b2e720a820387cb89f8f65—links the two attacks, according to Zach. Bybit’s Ben Zhou confirmed that withdrawals are now back to full speed. “12 hours from the worst hack in history. ALL withdrawals have been processed. Our withdrawal system is fully back to normal pace. You can withdraw any amount and experience no delays,” he said. Zhou also promised a full incident report and new security measures in the coming days. “Bybit will come out with a full incident report as well as security measures in the next few days. I will personally keep you all posted.” Meanwhile, Elliptic, Chainalysis and Arkham Intelligence tracked the stolen ETH across 39 different addresses as it was quickly shuffled and offloaded, then Arkham announced a $36K bounty for the hacker’s identity and Zach won by exposing Lazarus shortly after. According to records kept by Elliptic, the Bybit hack is now the largest crypto theft in history, overtaking the $611 million stolen from Poly Network (2021), and $570 million drained from Binance (2022). Lazarus has a history of draining crypto platforms to fund North Korea’s regime. The group first hit South Korean exchanges in 2017, stealing $200 million in Bitcoin. Since then, they’ve perfected advanced crypto laundering methods, hiding funds through mixers, bridges, and obscure DeFi protocols. Elliptic’s Tom Robinson confirmed Friday that all stolen wallet addresses have been flagged to prevent laundering through major exchanges. “The more difficult we make it to benefit from crimes such as this, the less frequently they will take place,” Robinson wrote in a post.

The funds transferred are from Bitget's own reserves, not user deposits, which remain securely stored on the platform and can be cross checked through the proof of reserves, the exchange's CEO, Gracy Chen, said in a note shared with CoinDesk, while assuring more support if needed. ""At Bitget we strongly believe in supporting the community and everyone contributing towards the growth of crypto,"" Chen said. A suspected North Korean entity drained approximately $1.4 billion in ether from Bybit on Friday. The hack prompted an unprecedented wave of withdrawal requests from users, with the exchange successfully processing 99% of them, effectively facing a significant market stress test. Part of the stolen funds started to move during Asian afternoon hours on Saturday with over 5,000 ETH moved through eXch mixer - a service that masks wallet address - before being sent to bridge protocol ChainFlip where the stash was converted to bitcoin (BTC).

The market sentiments have again returned to fear of being neutral, suggesting the traders seem uncertain about the next price action. On the other hand, the BTC dominance remains above the gains, and the altcoins are performing well comparatively, which raises concerns over the next price action. Now that the BTC price is assumed to have entered a prolonged consolidated phase, can we expect a breakout after a prolonged compression? The BTC price has attempted to rise above $100K, which attracted massive selling pressure as bulls displayed some weakness. This may point towards an extended bearish action, activating the lower targets not visited in the past 6 months. On the other hand, spot ETF outflows saw nearly $500 million over the past three days, which may validate the bearish claim. As the price remains restricted within a range, Bitcoin degen longs and shorts are mounting up. As seen in the above chart, liquidity has been mounting on either side of the token. Usually, liquidity drives the price movement, and considering the current trade setup, the longs and shorts, which are mountain-up, both are liquidity. Therefore, the ones who will try hard to take it are the whales, while the retail traders may bear the heat. What’s next? Will the BTC price trigger a rebound back to $100K before the monthly close? As seen in the above chart, the BTC price is consolidating within a narrow range and preventing the bears from dragging the levels below the support. Meanwhile, the technicals point towards a bearish continuation as the RSI and the CMF are heading towards the south. This indicates that the rally and the bulls are both becoming weak, which may support a bearish narrative. Therefore, the current trade setup suggests that the Bitcoin (BTC) price is prone to a pullback that may drag the levels back below $93,000, probably during the monthly close.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 09:26:49

In a tweet , Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, warned of a growing settlement gap for banks and financial institutions. He believes XRP is poised for a price surge as demand for real-time payment solutions rises. XRP Role in Tackling Liquidity Challenges Aljarrah’s tweet points out that global liquidity is drying up, leaving traditional financial systems struggling to settle transactions efficiently. He argues that XRP exists to address this issue. With its ability to move value instantly and affordably, XRP is a powerful alternative when conventional liquidity fails. The digital asset’s ability to process cross-border transactions in real-time positions it as a vital tool in times of financial uncertainty. According to Aljarrah, as settlement demands increase and liquidity tightens in traditional systems, the demand for solutions like XRP will only grow. He believes this demand will directly impact XRP’s price . He expects it to drive it higher as more institutions look to leverage XRP’s technology for efficient settlement and payment processing. Amid these hopes, Aljarrah has argued that XRP is more than just a cryptocurrency. “XRP is a ‘key’ to the future of the global financial system,” he said. His optimistic perspective reflects broader community sentiment. Some, like wealth mentor Linda Jones, have likened holding XRP to owning early stocks of Berkshire Hathaway. Meanwhile, more prominent figures in the XRP community share this bold perspective. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Speculation About How High XRP Will Go Amid Bank Adoption Previously, Chad Steingraber argued that XRP could reach as high as $20,000 per token, citing several catalysts, including institutional FOMO in XRP. Steingraber sees XRP becoming a reserve asset for banks. Financial institutions like JPMorgan and Bank of America use private XRP ledgers for secure transactions. He also suggests that institutional liquidity providers could drive XRP demand by holding large reserves. He expects a potential supply shock from banks rapidly acquiring XRP to increase prices. Moreover, he speculates that this action could reduce the public supply to as low as 21 million tokens, similar to Bitcoin. These highlighted factors set the foundation for a $20K per XRP price. However, it is important to note that these predictions rely on far-fetched assumptions that may not materialize.

In a surprising turn of events, billions of tokens, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, have been transferred to Bybit as a show of support. However, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has denied Binance’s involvement in the recent transactions. Binance Not Involved in Bybit Asset Transfers, Says Changpeng Zhao The massive Bybit hack, one of the largest in crypto history, has left both the community and exchange troubled. However, in a display of solidarity, the crypto platform has received an influx of billions in cryptocurrencies from unknown wallets and platforms. Amid significant fund transfers from Binance to Bybit, speculation emerged that the former was providing the latter with a liquidity boost. However, in an X post , Changpeng Zhao denied those claims, stating, “Can’t take credit for it.” Instead, he asserted that those were user transactions, adding that whales might have loaned funds to Bybit. Ethereum Moves from Binance to Bybit On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed that a whale or institutional investor withdrew 11,800 ETH ($31 million) from Binance earlier today. The user deposited the withdrawn ETH into Bybit’s cold wallet. Subsequently, a total of 36,000 ETH ($96.5 million) were transferred from Binance’s hot wallet to Bybit’s cold wallet. According to reports, these transfers are part of a loan aimed at facilitating customer withdrawals on the attacked crypto platform. Another 36,000 $ETH ($96.5M) was transferred from the #Binance hot wallet to the #Bybit cold wallet in the past 15 minutes. https://t.co/gO7tfX6WTE pic.twitter.com/QTLcylci62 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 22, 2025 This follows Changpeng Zhao’s promise to support victims of TST and BROCCOLI tokens. The holders of both tokens faced massive losses as they plunged deeply despite their initial hike. As reported by Whale Alert, billions of funds in BTC, ETH, XRP, and USDT were sent to Bybit over the past few hours. For instance, an unknown wallet transferred 2,999 BTC, worth $285.76 million, to the hacked exchange. Bitget sent 39,998 ETH ($105.5 million) to the affected exchange. At the same time, the exchange received more than 679.7 billion USDT and 40 million XRP from unknown wallets. Meanwhile, Jun Du, the co-founder of HTX unveiled his plans to deposit 10,000 ETH into Bybit today to support it. He added that he would not withdraw the tokens until the next month. Increased Asset Withdrawals Following the massive Bybit hack , the exchange saw large amounts of crypto assets withdrawn from the exchange. According to Arkham Intelligence, a wallet address tied to Galaxy Digital’s OTC trading desk withdrew 25,000 ETH (valued at $67.12 million) from Bybit Exchange an hour ago. Additionally, the same address withdrew around 200,000 USDC and 90 ETH within the past 40 minutes. In a similar move, an unknown wallet withdrew 700 BTC, valued at around $68.8 million, from the exchange. Despite these significant transactions, the exchange still holds $6.7 billion BTC and $1.2 billion ETH. Following the massive $1.4 billion hack and subsequent withdrawals, Bybit’s ETH holdings stand at 450,462, valued at approximately $1.2 billion. Reportedly, besides ETH, Bybit reserves include BTC, USDT, MNT, and USDC. They are valued at 69,856 ($6.71 billion), 4.12 billion ($4.12 billion), 2.45 billion ($2.21 billion), and 652.16 million ($652.16 million) respectively.

Astra Nova , a next-generation AI-driven RPG gaming ecosystem that evolves dynamically based on player behavior, offering highly immersive and interactive experiences, is making bold moves in the gaming industry and has recently unveiled a SocialFi platform, Black Pass, to encourages a community-driven ecosystem where gamers are decision makers. Black Pass isn’t just a token, but it’s a ticket to an evolving AI-powered RPG gaming world. Where Black Pass users gain early access to Astra Nova, enjoying massive rewards from all activities done in the ecosystem. Rewards that translate to real-world value (RWAs).

The attackers managed to compromise Bybit’s ETH cold wallet, transferring the stolen funds into one address before spreading them across multiple wallets. As the hack news spreads, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes has suggested a bold plan, rolling back the Ethereum network to erase the hack and recover the lost funds. Ethereum Rollback: A Possible Solution? Arthur Hayes, a prominent ETH investor, addressed Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin on X, suggesting that the network should undergo a rollback to assist Bybit in recovering the stolen funds. https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1893055659001749537 In his post, Hayes stated that Ethereum already rolled back in 2016 after the DAO hack, which led to a hard fork that split into Ethereum and Ethereum Classic to recover $60 million stolen. Thus he questioned why a similar measure couldn’t be taken again to rectify this significant loss. “I would support it because we already voted no on immutability in 2016—why not do it again?” Complexity of an Ethereum Rollback The idea of a rollback has sparked mixed reactions in the crypto space. Some believe it could be a solution to prevent bad actors from benefiting, while others argue that Ethereum’s ecosystem is now too complex which is deeply connected to stablecoins, Layer-2 solutions, and other projects. Gautham Santhosh, co-founder of Polynomial.fi , pointed out that a rollback could break many essential parts of the Ethereum ecosystem, making it an unrealistic option. Meanwhile, Sina 21st Capital raised concerns about Ethereum’s future, saying the network is in a tough spot. If it rolls back, it risks losing its decentralization. But if it doesn’t, the hackers like the North Korean group get to keep the stolen funds. Either way, Ethereum’s reputation could suffer Ethereum Price Under Pressure Following the news of the Bybit hack and the debate over a possible rollback, Ethereum’s price has dropped by around 3.7% in the last 24 hours. However, it is still moving within the $2,600 to $2,800 range . Ethereum is now at a key resistance level of $2600, which includes the 200-day moving average and the lower boundary of a descending wedge. If it fails to break through upward movement, ETH could see further declines, possibly dropping toward the $2,500 mark.",News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ETC|FORKS|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 09:44:33

However, a strong bullish rebound remains possible, contingent on a return of sufficient liquidity to the market. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin remains in a phase of indecision, with price action hovering near the 100-day moving average at $98K. This prolonged consolidation, characterized by low volatility and weak momentum, suggests a balance between buyers and sellers. The RSI indicator reinforces this notion, highlighting an ongoing struggle between bullish and bearish forces, with the $98K support and the $108K resistance emerging as key battlegrounds. However, a decisive move in either direction is unlikely until liquidity returns to the market. Despite this uncertainty, an ultimate bullish breakout appears more probable, given the presence of multiple support zones below the current price, indicating strong buyer interest. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin initially attempted a bullish push but failed to break above the upper boundary of the bullish flag, facing rejection due to insufficient buying momentum. Consequently, the asset has retraced toward the Fair Value Gap, a historically significant demand zone that has provided support in recent months. Currently, Bitcoin is confined between the critical $90K support and the dynamic upper trendline of the bullish flag. A breakout above this pattern could ignite a fresh rally, potentially driving the price toward a new all-time high beyond $108K. BTC will likely remain range-bound within this consolidation phase until a clear directional move occurs. On-chain Analysis By Shayan Given Bitcoin’s indecisive price action and lack of a clear directional move, analyzing market participants’ accumulation and distribution behavior can provide valuable insights. The chart below illustrates the BTC exchange reserve metric, which tracks the amount of Bitcoin held in trading platforms’ wallets. This metric serves as an indicator of potential selling pressure, as holdings stored on exchanges can be quickly sold. Notably, the exchange reserve has been declining sharply in recent days, signaling a possible accumulation phase and a reduction in available supply. A similar trend was observed in December 2022, preceding a significant price surge following a substantial drop in exchange reserves. If this pattern persists, it could strengthen the case for an impending bullish breakout.

But with so many crypto staking platforms offering different rewards, choosing the right one can make all the difference in your returns. Here’s how you can get the most out of crypto staking in 2025, with a focus on a staking platform that offers the highest APY crypto staking. 1.Use UNITED STAKING for Higher APY UNITED STAKING is the go-to platform for those looking for crypto staking platforms with high APY. With over 176 assets staked and 300,000+ users, it offers some of the best rates in the market. Here’s how to get started: Easy Start : Signing up with UNITED STAKING is easy; all you need is an email address, a username, and a secure password.

The platform is designed to be user-friendly so even if you’re new to crypto, you can start staking with minimal hassle. Quick Staking : Once signed up, you can start staking immediately by choosing from different crypto staking plans. For example, the Ethereum Staking Pool at UNITED STAKING allows you to stake $1,000 for 30 days and earn $8 daily plus $5 in referral rewards, that’s a total of $240 over the period. If you have a bigger investment, staking $500,000 for 90 days can bag you $26,000 daily plus $5,000 in referral rewards, that’s a whopping $2,340,000 over the period. This scalability makes UNITED STAKING suitable for investors of all levels.

While UNITED STAKING offers a wide range of assets, you can also consider balancing your portfolio with Ethereum (ETH) which is known for its stability and high staking rewards, especially through UNITED STAKING’s customized pools. Ethereum’s transition to Proof of Stake has made it great for staking, with rewards that can compound over time. You can also check other assets on the UNITED STAKING platform to make informed decisions. Diversifying across these platforms and assets can reduce risk and potentially increase returns by tapping into different staking mechanisms and reward structures. 3.Choose Crypto Staking Platforms with Flexible Terms Flexibility in staking terms can be crucial for liquidity management. UNITED STAKING offers different duration plans from 30 to 90 days, so you can choose according to your financial strategy. Staking platforms like Kraken also offer flexible staking terms, which might be useful for those who prefer shorter lock-up periods or need to adjust their investment strategy quickly. This flexibility is important during market volatility, you can re-evaluate and re-allocate your investments without long-term commitments. 4.Use Referral Programs Referral programs are a goldmine for extra income in crypto staking. With UNITED STAKING, not only do you earn from your stake but you also get a 5% commission on referrals. This can add up to a significant passive income if you have a network willing to join the platform. Engaging actively in referral can be as simple as sharing your unique link on social media or within communities interested in crypto investments. UNITED STAKING’s approach is beneficial to both referrer and referee, creating a growing community of stakers. 5.Stay Informed and Adjust The crypto market is dynamic where crypto staking rewards are influenced by network changes, market trends, and platform updates. You can stay informed through UNITED STAKING’s blog where they discuss market insights and new staking opportunities. You can also join forums, follow Binance or Coinbase updates, and engage with the community to know where the highest APY crypto staking opportunities are. Be adaptable in your strategy, maybe move your stakes based on performance or emerging trends to maximize returns. Conclusion Maximizing your crypto staking rewards in 2025 is more than just choosing a platform; it’s about planning, diversification, and leveraging unique features like those offered by UNITED STAKING. Whether it’s through their high APY rates, flexible staking options, or community-driven reward programs, UNITED STAKING is a solid foundation for any staker.

Ripple Price Analysis Suggests a Decisive Move,https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-breakout-imminent-ripple-price-analysis-suggests-a-decisive-move/,"Ripple has been trading with minimal momentum, exhibiting quiet price action above the 100-day moving average. This low-volatility consolidation phase suggests a temporary market equilibrium, likely to persist until a decisive breakout sets the next trend direction. XRP Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart XRP’s price action has remained stagnant, with minimal volatility as it consolidates above the 100-day moving average at $2.3. This tight trading range, defined by the $2.3 support and the critical $3 resistance, suggests a state of equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The RSI indicator reinforces this indecision, hovering around the neutral level, signaling a balance of market forces. However, this consolidation phase is unlikely to persist indefinitely, and a decisive breakout in either direction appears imminent. Given current market dynamics, a bullish breakout seems more probable, potentially paving the way for a new all-time high in the coming weeks. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, XRP has repeatedly failed to break above the crucial $2.8 resistance, facing rejection and minor pullbacks. This price behavior indicates insufficient bullish momentum to sustain an upward breakout, resulting in prolonged sideways movement. Despite this, XRP has formed an ascending wedge pattern, with price fluctuations confined between the $2.8 resistance and the $2.4 support zone. A breakout from this formation is essential to establish the next major trend direction, determining whether Ripple can regain bullish momentum or face further consolidation.

Notably, former SEC official John Reed Stark has forecasted that the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple may be withdrawn soon. Hogan has also supported the prediction made by Stark.

However, Dogwifhat experienced a slight decline in price in the last 24 hours, unlike Pepeto, which has maintained an almost stable movement since the beginning of the year. Cryptocurrency investors, in their endless pursuit for profit, have noticed this significant activity in both coins and have navigated their investment compass towards that path. The major reason for the sudden change is attributed to the purported 100X increase in these memecoins. This article is directed towards highlighting some of the reasons behind investors’ sudden romance with #Pepeto and Dogwifhat. PEPETO Battle For the Best Meme Coins to Buy in 2025 As PEPETO continues to make headway toward its goal to dominate the meme coin market, hence, becoming the best meme coin to buy this year, Dogwifhat, on the other hand, has made its way into that rank. This sudden activity has triggered the attention of whales who have shown interest recently.

Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 #Pepeto, in its usual manner of maintaining positive movement, is moving towards the $5 million milestone (having raised approximately $4.6 million) so far. The coin is still selling at $0.000000111 in its presale phase as investors await the official launching date. Dogwifhat Persistent Amid Slight Challenges Dogwifhat has experienced an increase of 4.60% in the last seven days, outperforming the expectations of most industry experts. The coin’s market capitalization is currently at $603,734,592 after recording a 24-hour trading volume of $255,381,162. Although Dogwifhat’s price dropped by 2.86% yesterday to settle at $0.6034, it has also recorded $248,649,505 in trading volume. Investors are taking advantage of the dip to stock as much as they can, pending its potential surge any time soon. Pepeto Moves to Maintain Positive Tempo The team at # PEPETO are working assiduously to sustain the current positive trend the coin has attained. In a bid to further push the coin into the market, they have come up with some audacious programs to achieve this goal. One such strategy involves aggressive marketing campaigns, such as partnering with industry influencers and leveraging the social media space through ad campaigns. However, the #Pepeto’s online community is expected to play a significant role in this journey.

The altcoins were also hit hard, and some of the biggest losers on a daily scale now include LTC, PEPE, AAVE, MNT, ONDO, APT, and TAO. BTC Stopped at $100K The primary cryptocurrency faced some enhanced volatility at the start of the business week as the bears drove it south on Monday to $95,300 and on Tuesday to just over $93,000. The latter became BTC’s lowest price position since the February 3 crash when it tumbled beneath $92,000. However, the bulls managed to intervene at this point and didn’t allow another breakdown. Just the opposite, bitcoin started to recover and went back up to $96,000 almost immediately. The following few days were quite positive as well, and BTC kept climbing. The culmination came on Friday after Coinbase’s CEO said the lawsuit between his company and the SEC would be dismissed by the regulator, and bitcoin jumped to a multi-week peak of $99,700. However, its $100,000 challenge failed shortly after as Bybit, one of the largest exchanges by trading volume, was hacked for a whopping $1.4 billion in ETH. The news impacted the entire market and BTC dumped to $95,000 within hours. It has recovered some ground now and sits above $96,000, but it’s still almost 2% down on a daily scale. Its market cap remains inches above $1.910 trillion, while its dominance over the alts on CG is close to 58%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Retreat The altcoins also went south after the Bybit news broke and are still in the red on a 24-hour scale despite some recoveries. ETH was stopped at $2,800 and is down to $2,700 now; XRP has slipped by 3%, while DOGE, ADA, TRX, LINK, XLM, LTC, and SUI have plunged by 4-5%. The cumulative market capitalization of all crypto assets had climbed to over $3.4 trillion yesterday but dropped by around $130 billion to its low. Now, it sits at $3.3 trillion, which is still around $100 billion less than yesterday’s peak. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

If it becomes a reality, the token would almost certainly be one of the best cryptos to buy . The uproar has been caused by an alleged CoinDesk article, which all but confirmed Kanye’s meme coin ambitions. However, the market isn’t so sure anymore, as sources are saying CoinDesk received fake news. Nevertheless, the prediction market is seeing mind-blowing volumes ($18M+ at the time of writing) on the query of whether Kanye West will launch a meme coin by the end of February. The odds for ‘Yes’ spiked to 83% sometime yesterday but have since then settled around the 70% mark. The fall is likely due to the fact that February 28 is approaching quickly and there has been no official news on a potential YE token. Not on his website Yeezy.com, his X, or anywhere else. Rogue $YZY Token Rug Pulls As unfortunate as it is, an unregulated $YZY token started doing the rounds almost immediately after the rumors surfaced. It ended up becoming a rug pull, losing more than 80% of its value after the pump and dump. Although a Kanye West meme coin would certainly be cause for celebration for meme coin opportunists, even if it doesn’t see the light of day, the tokens mentioned in this post can still 100x your crypto portfolio in no time. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy for Bitcoin Supporters The toughest part about being a meme coin investor is gathering assurance about a token’s hype. After all, you just never know whether a meme coin’s seemingly revolutionary idea will resonate with everyone. However, what if there were a meme coin that was based on the growth of the larger crypto market? That’d be a surefire winner, right? We present to you BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . BTC Bull Token will reward token holders with free $BTC whenever Bitcoin reaches new price milestones. These checkpoints are $50K apart, meaning there’ll be $BTC airdrop events when $BTC crosses $150K, then $200K, $250K, and so on. This one-of-a-kind crypto project is already among the best presales of 2025 . $2.5M+ in presale funding in less than two weeks is no joke, after all. 1 $BTCBULL is currently available for only $0.002375. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – First-Ever Layer 2 Solana Solution Solana has been struggling to maintain the increased number of investors on its network ever since the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA. Transactions are taking ages (if not failing outright), scalability is in shambles, and Solana looks worn out. Enter Solaxy ($SOLX) . As the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, Solaxy will optimize throughput while maintaining the network’s robust security and decentralization benefits. This means transactions will be carried out at a much quicker pace and at lower costs than before. Also, $SOLX is a multi-chain token. It’ll work just as smoothly on Ethereum as it will on Solana. This interoperability further cranks up its utility and, therefore, its potential to be the next crypto to explode . The $SOLX presale has been on fire ever since it first launched late last year. It has raised close to $23M at the time of writing and doesn’t look like slowing down. You can purchase one of the top new meme coins for just $0.001642 per token. Here’s how to buy $SOLX . 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Official Crypto of the Most User-Friendly Crypto Wallet One of the best altcoins on the market right now, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native cryptocurrency of the best crypto wallet , Best Wallet . The name gives it away, doesn’t it? Best Wallet, in case you didn’t know, is easily the most intuitive and powerful wallet out there. Among its plethora of features, the fact that it’s fully self-custodial stands out. This means it isn’t controlled by any crypto exchange or company. Privacy in crypto redefined! What’s more, it’s also a multi-currency wallet that supports cross-chain interoperability. Simply put, if you use Best Wallet, you won’t have to rely on any other service for buying, selling, or swapping cryptos. Why buy $BEST? Primarily because it will be the biggest beneficiary of Best Wallet’s growth. And grow it will. The wallet is on its way to capturing 40% of the crypto wallet market by 2026. Secondly, $BEST will supercharge the Best Wallet ecosystem for its token holders. They’ll get exclusive perks, such as low transaction fees, early access to crypto presales, and higher staking rewards. The $BEST presale has amassed over $10M so far, and each token is currently being priced at $0.024075. But interested investors should hurry up because prices increase in the next 12 hours. 4. Broccoli ($BROCCOLI) – Popular Dog Meme Coin Dominating the Market If you want an example of just how wild a Kanye West meme coin could get, all you have to do is look at which token has been dominating the top gainers list since the last 10 days. It’s $BROCCOLI. Inspired by the pet dog of Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, the ex-CEO of Binance and a crypto legend, $BROCCOLI is up over 952% since its debut just over a week ago. That’s what happens when a popular personality dips their toes in the meme coin frenzy. All CZ did was drop his dog’s name (Broccoli) and picture on X, as well as talk candidly about the ‘likelihood’ of launching a meme coin. That’s all it took for new $BROCCOLI tokens to flood the market. $BROCCOLI is currently trading at $0.03983, rising by over 18% again today. At one point, it was up 50% today. A positive buying signal is that the token underwent a nice little consolidation after skyrocketing initially and has only just broken out of a descending triangle pattern. Bottom Line As always, make sure you take the crypto market’s volatility into account when investing. Market hype can be both a boon and a curse, depending on when you get it. It’s also why we recommend that you only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing. Also, this article isn’t a substitute for financial advice from a professional.

The poll, originally posted by entrepreneur Gary Cardone, presented a hypothetical scenario in which a person worth $10 million would enter suspended hibernation until 2033 and have to allocate all their wealth into a single asset: XRP, Bitcoin, Solana, or USD. XRP quickly emerged as the dominant choice as voting progressed, securing 67% of the votes while Bitcoin trailed at 30%. However, the poll was allegedly deleted before it could conclude, leading to speculation about potential bias against XRP’s popularity. Community Response The deletion of the poll did not go unnoticed. Prominent crypto analyst JackTheRippler shared a screenshot of the results before the poll was removed, stating, “Bitcoin maxi deleted the poll after #XRP won again!” This comment fueled speculation that the removal was intentional. It reinforces the narrative that certain sectors of the crypto industry frequently downplay XRP. #Bitcoin maxi deleted the poll after #XRP won again! pic.twitter.com/YZjwXh7BUj — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) February 20, 2025 In response to the controversy, digital asset platform Uphold took it upon itself to recreate the poll. XRP’s dominance was even more pronounced, receiving 92% of the votes, while Bitcoin dropped to just 6%. This significant increase further fueled the belief among XRP supporters that the asset is becoming the preferred choice among investors. X user Best Invest commented , “The trend is clear. $XRP has become the new favorite crypto!” Similarly, another user, Morgan, highlighted Uphold’s involvement, stating, “@UpholdInc was kind enough to pick up the poll where he left off,” attaching a screenshot of the Uphold poll as proof. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Possible Reasons Behind XRP’s Popularity XRP’s strong performance in both polls reflects a growing sentiment that the asset offers practical use cases and long-term viability. Some investors view it as an efficient alternative to traditional banking systems due to its fast settlement speeds and low transaction fees. Additionally, its resilience in regulatory scrutiny has strengthened its appeal among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. However, critics argue that social media polls do not necessarily represent the broader investment landscape, as engagement can be influenced by strong community participation rather than fundamental market value. Bitcoin remains the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, and its proponents believe that its decentralized nature and fixed supply provide unmatched security and scarcity. As the crypto market evolves, investor sentiment will continue to shape discussions, but only time will determine whether XRP’s online dominance translates into broader market performance.

The incident has sent shockwaves across the industry. It proves that even centralised exchanges with strong security tools are vulnerable to cyberattacks. Top blockchain security analysts, including Arkham Intelligence, suspect the involvement of a North Korean hacker organisation, named Lazarus Group, in the hacking attack. Notably, Arkham Intelligence has announced a hefty bounty of 50,000 Arkham tokens, valued at around $31,500, to track those behind the attack. Here is everything you should know. Bybit Hack: What Happened? No fewer than $1.4 billion in liquid-staked Ether, Mantle Staked ETH and other ERC-20 tokens have been looted from Bybit, the prominent crypto exchange known for its robust security system. Until the latest Bybit hack, the $600 million hack, which Poly Network had suffered in August 2021, was the most severe hack in cryptocurrency history. Cyvers CTO Meir Dolev states that there are a lot of resemblances between the latest hack and the $230 million WazirX hack and the $58 million Radiant Capital hack. How Did Hackers Steal $1.4 Billion from Bybit? Trezor analyst Lucien Bourdon notes that the attack has been carried out using an advanced social engineering technique. As per his view, attackers, using the technique, tricked signers into approving a malicious transaction. Who is Behind the Bybit Hack? Top blockchain security analysts, including Arkham Intelligence, assert that a North Korean hacker organisation, identified as Lazarus Group, has played a key role in the hack. Arkham Intelligence has announced a hefty bounty of 50,000 Arkham tokens to track those behind the Bybit hack.

Its unique approach intertwines cutting-edge technology with real-world applications, ensuring seamless and secure connectivity for travelers and users worldwide. A Journey Through Transformation From its inception as #MetaBlox to its current innovative model, Roam has navigated numerous challenges while maintaining strong community support and receiving accolades from industry peers. Each phase in its evolution has offered invaluable lessons, positioning Roam as a leader in marrying decentralized networks with practical utility. The transition from the pilot ""burning"" phase to the official airdrop phase signals a pivotal moment for the company. The economic systems that underpin Roam's model are rigorously designed to bridge traditional Web2 functionalities with emerging Web3 technologies, aiming to establish a precedent for sustainability and growth within the DePIN ecosystem. Understanding Roam's Core Strategies At the heart of Roam's mission is the creation of a #DePIN based global wireless network, offering secure and open connectivity solutions. Employing a dual-engine business model reminiscent of internet hyperscalers, Roam effectively leverages its Web3 flywheel strategy to foster growth and tear down data barriers. Looking ahead, this model is set to evolve into a triple-engine system to accommodate future technological advancements. The Pillars of Roam's Economic Model Roam's economic sustainability is built upon a trio of strategic flywheels: the User Flywheel, Node Flywheel, and the anticipated AI Data Flywheel. The User Flywheel aims to attract and retain users through robust Web3 incentives, enhancing the ecosystem through expansive community operations and ultimately driving down costs. This approach not only broadens the user base but also increases advertising and referral income, establishing a sustainable cycle that perpetuates growth and engagement. The Node Flywheel focuses on expanding network coverage through strategic sales and upgrades, ensuring that miner participants see returns that align with their contributions. As the node network expands, so does business client satisfaction, which feeds back into user growth and satisfaction. Looking to the future, the AI Data Flywheel aims to transform connectivity and data processing capabilities, facilitating AI-powered innovations and applications that resonate with Roam's core vision. The Future of Tokenomics: Insightful Mechanisms Roam’s tokenomics center around a deflationary model that promotes stability and growth. This model is inspired by the principles of the Impossible Trinity, carefully balancing system parameters with market needs to ensure long-term sustainability. Points within the ecosystem act as an internal currency, akin to traditional loyalty programs, ensuring market activities remain insulated from external volatility. This internal economy is bolstered by a strategically planned token release curve, resembling the well-studied Bitcoin emission pattern. These principles guide the ecosystem toward a stable equilibrium while incentivizing continuous engagement through mining and market participation. Encouraging Meaningful Participation Roam's reward mechanisms are designed to recognize the critical role participants play within the ecosystem. Whether through network expansion, community validation, or AI data contributions, users are encouraged to engage deeply, with their efforts directly contributing to the network's robustness. Special consideration is given to node owners and community validators, with a reward system that adapts as the network evolves. This ensures that contributions are always aligned with tangible outcomes, fostering an environment where innovation can flourish. Balancing Value and Scarcity The inherent value of $ROAM and Roam Points is secured through a nuanced mix of intrinsic growth and strategic deflation. With a focus on network expansion and scarcity-driven appreciation, Roam's model safeguards token value against market fluctuations. Hard deflationary measures, such as token burning, effectively limit supply while enhancing utility-driven demand. These strategic choices position Roam not only to withstand market volatility but to thrive within it. Reflecting on Challenges and Opportunities In the fluctuating world of cryptocurrency, Roam remains steadfast, continually refining its strategies to support token value, even amidst downturns. This resilience is reflected in its adaptability to market conditions, leveraging innovative mechanisms to stabilize prices and ensure long-term growth.

As it transitions from the Pilot ""Burning"" phase to the TGE, Roam's co-founder YZ delves into the project's economic system and its potential to bridge Web2 and Web3. YZ’s article offers insights into Roam’s tokenomics, highlighting its sustainability-driven flywheels and deflationary models. This offers an insightful exploration for anyone looking to understand how Roam’s design could set a precedent in the rapidly evolving DePIN space. Here is the full article for a detailed exploration. Over the last three years, @weRoamxyz has evolved from #MetaBlox into its current form. Despite facing numerous challenges, we are grateful for the unwavering support from our community and the accolades from industry peers. Many see Roam as a project combining cutting-edge technology with practical, real-world applications. At the very least, with Roam, global travelers need not worry about connectivity. We extend our heartfelt thanks to our 2 million users for their support and affection for our product. As we wrap up the pilot ""burning"" phase and are entering the airdrop and TGE official ""burning"" phase, I’d like to share insights into the design of Roam's economic system. From my perspective, this has been a pivotal focus of my work over the past three years. In the current climate, where venture-backed coins often find themselves unsupported and Meme PVP runs rampant, many industry experts are disillusioned. Together, let's explore whether Roam's economic system can serve as a valuable reference point and identify areas for improvement. Before diving into the economic system, let’s touch on our business model briefly. Roam is a global open wireless network, dedicated to building secure, seamless, and free connectivity through a Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network ( #DePIN ). Our core strategy involves operating a network using an internet hyperscaler's business model, driving growth through the Web3 flywheel, and dismantling data barriers with an open network approach as we advance into the AI era. Currently, our business model operates on a dual-engine system, with plans to evolve into a triple-engine system in the future. 1.0 Roam’s economic flywheels Roam's economic system ensures sustainable development and growth through three key flywheels: the User Flywheel, the Node Flywheel, and the future AI Data Flywheel. User Flywheel: Attract users through Web3 incentives. Initially solidify the user base by providing WiFi #OpenRoaming services via a mobile app. Further expand the user base through Web3 community driven operations. Reduce eSIM data costs and increase advertising and referral income once the critical mass is achieved, winning better commercial terms. Implement dual-track customer acquisition with WiFi #OpenRoaming and global smart eSIM, while maintaining positive cash flow. Acquire more users, adding values to the token and enhancing the Web3 incentive effect, further reducing costs. Return to step 3. Node Flywheel： Sell WiFi miners or upgrade community WiFi through Web3 incentives. Provide broader network coverage, enhancing consumer satisfaction. Help the User Flywheel increase the number of users, with more users’ check-in, miners receive more passive income. Onboard CDN and IP application clients once the number of nodes reaches the requirement. Generate cash returns for mining participants and introduce a miner lease program to expedite the growth. Improve the business client satisfaction with a fast expanding node network. Return to step 2. Future AI Data Flywheel:： Generate a large amount of DID-labeled location and time data with privacy protection through Web3 incentives. Bring more ecosystem project data via the Roam Discovery Program. Upgrade the connectivity for WiFi smart devices with DID-based OpenRoaming. Support AI agents or avatars using these devices. (Steps 3 and 4 occur in parallel with steps 1 and 2) Facilitate edge AI computing and distributed models with the Roam node network Allow AI to provide services through the Roam App and smart devices. Further generate new data and expand new nodes, returning to steps 1 and 3. Through these flywheel models, Roam is dedicated to creating a sustainable ecosystem that drives innovation and development in global wireless networks. 2.0 Roam Tokenomics Analysis 2.1 Distribution： Hard cap: 1 billion $ROAM。 120 million team tokens, vesting in 6 years. 280 million for past and future investors, including airdrop tokens. 600 million tokens will be generated via mining after TGE. 2.2 Design Principle： Inspired by the so-called Impossible Trinity principle, Roam's tokenomics design fixes only two fundamental parameters, leaving everything else to the market to ensure the system's sustainability and maintain market stability. Points： Within the Roam ecosystem, transactions are settled using points rather than directly using tokens. Points circulate only within the system, much like Tencent's Q-coins or airline miles, with a constant value and no cap. When ecosystem vendors provide services, they earn points instead of tokens to avoid the unnecessary selling pressure caused by token price increases and to maintain reasonable pricing. The fixed value of points serves as the first fundamental anchor parameter. Tokens： The token release curve is similar to Bitcoin's exponential decay. Initially, approximately 0.6% is released monthly, decreasing to 0.35% after five years, 0.2% after ten years, 0.05% after twenty years, and finally 0.001% after fifty years. The pre-fixed release curve serves as the second fundamental anchor parameter. 2.3 Key Mechanisms： Conversion Between Points and Tokens: Points are converted to tokens through a ""burning"" process, with the conversion rate determined by the market. Tokens can also be converted back into points, which involves the destruction of tokens. Cycle Mechanism： The conversion process operates based on Cycles (virtual blocks), with each Cycle lasting 1000 seconds. Difficulty Adjustment ： In homage to Bitcoin, Roam’s token generation includes a difficulty adjustment mechanism. The token release curve is adjusted according to network activity (check-in numbers) to ensure token value stability and prevent a death spiral. When network activity declines, the token release speed is reduced accordingly to maintain token value. This process helps eliminate low-value nodes and increase the yield of high-value nodes, akin to the hash rate upgrades in Bitcoin mining.。 Mining and TGE： Roam’s TGE marks the formal launch of the conversion between points and tokens. Before and after the TGE, mining participants consistently receive points not tokens as the rewards.. Through these mechanisms, Roam is committed to establishing a stable and sustainable economic ecosystem to support the long-term development of its global open wireless network. 2.4 Reward Mechanism 2.4.1 Point Generation Roam's tokenomics focus on rewarding participants who contribute to the three core flywheels: the User Flywheel, the Node Flywheel, and the AI Data Flywheel. Node Owners Node owners are a vital component of Roam's system, receiving daily point rewards. As the system evolves, these rewards will transition from equal distribution to differentiated allocation based on each node's service capabilities, such as CDN and VPN. This approach ensures that rewards are supported by real cash flow. Additionally, nodes can produce a limited number of high-tier stickers daily, which node owners can choose to distribute or keep. Community Validators Community validators, or app users, earn point rewards by verifying node operations. They connect to nodes and perform network verification, commonly known as ""check-ins."" After each check-in, both the validator and node owner receive corresponding points. The validator receives a sticker as well. This check-in process is a core activity supporting the development of Roam's three economic flywheels. Future AI Data Flywheel Looking ahead, Roam plans to introduce a similar incentive mechanism for point generation related to the AI Data Flywheel in the second half of 2025. This initiative aims to further enhance contributions to the AI Data Flywheel, fostering growth and innovation within the ecosystem. In addition to the aforementioned components, Roam encourages community users to integrate third-party WiFi networks, particularly those compatible with OpenRoaming. These users can earn point rewards akin to those for mining nodes, albeit with relatively smaller amounts. Both validators who check-in on these devices and the device registrants receive rewards. Furthermore, within Roam's ecosystem projects, such as GameFi initiatives, users have the opportunity to earn additional point rewards through participation, enhancing the system's playability. Importantly, Roam and its Discovery ecosystem projects are designed to maintain the overall stability of the system by not altering the total number of points in circulation. 2.4.2 Analysis Roam's reward system is meticulously designed to encourage genuine effort and meaningful contributions. Users can earn substantial passive incomes by adding more nodes or actively engaging in network activities. Many users have profited from ""owning"" community WiFi and assisting in its #OpenRoaming upgrades. Top participants can earn tens of thousands of points daily, which translates into significant income, allowing many to enjoy a comfortable lifestyle. The enthusiasm for network expansion within the Roam community is palpable. Some users liken Roam to #StepN , earning rewards through daily walking and WiFi check-ins. In Southeast Asia, there are users riding motorcycles with the ambition of owning the network of an entire city by validating and registering as many public WiFi networks as possible. For those unable to participate in daily activities, investing in miners offers a stable source of passive income. Whether through financial investment or active participation, these efforts contribute to the robust construction of Roam's network. This drives the development of the three flywheels and generates real-world income, standing in stark contrast to crypto projects that rely solely on on-chain TVL without delivering tangible value. 2.5 Other Assets Beyond points and tokens, Roam's economic system includes two additional significant assets: #NFTs and stickers. NFTs: In Roam, NFTs symbolize ownership of cloud mining machines. Roam prioritizes rewarding networks that genuinely provide WiFi OpenRoaming services, meaning that miners in high-traffic areas can generate higher income. However, not everyone has the opportunity to set up miners in such prime locations. To address this, Roam allows users to benefit from these ideal setups through NFT cloud mining, facilitated by Roam’s deployment team, enabling them to earn substantial income. Stickers: Stickers serve as crucial credentials for network validation within the Roam ecosystem. Network validation is a frequent user engagement activity and a core component of the ecosystem. This function not only ensures the quality of network services but also strengthens user connections and generates relevant data, making Roam a frequently used app. In Roam, stickers determine the ""burning"" capacity in the sticker pool. In the future, stickers can be combined in a game-like manner to synthesize staking accelerator cards, becoming tools in #GameFi and #SocialFi projects, and even acting as discount coupons. By integrating NFTs and stickers, Roam enhances the diversity and innovation of its economic system, offering more ways for users to participate and laying a solid foundation for the sustainable development of the entire ecosystem. 3.0 Points “Burning” Starting on January 24, 2025, Roam initiated a pilot ""burning"" process that exceeded the team's expectations and provided valuable data to refine its tokenomics. The ""burning"" process is divided into three pools: the Mining Pool, the Sticker Pool, and the Regular Pool. Tokens are generated from these pools at a ratio of 5:3:2. Mining Pool: This pool is dedicated to ""burning"" points generated by miners. For example, if a user has 1 million points, with 100,000 points from miners and the remaining 900,000 points from community WiFis and check-ins, the user would have a ""burning"" capacity of only 100,000 points in the Mining Pool. Sticker Pool: The ""burning"" mechanism in this pool requires users to use stickers to establish their ""burning"" capacity. Roam provides four types of stickers: Common (burns 50 points), Rare (burns 100 points), Epic (burns 250 points), and Legendary (burns 1,000 points). Users can use up to 50 stickers at a time, but each sticker can be used only once. Regular Pool: Any remaining points can be burned in the Regular Pool. In each cycle, the amount of tokens a point can earn from burning depends entirely on the total number of points participating in the burn during that cycle. For example, if a cycle can produce 648 tokens and 10,000 points are burned, each point would earn 0.0648 tokens. After 1,930 cycles, the burn results are as follows: In just a little over ten days, Roam has burned a quarter of the points generated over the past 19 months. The popularity of the entire burning process is evident. After the initial ramp-up, more than 10,000 people participated online at any cycle. The average conversion rate in the Mining Pool is 54.5 points per token, while the Sticker Pool averages 139.1 points per token, and the Regular Pool averages 523.3 points per token. The favorable conversion rate in the Mining Pool ensures stable returns for miners, while the higher conversion rate in the Sticker Pool rewards frequent check-ins, encouraging ongoing user participation. 4.0 The Value Support of $ROAM and ROAM Points The ultimate success of an economic system often relies on the stability and growth of its token price. So, what supports the value of $ROAM ? There are two primary factors: the intrinsic value increase due to network expansion and the appreciation of individual token value through a deflationary mechanism. These elements work together to ensure the sustained value and appeal of $ROAM in the market. 4.1 Intrinsic Value Growth： The growth of the Roam network has been thoroughly demonstrated through data provided by the Roam Explorer - Real-Time Updates on Roam Network’s Expansion , making further elaboration unnecessary here. 4.2 Token Consumption and Deflation Mechanism： 4.2.1 Hard Deflation: Token “Burning” Tokens are permanently removed from circulation through “burning”, reducing the total supply. This increases the value of each remaining token by creating scarcity. 4.2.1.1 Arbitrage-Driven Token-to-Point Conversion After the TGE, Roam will introduce a reverse conversion mechanism where users can convert tokens into points based on the weighted average value between the Sticker and Regular Pools for the targeted cycle. One token could be converted to an average of 292.78 points based on data from the past 1900 cycles. The tokens converted in this process will be burned, effectively removing them from circulation. This process presents an arbitrage opportunity for users with sufficient stickers, motivating them to convert a token into points and then earn more tokens through burning (with the current Sticker Pool rate at 139.1 points per token). The lower burn volume in the Sticker Pool, compared to the Regular Pool, is due to sticker availability being the limiting factor, as stickers are only obtainable through core activities like check-ins. While this reverse conversion process might reduce the conversion rate in the Sticker Pool, the sticker quantity remains the bottleneck, not the point quantity. Therefore, reverse conversion continues to facilitate token burning. This mechanism enhances user engagement with the app, increasing the value of data, advertising, and traffic, which in turn drives more cash income. 4.2.1.2 Utility-Drives Token-to-Point Conversion In Roam's ecosystem, points are essential for various applications, including games, social interactions, and AI services. For instance, the popular @0xBitbang game within the Indonesian community and the forthcoming @MoJoGoGo_AI Twitter Management Agents require points for participation. Users who lack sufficient points can either engage in more #OpenRoaming build-out tasks or convert their tokens to meet the demand, thereby promoting token burning. This conversion process not only supports active user engagement but also enhances the utility of points within the ecosystem. 4.2.1.3 $ROAM Buyback Currently, the Roam ecosystem has generated 3 billion points, with over 1 billion already “burned”. This includes 700 million points consumed in pilot-burning and 300 million points reclaimed and burned through Roam's network revenue. After the TGE, Roam can also opt to use some of its network profit to directly purchase tokens from the market and retire them, further reducing the circulating token supply.。 4.2.2 Soft Deflation: Token Supply and Demand Imbalance In the market, when the demand for tokens exceeds the supply, the token price typically increases. 4.2.2.1 Metcalfe's Law and the Exponential Decay Token Release Curve As a network that connects people, Roam's value aligns with Metcalfe's Law, being proportional to the square of the number of network nodes. However, Roam's token release curve mirrors Bitcoin's, adhering to an exponential decay pattern. As the network expands with more participants and nodes, the token supply grows at a slower pace than the demand. This natural imbalance leads to an increase in token value, as scarcity meets rising demand. 4.2.2.2 Increased Demand from Expanded Token Use Cases Even if the number of tokens remains unchanged, expanding their use cases can lead to deflation. For example, if 100 tokens were initially used for two scenarios, expanding to ten scenarios significantly reduces the number of tokens available for each use. If the rate of token circulation doesn’t increase, deflation occurs. Following Roam's TGE, tokens can be used in a variety of scenarios beyond the ecosystem, such as topping up credit cards for spending, exchanging them for other Discovery project tokens, and purchasing phone numbers and eSIM data. Each new use case effectively contributes to token deflation by increasing demand and thus enhancing their value. 4.2.2.3 Reducing Token Circulation Speed Reducing the circulation speed of tokens also produces a deflationary effect. By locking Roam tokens to gain benefits like free global roaming data or to participate in staking pools, the number of tokens in active circulation is effectively reduced, thus increasing their value. 4.2.3 Conclusion These mechanisms ensure that Roam maintains the relative scarcity of its tokens while boosting demand across diverse application scenarios. This strategic approach promotes the healthy development of the overall economic system and helps secure the long-term value of Roam tokens. 4.3 ROAM Points The value of ROAM Points is relatively easier to manage since they only circulate within the Roam ecosystem. The pilot ""burning"" process has demonstrated that ROAM Points have entered a slightly deflation mode already, indicating that maintaining a constant value of the ROAM Points just need a simple tweak on point emission speed. 5.0 Roam Airdrop Strategy For many projects without tangible products, on-chain interaction airdrops are often used as a technical means for exchange listings. However, these airdrops typically fail to retain users, who tend to sell off tokens quickly, thus increasing selling pressure. As a result, some projects secretly reduce the number of tokens distributed, leading to controversies over insider trading. In contrast, Roam uses airdrops as a more cost-effective customer acquisition channel compared to traditional methods like SEO and SMM. In addition, Roam does not only airdrop tokens, it airdrops global roaming data as well!. These airdrops are conducted within the app, specifically targeting valuable and new users to ensure that resources are efficiently utilized. This strategy not only improves user quality but also sustains the harmonious atmosphere within the Roam community. By employing this precisely targeted airdrop approach, Roam effectively attracts and retains genuinely valuable users, laying a strong foundation for the product's long-term development. 6.0 When Bear Market Comes In a bear market environment, token prices are typically under pressure, and market liquidity may be lacking. However, Roam's economic system has multiple strategies to address these challenges and maintain token value stability. Method 1: Difficulty Adjustment and Deflation Acceleration When participation decreases and network activity declines, Roam's difficulty adjustment mechanism activates, reducing the token generation rate. This accelerates the deflation process, providing support for token prices. Method 2: Token/Point Arbitrage to Accelerate Burning As network activity decreases, the total number of stickers drops, lowering the difficulty of arbitrage for active players. Increased arbitrage activity speeds up token burning, thereby supporting token prices. Method 3: Token Lock-up and Stable Returns Users can earn APY by staking their tokens or locking them up to receive free telco services. This reduces the circulation speed of tokens, creating a soft deflationary effect that supports token prices. Pathway 4: Bear Market Benefits for Low-Cost Services Bear markets often drive more users to seek low-cost services, potentially leading to a shift from traditional telecom operators to Roam. This transition not only boosts Roam's profits but also provides opportunities for token buybacks, burns, or treasury replenishment, further supporting token prices. Through these methods, Roam not only maintains stability during bear markets but also optimizes its economic mechanisms to ensure long-term token value growth. Roam is actively exploring additional strategies to address future challenges in token prices and liquidity. 7.0 Summary: Crypto has reached a pivotal turning point, and for teams accustomed to traditional business models, this shift might seem daunting. However, for teams experienced in the competitive landscape of the Web2 internet, this new environment presents a wealth of opportunities. It offers fertile ground for innovation and growth, perfectly aligning with the skills and experiences honed in the traditional internet industries. For these teams, the transition to the crypto space can be nothing short of a paradise, offering a chance to leverage their expertise in novel and impactful ways.

While ADA’s surge and XRP’s breakout attempts signal potential gains, FXGuys is setting itself apart with Trade2Earn rewards, staking incentives, and a Trader Funding Program. With a 1,000% token price growth projection, FXGuys is quickly becoming a top contender in the crypto trading space. Will Cardano and XRP regain momentum, or is FXGuys the real winner? Let’s explore the latest updates and why FXG is stealing the show! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Cardano Leads Market Rebound: Is ADA Among the Top 10 Altcoins to Watch? Cardano’s ADA recently experienced a 129% surge in trading volume, reaching $985.47 million within 24 hours. Subsequently, ADA’s price surged to $0.78 on February 18, 2025, marking an 18.18% gain since hitting a low of $0.66 on February 10. Despite instability in the broader market, ADA is consolidating between its 50-day and 200-day moving averages , set at $0.91 and $0.64, respectively. Analysts suggest a breakout above the $0.91 mark could trigger a rally toward the $1 mark. Cardano’s Q4 2024 report shows strong growth, with average daily transactions up 65% to 71,500 and daily active addresses increasing 58% to 42,900. Meanwhile, Cardano’s DEX volume soared to $15.94 million in early February 2025, with Minswap, WingRiders, and SundaeSwap leading. As adoption rises, ADA could be primed for further gains. Meanwhile, the FX Guys BETA trading platform has changed the narrative, as users can now see the uniqueness of this trading platform. With its ongoing presale, FXGuys is stealing the spotlight ahead of Cardano. Ripple’s XRP Aims for New Highs as Investors Hold Strong Ripple’s XRP is showing signs of strength as it attempts to break through a key price level. Long-term holders are holding onto their tokens, indicating confidence in their future growth. Currently trading at $2.59 , Ripple’s XRP is trying to secure $2.80 as a stable support level. However, If XRP holds this position, the top DeFi coin could climb higher, possibly surpassing its previous all-time high of $3.29. However, if XRP fails to reclaim $2.70 soon, experts envision a potential drop to $2.33. However, with strong investor confidence and positive market sentiment, Ripple’s XRP remains positioned for growth. While Cardano and XRP work toward recovery, FXGuys is stealing the spotlight with its presale buzz.

40684887,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=680374,1740224295,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40684887.jpeg,Billionaire investor Novogratz credits XRP army’s role in token’s longevity as SEC drops key crypto cases,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/billionaire-investor-credits-xrp-army/,"Billionaire investor Mike Novogratz believes that XRP’s continued success in the digital currency market comes down to its strong and dedicated community. Despite having been cautious a few months back, Novogratz now admits that the “XRP Army” is crucial, even to the token’s existence, and vital to the token’s overall success. Novogratz highlights XRP’s resilience and the power of community in crypto valuations Galaxy Brains podcast, hosted by Alex Thorn, featured a recent episode discussing Ethereum and its underwhelming performance versus Bitcoin since the merge. Thorn said that Ethereum had fallen 75% against Bitcoin since the merge and 50% since the Ethereum ETFs announcement in mid-2024. In response to a question about the possible reversal of the ETH-to-BTC ratio, Novogratz said it did not matter because Bitcoin has a simple and powerful narrative—that it is digital gold—and its valuation comes from collective belief rather than just technological advancements. In contrast, he said, the proposition of Ethereum as a global decentralized trust layer is more complicated because it is facing increased competition and oversupply of altcoins on the market. One of the reasons why I believe the prices of all these alts are going down is, there [are] too many of them. There is an infinite amount of token supply coming up and the timeframe for those narratives to build community is not enough. ~ Mike Novogratz Featuring older crypto players like XRP and Cardano (ADA), Novogratz added that the previous token generation was launched in a less crowded altcoin sector, which resulted in strong community-building behind these tokens. Novogratz admitted that he had previously underestimated the XRP Army. He noted that XRP has stayed relevant due to the passionate community of users who have been its supporters and advocates over the years. He compared the XRP Army to the Bitcoin community, noting that both are important in maintaining the value of their respective assets. In February 2025, Novogratz made similar comments, saying that engaging the community is important to determining the fair market values of digital assets. He also said that he was surprised by the increase in the price of XRP in November 2024 after Donald Trump’s election. Novogratz admitted that he did not foresee XRP among the best-performing tokens in late 2024; however, the level of support and engagement was the key to the coin’s performance. Ripple appeal speculation grows as SEC drops cases against Coinbase and OpenSea Just a few hours ago, the SEC’s war on crypto took another turn in favor of the US digital asset industry. The SEC agreed to dismiss its case against OpenSea and Coinbase. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that after years of litigation and at great cost to the taxpayer, the company has reached an agreement with SEC staff to have them dismiss their lawsuit against Coinbase. He pointed out that when the commission signs the decision, which is expected next week, it will mean a full dismissal of the case with no penalties paid and no alterations to Coinbase’s activities. Once the prolonged legal battle began, according to Armstrong, it caused damage to the country. OpenSea’s co-founder and CEO Devin Finzer views the SEC’s decision to close the investigation as a win for the NFT and Web3 community. Finzer believes the agency’s initial stance on NFTs misinterpreted existing laws and would hinder innovation in the space. Friday’s news fueled speculation about the SEC’s pending appeal against the programmatic sales of XRP ruling in the Ripple case. Former SEC Office of Internet Enforcement Chief John Reed Stark reacted, noting that as predicted, like the rest of the SEC’s crypto-enforcement program, the commission’s Coinbase case is dead. He added that the Ripple appeal is obviously next on the chopping block. In other developments, crypto markets have turned red after top digital assets exchange Bybit was hit by a $1.4 billion hack, plus renewed inflation concerns spooked investors. CoinGecko data shows that big digital coins such as Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP are all down, among other high-cap coins. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, is trading for $96,300, a more than 2% drop over the past day. Ethereum’s price has dropped further—by 3%—and stands at $2,669. Meanwhile, XRP, the third-biggest digital asset, has taken a 6% plunge and is now trading for $2.56.

Unveiling the Mystery Behind Bybit’s $1.4B Breach,https://coingape.com/trending/who-are-the-lazarus-group-hackers-unveiling-the-mystery-behind-bybits-1-4b-breach/,"On February 21, 2025, a $1.4 billion breach struck Bybit, a major player in the cryptocurrency exchange sector, alarming the entire industry. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT quickly identified the Lazarus hacker Group, the infamous state-sponsored hacking team from North Korea, as the culprits behind the scheme. Regarded as the biggest cryptocurrency heist in history, this breach has brought the elusive Lazarus Group back into the spotlight. So, who are these cyber criminals, and how did they capture such a huge bounty? Let’s unravel the puzzle of Bybit’s hack and peek behind the curtain at this mysterious. The Bybit ‘s Lazarus Group Hackers Incident: A Masterclass in Cybercrime The Bybit’s hack occurred with unsettling accuracy. Bybit’s Ethereum (ETH) cold wallet—allegedly an extremely secure offline storage solution—was breached during a routine transfer to a warm wallet. Hackers deceived Bybit’s team by disguising a malicious transaction as legitimate, modifying the smart contract rules to gain control. In an instant, 401,347 ETH (valued at over $1.4 billion) disappeared into a network of wallets. Ben Zhou, CEO of Bybit, quickly assured users that the exchange is solvent, with all customer funds supported 1:1, but the harm was done—both financially and to the sector’s credibility. ZachXBT, a famous blockchain investigator, solved the case thoroughly. His proof—trial transactions, wallet associations, and forensic timestamps—connected the theft to the Lazarus Group, a name associated with crypto chaos. Source: @zachxbt Arkham Intelligence, which placed a $50,000 reward for information on the attackers, validated ZachXBT’s discoveries within hours, solidifying Lazarus group as responsible in this extraordinary hack. Who Are the Lazarus Group? The Lazarus Group is not just any other average band of hackers—it’s a powerhouse backed by North Korea’s Reconnaissance General Bureau. Since emerging around 2007, they’ve sharpened their skills over nearly 20 years, mixing spying, cash grabs, and global chaos. Nicknames like APT38 and TraderTraitor only hint at their operation. Their resume reads thrillers—think the 2014 Sony Pictures takedown and the 2016 Bangladesh Bank attack, pocketing $81 million. In crypto, they’re infamous heavyweights. They’ve raked in billions, including: Ronin network heist (March 2022): Snagged $620 million from Axie Infinity’s blockchain backbone. Horizon bridge raid (June 2022): Lifted $100 million from Harmony’s cross-chain bridge. Phemex exchange breach (January 2025): Nabbed over $70 million from Singapore’s Phemex exchange, echoing their signature moves. The Bybit deal, securing 500,000 ETH, elevates them beyond Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin, making them the 14th largest Ether holder globally. These scores emphasize their smooth, constantly changing strategies and ability to target crypto’s vulnerabilities. How Lazarus Group Operate The Lazarus Group’s playbook is as sophisticated as it is ruthless. They utilize custom malware—think Manuscrypt, AppleJeus, and FALLCHILL—to infiltrate systems. Phishing is their specialty, often through fake LinkedIn profiles or spear-phishing emails that dupe employees into handing over credentials. The Bybit hack showcased their latest trick: “blind signing,” where a legit-looking user interface hides a malicious payload. They’ve also mastered social engineering—like luring victims with fake job offers, as seen in the 2023 CoinsPaid breach. Once inside, they move fast. Funds get split across dozens of wallets, laundered through DeFi platforms like Uniswap (no KYC required), and obscured with mixers. The Bybit loot, now tracked across 53 wallets, exemplifies their knack for disappearing into the blockchain’s shadows—though dumping 500,000 ETH in a bearish market could prove tricky even for them. Why It Matters The Bybit breach isn’t just a headline—it’s a wake-up call. The Lazarus Group’s relentless attacks expose gaping vulnerabilities in even the most fortified crypto platforms. For Singapore-based Bybit users (and beyond), it’s a stark reminder: not your keys, not your coins. Yet, CEO Zhou’s pledge to cover losses offers some relief, backed by the exchange’s $20 billion in assets. Still, Ethereum price was impacted , crashing 8% after the Bybit hack This isn’t random crime—it’s statecraft. The U.S. estimates North Korea’s crypto thefts bankroll 30% of its missile program, turning digital wallets into geopolitical weapons. ZachXBT’s swift unmasking, paired with efforts from firms like Elliptic and Chainalysis, shows the industry’s fighting back—but recovery remains a long shot against a nation-state foe. What’s Next? The Lazarus Group isn’t slowing down. Discussions in the crypto space assert that, they have been behind January’s $30 million Phemex hack too, hinting at a spree targeting exchanges. For Bybit, it’s about rebuilding trust with beefed-up security. For the crypto world, it’s a race to outpace hackers who evolve as fast as the tech they exploit. Self-custody, multisig wallets, and sharper vigilance are trending as users rethink centralized platforms. Conclusion The Lazarus Group’s $1.4 billion Bybit heist is more than a record-breaking theft—it’s a glimpse into a shadowy war where code meets geopolitics. Revealed through ZachXBT’s investigation, these North Korean hackers continue to be a significant threat, combining technological skill with state-backed boldness. As crypto grows, so does their shadow.

After mentioning the factors that could impact the third-largest digital asset, one of them gave a highly bullish prediction that would send its price within double-digit territory. The Factors Both AI chatbots were pretty straightforward when it came to the factors that could determine XRP’s price movements this year. They ranked the regulatory landscape in the US first, especially the highly anticipated resolution of the lawsuit between the company behind the token and the SEC. The battle, going on for over four years now, is yet to see a decisive conclusion even though Ripple has secured a few vital wins. The recent developments on the US SEC vs. crypto companies front, meaning the pause between the agency’s fight against Binance and the upcoming dismissal in the Coinbase case, brought hope to the XRP army about a similar resolution. “The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently withdrawn its lawsuit against Coinbase and is considering approving XRP-focused Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). This shift suggests a more lenient regulatory environment, which could positively impact XRP’s adoption and price.” – said ChatGPT. The second important factor listed by DeepSeek and ChatGPT is the global adoption rates. The Chinese AI bot said Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (OLD) service, which uses XRP for cross-border payments, is gaining traction as of late, and increased adoption by financial institutions and payment providers could drive higher demand for the native token. Institutional adoption could also skyrocket if the US greenlights a spot XRP ETF. Numerous companies have already submitted filings with the SEC to launch such a product, and some of them have been officially acknowledged by the agency. Lastly, DeepSeek outlined the overall market conditions. The crypto market has been shaky in the past month or so, but a bigger resurgance could restart XRP’s rally. The Price Predictions Both AI chatbots were careful when outlining precise price predictions, as they warned that such forecasts are highly speculative, especially in the ever-volatile crypto market. However, ChatGPT noted that XRP could go up to somewhere between $5 and $7 in the first half of the year, driven by “favorable regulatory changes and increased institutional interest.” DeepSeek’s conservative scenario sees XRP remaining at its current range of $2-$3. However, its more bullish forecast predicted that if Ripple wins the legal case against the SEC and the stars align on all other aforementioned factors, it could skyrocket to “$10 or more.” The post ChatGPT and DeepSeek Analyze Ripple’s (XRP) Price Potential for 2025 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-02-22 11:42:01

By 2028, FLOW could reach a maximum price of $2.37. In 2031, FLOW will range between $6 to $7.62. Flow coin, the native token of the Flow blockchain created by Dapper Labs, is essential for powering decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. Flow aims to provide a high-performance, user-friendly platform that tackles scalability without sacrificing decentralization. Its unique architecture allows developers to build secure and efficient smart contracts. FLOW, its native token, has several key uses within the ecosystem, including paying transaction fees, staking, and participating in network governance. The growing number of dApps and users on the platform drives demand for Flow coin, influencing FLOW’s price movements. Given Flow coin’s strong fundamentals and growing support levels in the ecosystem, the question arises: how high can FLOW go? What will FLOW price be in 2025? Overview Cryptocurrency Flow Token FLOW Price $0.504 Market Cap $820,210,613.48 Trading Volume $34,819,058.67 Circulating Supply 1,565,180,799.66 FLOW All-time High $46.16 Apr 05, 2021 All-time Low $0.3921 Sep 12, 2023 24-hour High $0.5556 24-hour Low $0.5099 Flow coin technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 13.46% 50-Day SMA $0.648 14-Day RSI 42.68 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 55 (Greed) Green Days 14/30 (547%) 200-Day SMA $0.657 Flow price analysis: FLOW makes a slight recovery, but resistance lies at $0.55 TL;DR Breakdown The market outlook for FLOW shows a mild recovery. However, the coin could retest $0.511 if the bears recapture the market. Flow is below the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level. Flow coin 1-day price analysis: FLOW sees slight buying pressure FLOW’s price analysis for February 22 shows that the coin has regained some momentum and is now trading above the middle Bollinger band, retesting its immediate resistance at $0.547. The next major resistance to be scaled stands at 0.236 Fibonacci level; breaking above this level would signify an increasing uptrend. FLOW’s immediate support stands at $0.511, with the stronger support zone at $0.474. FLOW sees slight buying pressure The MACD indicator shows slight buying pressure, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. A break above $0.547 could push FLOW towards $0.579 or higher. In the bearish case, FLOW might retest support at $0.511. Flow coin 4-hour price analysis: Accumulation grows, but FLOW faces resistance at $0.555 On the 4-hour price chart, FLOW’s price remains range-bound between support at $0.481 and resistance at $0.555. To confirm the uptrend observed on the larger timeframe, FLOW must break out to the upside of the consolidation zone towards $0.612. Accumulation grows, but FLOW faces resistance at $0.555 The Community Channel Index’s value (57.61) indicates that FLOW’s bullish momentum is growing but not yet overbought, giving room for more gains. The Chaikin Money Flow’s value at 0.11 indicates positive buying pressure and increasing accumulation of the coin. FLOW technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.5997 SELL SMA 5 $0.5638 SELL SMA 10 $0.5549 SELL SMA 21 $0.5347 SELL SMA 50 $0.6487 SELL SMA 100 $0.7440 SELL SMA 200 $0.6570 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.5646 SELL EMA 5 $0.6044 SELL EMA 10 $0.6595 SELL EMA 21 $0.7126 SELL EMA 50 $0.7564 SELL EMA 100 $0.7389 SELL EMA 200 $0.7236 SELL What to expect from Flow? The short-term momentum for FLOW indicates a recovery, albeit not as strong. The coin must clear resistance around $0.547 – $0.555 to confirm a sustained recovery. If this does not happen, traders should look out for further price consolidation or a retest of support at $0.511. Is FLOW a good investment? Flow coin has potential as an investment due to its strong partnerships with major brands and its focus on powering decentralized applications, especially in the NFT and gaming spaces. However, like all cryptocurrencies, it carries significant volatility and risks, so investors should carefully consider market conditions and risk tolerance before investing. Why is Flow price rising? Flow has seen some gains lately, bouncing off support at $0.5099 and recovering to the $0.52 levels, attributable to mild capital inflow to the market. Flow price chart Will FLOW recover? FLOW can potentially recover if it can break through resistance levels and maintain momentum. The market’s current consolidation phase suggests a possible breakout, which could either see selling pressure and drive prices higher or lead to further declines. Close monitoring is crucial as market dynamics remain volatile. Will FLOW reach $1? The $1 price mark is within range, having reached that level in early December 2024. Renewed buyer interest in the coming weeks will surely push FLOW to $1 and above. Will FLOW reach $5? This level has not been achieved since February 2022. For FLOW to recapture the $5 levels, significant cash inflows will be required. Can FLOW reach $50? FLOW has previously reached an all-time high (ATH) of $46.16, so reaching $50 is definitely achievable. However, a significant bull run and tangible ecosystem updates are required to achieve this feat, as the coin is currently 98% below its ATH. Is Flow a good blockchain? Flow is a solid blockchain, especially for gaming and NFTs. It is designed for scalability, fast transactions, and low fees. The network’s unique multi-role architecture improves efficiency without compromising decentralization. However, it faces fierce competition, and adoption levels are not as high as those of Ethereum and Solana. Does FLOW have a good long-term future? Projections suggest substantial growth over the coming years, with a potential peak of $7 by 2031. This positive outlook reflects a strong potential for sustained value appreciation and continued market relevance.

40685071,http://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=133121,1740224711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial Move: Russia’s Supreme Court to Recognize Cryptocurrency as Property,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/russia-supreme-court-crypto-property/,"In a potentially crucial development for the cryptocurrency landscape, Russia’s Supreme Court is making strides to officially recognize cryptocurrency as property within its legal framework. This landmark decision, as reported by Bitcoin.com News and Russia’s state news agency TASS, signals a significant shift in how digital assets may be treated in legal cases within Russia. Are you ready to understand the implications of this move? Let’s dive into what this means for the crypto world and beyond. Why is Russia considering cryptocurrency as property? The driving force behind this initiative is the escalating rise of crypto crime Russia . According to Chairperson Irina Podnosova of Russia’s Supreme Court, the increasing use of digital currencies in criminal activities, either as tools to commit crimes or as the illicit proceeds themselves, has become a major concern. At a meeting with judges and President Vladimir Putin on February 20th, Podnosova highlighted the urgent need to address this growing issue. Here’s a breakdown of the core reasons: Surge in Crypto-Related Crimes: Law enforcement agencies are grappling with the challenge of tracking and recovering assets in cases involving cryptocurrencies. Legal Gaps: The current legal framework in Russia lacks a clear definition of cryptocurrency in property law, hindering effective prosecution and asset recovery. Need for Enforcement Tools: Classifying crypto as property is seen as a necessary step to equip law enforcement with the tools to track, freeze, and seize digital assets involved in illegal activities. By officially recognizing cryptocurrency as property, the Russian legal system aims to close these gaps and provide a more robust framework for dealing with crypto crime Russia . The benefits of recognizing crypto as digital asset property Classifying cryptocurrency as digital asset property brings a host of potential benefits, not just for law enforcement, but for the broader Russian economy and its citizens. Let’s explore some key advantages: Enhanced Law Enforcement Capabilities: Tracking Illegal Funds: Treating crypto as property allows authorities to legally track the flow of illicit funds through blockchain transactions. Asset Freezing and Seizure: Legal recognition empowers courts to issue orders to freeze and seize cryptocurrency assets linked to criminal activities, similar to how they handle traditional property. Improved Prosecution Rates: Clear legal definitions simplify prosecution processes in crypto-related crime cases, potentially leading to higher conviction rates. Investor Protection and Clarity: Legal Recourse: Investors who fall victim to crypto scams or fraud gain legal recourse to recover their assets, as cryptocurrency will be recognized as something of value under the law. Reduced Uncertainty: Clear legal status reduces ambiguity surrounding cryptocurrency ownership, fostering a more predictable and secure environment for crypto users and businesses. Alignment with Global Trends: International Cooperation: Recognizing crypto as property can facilitate international cooperation in cross-border crime investigations and asset recovery, as many jurisdictions are moving towards similar classifications. Attracting Investment: A clear and regulated legal framework can make Russia a more attractive destination for legitimate crypto businesses and investors who seek legal certainty. What are the potential challenges of crypto legal status? While the move to recognize crypto legal status as property is largely seen as positive, it’s not without its challenges. Implementing this change effectively will require careful consideration and addressing potential hurdles: Defining ‘Property’ in the Digital Context: Unique Nature of Crypto: Cryptocurrency is not tangible property. Defining its legal characteristics as ‘property’ requires navigating its decentralized and digital nature. Custody and Control: Issues of custody, private keys, and control over digital assets need to be clearly addressed in the legal definition of crypto property. Technical Complexity and Enforcement: Blockchain Expertise: Law enforcement and the judiciary will need to develop expertise in blockchain technology to effectively investigate and prosecute crypto-related crimes. Cross-border Nature: Cryptocurrency transactions are often cross-border, posing challenges for enforcement and jurisdiction. International cooperation will be crucial. Potential for Overreach and Misuse: Privacy Concerns: Enhanced tracking capabilities could raise privacy concerns if not implemented with appropriate safeguards. Risk of Overregulation: The focus on crime could lead to overly restrictive regulations that stifle innovation in the legitimate crypto sector. Examples of how this might play out in Russia crypto regulation Let’s consider some hypothetical scenarios to understand the practical implications of this shift in Russia crypto regulation : Scenario Impact of Crypto as Property Crypto Scam Case: A Russian citizen is defrauded in a crypto investment scam. With crypto recognized as property, the victim can file a legal claim to recover their digital assets. Courts can issue orders to freeze and potentially seize the scammer’s crypto wallets. Tax Evasion: An individual uses cryptocurrency to hide income and evade taxes. Tax authorities can now legally investigate and seize cryptocurrency holdings as undeclared assets, treating them as taxable property. Criminal Proceeds: A criminal gang uses cryptocurrency for money laundering. Law enforcement can track the flow of funds on the blockchain, identify wallets associated with the gang, and obtain court orders to freeze and seize these crypto assets as proceeds of crime. Bankruptcy Proceedings: A company holding significant cryptocurrency assets declares bankruptcy. Cryptocurrency holdings can be included in the company’s asset pool and distributed to creditors as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, similar to other forms of property. Actionable Insights: What does this mean for you? This development in cryptocurrency Russia has implications for various stakeholders: For Crypto Users in Russia: Increased Security: Potentially greater protection against scams and fraud, with legal avenues for asset recovery. Greater Clarity: More defined legal framework around cryptocurrency ownership and transactions. Potential Tax Implications: May lead to clearer tax regulations on cryptocurrency holdings and transactions. For Crypto Businesses in Russia: Opportunity for Legitimacy: Formal recognition can enhance the legitimacy of the crypto industry in Russia. Need for Compliance: Businesses will need to adapt to new regulations and compliance requirements related to crypto property. Investment Climate: Could improve the investment climate for crypto businesses seeking legal certainty. For the Global Crypto Community: Precedent Setting: Russia’s move could influence other jurisdictions considering similar legal classifications of cryptocurrency. Global Regulatory Landscape: Contributes to the evolving global regulatory landscape for digital assets. Conclusion: A significant step towards mainstream crypto adoption in Russia? Russia’s Supreme Court’s push to classify cryptocurrency as property is undoubtedly a significant step towards bringing digital assets further into the mainstream legal and financial system. While challenges remain in implementation and ensuring a balanced approach, this move reflects a growing global recognition of cryptocurrency’s importance and the need for clear legal frameworks to govern its use. As Russia refines its approach to cryptocurrency Russia , the world will be watching closely to see how this landmark decision shapes the future of crypto regulation and adoption.

Notably, the recent settlement of the Coinbase case has fueled community optimism about a potential dismissal of the XRP lawsuit. According to legal expert Jeremy Hogan, a settlement in the Ripple vs. SEC case is possible as early as Q2 2025. Will XRP Lawsuit be Settled by May 2025? As the community awaits an imminent resolution in the XRP lawsuit, advocate Jeremy Hogan shared his insights. In an X post , Hogan stated that the Ripple vs. SEC case could witness a settlement by the first half of April or early May. However, he clarified that the prediction is merely his intuition and not based on any concrete evidence. Hogan’s comments came in response to Good Morning Crypto host Johnny Krypto’s post. Addressing Hogan, Johnny Krypto shared a thread, seeking the lawyer’s opinion on the impending conclusion of the XRP lawsuit. The message read, “Do you think the XRP case can get dropped sooner than you originally thought or does May still feel right to you gut?? Coinbase Case Closure and XRP Lawsuit Settlement In a surprising development, the US SEC agreed to drop the prolonged Coinbase lawsuit, marking a significant milestone in the crypto space. The move also highlights the SEC’s regulatory changes that visions the establishment of the US crypto environment. Celebrating the significant development, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong posted on X that the platform reached an agreement with the SEC after “years of litigation, millions of your taxpayer dollars spent, and irreparable harm done to the country.” Meanwhile, Jeremy Hogan sees the Coinbase suit dismissal with prejudice as a strong win, as it permanently closes the case. He means that there is no room for the SEC to refile the case. Notably, as per Hogan’s words, the SEC’s bold move suggests they’re not waiting for Commissioner Atkins’ confirmation to take decisive action on crypto regulation. This implies the SEC might make more crypto-friendly moves even before Atkins takes office, potentially indicating an imminent XRP lawsuit settlement. SEC’s XRP ETF Acknowledgements Spark Enthusiasm Over the last few days, the SEC has taken significant steps towards potentially approving XRP ETFs. Particularly, the SEC acknowledged XRP ETF applications submitted by multiple asset managers including Grayscale, 21Shares, CoinShares, Bitwise, and Canary Capital. This optimistic move, coupled with the SEC’s decision to drop the Coinbase case, has sparked speculations of an early XRP lawsuit settlement. Previously, Jeremy Hogan posited that the XRP lawsuit conclusion could be possible before the SEC’s approval of an XRP ETF. Although the SEC’s ETF nod doesn’t assure approval, it has fueled community optimism about a potential ETF launch and lawsuit dismissal. As per wider speculations, with the SEC recognizing XRP ETF applications, a lawsuit dismissal is now within reach.

As meme coins continue to dominate the digital asset space, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is proving to be an undeniable force, securing its place as the fastest-selling meme coin on the market. With early investors capitalizing on its robust ecosystem and deflationary tokenomics, the momentum is building fast, and the subsequent price increase is just around the corner. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Where Meme Culture Meets The Future Of AI FloppyPepe (FPPE) isn’t just another meme coin riding a wave of speculation. It carries the cultural legacy of Matt Furie, whose influence on meme culture has shaped the viral nature of online communities. Just as Furie’s work ignited a global meme wave, FloppyPepe (FPPE) influenced that same cultural momentum to capture the attention of modern crypto investors. This established cultural presence gives the project a natural advantage in driving widespread adoption and viral appeal, solidifying its place in the evolving crypto landscape. This deep-rooted meme heritage, combined with advanced AI technology, makes FloppyPepe (FPPE) a unique player in the meme coin space. Meme coins thrive on virality and cultural impact, and few can claim a direct link to one of the most recognized internet memes of all time. This strong cultural foundation positions FloppyPepe (FPPE) ahead of the competition, offering investors a rare opportunity to engage with a meme coin that blends historical significance with the rapidly growing AI sector. AI-Powered Advancements Reshaping The Meme Coin Market The rapid sellout of the private sale is no coincidence. FloppyPepe (FPPE) brings AI functionality into digital assets. Through FloppyX, an AI video agent , and its text-to-image AI agent , Meme-o-Matic , this project empowers users to generate viral content quickly. This integration of AI with meme coin utility is a breakthrough in the space, making FloppyPepe (FPPE) an entirely new category of crypto investment, offering a unique value proposition to investors. Beyond its AI ecosystem, FloppyPepe (FPPE) employs a deflationary burn mechanism . This means that 1% of every transaction is permanently removed from circulation. The result? The token’s supply tightens as demand rises, potentially driving long-term price appreciation. With FloppyPepe (FPPE) currently priced at $0.0000002 , investors see an opportunity to lock in early gains before the presale advances to its next phase. Momentum for FloppyPepe (FPPE) isn’t slowing down, as the meme coin continues to dominate the AI agent cryptocurrency sector, gaining traction with increasing adoption and market growth. Analysts predict that AI meme coins like FloppyPepe (FPPE) could be at the forefront of this expansion, mirroring the explosive growth of similar AI-driven projects. Analysts and investors recognize this project’s potential as it bridges AI, meme culture, and financial incentives into one faultless ecosystem. Its commitment to security has further strengthened investor confidence. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has successfully passed a smart contract audit by SolidProof , validating transparency and protection for its holders. In a market saturated with unverified projects, this verification is a significant trust signal that sets the meme coin apart. Act Now Before FloppyPepe (FPPE) Surges Further The overwhelming response to FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) private sale proves that investors are eager, recognizing that its structured scarcity through the burn mechanism could drive exponential price growth as demand outpaces supply. With the beta launch scheduled to go live in just two weeks via the Telegram community account, speculation is growing that demand for FloppyPepe (FPPE) could skyrocket even further. Those securing positions now are investing in an ecosystem that uses AI to create real-world utility. With its presale gaining traction, its security verified, and its AI technologies set to roll out, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is nearing the next stage of its presale. This will further cement its position as a leader in AI meme coins, where prices are expected to increase. However, the supply for early buyers is rapidly depleting, making this a critical moment for those looking to enter before the next price jump.

The U.S. spot Ethereum ETF outflows landscape just took an unexpected turn. Recent data reveals a significant shift in investor sentiment as these highly anticipated investment vehicles experienced a combined net outflow of $8.9 million on February 21st. This marks the second consecutive day of net outflows, signaling a potential cooling trend after initial enthusiasm. Let’s dive deep into what’s happening and what it could mean for the future of Ethereum and the broader crypto market. What’s Behind the Sudden Ethereum ETF Outflows? According to Farside Investors, a platform specializing in financial information, the total net outflow from U.S. spot ETH ETFs reached $8.9 million on February 21st. Interestingly, the data highlights a nuanced situation: while there was a net outflow, only one ETF, Bitwise’s ETHW, reported a net outflow of precisely $8.9 million. This suggests that all other spot Ethereum ETFs either saw no change in holdings or experienced inflows that were exactly offset by Bitwise’s outflow. This raises a crucial question: Is this an isolated incident concentrated within a specific fund, or does it represent a broader market trend for Spot Ethereum ETFs ? To understand the significance, let’s break down the key players and the numbers: Total Net Outflow (Feb 21): $8.9 million Source: Farside Investors Primary Contributor to Outflow: Bitwise ETHW Performance of Other Spot ETH ETFs: No change in holdings reported Consecutive Days of Net Outflows: Two This data paints a picture that is both concerning and intriguing. While the overall number is relatively small in the grand scheme of ETF assets, the fact that it’s a net outflow, and the second consecutive day, warrants closer examination. Especially noteworthy is the concentration of the outflow in Bitwise’s ETHW. Is there something specific to this fund driving investors away, or is it a bellwether for the entire crypto ETF market segment? Spot Ethereum ETFs: A Quick Refresher For those new to the scene, Spot Ethereum ETFs are exchange-traded funds that directly hold Ethereum. This is in contrast to futures-based ETFs, which invest in Ethereum futures contracts. The approval of spot crypto ETFs, particularly Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year, was seen as a monumental step for the crypto industry, potentially opening the floodgates for institutional and retail investment. The anticipation surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs was similarly high, with many expecting them to provide easier and regulated access to ETH for a wider investor base. The benefits of spot Ethereum ETFs are numerous: Simplified Investment: Investors can gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding and managing the digital asset, simplifying the investment process. Regulatory Compliance: ETFs operate within a regulated framework, offering a level of security and compliance that may appeal to institutional investors and risk-averse individuals. Accessibility: ETFs are easily traded on traditional stock exchanges, making Ethereum investment accessible through brokerage accounts that many investors already use. Potential for Increased Liquidity: ETFs can enhance liquidity in the Ethereum market by creating new avenues for trading and investment. Decoding the February 21st Outflows: What Could Be Happening? Several factors could be contributing to these initial Ethereum ETF outflows . It’s crucial to remember that the ETF market is dynamic and influenced by a multitude of variables. Here are a few potential explanations: Profit Taking: After the initial launch and hype surrounding spot Ethereum ETFs, some investors might be taking profits, leading to outflows. This is a common phenomenon in newly launched investment products. Market Correction: The broader cryptocurrency market can be volatile. If investors anticipate a market correction or downturn in Ethereum prices, they might reduce their exposure through ETFs. Fund-Specific Issues (Bitwise ETHW): As Bitwise ETHW is the sole contributor to the reported outflow, there could be specific factors related to this particular fund, such as investor concerns about management fees, fund performance relative to peers, or broader sentiment towards Bitwise as an issuer. Rotation into Other Assets: Investors might be reallocating capital from Ethereum ETFs into other asset classes, including other cryptocurrencies, stocks, or bonds, based on shifting market perspectives and risk appetite. Temporary Market Noise: It’s also possible that these outflows are simply short-term market fluctuations or noise, and not indicative of a longer-term trend. Two days of outflows is a relatively short period in the context of ETF performance. Bitwise ETHW Under the Microscope: Why the Focus? The fact that Bitwise ETHW is singled out as the source of the entire $8.9 million crypto ETF outflow is significant. While further investigation is needed to pinpoint the exact reasons, here are some potential considerations: Fund Performance: How has Bitwise ETHW performed compared to other spot Ethereum ETFs? If it has underperformed, investors might be moving their assets to better-performing funds. Fees and Expenses: Are Bitwise ETHW’s fees and expenses competitive with other offerings? Higher fees could deter investors, especially in a competitive market. Investor Sentiment Towards Bitwise: Is there any specific negative sentiment or news surrounding Bitwise as an asset manager that could be impacting investor confidence in their ETHW ETF? Marketing and Distribution: How effectively is Bitwise marketing and distributing its ETHW ETF compared to its competitors? Lower visibility or less effective distribution could result in slower asset accumulation and potentially outflows. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Ethereum ETF Landscape For investors in ETH ETFs or those considering investing, these initial outflow figures provide valuable insights: Monitor ETF Flows Closely: Pay attention to daily and weekly ETF flow data from reputable sources like Farside Investors. Consistent outflows could signal a concerning trend, while inflows indicate renewed investor interest. Diversify ETF Holdings: Consider diversifying your ETF holdings across different issuers to mitigate fund-specific risks. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Research Fund Performance and Fees: Thoroughly research the performance, fees, and expense ratios of different spot Ethereum ETFs before investing. Choose funds that align with your investment goals and risk tolerance. Stay Informed About Market Conditions: Keep abreast of broader cryptocurrency market trends, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors that could influence Ethereum prices and ETF performance. Consider Long-Term Perspective: Remember that ETF investments are typically long-term strategies. Short-term fluctuations and outflows are normal market behavior and should be viewed in the context of your overall investment horizon. Conclusion: A Fleeting Dip or a Foreshadowing Trend in Ethereum ETFs? The $8.9 million net outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on February 21st is a noteworthy event, particularly as it marks the second consecutive day of outflows. While the concentration of the outflow in Bitwise ETHW suggests fund-specific factors might be at play, it’s crucial to monitor these trends closely. Whether this is a temporary dip or the start of a more sustained outflow trend remains to be seen. For investors, staying informed, diversifying, and maintaining a long-term perspective are key to navigating the evolving landscape of spot Ethereum ETFs and the broader cryptocurrency market. The initial euphoria surrounding these ETFs is now being tested by market realities, and the coming weeks will be crucial in determining the long-term trajectory of these innovative investment products.

Table of Contents Solana price set to decline to $125 with this support retest Exploring Ripple’s $100 dreams A massive rally is imminent for Remittix The Solana price projections for 2025 have been a hot topic. While others expect further problems for the Solana price, experts have rebuilt optimism in the rising path of the XRP. Some big investors now turn to Remittix while Ripple is running a high $100 target for XRP. Remittix’s creative crypto-to-fiat conversion mechanism will fundamentally redefine current cross-border transactions as we know them. Read on to get more information on the token. You might also like: Remittix extends gains as PEPE experiences a 20% decline this week Solana price set to decline to $125 with this support retest In a TradingView post, MadWhale predicted that the Solana price was at risk of dropping to as low as $125 with the retest of the $164 price level, which is a key support level on the horizon. The expert pointed out that this is a key support level that has lately shown robust. He cautioned, however, this time around, that may not be the case. MadWhale said there are signs the Solana price would soon surpass this daily support, which would cause a drop of around 25%. Should this price collapse, the analyst said that the target Solana price to keep an eye on would be $125, which corresponds with a major monthly support zone. He also said that this region is a vital aspect in the present market analysis because it has always been a major support against further downturns. The following chart of the analyst revealed a break below the $125 support line, which would drive the Solana price as low as $80. PizzaDriver, a crypto expert, has recently cautioned that Solana price may see a 2022-like meltdown, with the currency falling to double digits. Having dropped over 11% throughout the last seven days, the Solana price has already seen a considerable fall. According to on-chain monitoring firm Santiment, Solana’s market mood has dropped to its lowest since the January 20th major retrace. Exploring Ripple’s $100 dreams Analysts observe Ripple striving to drive XRP well above historical highs. With more legal certainty, Ripple might grow internationally via bank alliances. Though there is much hope, reaching $100 would need consistent announcements and significant acceptance. Critics point out that brand buzz is useless if real use falls short. Though a crypto analyst’s altcoin comparison points to competition from new coins with everyday use cases, many remain positive on Ripple. XRP runs the danger of losing ground to currencies tackling direct money problems if it fails to acquire fresh utility or clear regulatory successes. Remittix then comes in to eclipse initiatives depending on transactions that can take longer to develop. A massive rally is imminent for Remittix Providing fast and reasonably priced cross-border solutions, Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by aggregating FIAT transactions with blockchain technologies. Supported by more than forty cryptocurrencies the site provides rapid translations into FIAT currencies like USD and GBP, therefore enabling simple bank account deposits. Remittix is a better alternative to conventional payment providers like Stripe and Wise. The platform guarantees accessibility and inclusivity for companies and people by supporting over 50 crypto pairs and 30+ FIAT currencies. Notable also is the platform’s open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over absurd rates of exchange of conventional banks. In the payments industry, Remittix is game-changing since this approach guarantees that the whole amount transferred reaches the recipient, therefore addressing unethical activity all too often. At $0.0628 in the presale stage, the RTX coin offers a good investment potential. Forecasts reveal an interesting rise; demand for innovative cross-border payment solutions is generating a 25x multiplier in the presale phase and over 1,500% increases following launch.

Russia and US Set for Crucial Ukraine Conflict Talks,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/russia-us-ukraine-conflict-talks/,"In a dramatic turn of events that has sent ripples of cautious optimism through the global community, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergey Ryabkov, has announced that high-stakes discussions between Russian and U.S. delegations are on the horizon. The subject? Nothing less than finding a path to end the protracted and devastating Ukraine conflict . This news, first reported by News1, comes as a potential beacon of hope amidst escalating tensions and prolonged suffering. Why are these Ukraine Conflict Talks so Crucial? For months, the world has watched with bated breath as the Ukraine conflict unfolded, leading to immense human tragedy and geopolitical instability. The prospect of direct talks between Russia and the United States, two major global powers with significant influence in this crisis, offers a glimmer of hope for de-escalation and a peaceful resolution. But what makes these upcoming Ukraine conflict talks so critical? De-escalation Potential: Direct dialogue is often the first step towards de-escalating tensions. By engaging in face-to-face discussions, both sides can directly address grievances, clarify positions, and explore common ground, potentially reducing the risk of further escalation. Humanitarian Crisis: The Ukraine conflict has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis. Negotiations could pave the way for humanitarian corridors, aid delivery, and ultimately, a cessation of hostilities that would alleviate immense suffering. Global Stability: The conflict’s ramifications extend far beyond Ukraine’s borders, impacting global energy markets, food security, and international relations. Successful ceasefire negotiations could contribute significantly to restoring geopolitical stability . Diplomacy as an Alternative: Talks emphasize diplomacy over military solutions. In a world increasingly weary of conflict, these discussions signal a preference for dialogue and negotiation, offering a pathway towards peace. Russia US Relations: A Rocky Road to the Negotiation Table The relationship between Russia and the United States has been complex and often strained for years. Navigating these intricate Russia US relations to even reach the point of agreeing to talks is a significant achievement in itself. Deputy Minister Ryabkov’s confirmation to RIA Novosti underscores a crucial development: both nations have, in principle, agreed to engage in “systematic and detailed developments.” This suggests a commitment to more than just a symbolic meeting; it hints at a willingness to delve into substantive issues and work towards tangible outcomes. However, the path ahead is undoubtedly fraught with challenges. Deep-seated mistrust, conflicting narratives about the conflict’s origins and objectives, and divergent geopolitical interests all present formidable obstacles. The success of these Ukraine conflict talks hinges on the ability of both sides to overcome these hurdles and find common ground. Diplomacy Ukraine: What are the Potential Outcomes? While optimism is warranted, realism must temper expectations. Diplomacy Ukraine is a delicate and intricate process. What could realistically emerge from these discussions in the coming weeks? Potential Positive Outcomes Potential Challenges Agreement on localized ceasefires to allow humanitarian aid. Establishment of communication channels for de-escalation. Commitment to further rounds of negotiations. Exploration of confidence-building measures. Potential framework for a longer-term peace process. Deeply entrenched positions on core issues. Risk of talks breaking down without progress. Influence of hardliners on both sides. External factors and third-party interference. Difficulty in verifying commitments and ensuring compliance. Ceasefire Negotiations: A Realistic Near-Term Goal? Given the complexities and high stakes, achieving an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire might be an ambitious initial goal. However, focusing on incremental progress, such as localized ceasefires or humanitarian pauses, could be a more realistic starting point for these ceasefire negotiations . These initial steps could build trust and momentum, paving the way for more comprehensive agreements in the future. The announcement of these talks alone is a significant diplomatic step. It signals a recognition from both Russia and the United States that dialogue is essential, even amidst profound disagreements. The world watches with anticipation, hoping that these Ukraine conflict talks will mark the beginning of a genuine effort to end the conflict and restore geopolitical stability to the region and beyond. Actionable Insights: Staying Informed and Understanding the Nuances For those following the cryptocurrency and financial markets, the Ukraine conflict and its potential resolution are of paramount importance. Geopolitical events significantly impact market sentiment and investment strategies. Here’s how you can stay informed and understand the nuances: Follow Reputable News Sources: Rely on established and unbiased news agencies for updates on the talks. Analyze Expert Commentary: Seek insights from geopolitical analysts and experts on Russia US relations and Diplomacy Ukraine . Monitor Market Reactions: Pay attention to how financial markets, including cryptocurrency markets, react to news and developments related to the talks. Understand Geopolitical Risks: Recognize how geopolitical stability (or instability) can influence investment decisions and market volatility. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Peace? The upcoming Ukraine conflict talks between Russia and the United States represent a crucial juncture. While the road to peace is undoubtedly long and arduous, the willingness to engage in dialogue is a vital first step. Whether these talks will lead to a breakthrough remains to be seen, but the mere fact that they are scheduled offers a flicker of hope in a world desperately seeking an end to conflict and a return to stability.

A report from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant has revealed that the Bitcoin Network Activity Index, which measures the growth across major metrics like active addresses, number of transactions, and block size, is down 17% from its November 2024 record high. Bitcoin Network Activity in Negative Trend The network activity index is currently at 3,658, the lowest level since February 2024. It has also fallen below its 365-day moving average, an occurrence not seen since July 2021, after China placed a ban on Bitcoin mining. This indicator signals that activity on the world’s largest blockchain network has entered into a negative trend. Bitcoin’s apparent demand growth has been on a decline since November-December, when it experienced a period of acceleration. Following the conclusion of the U.S. presidential elections, Bitcoin demand surged to 279,000; however, the metric hovers around 70,000 today. Factors affecting demand growth include economic uncertainty regarding the imposition of trade tariffs in the U.S., inflation fears , and potential selling pressure from bankrupt crypto exchange FTX repayments. Bitcoin Demand Remains Weak The weak demand for BTC is also seen in purchases from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) market. Bitcoin ETF daily purchases have plummeted from over 18,000 BTC in early November to less than 1,000 BTC currently. CryptoQuant noted that BTC rallies have historically coincided with rising ETF purchases; however, current purchase levels do not support such price surges. Moreover, CryptoQuant’s Inter-exchange Flow Pulse shows that Bitcoin spot demand has slowed in the U.S. The volume of BTC flowing from other exchanges to Coinbase has declined and fallen below its 90-day moving average, indicating relatively lower demand and a period of price correction. What’s Next for BTC? Furthermore, stablecoin liquidity expansion has slowed down. The total market cap of stablecoins has hit new highs above $200 billion; however, their liquidity is expanding at a slower pace. Tether (USDT), for example, has seen a 92% decline from the December 16 60-day change of $20.4 billion in market cap – the figure now sits at $1.5 billion. CryptoQuant says BTC needs a new wave of stablecoin liquidity expansion to rally again. The cryptocurrency could fall towards $86,000, the Trader’s On-chain Realized Price minimum band, if demand growth and liquidity conditions do not improve soon enough.

The confirmation of Kash Patel comes with significant controversy, not just for his past criticisms of the agency but also for his personal investments in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related stocks. FBI Director And His Love For Crypto Based on financial disclosures, Patel owns around $115,000 worth of Bitcoin via a US spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). He has also made roughly $250,000 investments in Core Scientific, a major crypto mining company. This makes Patel one of the most openly pro-crypto officials to hold such a high-ranking law enforcement position. His financial portfolio elicits different opinions. Critics express concerns regarding potential conflicts of interest, whilst cryptocurrency enthusiasts view his appointment as indicative of a more favorable legal landscape for digital assets. Considering the director’s vested interest in the market, how will the FBI approach investigations pertaining to cryptocurrency? Trump loyalist Kash Patel is confirmed as FBI director by Senate despite deep Democratic doubts Read more https://t.co/svv7TpCegb #DonaldTrump #KashPatel #FBI #USA — Moneycontrol (@moneycontrolcom) February 21, 2025 A Narrow Senate Confirmation Patel’s appointment hasn’t been an easy ride. The Senate vote exhibited significant political tensions, resulting in a narrow 51-49 vote. Critics have voiced concerns regarding Patel’s close association with Trump and his history of challenging the FBI’s leadership. His confirmation signals a shift in direction for the agency, one that could bring heightened scrutiny to its past actions under previous administrations. Democrats expressed worries that Patel may target Trump’s opponents and defend his supporters using his position. Republicans countered that the FBI needed a capable leader to restructure a politically weaponized organization. Now under Patel’s direction, the issue of whether his leadership will increase the FBI’s legitimacy or deepen its political entanglements still persists. On Crypto Regulation The US bitcoin industry has lately been under increasing regulatory pressure while the SEC and FBI lead major roles in enforcement actions. Patel’s pro-bitcoin stance might affect how these questions are handled. Could this signal the beginning of a legislative approach more lenient to digital assets? Investors are keeping close attention. A prominent law enforcement agent with personal cryptocurrency interests could influence legislation. But Patel’s ability for objectivity will most likely determine how his tenure influences the industry. The Road Ahead For The FBI Apart from cryptocurrency, Patel’s appointment reflects a more significant shift in the power distribution system of the United States. His guidance could shift the FBI’s focus, particularly with relation to well-publicized political issues. It’s still not clear whether that means looking into old cases again or starting new ones.

However, despite its impressive gains, Dogwifhat has dipped out of the top 100 largest cryptos, with the tides turning in November 2024, with a massive dip spillover into 2025. The Bonk price has also plummeted by over 47% in the past month. However, despite the steep decline, Ali Martinez believes a strong support hold above $0.0000091 could lead to a bullish outlook. Moreover, the meme coin market is full of swing, and investors are always on the lookout not to miss the next big opportunity. As popular giants like Dogwifhat and Bonk showcase signs of bouncing off from key support levels, many new gems are also sneaking up in the market, and ChowWow is one of them. Its presale presents the perfect opportunity to buy into the token’s low entry price of just $0.008. Dogwifhat Price Correction Nearing End After 87% Price Dip The price of Dogwifhat dipped by 87% from its ATH to hit a low of $0.55 on February 3, 2025. While no clear bullish trend reversal signals have emerged, the price of Dogwifhat continues to trade along an important support level. This suggests that a recovery could be on the horizon. The weekly time frame chart for the WIF token suggests that the meme coin price has fallen inside a long-term descending parallel channel since April 2024. Dogwifhat price chart | Source: TradingView The Channel contains both the ATH and slightly lower highs of March and November 2024. During the dip, Dogwifhat price dipped below the channel’s midline, breaking down below the $1.40 horizontal support region. This is the final horizontal zone before the all-time low. Since February, the Dogwifhat price has traded close to the channel’s support trend line. WIF hasn’t shown any bullish trend reversal signs despite this being a likely level for a bounce. Technical indicators are also bearish, with the RSI and MACD falling below the bullish threshold. Bonk Price to Test Major Support: Could a Reversal Be In Sight? Bonk’s price movement managed to hold a key support level around the $0.0000091 support level last tested in February 2024. Bonk, which trades above the $0.0000149 level, is also hovering near the lower band of the Bollinger Bands, signaling an oversold scenario. Bonk price analysis | Source: CoinMarketCap If the meme coin rebounds off this lower boundary, it might initiate a short-term surge. However, failure to reclaim the mid-band, which is at $0.0000181, could keep the selling pressure intact. Meanwhile, the RSI is at 37, which is also close to oversold territory. Historically, this has always led to a price rebound in the short term. Notably, Bonk price has been sitting near key retracement levels, with the 1.618 Fib extension around $0.0000107 acting as a significant support zone. If the price of Bonk loses this level, it might result in a deeper correction, potentially testing sub-$0.0000700 levels. However, if the bulls step in at the current levels and push the meme coin price above $0.0000180, the token might rally toward $0.0000230 and beyond. ChowWow ($CHOW): A Utility Meme Coin with Clear Vision for The Future ChowWow ($CHOW) is a utility meme coin built with its community in mind while committed to providing practical use cases. It transcends its meme status by integrating features like Web3 gaming infrastructure, staking, and airdrops to expand its community while encouraging loyalty. Moreover, ChowWow has been developed on the SOL blockchain’s lightning-fast speeds and cheaper transaction fees, making it better than Ethereum-based meme coins. ChowWow, which currently sells at just $0.008 at stage one of its presale, has already recorded significant attention, with over $150K already raised. As a deflationary token, the ChowWow project plans on burning and buying back the $CHOW tokens with the aim of reducing its supply over time and supporting a price rally. A move that has led to crypto enthusiasts scooping up the tokens before the price rallies. Among the stand-out features of the ChowWow project is its play-to-earn reward scheme, which distinguishes the project from the rest of the conventional meme coins based on internet hype. For its gaming kingdom, $CHOW will act as the main token players can use, as the project follows a sustainable method of keeping the token in high demand. Can ChowWow Outshine Dogwifhat And Bonk In 2025? Dogwifhat price movement could be nearing the end of a bearish outlook. However, the WIF token has yet to record any significant gains. The Bonk price has showcased a bullish sign provided it remains above the $0.0000091 level as ChowWow opens up a new door for big ROI with actual utility. The project’s tokenomics will allocate 70% of its supply to presale tokens, gaming rewards, and staking. This makes now the right time for investors to capitalize on the ChowWow at a discount before its price surges.

Chainflip Says Funds Cannot Be Freezed While Chainflip has taken steps to mitigate the situation, it noted that its decentralized structure prevents it from completely blocking, freezing or redirecting any funds. “We have tried our best to deal with the current situation, but as a decentralized protocol, we cannot completely block, freeze or redirect any funds. However, we have currently shut down some front-end services to prevent the flow of funds,” he said. Earlier, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou warned the community via social media that hackers were attempting to transfer stolen assets to the Bitcoin network via Chainflip. Zhou called on the cross-chain bridge project to help prevent further asset transfers and prevent funds from being moved to other chains.

According to the DOJ, the citizen of Brazil appeared at the United States District Court in Seattle, where he is facing a 13-count indictment for wire fraud and conspiracy related to his Bitcoin investment scheme. Authorities claim the defendant, 48-year-old Dover Braga, lived in Florida between 2016 and 2021 when he carried out most of his fraudulent activities. In the DOJ indictment , Braga was accused of running a Bitcoin investment scheme that acted as a front for a Ponzi scheme alongside an illegal multilevel marketing scheme. The grand jury returned the indictment in October 2022, and it was unsealed after authorities apprehended the suspect in Switzerland. Braga pleaded ‘Not Guilty’ to the charges and the trial, which will be presided by US District Judge Tana Lin, was scheduled for April 28, 2025. DOJ extradites suspect to the US over $290M scam According to the DOJ indictment, Braga and his accomplices conspired to create a crypto trading and investment platform called Trade Coin Club (TCC), with a physical office in Belize. In 2016, Braga, alongside his co-conspirators, started promoting TCC, promising investors that they could make money from investing in Bitcoin on the platform. Braga told investors that the platform had sophisticated software that would enable investors to make profits from the fluctuating price of the leading digital assets. He also promised investors certain rewards and percentages for inviting new users to the platform. In reality, the platform had no sophisticated software and the platform did not exist. Investors who were early to the platform were paid off by funds from new investors, taking the shape of a Ponzi scheme. The DOJ indictment also mentioned that Braga traveled globally to promote the fake platform, going to Thailand in March 2017, before going to Nigeria and Macau in May 2017. The platform was promoted on social media and at events, where Braga claimed at some of the events that the platform had about 126,000 members across 231 countries. The DOJ mentioned that through his fake promises, he induced thousands of people to entrust him with about 82,000 BTC worth $290 million at the time, with most of them depositing it on TCC. He also layered his criminal activity, creating a website for users to track their investments. However, it turned out that the website was fictitious and no trading activity was happening. According to the authorities, Braga started to misappropriate investor funds, with records showing that he took out at least $50 million in BTC between December 2016 and July 2019. However, trouble started when investors started to request their funds in 2017 and early 2018. In January 2018, TCC informed investors that it was ceasing operations in the United States, noting that it would cancel their accounts. Investigations uncover Braga’s tax crimes According to authorities, Braga profited greatly from his crimes while failing to report his earnings to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Authorities said that in 2017, he received Bitcoin worth $30.5 million, but only reported $152,298 income for the year. The following year, he received $13 million in BTC but told the IRS he made $73,473 for the year. In 2019, he received $10 million worth of Bitcoin but reported $72,473. According to the Special Agent in charge of the FBI Seattle field office, the crime that Braga was charged with is now new, he just used a new technology as a cover to defraud investors. “While the victims in this case waited and wondered about the fate of their investments, he siphoned off millions of dollars for his personal use. This case demonstrates the determination of the FBI and our partners in IRS Criminal Investigation to hold fraudsters accountable, no matter where in the world they may be,” he said. The US Attorney Teal Luthy Miller also commended the FBI, IRS, and other federal partners for helping them solve the case. “The victim investors have waited years to see justice. I commend our federal partners at the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation for their diligent work on this case,” the US Attorney said. Braga is presently facing 12 counts of wire fraud, representing 12 wire transfers made by 12 investors to TCC to deposit in their accounts on the platform. He is also facing a count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. If found guilty, Braga could spend up to 20 years in prison for each of the charges.

During this time, PlutoChain could draw attention as a hybrid Layer-2 project that has the potential to bring new features to BTC’s network and upgrade its use cases. Let’s check out the details below. XRP Price Prediction: Analysts Point Out a Bullish Pattern on XRP’s Chart – Can This Lead to $10? An expert analyst has spotted a potential “cup and handle” pattern forming in XRP’s price action, a classic bullish indicator that could set the stage for a major breakout. If the pattern plays out as expected, XRP could surge toward $3.35, its all-time high. However, before that happens, the price may dip further, forming the “handle” of the pattern—a common setup before an upward move. Currently, XRP is trading around $2.76, down 18% from its January peak. Apart from technical analysis, other major catalysts could help with XRP’s growth. The potential launch of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. could drive institutional investment. Additionally, Ripple’s ongoing discussions with the new U.S. administration may open doors for greater regulatory clarity and mainstream adoption. If these factors align with the bullish chart pattern, XRP could be on the verge of a significant price rally. Other analysts like Crypto Beast predict a $10 price for XRP in the coming months. PlutoChain’s Hybrid Layer-2 Platform May Bridge the Gap in BTC’s Ecosystem – Could This Upgrade Bitcoin’s Functionality in 2025? Bitcoin remains the dominant cryptocurrency, but its practical use still faces challenges. High transaction fees and slow processing times often limit its viability for everyday payments. Since Bitcoin wasn’t initially built for speed or large-scale transactions, improving its efficiency has become a critical focus. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) may offer a potential solution. By introducing a hybrid Layer-2 platform, PlutoChain could improve Bitcoin’s scalability and transaction speed. Unlike Bitcoin’s 10-minute block confirmation time, PlutoChain’s Layer-2 network processes blocks in just two seconds, which might make BTC more suitable for daily transactions. Transaction fees have long been a roadblock to Bitcoin’s broader adoption. PlutoChain may help reduce costs significantly, making smaller BTC transactions more practical and accessible. This could remove one of the biggest barriers preventing Bitcoin from being widely used as digital cash rather than just a store of value. Other than payments, PlutoChain is also built to integrate with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which might improve Bitcoin’s interoperability with decentralized finance (DeFi), NFT marketplaces, and other blockchain applications. During testing, PlutoChain processed over 43,200 transactions in a single day, suggesting it may be capable of handling high traffic volumes. Security remains a top priority as well, with audits conducted by firms like SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi, along with continuous stress testing to ensure network stability. Additionally, PlutoChain’s governance model could shift decision-making power to its community, giving users a say in protocol upgrades instead of leaving control solely to miners and developers. By tackling Bitcoin’s speed, cost, and interoperability challenges, PlutoChain might open up new use cases, making BTC more scalable, efficient, and functional in 2025 and beyond. The Bottom Line With a bullish pattern forming on XRP’s chart and new positive updates around the network lately, we might see the popular altcoin reach $5-$10 in the next few months. At the same time, PlutoChain could draw a lot of attention with its hybrid L2 technology that might upgrade Bitcoin. With the mainnet launch scheduled soon, it may be a good idea to keep an eye on the project and follow its developments. —– Please remember that this article is purely informational and not financial advice.

Hackers broke into Bybit’s secure storage , known as a cold wallet, and stole over $1 billion worth of Ethereum tokens. More than 401,000 ETH, including staked tokens, were taken. Following the news, Ethereum dropped over 5% to $2,700 in the last 24 hours. In response to the controversy, Crypto analyst, Justin Bechler argues that Ethereum is facing an impossible dilemma due to the involvement of North Korean hackers in illicit transactions. His claim stems from a growing debate on whether Ethereum should take action to reverse these transactions or allow them to stand. https://twitter.com/1914ad/status/1893122188716450200 A Tough Decision for Ethereum Recently the X has turned into a war zone where many are trolling the ETH founder while others suggest he should stay out of controversy by taking action against the hackers. Matthew R. Kratter, a well-known analyst, believes Ethereum’s leadership, including Ethereum’s co-founder vitalik buterin vitalik buterin Vitalik Buterin is a professional programmer and Co-Founder of Ethereum. Buterin, along with Gavin Wood, Charles Hoskinson, Joseph Lubin, and Anthony Di, launched Ethereum in 2014. He co-created Ethereum when he understood that he could construct a new, possibly enhanced version by iterating on the Bitcoin blockchain.

What does Vitalik Buterin invest in?Vitalik Buterin has made numerous investments in companies like Varro Life Sciences, Polymarket, and RISE (Singapore) within the healthcare technology systems, information services (B2C), and financial software industries. coinpedia@gmail.com Entrepreneur Crypto and Blockchain Expert should be held responsible if they don’t act. He argues that allowing hackers to keep the stolen ETH makes Ethereum an indirect supporter of global terrorism. Analyzing the situation, Justin Bechler said that Ethereum is facing an impossible choice. He argues that, if Ethereum rolls back the transactions through a hard fork, it would prove that Ethereum is centralized, contradicting the fundamental blockchain principle of immutability. However, if Ethereum does nothing, it risks being linked to terrorism financing, which could lead to severe regulatory consequences. Should Ethereum Roll Back the Chain? Some believe Ethereum should step in and reverse the transactions. Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX and a big ETH holder, publicly asked Vitalik Buterin to roll back the network and return the stolen funds to Bybit. He points out that Ethereum already did something similar in 2016 after the infamous DAO hack, so why not do it again? But so far, Vitalik hasn’t responded. However, doing this would confirm claims that Ethereum is centralized, meaning it can be controlled like a regular company rather than an independent blockchain. One of the biggest selling points of crypto is that transactions cannot be changed. If Ethereum breaks this rule, its reputation could take a huge hit. Bitcoin Maxis Troll Ethereum Bitcoin supporters, including Samson Mow, are having a field day. They’ve been posting identical tweets pretending that they and Vitalik are “discussing rolling back Ethereum.” Mow jokes that if Ethereum does this, they should create a separate version of Ethereum called ETHNK (short for North Korea Ethereum) that holds the stolen funds. Meanwhile, Binance and other big exchanges are stepping in to help Bybit by sending millions of dollars in ETH to support the exchange. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Market Hit Hard as $566 Million Liquidated After $1.4B Bybit Hack , What Happens Next? If Ethereum does nothing, the stolen funds could be used to finance North Korea’s cyberattacks, making Ethereum a target for global regulators. The U.S. could impose strict sanctions, making it harder for Ethereum to work with banks and businesses. On the other hand, if Ethereum interferes, it risks losing trust in the crypto community. So the big question isn’t if Ethereum will face problems, but how fast they will come .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Lunex Network, Solana could still remain better investments",https://crypto.news/is-a-litecoin-etf-on-the-way-lunex-network-solana-could-still-remain-better-investments/,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Litecoin’s ETF hype faces bearish signals, while Lunex Network’s DeFi protocol surges 425%, drawing investor interest. Table of Contents Litecoin price action remains bearish despite ETF approval speculations Solana outshines Ethereum in DeFi activity as its price faces resistance Lunex Network makes cross-chain trading simpler with noncustodial DeFi protocol Litecoin’s ETF hype is being threatened by bearish signals on the token’s daily chart, making analysts shift their focus to utility altcoins. Meanwhile, Solana’s recent DeFi activity has outperformed Ethereum by attracting millions in institutional investment, but LTC and SOL continue to battle bearish market trends. Amid this sentiment, Lunex Network’s next-gen DeFi protocol is gaining traction by changing cross-chain trading. As LNEX surges 425% during its presale, could it be the smartest crypto investment of 2025? You might also like: AVAX targets $75, SUI to overtake SHIB, Lunex Network is the next 10x coin Litecoin price action remains bearish despite ETF approval speculations Litecoin could become the third cryptocurrency to get a US spot-ETF. The SEC is already reviewing Canary Capital’s application for a Litecoin ETF, and market experts believe Litecoin’s ‘commodity’ status will help secure approval soon. Despite these optimistic speculations, Litecoin’s price action has turned bearish. At press time, Litecoin was selling for $129.84 following an intraday decrease of 4.2%. Litecoin’s trading volume increased to $1.54 billion, but the bearish signals on Litecoin’s daily chart suggest a possible sell-off. Since Litecoin’s MACD has formed a bearish crossover, Litecoin’s price could crash to the $100 support soon. Breaking below that level could trigger an even bigger selloff, bringing LTC’s price down to the $71 support. Solana outshines Ethereum in DeFi activity as its price faces resistance Solana experienced a record-breaking downfall throughout February, but analysts expect SOL’s price to make a massive comeback in March. The Solana network has gradually grown to a DeFi hub, backed by the mainstream adoption of its meme coins. Despite the bearish price action, the Solana network recorded a DEX volume of $258 billion in January which was 300% higher than Ethereum. Solana’s ecosystem extends beyond meme coins to handle the mainstream adoption of web3 uses. SOL-based investment products are gaining traction as they recorded a net inflow of $4.5 million, suggesting high investor confidence. Solana is currently selling for $172.28 following an intraday increase of 2%. Solana’s daily chart has started showing signs of recovery as SOL’s current price is above the 100-EMA and 200-EMA trend lines. If the Solana bulls regain dominance, Solana’s price could outperform Litecoin and test the $294 resistance level during this quarter. Lunex Network makes cross-chain trading simpler with noncustodial DeFi protocol Lunex Network ’s noncustodial DeFi protocol is attracting thousands of investors during its presale, making this new DeFi altcoin a better investment opportunity than both LTC and SOL. Lunex Network makes trading as simple as possible by allowing cross-chain transfers on over 40 different blockchain networks with 50,000+ cryptocurrency pairs. The best part about Lunex Network is the lightning-fast transaction speeds and low fees. Every transaction made on Lunex Network is processed through a smart contract that has already passed a SolidProof audit. With this unlimited liquidity, Lunex Network users can make thousands of transactions with tight spreads and zero slippage. This user-first approach has helped Lunex Network sell more than half of its presale token supply in record time. The platform has already recorded a massive price jump from the initial selling price of $0.0012, and analysts expect even bigger surges as the LNEX token enters the next presale stage. Early investors receive their LNEX tokens right away, allowing them to lock the tokens for a predefined period and secure up to 18% APYs. Lunex Network also shares a percentage of its weekly revenue with long-term token holders through an open market buyback of LNEX. This mechanism increases LNEX’s demand on DEXs, further increasing the token’s value over time. Since LNEX is a governance token, investors can use their tokens to vote on important decisions in the Lunex Network ecosystem. LNEX tokens are currently selling for only $0.007 during the presale, making now the ideal time to become part of the Lunex Network ecosystem at a low entry point.

H.C. Wainwright & Co. analysts call it a “major win” for Coinbase and the entire cryptocurrency sector. Although ultimate approval by SEC commissioners is still pending, the management of Coinbase is hopeful that the case might be dismissed as soon as next week, analyst Mike Colonnese said. Allegations and Regulatory Shift The SEC’s lawsuit, which it filed in June 2023, accused Coinbase of selling unregistered crypto securities and operating illicitly as an exchange , broker, and clearing house. The dismissal of the case would take away a huge regulatory overhang and indicate a change in tone towards a more crypto-friendly direction from the SEC. Regulatory Overhang Removed, Expansion Imminent Analysts Mike Colonnese and Dylan Scales pointed out that this action eliminates a significant regulatory risk for Coinbase’s shares. The resolution of the lawsuit is expected to reduce legal costs and open up opportunities for business expansion, particularly in staking and new crypto listings. We expect the denial of Coinbase’s application to motivate expansion of its staking business, which has been strained since the enforcement action,” the analysts wrote. “This will also be able to accelerate new crypto listings, both to subscription revenues and transaction fees”. Stock Reaction and Market Impact Coinbase’s stock rose by 1% on Friday initially following the announcement , but analysts were expecting a more positive reaction. However, sentiment turned as reports of a high-profile hack on Bybit rattled the broader crypto market, with Coinbase’s shares dropping.

As the market explores new opportunities, Rexas Finance emerges as a promising alternative, capitalizing on the tokenization of real-world assets. Ripple’s Resilient Market Position Despite strong competition, Ripple continues to assert its market presence. After completing a significant corrective phase earlier in the year, Ripple’s trading volume and investor interest surged. Cryptocurrency is navigating through a complex market, marked by quick recoveries and strategic resistance. The pivotal moment came when it tested the $1.95 support level, successfully rebounding, which rekindled interest among traders. As Ripple approaches critical resistance levels , the crypto community watches closely. A breach above the $2.40 mark could signal a robust upward trajectory, potentially elevating Ripple’s market cap significantly. This scenario paints a bullish picture for Ripple, provided it sustains the momentum and breaks past subsequent resistance points at $2.69 and $3.07. Ripple’s adaptability in fluctuating markets underscores its potential for sustained growth. However, as newer technologies and platforms like Rexas Finance gain traction, Ripple must innovate continually to maintain its competitive edge. Investors remain optimistic about Ripple’s potential, but the evolving landscape introduces variables that could impact its market position. Rexas Finance: A New Era in Tokenization Rexas Finance is setting new standards in the DeFi space by facilitating the tokenization of real-world assets. This innovative platform offers unprecedented liquidity solutions, allowing investors to access markets previously constrained by high entry barriers. Rexas Finance’s robust framework supports secure transactions, making it a preferred choice for investors seeking reliability and transparency. The platform’s dual approach of staking and yield farming presents lucrative opportunities for investors. By engaging with Rexas Finance, users can benefit from high yield rates and a dynamic trading environment. The project’s security measures, including audits by CertiK, ensure a rug-proof experience, fostering trust and increasing its appeal among the crypto community. Click Here To Buy Rexas Finance (RXS) Presale With the anticipated launch date approaching, the crypto market is abuzz about Rexas Finance’s potential to reshape asset trading. As the platform moves into the final stages of its presale, investor enthusiasm suggests that Rexas Finance might not only meet but exceed market expectations.

Meanwhile, the price dropped below $0.85, validating a pullback to the current levels of around $0.76. Cardano, which was on its way to reach the upper resistance of the descending channel, will the current pullback hinder the progress of the rally? The ADA price faced a huge rejection in the last few days of 2024, which compelled the token to form consecutive lower highs and lows. After the rebound in early February, the price seems to have halted the bearish activity to some extent, which has helped the token to maintain a horizontal consolidation. Meanwhile, the volume is also rising slowly, which suggests a major price action could be on the horizon. As seen in the above chart, the ADA price is feared to drop still more as it is trading between the lines of the Ichimoku cloud, which is heading for a bearish crossover. This suggests the bullish trend is not validated yet, as the bears may be under significant pressure. As a result, the Bollinger bands have suddenly begun to go parallel with each other. This suggests the price is undergoing a sideways consolidation and hence a good time to accumulate. On the other hand, the Chaikin money flow has reached 0.3, hinting towards the growing strength of the bulls against the bears while the RSI is hovering just below the average range. This suggests the bulls are vigilant over the current price action, and hence a significant price action may follow ahead of the monthly close. Therefore, if the ADA price reclaims $0.78 during the weekend and rises above $0.8, then the monthly close could be bullish with a higher possibility of rising above $1 in March. Otherwise, it may remain consolidated for a longer time than expected.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|ADA|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 12:17:45

OpenSea founder celebrates SEC’s decision as a win for creators and the NFT community. SEC drops Coinbase lawsuit and signals a shift in regulatory approach to NFTs and crypto. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has decided to drop its investigation into OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, opting not to take legal action. This decision is seen as a positive sign for the NFT industry. OpenSea founder Devin Finzer celebrated the report’s conclusion, calling it a win for creators and the Web3 community. The SEC’s probe into OpenSea began in August 2024 after the agency issued a Wells notice indicating its intent to take legal action. The main question was whether some non-fungible tokens (NFTs) traded on the platform should be classified as securities. NFT Industry Gains Ground as SEC Steps Back Previously, the SEC had raised concerns about whether NFTs might be considered securities under securities laws.

Most Solana meme coins plunge Most Solana ( SOL ) meme coins have crashed by double digits, with the total market cap tumbling to $10 billion. According to CoinGecko, this valuation has dropped from over $25 billion in January. Solana meme coins | Source: CoinGecko Official Trump ( TRUMP ), which was launched on Jan. 19, has crashed from $103 to $16, while the market cap has moved from over $14 billion in January to $3.27 billion today, meaning that investors are down $10.7 billion. Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) token’s market cap has dropped from $3.2 bilion to $554 million, while Melania ( MELANIA ) has fallen from $1.9 billion to $143 million. Only a handful of meme coins have soared in the last 30 days. Would token has jumped by 24%, while Comedian, Unicorn Fart Dust, and Just a chill guy have soared by double digits. You might also like: Pump.fun moves $11M in SOL to Kraken as trading activity drops amid LIBRA scandal Insiders, Pump.fun were top beneficiaries The ongoing SOL meme coin crash has cost many investors billions of dollars. The only beneficiaries are Solana, meme coin generators like Pump.fun, and insiders. Solana’s network has generated substantial fees in the past few months, mostly from these meme coins. Data by TokenTerminal shows that Solana has made $748 million in fees in the last 180 days and $328 million this year. It has even beaten Ethereum ( ETH ) in the fees generated this year. Pump.fun, the biggest token generator in Solana, has also made substantial sums of money. According to DeFi Llama , Pump has made $68 million in fees this month and $121 million in January. Pump fees | Source: DeFi Llama Solana DEX networks like Raydium, Meteora, Jupiter, and Orca also benefited as their volumes surged. They have handled over $1 trillion in volume in the past few months. Insiders and early adopters, popularly known as snipers , were among the top beneficiaries. On-chain data shows that most of them have dumped their tokens, making millions of dollars. A good example of this is Melania. Nansen data shows that the most profitable trader made $82 million and has sold all of them. As shown below, most profitable MELANIA investors have dumped all their tokens. Melania meme coin profit leaders have dumped | Source: Nansen The same goes for Official Trump, where the most profitable trader made $29 million and sold everything. Most of the holders have sold their tokens. Trump meme coin profit leaders have dumped | Source: Nansen A closer look at most other Solana meme coins shows the same thing. This also likely explains why the price of Solana is crashing, especially after the recent Libra debacle, where it initially jumped and subsequently crashed within hours. SOL is down over 40% from its highest level this year. Why Solana is the go-to blockchain for meme coins One of the coin’s biggest advantages is its high-speed, low-cost transactions. With the ability to process over 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and minimal fees, Solana differs from Ethereum, where high gas fees can hinder micro-transactions. Also, the Solana Program Library makes it easy for developers to deploy new coins. Platforms like Pump.fun allow users to launch meme coins in minutes, democratizing access to token creation and fueling the rapid growth of meme-driven assets. Strong community and retail Interest The success of meme coins like Bonk ( BONK ) and Dogwifhat ( WIF ) has cultivated a strong retail and community-driven market. This environment encourages speculation and viral adoption, making it the perfect playground for meme coin enthusiasts. These meme coins also gain quick listings on major centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges like Raydium ( RAY ) and Jupiter ( JUP ). This ensures high liquidity and accessibility, allowing new projects to gain traction rapidly. NFT and Meme Culture Synergy Many Solana-based meme coins also leverage NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, for branding, marketing, and community engagement, further boosting their viral appeal. Tading bots like BonkBot and Maestro also act as tools that allow users to instantly buy and sell meme coins directly from Telegram.

Within a day, the $TRUMP token exploded from $6 to over $70, reaching a market cap of over $14 billion. $TRUMP undeniably made numerous early investors millionaires. Building on this momentum, the BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is poised to become the next sensation. Projections suggest potential gains of up to 100x, which could make this an excellent opportunity to buy the token while it’s sold at a discount during its presale. The Meteoric Rise of $TRUMP On January 17, 2025, President Donald Trump introduced the OFFICIAL TRUMP token ($TRUMP) on his Truth Social platform and then on X. Launched on the Solana blockchain, $TRUMP quickly gained the attention of Trump supporters and crypto investors, with its value soaring from an initial price of $6 to over $70 within a day. This resulted in a market capitalization exceeding $14.5 billion by January 19, putting $TRUMP in the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap. For comparison, projects like TON (Telegram’s official Layer-1), Avalanche, and Polkadot currently have a market cap of less than $10 billion. The question is, is there a new meme coin that could repeat $TRUMP’s success? BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) as an Intersection Between DeFi, Meme Coins, and Bitcoin BTC Bull Token is a meme-inspired project that rewards holders as Bitcoin increases in value. Bitcoin has historically been the best-performing asset, boasting an average annual return of 230% and a staggering price increase of over 200 million percent since its inception. With increasing media coverage, widespread adoption, and discussions about its potential inclusion in national reserves, Bitcoin’s trajectory toward $1 million appears plausible. Bitcoin Bull Token is strategically positioned to capitalize on this growth, offering holders benefits such as real $BTC and $BTCBULL airdrops, $BTCBULL token burns, and high-yield staking rewards. The airdrop rewards and token burn mechanics will activate when Bitcoin reaches key price milestones. At $150k and $200k, $BTCBULL token holders will receive real $BTC airdrops, while at $250k BTC price, a $BTCBULL token airdrop will take place. Token burn mechanics will activate when BTC reaches $125k, $175k, and $225k. The goal is to burn up to 15% of the total token supply, reducing it from 21 billion to around 17 billion. Deflationary mechanics, such as token burns, often positively impact the token price by increasing scarcity. BTC Bull Token Leverages Ethereum Blockchain for Maximum Reach While $TRUMP opted for the Solana blockchain, $BTCBULL’s decision to utilize Ethereum offers several advantages. First, Ethereum’s widespread adoption ensures that $BTCBULL is compatible with many wallets, allowing seamless trading and integration with decentralized finance apps. Moreover, Ethereum’s prominence in the crypto space makes it easy for $BTCBULL to be listed on leading decentralized exchanges like Uniswap promptly after its presale. This will allow users to trade their $BTCBULL tokens seamlessly once the token goes live. In addition, there are over 300 million cumulative unique addresses on Ethereum , showing a broad user base. Thanks to its partnership with Best Wallet, the fastest-growing non-custodial wallet, users can buy $BTCBULL tokens directly with a card during the presale. Most importantly, they can interact with their $BTCBULL tokens and receive their Bitcoin airdrops in the same wallet as Best Wallet, which supports multiple blockchains. Because of its unique incentive structure, the BTC Bull Token has caught the attention of popular crypto YouTubers. NASS CRYPTO recently shared the launch of the $BTCBULL token with his one million subscribers. Bitcoin Bull Token ($BTCBULL) In Presale Now – Unstoppable Force Pushing Bitcoin Towards $1M+ Limited Time Remaining to Buy at a Discounted Price Early investors can buy $BTCBULL at a discounted price of $0.002375. However, the price increases every few days, giving early birds the best deal. Investors who buy the token early can stake it to increase their holdings without making new purchases. The project offers its stakers a dynamic APY of 175%, which drops as more tokens are staked, making early staking most beneficial. The arrival of $BTCBULL marks a fresh chapter in the meme coin story, merging community passion with rewards linked to Bitcoin’s success. As the cryptocurrency environment progresses, $BTCBULL presents a compelling opportunity for investors to join a meme coin and get Bitcoin exposure.

According to reports, the NASDAQ-listed firm revealed that it has signed a definitive agreement, making it one of the majority owners of the operational Bitcoin mining data center. According to the report , BitFuFu priced the deal at $400,000 per megawatt, putting the total value of the 51 MW mining center at $20.4 million. The company noted that the transaction was funded from the cash in its balance sheet and common stock. The Oklahoma mining data center has been in operation since 2022, operating through an air-cooled container-based infrastructure. In its statement, BitFuFu mentioned that the facility also has a functional operations center that can be used as a hardware repair center. The company initially announced plans to acquire the facility in January but failed to disclose details surrounding the location and the seller. BitFuFu acquires data center in Oklahoma According to the company, the data center site still has available space for further expansion. However, it is still subject to the completion of a transmission upgrade study by the utility company and Southwest Power Pool later this year. According to the CEO and chairman of BitFuFu Leo Lu, the move is in line with the company’s 1 GW global expansion plans. “This acquired data center in Oklahoma has built a highly efficient mining operation, and we are excited to welcome them into the BitFuFu family. It allows us to expand our self-mining operations, enhance hosting services, and strengthen our cloud mining platform,” he said. According to the statement on its platform, BitFuFu says it offers 556 MW of Bitcoin mining hosting capacity, with its centers spread across different locations in the United States. The company also noted that it has one center in Ethiopia and another one in Paraguay. The company has also enjoyed investments over the years, with crypto mining hardware company Bitmain as one of its investors. Trump factor comes into play amid global expansion plans The company, founded in 2020, went public in 2024 after a SPAC merger with Arisz Acquisition Corp. BitFuFu has mentioned that as part of its goal to achieve a 1 GW capacity in the next two years, it intends to move from an asset-light strategy to owning its diverse and robust portfolio of Bitcoin mining infrastructure. Last year, the company announced that it had signed a 10-year exclusive lease for two of its Bitcoin mining facilities in the United States. The facilities provide a combined 33 MW capacity, with the lease agreement also opening the company up to the option of acquiring a major stake in both facilities. At the time of the deal, the company mentioned that the deal pushed it to 110 MW between sites it owned or operated. It added that the rest were hosted by third parties. The acquisition is coming at a perfect time when United States President Donald Trump is looking to give the crypto industry a fair fight. While the last administration was filled with majorly anti-crypto personalities, this new administration has birthed a new dawn in the sector in America. Most companies are eyeing a move to the country as the industry continues to anticipate the effects of Trump’s policies for the sector to come to reality. In addition, Bitcoin has also taken center stage, with news about a federal reserve being in the works. Aside from the federal Bitcoin reserve, states have been pushing for their crypto reserve, with Bitcoin enjoying all the attention. It remains to be seen the positive effects that the Trump factor could have on the activities of firms like BitFuFu that are right in the middle of the Bitcoin situation.

Despite this performance, whales or large addresses holding a substantial amount of tokens continue to accumulate, which gives a bullish XRP price prediction where the price can make a 40% rally to $3.64. XRP price trades at $2.58 today, February 22, 2025, with the price fluctuating between a daily low of $2.51 and a daily high of $2.71. As Ripple whale activity rises , can XRP register a 40% rally, or will bearish trends continue to stifle its performance? XRP Price Prediction Today: Can Ripple Rally 40% XRP price seems to be mirroring Bitcoin price performance, but it has the potential to rally by 40% to $3.64 in the near term. However, despite bullish triggers like optimism around the SEC vs. Ripple case coming close to an end, retail interest remains somewhat low, preventing a healthy uptrend. According to analyst CryptoWZRD, Ripple price could be on the verge of a 40% rally if it can break past the $2.80 resistance level decisively. In the analysis, the analyst acknowledged that retail demand could derail an uptrend toward this key level. However, if the retail sentiment flips positive, which is likely to happen due to a potential Ripple ETF approval and the speed at which the new SEC Chair is handling crypto cases, XRP price could break this level to target $3.64.

Data from Santiment shows that large addresses holding between 10M and 100M XRP tokens recently bought an additional 20M XRP valued at more than $50M at Ripple’s current price. XRP Whale Activity When whales are buying despite the sluggish performance, it suggests conviction in an upcoming recovery. Moreover, whale accumulation has often preceded strong upward moves. If this whale activity suggests that Ripple is on the verge of a bullish breakout, the price could potentially surge by 40%. If retail interest returns, these gains could be achieved in the near term. XRP Price Technical Analysis XRP’s daily chart shows the price has been in consolidation for nearly three weeks. A breakout is facing resistance at the 61.8% Fibonacci level of $2.77, while buyers have been defending support at the 38.2% Fib level of $2.39. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart Buying pressure is currently weak for this breakout to happen in the near term. This is due to the RSI of below 50. The negative MACD line also shows bearish momentum that may continue to stifle XRP price performance until retail interest returns.

For comparison, in 2022, the average number of new altcoins was around 50,000 per month. This creates problems for crypto investors to find the next altcoins to explode since the market is crowded, to say the least. However, there are always opportunities, but only with the right research. Let’s have a look at the best 3 cryptos to buy now that could potentially get that 100x in the months ahead based on their fundamentals and use cases. ChowWow - Best Altcoin to Buy Now? Drawing from the loyal and strong Chow Chow breed, ChowWow launched the presale for its native token $CHOW in February. Unlike typical meme coins that rely purely on hype, this project is building something more substantial. It’s built on the Solana network. This new cryptocurrency combines gaming with earning opportunities in a way that makes sense. Players can jump into the game world to earn rewards, or simply stake their tokens if they prefer a more passive approach. It's refreshing to see a meme coin project that's putting real effort into building lasting value rather than just riding the hype train. Looking at the numbers, ChowWow has set its total supply at 888,777,000 tokens. Half of these are up for grabs in the presale, which shows they're serious about rewarding early believers. The rest will go toward things that actually matter - staking rewards, running the project, and giving back to the community. For those interested in staking, the yields look pretty attractive at 8% to 15% per year. The exact amount you'll earn depends on how long you stake and how many other people are in the pool. The gaming side is fun too - you get to play with digital pets that represent your tokens, and there's a whole training and trading system built around it. The community aspect is strong, with weekly meme contests dishing out $1,000 in USDT to the best creators. Right now, you can get in during the presale at $0.008 per token, with the launch price expected to hit $0.0288. This means that “early birds” could get nice profits upon launch. You only need $25 to get started, which keeps the barrier to entry low. Visit ChowWow Presale Alephium (ALPH) - Undervalued Crypto Alephium is doing something pretty clever with blockchain technology. They've created what they call BlockFlow - think of it as splitting up the blockchain into smaller, more manageable pieces. This clever setup lets them process about 10,000 transactions every second, which makes Bitcoin's 7 and Ethereum's 27 look like dial-up internet. They've also come up with a smarter way to handle mining called Proof of Less Work. Instead of burning through electricity like there's no tomorrow, their system adjusts how hard mining is based on what's happening on the network right now. It's like having a smart thermostat for your blockchain - it uses just what it needs to stay secure. The way Alephium handles transactions is pretty smart too. They've taken Bitcoin's UTXO model and given it an upgrade, making it more flexible while keeping it secure. It's like they've taken the best parts of Bitcoin and Ethereum and mixed them together. For developers, Alephium has built its own tools - a virtual machine called Alphred and a programming language named Ralph. These make it much easier to build apps on the platform without running into the usual headaches. The project's token, ALPH, has a cap of 1 billion tokens and currently sits at a $62 million market cap. They've designed their system to handle tokens really well, making it super smooth for both regular users and developers building apps. Alchemy Pay (ACH) - Next Altcoin to Explode? Alchemy Pay has been quietly revolutionizing crypto payments since 2018. Based in Singapore, they've built a system that works in over 70 countries and connects with more than 300 different payment methods. They're not just dreaming big - they're already working with giants like Shopify, Visa, and Mastercard. What makes them special is how they handle the crypto-to-fiat conversion. When someone pays with crypto, the merchant gets their local currency right away. They use Chainlink's price feed to make sure everything is priced fairly, and they've wrapped it all in serious security measures like two-factor authentication and solid encryption. For business owners, adding Alchemy Pay is pretty straightforward. It works both online and offline, which is crucial for real-world adoption. Their token, ACH, runs on Ethereum and has grown to a respectable $315 million market cap. It's not just for show either - merchants need to hold some ACH to use certain features, and token holders can stake their coins and vote on important decisions. This setup makes Alchemy Pay a bridge between the crypto world and regular money, something that's becoming more important as digital currencies go mainstream. The project keeps growing, now handling over 100 fiat currencies and more than 40 different cryptocurrencies. Conclusion Even though the massive influx of new cryptos makes it harder to spot genuine opportunities, these projects stand out through their focus on building actual utility rather than just chasing quick gains. The potential for returns exists, but as always in crypto, success depends on timing, market conditions, and the projects' ability to deliver on their roadmaps. Based on our research, $CHOW, $ALPH and $ACH are among top altcoins to invest in now. Visit ChowWow Presale Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

This AI Altcoin’s Smart Strategy Raised $10.8M in 2 Months,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/ethereum-future-facing-uncertainty-this-ai-altcoins-smart-strategy-raised-108m-in-2-months,"Ethereum is one of the most important cryptos today, yet the Ethereum price is struggling below the $3K mark despite ETF rumors. The ongoing ETH ETF rumors draw institutional investors to Ethereum, while retail investors doubt Ethereum’s future price potential. However, this AI altcoin stands out with its future price potential and impressive presale, which gathered $10.8 million in just a two-month period. Ethereum’s Price Struggles Despite ETH ETF Optimism Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is currently trading at $2630, reflecting a modest 3.4% decrease from the previous week. Ethereum’s price movement remains sluggish seeing quite high volatility over the course of last year. Over the past month, Ethereum’s price has seen several fluctuations, struggling to break above key resistance levels, such as the $3800 mark. In mid-2024, the U.S. SEC approved the first spot ETH ETFs. This approval allowed major financial institutions, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale, to launch ETH ETFs, providing investors with more ways to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset. The introduction of these ETH ETFs has opened the door for increased institutional investment in Ethereum. Despite the initial excitement, Ethereum’s price wasn’t quite affected by the launch of ETH ETFs. However, just recently, the SEC has approved Bitwise ETH ETF. Bitwise now still needs the SEC to approve a pending registration application, known as a Form S-1, for the fund to go live. Investors are now closely watching this upcoming new ETH ETFs and the network’s ongoing upgrades, which could provide the catalyst needed for a stronger uptrend. However, given its massive market capitalization, Ethereum’s price potential remains relatively limited compared to emerging projects such as the talked about AI altcoin.

Yet, recent movements in its price charts suggest a struggle to surpass the $3,000 threshold despite continuous whispers of ETF endorsements. In contrast, a pioneering AI-based altcoin has demonstrated remarkable fundraising success, amassing $10.8 million within just sixty days. A Glimpse into Ethereum’s Current Terrain Positioned as the runner-up in market capitalization, Ethereum’s journey is marked by its inability to overcome significant resistance levels, including the $3,800 barrier. The volatility that has characterized its recent performance remains a focal point for market analysts. Despite positive news in mid-2024 regarding the approval of spot ETH ETFs by the U.S. SEC, providing giants like BlackRock and Grayscale a chance to expand their offerings, Ethereum's price saw minimal impact. The awaited debut of Bitwise's ETH ETF, contingent upon the SEC’s nod on a pending Form S-1, brings a glimmer of hope to Ethereum enthusiasts. Yet, against this backdrop of high market value, burgeoning projects—such as an innovative AI altcoin—present a compelling case for more significant growth prospects.

Market pundits foresee a potential surge, projecting up to a 50-fold increase post-launch, underscoring its attractiveness as a 2025 investment opportunity. What Sets IntelMarkets (INTL) Apart? Harnessing AI for Trading: IntelMarkets deploys AI-driven analytics for real-time data assessment, empowering users with lucrative trading opportunities and an edge in high-frequency trades. Seamless DeFi Experience: By merging AI with DeFi, IntelMarkets offers an intuitive entry into the decentralized finance world. Dual-Blockchain Support: Operating across Ethereum and Solana, INTL ensures robust performance through enhanced scalability, speed, and security. Guided by Expertise: The IntelMarkets team boasts backing from thought leaders at OpenAI and MIT, reinforcing its innovative edge.

The platform is poised for widespread acceptance among both individual traders and institutional backers, making it a smart choice for those seeking substantial returns.

Amid this vibrant scene, Panshibi emerges as a captivating new entrant, poised to redefine the landscape. Panshibi is not merely a new player; it promises a fresh narrative in the realm of cryptocurrencies. Unveiling the Panshibi Phenomenon Panshibi has made a remarkable entrance, promising returns that have already astonished early investors. With talks of potential Coinbase approval amplifying its allure, Panshibi captures the attention of astute investors eager for the next big opportunity. For those seeking insight into these dynamic crypto players, let's delve into the unfolding stories of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Panshibi. The Journey of Dogecoin: A Pioneer's Path The first wave of meme coins owes its vitality to Dogecoin. This pioneer remains significant in the alternative crypto market, with its current trading status drawing much interest. According to CoinMarketCap , DOGE is valued at $0.255 with a notable market cap. This sustained interest is buoyed by new developments such as a proposed stimulus check nicknamed the ""DOGE Dividend."" The notion of a DOGE dividend, influenced by the savings from governmental efficiency initiatives, has added an intriguing dimension to Dogecoin's narrative. Elon Musk's financial strategies, paired with insights from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, could catalyze a bullish run reminiscent of past cryptocurrency rallies. Shiba Inu's Shifting Fortunes While Dogecoin continues to garner attention, Shiba Inu's ecosystem presents its own set of challenges and opportunities. The protocol's activity within Shibarium has faced setbacks, reflected in a decline in transactional numbers. Recent statistics indicate a significant drop, impacting the network's expansion and SHIB's market behavior. The decrease in Shibarium activity underscores how crucial this component is for Shiba Inu's trajectory. The downturn has affected both the coin's value and the effectiveness of its deflationary mechanism, posing questions about its future momentum. Panshibi: A Fresh Icon in the Meme Coin Landscape Introducing a new era of meme coins, Panshibi is making waves with its potential for exponential gains. As the SHIBI coin races through its presale stages, its price ascent hints at a bright future. Currently, Panshibi's ecosystem offers innovation that attracts both seasoned and new investors. The Panshibi framework incorporates advanced concepts like an AI-powered platform and high-yield staking, elevating its status among the promising ERC20 coins. With liquidity secured for the long term and a finite supply of tokens, it stands as a compelling investment choice for those captivated by the world of meme coins. Unraveling the Potential of Panshibi With a foundation rooted in creativity and robust growth potential, Panshibi is fast becoming the talk of the town. For anyone scouting for transformative investment opportunities in the crypto world, this new player might hold the keys to significant future gains.

Yet, amidst this excitement, a new player, Panshibi (SHIBI) , is stealing the show. With jaw-dropping 2.5x returns already amassed during the SHIBI cryptocurrency ICO and whispers of a Coinbase approval looming, Panshibi is positioning itself as the best crypto to buy for savvy investors. Let us do a deep dive into the latest happenings within Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Panshibi ecosystems. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Meme Coin Pioneer Heats Up Dogecoin kicked off the meme coin craze years ago, and it is still relevant among the top altcoinstoday. As of February 20, 2025, DOGE trades at $0.255 , boasting a hefty market cap of roughly $37.8 billion. Over the last week, Dogecoin’s trading volume has climbed by a steady 12%, and analysts are buzzing about a possible 4-6x rally by the third quarter of this year. What’s driving this Dogecoin price optimism? A potential catalyst has emerged in the form of a proposed $5,000 stimulus check , dubbed a “DOGE Dividend,” which would redistribute savings uncovered by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claim the DOGE team has already saved taxpayers $50 billion, with Musk projecting total savings could soar to $2 trillion as efforts continue. American executive James Fishback pitched the idea of a tax refund check sent to every taxpayer, funded exclusively with a portion of the total savings delivered by DOGE. If enacted, this stimulus could echo the crypto price surges of 2020 and 2021, when Trump’s and Biden’s checks fueled rallies in Dogecoin and Bitcoin. Dogecoin could soar to fresh heights, making it a contender for the best crypto to buy for anyone who loves a good meme coin story. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Challenger Rises Again Shibarium, the Ethereum-based layer-2 solution of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, faces significant difficulties due to reduced operational activity. Shibariumscan data shows that daily protocol transactions decreased from 4.77 million on February 14 to 54,640 by February 17 . The substantial decrease in user participation caused Shiba Inu's (SHIB) transaction volume to crash. Shibarium serves as a vital driver for Shiba Inu’s network expansion because its diminished activity creates significant effects on both price and deflationary system performance. Shibarium's decreased operational level affects both Shiba Inu's market value and its deflationary mechanism. The value of the meme coin dropped from $0.00001695 to $0.00001515 because network activity declined. Shibburn data indicates that the burn rate has decreased by 93.64% since the last 24 hours as only 1,026,163 SHIB tokens were destroyed. Panshibi (SHIBI): The Panda-Powered Meme That Has Investors Addicted While DOGE and Shiba Inu have their fans, Panshibi is bursting onto the scene like a panda on a rocket. This ERC20 coin is looking to notch at least 30x gains during its presale, pulling in over $1 million faster than analysts anticipated. Currently in Stage 4, SHIBI’s cryptocurrency ICOprice is $0.005, with a listing price of $0.026 expected that’s a 520% jump for early birds. And the hype doesn’t stop there. Some analysts are tossing around predictions of a 100x surge after launch, cementing Panshibi’s case as the best crypto to buy for 2025. What makes Panshibistand out among top altcoins? Its ecosystem is brimming with fresh ideas and narratives. There’s an AI-powered Social-Fi platform where users can tackle quests for rewards, plus staking options with up to 1,200% APY. SHIBI liquidity is locked for a decade, giving investors peace of mind, and the token supply is capped at 2 billion. The community’s growing fast, pulling in folks from the DOGE and Shiba Inu crowds. Oh, and those Coinbase approval rumors? They’re only adding fuel to the fire. Panshibi’s not just riding the meme coin wave it’s rewriting the meme playbook. Why Panshibi Could Outpace DOGE And SHIB With a promise of 30x gains in the bag and a presale that’s turning heads, this ERC20 coin blends meme coin charm with serious utility. For anyone hunting the next top altcoins to buy, SHIBI’s low entry price and sky-high potential make it tough to ignore. Don’t sleep on this one dive into Panshibi today and see why it’s got the crypto world talking. The next big thing might just be a panda in disguise.

Bybit Hacker Emerges as World's 14th-Largest ETH Holder,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/02/22/ether-supply-squeeze-bybit-hacker-emerges-as-world-s-14th-largest-eth-holder,"The Bybit hacker, supposedly a North Korean entity, is now one of the world's largest ether holders, which may have bullish implications for the cryptocurrency's spot price. According to data from Arkham Intelligence and Coinbase executive Connor Grogan , this malicious actor holds 489,000 ETH, valued at approximately $1.34 billion, constituting about 0.4% of ether's total supply, making it the 14th-largest Ether holder globally. That puts the hacker ahead of the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum's CEO Vitalik Buterin and Fidelity. It's important to note that the addresses linked to this entity are being closely monitored and backlisted by exchanges, which means the hacker will likely struggle to offload these coins in the market. In simpler terms, the hacked ether supply is likely lost permanently. Furthermore, Bybit, which has reportedly secured a bridged loan from unnamed partners to cover nearly 80% of the ether lost in the Friday hack, will likely need to purchase coins in the market. ""As far as this supply is concerned, it's essentially gone. No OTC desk or exchange will facilitate the movement of such a large amount. Meanwhile, Bybit is short 402k ETH. The bridge loan may cover immediate needs, but purchasing will still be necessary,"" Vance Spencer, co-founder of the crypto VC firm Framework Ventures, said on X .

The creator economy has seen explosive growth over the past decade, yet many content creators, writers, educators, and artists face a fundamental dilemma: monetization and content distribution often favor centralized platforms, which impose rigid rules, fees, and algorithms that limit creators’ autonomy and earnings. You might also like: Creator economy 2.0: AI and web3 define the digital success | Opinion While web3 solutions promise greater freedom, they have thus far often had poor user experiences and required creators to navigate complex onboarding processes and applications. However, blockchain-based autonomous agents are emerging as a new alternative for creators, seamlessly handling tasks, sparking new creative possibilities, and finally putting creators back in control of their work and income. Creator assistants Autonomous agents simplify content distribution and monetization by automating tasks such as pricing, licensing, and revenue sharing, freeing creators to focus on their craft. For instance, these agents can optimize pricing strategies based on market demand or manage revenue splits transparently. Unlike traditional AI tools, decentralized agents can operate trustlessly onchain, ensuring transparency, reducing costs, and eliminating third-party intermediaries. By leveraging programmable rules and onchain verification, autonomous agents also allow creators to explore new revenue streams—such as micro-licensing or fractional ownership of digital assets—giving them control over their intellectual property while tapping into innovative monetization models. Ethical concerns, such as licensing and copyright issues, can be addressed through programmable licensing rights embedded in content metadata. Art curator agents In the digital art space, autonomous agents are already changing how content is curated, traded, and displayed. These agents can autonomously acquire and curate digital content based on predefined rules through onchain verification. By operating on a decentralized infrastructure, art curator agents reduce risks such as fraud or manipulation commonly associated with centralized platforms. Programmable licensing embedded in the metadata of digital art ensures all transactions respect the creator’s terms. This eliminates ambiguities around copyright and guarantees fair compensation for creators, even as their work circulates across different platforms. Intelligent creative tools Developers are integrating autonomous agents into creative applications, offering creators powerful tools to enhance their work. These agents can act as co-creators or intelligent managers to generate, refine, and manage content in new ways. For example, an agent embedded in a video editing platform might suggest edits based on audience engagement data or generate metadata to improve discoverability. The use of trustless, onchain computation means that creators are not reliant on centralized APIs or platforms, which could compromise their data or artistic vision. Unlike many current AI agents that depend on centralized APIs like OpenAI, these decentralized agents operate sustainably and transparently, avoiding vulnerabilities tied to centralized control. Where to start for creators For creators just starting to explore decentralized platforms, it is crucial to confirm that the platform they use provides reliable and sustainable storage for their data. Many traditional NFTs store the artwork and metadata separately, which can create issues if the centralized storage provider discontinues service or stops paying for the storage costs. That’s a recipe for future headaches. Decentralized platforms like Bazar take a different approach, bundling everything together—your work, its rights, and ownership—in one permanent transaction on Arweave, called an atomic asset. Think of it like a self-contained digital artwork that carries its own rule book, no matter where it travels online. This is especially important as AI increasingly interacts with creative work, making the ability to embed programmable licensing rights essential. To that end, Bazar is experimenting with a data licensing framework called the Universal Data License that empowers artists to encode clear usage rules directly into their creations. When art includes these clear rules about how it can be used, autonomous agents can act like digital rights managers, making sure terms are followed everywhere the work appears. These rules provide transparency for users and AI agents alike, ensuring consistent adherence to terms of use. It’s like having a tireless advocate ensuring creators maintain control over how their work is used, securing credit and compensation even as their art evolves and takes on new life across the digital landscape. The future of autonomous agents Over the next decade, autonomous agents will play an increasingly important role in the creator economy. By decentralizing content monetization and distribution, these agents reduce reliance on traditional platforms, providing creators with more tools and resources to maintain control over their work while streamlining business operations. They will also help identify new monetization strategies, intelligently manage distribution, and handle data-driven financial decisions. Autonomous agents offer an opportunity for creators to regain control over their work and innovate in ways that would be previously constrained by centralized systems. As these tools evolve, they will help build a creator economy that prioritizes transparency, empowerment, and sustainable growth for all.

In 2025, some of the most intriguing developments are taking place in Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and an up-and-comer in the gaming industry, Rollblock ( RBLK ). Each of these entities presents unique potential, with Rollblock capturing attention with an expected 50x growth surge. Let’s delve into the specifics of what makes these opportunities noteworthy. The Rise of Rollblock (RBLK) in the Gaming Industry Rollblock is not just riding the wave of blockchain gaming; it is redefining the landscape by ensuring fairness and transparency in a market valued at over $500 billion. December was a landmark month with a 600% user increase and a noteworthy $1.75 million in wagered bids . Offering over 7,000 games and sports betting, Rollblock is cementing its status as a comprehensive hub for crypto gaming aficionados. Investor excitement is palpable, with presales gathering $10.5 million already, and token prices at $0.06. The option to use Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Mastercard simplifies participation, potentially sparking increased mainstream adoption. In addition, Rollblock implements a weekly buyback strategy with 60% of buybacks burned, effectively reducing token supply while rewarding stakeholders with up to 30% APY. This week’s 50% bonus on token purchases underscores the urgency to act. Ripple's Strategic Advances with New ETFs Ripple (XRP) continues its upward trajectory, reflecting a price increase to $2.69, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours. Recently, the Brazilian market welcomed the first-ever Ripple ETF by Hashdex, enhancing Ripple's appeal to institutional investors and reinforcing its significance in the blockchain domain. The potential U.S. ETF could trigger further price ascension, possibly exceeding $5 soon. Cardano's Potential Through Upcoming Enhancements Despite a challenging 20% drop over the past month, Cardano (ADA) is on the mend, trading at $0.78 following a recent 3.6% rise. The impending Ouroboros Leios upgrade promises to drastically improve scalability and speed, possibly propelling ADA to the $3 mark by mid-2025. The Bold Future of Rollblock While XRP and ADA represent robust investments, Rollblock's innovative approach in gaming and deflationary model could deliver extraordinary returns. By challenging traditional industry players, Rollblock ($RBLK) is poised to capture investor interest. Unveil the incredible potential of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

While Ripple and Cardano are long-established Layer 1 powerhouses, Rollblock could deliver the biggest returns, with analysts predicting a potential 50x rally ahead. Rollblock (RBLK) Gaming Upstart Offers Early Adopters 50% Bonus For A Limited Time Rollblock ( RBLK ) is leveraging powerful blockchain technology to bring transparency and fairness to an industry worth over $500 billion. Its game-changing impact is already making waves - December saw a 600% surge in new users, with over $1.75 million in wagered bids being placed on the platform. This is no doubt due to the expansive nature of the Rollblock offer, which features more than 7,000 games and a brand-new sports betting feature, making it a one-stop destination for crypto gaming enthusiasts. Investor interest in the RBLK token has skyrocketed in recent weeks, with the presale already attracting $10.5 million in inflows. Stage 10 tokens are currently selling rapidly at $0.06, but prices are expected to rise soon as this stage is already more than 33% sold out. Rollblock has also made onboarding seamless by enabling fiat deposits through Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Mastercard, opening the door for further adoption this year. The platform allocates up to 30% of its weekly revenue to buy back RBLK, with 60% of these buybacks burned to reduce the overhanging supply, while the remaining 40% is used to pay staking rewards of up to 30% APY for holders. Rollblock is currently offering a 50% bonus on all RBLK purchases this week, giving investors a rare opportunity to supercharge their holdings before the price inevitably rises. Ripple (XRP) Brazilian ETF Launch Gets The Green Light Ripple (XRP) is trading around $2.69, up by 3.6% in the last 24 hours and a solid 10% over the past week. Hashdex recently received approval for the first-ever Ripple ETF fund in Brazil. This will open the Ripple ecosystem to a huge wall of institutional capital and further establish Ripple as a major player in the Layer 1 blockchain space. It also makes the prospect of an American ETF fund more likely this year, paving the way for the numerous Ripple applications that are already on the desk of the SEC to be approved in 2025. This could launch the Ripple price above $5 in the months to come. Cardano (ADA) Speedy Upgrade Could Push Price To New Highs Cardano (ADA) has gained 3.6% today to reach $0.78. While this is encouraging, Cardano holders are likely still smarting from the 20% decline they have had to stomach over the last 30 days. Cardano fell sharply from $1 and has continued to fall despite bouncing from support at $0.61 during the major flash crash. The upcoming Ouroboros Leios upgrade is expected to dramatically enhance Cardano’s scalability and speed, potentially making it one of the fastest Layer 1 blockchains in the space. If this is launched successfully, Cardano could rapidly surge toward $3 by mid-2025. Rollblock Will Storm The Gaming Scene This Year While Ripple and Cardano are solid investment opportunities right now, Rollblock ($RBLK) offers the highest upside. With its blockchain-powered gaming model and deflationary tokenomics, RBLK is set to challenge the major industry players, meaning that early investors could see life-changing returns in the months ahead.

Sui holds strong amid market volatility Sui (SUI) has seen a weekly decline of 8.06%, with its current trading range between $2.87 and $3.70. Over the past month, SUI has dropped 25.37%, reflecting recent market corrections. However, its long-term performance remains impressive, boasting a 223.98% increase over the last six months.

The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) at $3.27 and $3.21 suggest price consolidation, while the MACD at 0.04668 signals a bullish momentum in the market. Key resistance levels are at $4.14 and $4.97. A breakout above these could trigger further price increases. On the downside, support sits at $2.47 and $1.64. Staying above these levels could help prevent deeper corrections. Given its strong six-month uptrend, SUI has the potential for continued growth, but it needs to overcome resistance levels to maintain its bullish trajectory.

Investors are beginning to feel impatient as BTC remains stuck in a tight range, showing no decisive breakout. The price was testing crucial supply between $98K and $100K when the market was hit by negative news, adding further uncertainty. Related Reading: Ethereum Holds Key Support – Analyst Doubts Bears Can Defend $4K Anymore On Friday, the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit suffered a massive hack, with $1.4 billion in ETH stolen. The incident triggered fear among traders, leading to increased volatility across the crypto market. However, Bybit responded quickly, working to reassure investors and prevent further market-wide panic. As Bitcoin remains range-bound, price compression is becoming extreme, indicating that a major move could be coming soon. Top analyst Big Cheds shared an analysis on X, revealing that Bitcoin is facing its tightest daily Bollinger Bands (BBs) since August 2023, when the price was at $29.5K. Historically, such low volatility phases lead to explosive price movements, making BTC’s next move critical. Bitcoin Price Action Signals Imminent Breakout Bitcoin has struggled below the $100K mark since late January, with bulls unable to confirm a recovery rally despite multiple attempts. At the same time, bears have failed to push BTC below key demand levels, keeping the price above $90K. This ongoing battle between supply and demand has created an uncertain short-term outlook, leaving the market waiting for a catalyst to determine the next move. The lack of directional clarity has led to Bitcoin consolidating in a tight range, signaling an upcoming breakout. Big Cheds’ insights on X reveal that Bitcoin now has its tightest daily Bollinger Bands (BBs) since August 2023, when BTC was trading at $29.5K.The last time BTC saw this level of price compression, the market experienced an aggressive price drop before a long accumulation phase that eventually led to a recovery. With BTC now coiling up for another breakout, traders remain cautious about the direction of the move. If BTC reclaims $100K, an explosive rally into price discovery could follow. However, a breakdown below $94K–$90K could trigger deeper corrections, making the next few days critical for the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Target $3,000 Once It Breaks Current Supply Levels – Analyst If history is any indication, this period of low volatility is unlikely to last much longer. The market is preparing for a major move, and traders are closely watching key resistance and support levels for confirmation. With Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges at historically low levels and long-term holders showing resilience, a breakout above $100K could spark a new wave of buying pressure. BTC Struggles After Volatile Friday Bitcoin is trading at $96,000 after a highly volatile Friday, where the price spiked to $99,500 before dropping to $94,800 following news of the Bybit hack. This sudden price action unsettled investors, as BTC failed to hold above critical supply levels and experienced a rapid selloff. Now, bulls must defend the $95K level throughout the weekend to prevent further downside. Holding this level would signal strength and allow BTC to push toward the $98K resistance, a key area that needs to be reclaimed for a breakout attempt above $100K. However, losing the $95K mark could trigger a breakdown into lower demand levels, potentially retesting the $94K or even $90K zones. Market sentiment remains divided, as BTC is showing signs of compression, typically leading to an aggressive move in either direction. Related Reading: Solana Sweeps Lows But Recovers – Can Bulls Reclaim $185 by Friday? For now, all eyes are on whether Bitcoin can reclaim $98K and sustain momentum, or if bears will push the price into deeper corrections.

This incident has reignited debate within the crypto community about whether Ethereum should roll back its blockchain to recover the stolen funds. Ethereum has since recovered to $2,735, but doubts persist about the sustainability of this rebound. Rollback Debate Divides Crypto Community The crypto community is sharply divided on how to respond to the Bybit hack. Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, advocates for a blockchain rollback, pointing to Ethereum’s 2016 DAO hack as a precedent. He argued, “If the community wanted to do it again, I would support it because we already voted no on immutability in 2016.” Samson Mow, CEO of JAN3, also supports this move, suggesting it could prevent the stolen funds from being misused. My own view as a mega $ETH bag holder is $ETH stopped being money in 2016 after the DAO hack hardfork. If the community wanted to do it again, I would support it because we already voted no on immutability in 2016 y not do it again? — Arthur Hayes (@CryptoHayes) February 21, 2025 Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, is a vocal supporter of the rollback, arguing that Ethereum compromised on immutability in 2016 and could do so again. “If the community wanted to do it again, I would support it because we already voted no on immutability in 2016,” Hayes stated. However, critics argue that a rollback would undermine Ethereum’s credibility and decentralization principles. Jimmy Song, a prominent Bitcoin advocate, contends that the Bybit hack is different from the DAO exploit because the stolen funds have already been moved, making a rollback impractical. Calls for Alternative Solutions and Regulation Some community leaders propose alternative solutions to prevent similar incidents without compromising immutability. Adriano Feria, an Ethereum supporter, suggested Layer 2 (L2) solutions with reversible transactions to enhance security. “Real-world mass adoption will not work without reversible transactions,” Feria argued , emphasizing the need for blockchain evolution to compete with traditional financial systems. Please take a moment to reflect on this. If Bybit had locked their funds in their own L2 with conditional reversible transactions, the hack would never have happened, and the idea of petitioning for an L1 rollback wouldn’t even need to be considered. Some form of transaction… https://t.co/1xXv4v91O5 — AdrianoFeria.eth (@AdrianoFeria) February 22, 2025 Meanwhile, the Bybit hack has intensified discussions on the need for better regulatory oversight. Analysts caution that increased scrutiny could lead to stricter regulations for digital assets, particularly for meme coins and other speculative tokens. Ethereum Technical Analysis: Key Levels to Watch Ethereum is trading at $2,735, with a 24-hour trading volume of $33.06 billion. It briefly dropped to $2,625 before recovering above the $2,710 support level, which aligns with the 50-Day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Despite the recovery, ETH faces strong resistance at $2,795, coinciding with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Despite the recovery, ETH is facing strong resistance near $2,795, coinciding with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. The descending wedge pattern indicates a potential bullish reversal, but Ethereum must close above $2,795 to confirm this breakout. Conversely, failing to break above this resistance could lead to further consolidation or a retest of the $2,643 support. Key Insights: Resistance at $2,795: Strong resistance at $2,795, aligning with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. Support at $2,643: Immediate support is at $2,643, with the next support at $2,457. Breakout Potential: A breakout above $2,795 could push Ethereum towards $2,946 and $3,153, confirming a bullish reversal. Outlook and Conclusion Ethereum’s bullish sentiment is cautiously intact above $2,710 and the 50 EMA. A decisive breakout above $2,795 could trigger a bullish reversal, pushing Ethereum toward $2,946 and $3,153. Conversely, failing to clear this resistance could lead to a retest of $2,643. The rollback debate and implications of the Bybit hack are likely to influence market sentiment in the near term. Investors should monitor key resistance and support levels as Ethereum’s next move will depend on how the community resolves the rollback controversy.

While some sectors show signs of slowing down after losing billions in value, these presales each promise a different angle for 2025. Below, we explore why Lightchain AI (LCAI) aims to shake up machine learning on the blockchain, how Mind of Pepe (MIND) claims to be the first AI agent altcoin and why Remittix (RTX) stands out as a top pick for cross-border payments. Lightchain AI (LCAI): Proof of Intelligence in an Unsteady AI Market Lightchain AI (LCAI) has turned heads by introducing a Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism. Unlike older systems like Proof of Work, LCAI uses node computing tasks model training, inference, and optimization to secure its network. At the heart of Lightchain AI (LCAI) is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a dynamic platform evolving through community effort. This model theoretically rewards meaningful AI tasks, but AI presales have hit rough waters recently, shedding billions in market cap. Although LCAI hopes to reverse that trend, the hype around AI tokens peaked quickly. Mind of Pepe (MIND): AI Agent Altcoin in a Challenging Meme Market Mind of Pepe (MIND) looks to fuse AI insights with a meme-driven community. After big meme tokens struggled to keep value, MIND claims it can stand out by offering data-driven intelligence through its AI agent. Holders of MIND supposedly gain access to advanced analytics that spot trends early, reflecting the growth of AI technology in 2024. Yet while the concept sounds fresh, meme coins have been underperforming. Some projects soared and then crashed fast. Supporters believe Mind of Pepe (MIND) will overcome these issues by focusing on real utility, but skeptics note that bridging AI and meme culture in a down market can be an uphill battle. Still, if MIND can maintain interest with its AI approach, it might carve a place for itself among collectors and traders who crave novelty. Remittix (RTX): Real-World Payments Topping the Charts While LCAI and MIND each chase AI-driven dreams, Remittix (RTX) offers a different track altogether: transforming cross-border payments. Currently priced at $0.0628, Remittix (RTX) has already raised more than $12.6 million, selling over 470 million tokens to investors looking for solid, real-world use. Past payment-focused cryptos like XRP soared when they delivered faster, cheaper global transfers. Building on that idea, RTX aims to let anyone convert crypto to fiat in seconds, then deposit it directly into a bank account across the globe. Picture a gig worker in Argentina who needs to receive funds from a client in Canada. Instead of waiting days for a bank wire, they can use Remittix (RTX) to settle stablecoins in near real time. This method cuts fees and speeds up transactions, helping unbanked or underbanked people as well. The project’s locked tokens and audited smart contract calm fears about quick sell-offs, adding to the trust that newcomers want in a fresh presale. As AI and meme coins falter, RTX addresses a tangible issue with a straightforward solution. Observers see this emphasis on everyday finance as the reason Remittix (RTX) is leaving other presales behind in 2025. Conclusion: Remittix Is The Crypto Presale To Watch Lightchain AI (LCAI) attempts to revamp blockchain consensus using AI tasks, and Mind of Pepe (MIND) merges meme culture with autonomous intelligence. While both projects try to stand out, AI tokens and meme coins have stumbled in recent months, eroding investor confidence. In contrast, Remittix (RTX) tackles a multi-billion-dollar remittance market with a PayFi system that offers instant, low-cost global payments a proven recipe for success in earlier payment-based coins. Having raised over $12.6 million and sold more than 470 million tokens, RTX shows that practical use cases still drive strong investment, even when hype-fueled sectors fall short. If you’re searching for a top-tier presale with the best chance of succeeding, Remittix (RTX) is your answer.

The exchange immediately launched an investigation, partnering with blockchain forensics experts to trace the stolen assets. The company issued an open call for assistance from teams with expertise in blockchain analytics and fund recovery. This hack represents one of the largest cryptocurrency exchange hacks in history. The Bybit team received aid from other exchanges to keep the withdrawals open for users.

The latest breach, a staggering $1.4 billion heist , has raised serious concerns about security, leaving users worried about their funds. Binance Co-Founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) has now weighed in, warning about the rising number of hacks and stressing the need for stronger security measures. CZ Flags a Disturbing Pattern in Crypto Hacks In a recent tweet, CZ pointed out a worrying trend: hackers are successfully targeting multi-signature “cold storage” wallets to steal large amounts of crypto. https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1893274376306356487 He explained that in Bybit’s case, attackers manipulated the front-end interface, making it look like a normal transaction. But behind the scenes, an entirely different transaction was being signed. This exposes serious flaws in multi-signature security systems. Are Hackers Exploiting Security Providers? What’s even more concerning is that these hacked exchanges used different security providers. This suggests that hackers, likely the notorious Lazarus group, have found vulnerabilities that go beyond a single system. It’s still unclear whether they are exploiting weaknesses in security devices, servers, or both. CZ’s Advice: Pause Withdrawals After a Hack To limit the damage from such breaches, CZ suggested that crypto exchanges should pause withdrawals immediately after detecting an attack. He emphasized that before reopening, exchanges must fully investigate how the hack happened, which systems were compromised, and whether security has been fully restored. He recalled Binance’s 2019 hack, where withdrawals were paused for a week. While the move initially caused some panic, user confidence was restored, and when withdrawals resumed, more deposits flowed in than withdrawals. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bybit Hack Update: Massive ETH Transfers & User Withdrawals Explained , CZ Praises Bybit’s Response, Criticizes Others Meanwhile, CZ applauded Bybit’s CEO, Ben Zhou, for staying calm and being transparent during the crisis . He compared this to other exchanges like FTX and WazirX, where a lack of openness led to bigger problems. At last, CZ noted that security should never be taken lightly and urged the crypto community to stay informed and choose safe platforms. Hackers are getting smarter, attacks are getting bolder, and the risks are getting bigger.

Here’s What’s Next for SOL Price Rally,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/will-solana-reclaim-180-before-the-month-end-heres-whats-next-for-sol-price-rally/,"The post Will Solana Reclaim $180 Before the Month-End? Here’s What’s Next for SOL Price Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Soon after the Solana price broke out and smashed a new ATH at $295, it was believed that the token may soon make it to $500 before the end of 2025. Meanwhile, the rise of the fallout of the memecoins on the Solana chain harmed the momentum of the SOL price rally. Currently, the price is stuck within a narrow range as the bulls display weakness and the bears appear less interested in exhibiting pressure at the current range. Therefore, what’s next for the SOL price? Will it reclaim $180 this month? Ever since the SOL price dropped below the psychological barrier at $200, the bulls have been failing to regain the last momentum. Meanwhile, the traders seem to be bullish on the token as, as per a new survey, a large number of FTX creditors plan to invest their repayments back in cryptos, specifically in Solana. Despite recent events like the LIBRA memecoin rug pull and the Meteora scandal, 44% of the creditors remain bullish on the Solana ecosystem. Moreover, 71% of creditors intend to hold or buy more SOL if it drops below $145, displaying more confidence in its long-term potential. Does this suggest the SOL price is about to drop below $150? As seen in the above chart, the SOL price has stuck within a narrow range between $169 and $176 over the past few days. After the drop below the ascending trend line, the bulls are trying hard to trigger a strong recovery, which is seen in the MACD. There has been a rise and drop in the selling pressure, which suggests there could be still some room for the bears to thrive as the selling volume is yet to fade away. Besides, the Chaikin money flow continues to trade below 0, hinting towards a weakness within the market as the bear holds a significant dominance. This may hint towards a growing possibility of an extended bearish action, probably below $160. However, the interim support at $158 may offer a strong base in case of an extended bearish action. While a drop below $150 currently appears to be quite distinct, a quick rebound seems to be on the horizon. On the other hand, the growing optimism around the spot ETF could keep the hopes for a strong upswing alive. Therefore, the Solana price may not reclaim $180 by the end of the month but may certainly display a monstrous rally in the long term.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|SOL|ALTCOIN|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 13:37:54

As the initial excitement surrounding meme coins begins to fade, a new wave of high-potential altcoins is emerging, aimed at offering tangible utility. In this backdrop, Rollblock ($RBLK) is making significant strides, revolutionizing the online gaming scene with its unique Web3 platform. Analysts are forecasting a remarkable 50x growth potential this year, but what sets Rollblock apart? Innovative Gaming with Rollblock ($RBLK) Rollblock ($ RBLK ) has carved out a niche for itself in the crypto gaming industry, offering a blend of cutting-edge technology and immersive gaming experiences. The platform's user base soared by an impressive 600% in December, marking a major milestone as players placed bids exceeding $1.75 million . Featuring over 7000 captivating games along with a new sports prediction league, Rollblock ensures an unparalleled gaming journey, all while leveraging the transparency of the Ethereum blockchain to bring integrity to a $500 billion market. What truly distinguishes Rollblock is its unique deflationary model. This strategy not only buys back $RBLK tokens weekly but also implements a burn of 60% of these tokens, effectively decreasing overall supply. The rest bolsters staking rewards, offering a lucrative 30% APY for investors. This results in both sustained demand and appealing returns for long-term holders. Currently at the tenth stage of its presale, $RBLK is priced attractively at $0.06. This creates an exciting window for investors to capitalize on a 50% bonus, a limited-time offer ahead of the next price increment. Dogecoin ($DOGE): A Once Bright Star Dimming Dogecoin ($DOGE) was once the darling of meme enthusiasts, yet its allure has diminished. Brief sparks from personalities like Elon Musk have failed to bring about sustained price surges, leaving Dogecoin trading at $0.25—a 5.3% decline this week and a 29% drop over the month. While some speculate on a future price resurgence, perhaps even integration with Musk's platforms, the broader consensus views Dogecoin as an underperformer against newer, more agile altcoins. Challenges Facing Toncoin ($TON) The native token of The Open Network, Toncoin ($TON), was initially buoyed by its connection to Telegram. Despite this, the past month has seen a 29% dip as the ecosystem's total value locked fell dramatically—from $773 million in July 2024 to just $215 million now. A reversal of this trend could propel Toncoin back to $8, should the support of its community ignite once more. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Struggles Persist Despite Shibarium Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has attempted to diversify beyond its meme origins with Shibarium, aimed at slashing gas fees and boosting DeFi capabilities. Yet, market volatility continues to plague $SHIB, with current trading at $0.000015 marking a 22% downturn over the past month, emphasizing the uphill battle it faces to reclaim its past highs. Rollblock's Future in Investor Portfolios As Dogecoin, Toncoin, and Shiba Inu navigate uncertain futures, Rollblock ($RBLK) shines brightly on the investment horizon. Its commitment to transparency and a deflationary tokenomics model positions it favorably for an upward trajectory in 2025. Engaging in its presale might just be the entry point for investors seeking high returns. Explore the Promising Potential of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

While Dogecoin ($DOGE), Toncoin ($TON), and Shiba Inu ($SHIB) struggle to maintain any kind of momentum, Rollblock ($RBLK) is rapidly gaining ground with its cutting-edge Web3 gaming platform. Experts predict a potential 50x rally this year - here’s why. Rollblock ($RBLK) Takes the Lead in Disrupting Online Gaming The crypto gaming landscape is heating up, and Rollblock ($ RBLK ) has emerged as the ultimate choice for on-chain gaming this year. The platform witnessed an astonishing 600% surge in new users in December, with players wagering over $1.75 million in bids . Offering more than 7000 immersive games and a newly launched sports prediction league, Rollblock provides an unmatched Web3 gaming experience. Every transaction is secured on the immutable Ethereum blockchain, ensuring fairness in a $500 billion industry that is crying out for transparency. A core strength of Rollblock is its deflationary revenue-sharing model. The platform allocates up to 30% of its revenue to buy back $RBLK tokens each week, with 60% of these buybacks burned to reduce the overhanging supply permanently. The remaining 40% funds staking rewards, offering holders up to 30% APY. This model ensures continuous demand while providing some of the highest yields in the space for long-term holders. Currently in stage 10 of its presale, $RBLK is selling fast at $0.06, with prices set to rise again in the coming weeks. Investors can take advantage of a 50% limited-time bonus on all $RBLK purchases this week before the next price jump. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Meme Mania Fades for Now Dogecoin ($DOGE) has long been a favorite among retail meme coin investors, but its momentum has clearly been fading recently. Despite occasional boosts from Elon Musk and unsustained rallies, Dogecoin has struggled to break out of its current price range. The price of Dogecoin is currently $0.25, down by 5.3% this week and an astonishing 29% in the last 30 days. Many analysts believe Dogecoin’s best days are behind it, although it is possible that this OG of the meme coin space may see some kind of integration with Musk's X platform this year. Dogecoin may well reach $1 this cycle but will be outperformed by faster horses. Toncoin ($TON) Loses 29% in a Month as TVL Tumbles Toncoin ($TON), the native token of The Open Network, saw a great deal of demand last year from retail investors due to its affiliation with the messaging app Telegram. Toncoin has lost 3.5% this week to trade at $3.64. On-chain metrics suggest that Toncoin use is declining, as its total value locked has dropped by a whopping 72%. In July 2024, this total was $773 million, while this month only around $215 million has been locked into the Toncoin ecosystem. The Toncoin price could well reach back above $8 this year if Toncoin bulls can reverse this worrying trend. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Shibarium Expansion Can’t Stop the Bleeding Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has attempted to move beyond its speculative meme coin status with the launch of Shibarium, its layer-2 scaling solution. However, despite this chain reducing gas fees and expanding its DeFi offering, Shiba Inu remains highly volatile. Shiba Inu is currently trading at $0.000015, having declined by 5.3% in the last week. Holders of Shiba Inu have also had to weather a 22% drawdown in the last month as the meme sector has been hit incredibly hard lately. Although the Shiba Inu burn rate has increased recently, there is still a long way to go before this popular meme coin can reverse its fortunes. Rollblock Will Change Investors’ Lives This Year While Dogecoin, Toncoin, and Shiba Inu face an uncertain year ahead, Rollblock ($RBLK) is going from strength to strength and remains the best high-upside investment of 2025. With revolutionary blockchain transparency and a powerful deflationary supply, $RBLK could rally hard this year as it embarks on its first-ever bull run.

The Bitcoin evangelist suggested that owning 4-6 million Bitcoins could help America pay off its national debt, predicting potential benefits of “$50 trillion to $80 trillion” for US taxpayers. Saylor stressed that the U.S. government could purchase 20% of Bitcoin’s supply “ like that ,” snapping his fingers. His remark about buying BTC “for free” likely referred to the U.S. government’s ability to issue an infinite supply of dollars through Treasuries. The U.S. government currently holds around 198,109 BTC — positioning it as the largest government holder of the apex crypto — while the United Kingdom owns 61,245 BTC. Notably, the German government dumped around $2.8 billion in BTC in 2024. Meanwhile, Saylor’s Strategy, which rebranded from MicroStrategy on Feb. 5, holds 478,740 BTC , making it the globe’s largest Bitcoin corporate holder. Last month, Strategy’s shareholders voted to boost the company’s Class A shares from 330 million to 10.3 billion, as part of efforts to raise $46 billion, evenly split between $21 billion in equity and $21 billion in fixed-income securities. In a December presentation, Saylor pitched a Bitcoin reserve strategy to Microsoft’s board of directors, suggesting that the tech giant could create as much as $5 trillion in shareholder value by adopting the benchmark crypto. However, Microsoft shareholders voted “no” to the Bitcoin reserve proposal.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Michael Saylor|USA,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-22 13:39:21

Chainlink ( LINK ) dived to $17.4 on Saturday, down by 43% from its highest level in December. Its crash mirrors the happenings among altcoins as most of them have retreated in the past few months. Still, there are three key reasons why the LINK price may bounce back later this year. First, there are signs that many Chainlink holders are not selling their coins. One piece of evidence is that balances on exchanges have continued falling this year. CoinGlass data shows that these balances have dropped to 138.8 million LINK coins, the lowest level since September last year. They plunged from 160 million in December. Chainlink balances on exchanges | Source: CoinGlass Falling centralized exchange balances is a sign that investors are optimistic about the coin, with most of them holding them steady in their self-custody wallets. In most periods, CEX balances jump when investors are moving them from their wallets to sell them. You might also like: Chainlink introduces new data product for DeFi The confidence among Chainlink holders is likely because many of them expect that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot LINK ETF later this year. Such a fund would lead to more inflows and boost its price. Chainlink price may also rebound because of its positioning in the crypto industry, where it is the biggest oracle network. It has a total value secured or TVS figure of $35 billion , making it much higher than other oracles like Chronicle, Pyth, and RedStone. Chainlink is also a big player in the Real World Asset tokenization industry through its cross-chain interoperability protocol. CCIP is a key component in the industry that provides solutions to build, scale, connect, and send assets across various blockchains. Chainlink price analysis LINK price chart | Source: crypto.news Third, Chainlink price may bounce back because of its strong technicals. The weekly chart shows that LINK has remained slightly above the 100-week Exponential Moving Averages even after crashing by 43% from its highest point in November. LINK has also formed a giant megaphone chart pattern, which is characterized by two diverging trendlines. In most periods, this pattern leads to a strong bullish breakout. In LINK’s case, the initial target of a rebound will be the November high of $30 followed by the 61.8% retracement point of $35. A drop below the lower side of the megaphone will invalidate the bullish LINK outlook.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. Tron was priced at $0.255 at the start of January 2025 and is trading in a range of $0.204 to $0.257 in February.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|TRX|ICO|EXCHANGE|BNB|LINK|ASIA|USDT|USDD,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-22 13:44:25

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Shiba Inu made millionaires with a 1000x surge, but its growth potential is now limited, prompting investors to seek the next big meme coin. Shiba Inu made millionaires overnight and was once identified as the best presale to invest in, surging from fractions of a cent to a market cap of over $9.3 billion. At its peak, it climbed over 1000x, proving the power of meme coins. One of the most astonishing success stories in crypto history involves an early Shiba Inu investor known as “Shibtoshi.” Initially, they invested just $95,000 into SHIB before its massive rally. This bold move resulted in mind-blowing profits, turning the investment into nearly $37 million. Stories like this illustrate the wealth-building potential of early-stage meme coins, including other massive and historical projects such as Pepe, Dogecoin , Floki, dogwifhat, and Trump. Now, investors are on the hunt for the next Shiba-like opportunity. However, with its current price at $0.00001578 and a massive circulating supply of 589.25 trillion SHIB, the chances of repeating those gains are slim. With its listing on major exchanges like Binance and its already high market cap, Shiba’s room for exponential growth has significantly diminished, making investors look for the next big thing in the meme coin world.

With its pre-sale price sitting at just $0.000000112, Pepeto is still in its early stages, allowing for enormous growth potential. Built on the foundation of meme coin culture, Pepeto is more than just hype — it carries a unique backstory, claiming to be the real Pepe, with rumors swirling that a former PEPE co-founder is behind it. These factors have ignited a frenzy across social media, drawing an ever-expanding community. What makes Pepeto unique? What sets Pepeto apart is its robust ecosystem. The PepetoSwap platform introduces zero-fee trading, making it a game-changing alternative to costly exchange fees. Additionally, Pepeto is developing its own Pepeto Exchange, integrating seamless trading technology designed to enhance liquidity and minimize slippage, ensuring traders get the best value. Unlike traditional meme coins, Pepeto isn’t just about speculation — it’s creating real utility, setting the stage for long-term sustainability. True power does not lie in fleeting trends, but in the perfect timing and unshakable context of adoption.

Rumors about Pepeto’s upcoming exchange listings have only fueled the hype.

The development, reported by Russian news agency Tass, is part of the country’s latest efforts for legal clarity in its handling of crypto-related crimes. At a recent meeting attended by judges and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Irina Podnosova said there is a need for a legal framework that addresses cryptocurrencies in criminal activities. She noted that the increasing prevalence of digital currency in the economy has led to an increase in crimes where crypto is used as a tool for committing crimes, serves as illegal income or acts as an object of criminal activity. Related News: BitMEX Founder Arthur Hayes Makes a Radical Suggestion on the Bybit Hack - If Accepted, It's a Mess Podnosova confirmed that the Supreme Court is involved in preparing a legislative initiative aimed at recognizing cryptocurrencies as property in criminal proceedings. The move is expected to increase law enforcement’s ability to track, freeze and seize illegal digital assets and strengthen Russia’s legal infrastructure to combat crypto-related crimes. This is not the first time the Russian Supreme Court has intervened in cryptocurrency regulation. In 2019, the court ruled that converting Bitcoin into rubles constituted money laundering when the BTC was obtained through illegal activities, particularly drug-related transactions. The ruling reinforced that cryptocurrencies could be subject to existing anti-money laundering laws. *This is not investment advice.

Now Roger needs our help. No one should spend the rest of their life in prison over taxes”. The post was made on February 20, and it rallied his own supporters to support the ‘free Bitcoin Jesus’ movement. As Ulbricht rightly points out, Roger Ver faces life in prison over unpaid Bitcoin taxes. It started in 2014 when Roger sought Japanese residency instead of American. The US authorities claim that Roger didn’t follow the exit tax procedures properly and are currently seeking extradition so that Roger can face 109 years behind bars. The IRS, America’s tax department, requires anyone renouncing their citizenship to pay all outstanding taxes before exiting the American tax system. Roger’s defense team, however, claims that the IRS didn’t follow proper procedures. Tax workers interrogated Roger’s attorney and staff while not executing a warrant. Supporters of Roger further argue that the IRS case rests on a misinterpretation of exit tax law. The betting markets, such as Polymarket, predict a 10% likelihood of Roger’s release within the first hundred days of Trump’s presidency. Roger has spoken out, claiming that reporting assets is complicated when investing in an emerging market. Furthermore, the markets Roger was involved in were illiquid and difficult to convert into cash. Roger’s defense team claims that the exit tax laws are unreasonably vague. They further point out that Roger took all the steps available at the time, considering the circumstances, and tried to follow the rules. On January 22, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht for his involvement in the Silk Road, an anonymous marketplace that used Bitcoin for transactions. Ulbricht had been serving a life sentence since 2015 and maintained his innocence the entire time, spurring the ‘Free Ross’ movement. The case against him was started in 2013 by federal agents and has also been shut down. The Free Roger campaign has many supporters, including those who supported the Free Ross campaign for so many years. Even Elon Musk has voiced support for freeing Roger Ver. There are mixed reactions, with some claiming that Roger’s case is very different from Ulbricht’s. However, Ulbricht and Roger were early adopters of Bitcoin, finding practical ways to use the new technology when most people were still wondering if it would last. Therefore, many people in the cryptocurrency community see a strong parallel between the two Bitcoin uses, especially since they both faced life in prison and battled against a draconian American tax department. While Roger invested in startups like Kraken and BitPay, Ulbricht created the Silk Road. Not surprisingly, Roger Ver, an early Bitcoin pioneer, was involved in the Blocksize Wars, advocating for bigger blocks so that Bitcoin could be used easily by regular people to make transactions.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|Cryptocurrency News|Roger Ver|Ross Ulbricht,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|MARKET|EXCHANGE|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-22 13:51:00

DOGE would rocket to its current all-time high price of about $0.73 at this time. However, the Tesla/SpaceX boss seldom mentions the title associated with his beloved cryptocurrency. Today, after being given a DOGE-labeled chainsaw by Argentinian president Javier Millei, Musk posted a rather amusing picture of himself on X featuring “The Dogefather” in the background. “This is a real picture,” Musk captioned the new post. However, it seems that Musk was referring to his new designation as the lead of the Department of Government Agency in the Donald Trump administration. Notably, this extra-governmental agency, which is aimed at lowering the federal budget deficit, has an acronym that matches Dogecoin’s ticker. And the official D.O.G.E website briefly featured the familiar DOGE meme imagery , boosting Dogecoin’s price in the process. With Trump back in office, Musk’s Department of Governmental Agency has started aggressively interrogating U.S. government agencies, with the latest target being the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Dogecoin Whales Accumulate — Sign That $1 DOGE Price Is In The Making? Ali Charts, a crypto markets analyst, highlighted that Dogecoin whales have been accumulating the asset in significant volumes amid speculation around a spot DOGE exchange-traded fund listing in the United States. Martinez noted that the cohort bought 110,000 million DOGE in the last 48 hours. Smart money investors adding more of the Shiba Inu-inspired meme coin to their wallets suggests their belief that another blitz breakout for Dogecoin is on the horizon. Asset managers, including Grayscale , Bitwise , and Rex Shares , have already signaled their intention to launch DOGE EFTs. Analysts are bullish that it won’t take long for Dogecoin ETFs to hit the market, predicting a theoretical launch as early as April . As of press time, Dogecoin remains 66.3% below its all-time high of $0.7316, reached in May 2021. However, if regulatory approval is secured, the cryptocurrency could grow to the highly-awaited $1 mark.",Cryptocurrency|News|Doge|Dogecoin|Elon Musk,EN,0,0,DOGE|TRADING|SHIB|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-22 13:57:22

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As crypto volatility rises, investors eye opportunities in Bitcoin, BitLemons, Cardano, and Polkadot. As the crypto market navigates through heightened volatility, savvy investors are turning their attention to three distinct opportunities. While Bitcoin hovers near its recent ATH, emerging platforms like BitLemons (BLEM) are positioning themselves alongside established players Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT) as potential portfolio cornerstones. You might also like: BTC nears $100k, SOL eyes $200; BitLemons targets huge gains Is BitLemons redefining the GambleFi landscape? In a sector ripe for disruption, BitLemons has emerged as a formidable contender in the $450b traditional casino market. This isn’t just another gaming token – it’s a fully operational crypto casino boasting over 8,000 games from industry giants like Evolution and Pragmatic. The platform’s 24/7 revenue generation model has caught the attention of serious investors, particularly after securing $1 million in private seed funding. What sets BitLemons apart is its transformative tokenomics structure. An impressive 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) is dedicated to token mechanics, split evenly between buyback & burn programs and staking rewards. This deflationary approach, coupled with dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof, positions BLEM as one of the most robust offerings in the space. The presale momentum is undeniable – Stage 1 sold out in just 16 days, and Stage 2 is moving rapidly at $0.02 per token. With rumors of a 17-18c listing price, early investors are racing to secure positions before the next price increment. How is Cardano transforming after the Plomin fork? The recent Plomin hard fork has injected new life into Cardano ‘s ecosystem. Looking at the charts, ADA has shown remarkable resilience, maintaining a strong position at $0.8013 despite a slight 1.24% weekly dip. The 24-hour trading volume has surged to $664.25m, indicating growing market interest. Technical analysis reveals an encouraging upward trend following the mid-February consolidation, with strong support established around the $0.74 level. The positive market sentiment is reflected in the 1.89% increase in market cap, now standing at $28.21b. Can Polkadot’s ETF filing change its trajectory? Polkadot’s recent headlines regarding Tuttle Capital’s leveraged ETF filing have sparked renewed interest in DOT. Despite a 2.88% weekly decline, DOT maintains a robust $5.08 price point, supported by a healthy daily trading volume of $187.29m. The technical indicators show DOT building momentum, with its market cap climbing 2.29% to $7.88b. The charts suggest a potential breakout forming, particularly if the ETF developments proceed favorably. Why BitLemons is poised for an unstoppable rally While established players like ADA and DOT continue their evolutionary paths, BitLemons presents a unique value proposition in the GambleFi sector. Its combination of immediate utility, transparent revenue sharing, and deflationary mechanics offers a compelling investment case that few projects can match. The time to act is now – with Stage 2 of the presale in full swing and the price set to increase soon, early investors have a rare opportunity to position themselves ahead of the curve.

While most altcoins have struggled to master meaningful recovery, ETH has received plaudits for its bullish outlook. With sentiment turning in favor of the largest altcoin, one analyst believes that ETH is “destined” for a breakout to $10,000 this cycle. Data Suggests New Ether All-Time Highs Could Be Around The Corner In a recent post on X, analyst Ted Pillows compared Ether’s current price action to Bitcoin’s movement during the previous bull market cycle, observing a familiar bullish pattern. Pillows point to historical data that suggests that in the 2015-2017 bull cycle, the price of Bitcoin reached a bear market bottom at around $200-$205. After a period of rangebound action and extreme volatility, the crypto ultimately broke out in a parabolic rally toward $780, representing a new historic high at the time. According to Pillows’ analysis, Ethereum is mirroring a similar course, having completed its accumulation and recently breaching stubborn resistance levels. Ether has also undergone considerable volatility recently, exacerbated by broader crypto market sell-offs that pulled its price below the psychologically important $3,000 price point. Bitcoin has risen by 90.5% in the last year. By contrast, Ether has plunged by 6.2% during the same timeframe. While BTC hit a fresh all-time high of $108,786 last month, ETH has yet to surpass its current record price of $4,878, which was registered back in November 2021. Still, Pillows listed some factors that could buoy the second-largest cryptocurrency’s bullish outlook. Ethereum Eyes $10,000 He cited Ethereum’s total value locked (TVL) and stablecoin liquidity dominance. As of press time, ETH remains the decentralized finance (DeFi) king, capturing over 52% of the total DeFi market’s TVL. The pundit also emphasized the effect of growing institutional interest and accumulation. ETH holders could see some direct benefit from Ethereum gaining more exposure. Finally, he noted that Ether currently boasts a lower inflation rate than Bitcoin and 99% of the altcoins in the market. Based on these bullish factors, Pillows suggests that investors and traders alike should aim for the moon, indicating that a $5,000 target is too conservative while advocating for a lofty $10,000 prediction . Meanwhile, Ether holders are hopeful that the potential approval of staking integration within spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which are currently being reviewed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), could trigger a move back above $3,000 in the near term.",Ethereum|Featured|News|Ethereum News,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-02-22 14:03:08

The support zone for DOGE price lies between $0.19 and $0.16, coinciding with the pattern’s lower trend line. If this level holds, investors can expect a recovery rally. While the target of this pattern is $3, there are other key levels where Dogecoin price might pause like – $0.569, the $1 & $2 psychological levels and $2.773. The ascending parallel channel pattern contains trend lines connecting higher highs and higher lows, suggesting that the asset is experiencing a consistent uptrend, which is a sign of bullish momentum. DOGE/USDT 1-week chart If this momentum continues and Dogecoin price holds the aforementioned support levels, investors can expect a bullish reversal What Lies Ahead of Dogecoin Price? The latest DOGE price has been fluctuating around $0.24, with a 4% decrease as of February 22, 2025. Despite earlier recoveries, the meme coin has experienced a correction in recent days. Currently, DOGE is testing the lower support level near $0.24, which has seen consistent bounces in the past few days. However, the price faces resistance at $0.3, which has been holding for most of the weeks The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 38, indicating that DOGE is approaching oversold conditions. The MACD is also showing signs of weakening momentum with a slightly negative crossover, suggesting possible further downside pressure. If the price can hold above the support at $0.24, there might be a potential bounce toward the $0.25 resistance. A break above this level could open the path to test the next resistance at $0.30. However, if the support at $0.24 fails, the next downside target could be $0.20. With the Dogecoin ETF speculation and if the crypto market sees a rebound, the DOGE price could see a massive surge. Dogecoin Price Dogecoin Faces Decline Amid Whale Movements The Dogecoin market has recently experienced a price decline, coinciding with fluctuating DOGE whale activities . The price dropped below $0.25, while whale transaction counts above $100K saw an uptick, nearing 51.454. The proportion of total stablecoin supply held by whales, exceeding $5 million USD, also mirrored these changes. This market behavior reflects whales are buying dips. While the increase in whale activity promotes accumulation, stablecoin holdings suggest that investors are cautious. Source- Santiment To sum up, If the Dogecoin price support levels hold steady amid whale activity, the DOGE price could surge toward $3. However, fluctuating market conditions and whale movements introduce uncertainty, with potential dips below $2 still possible.

40692117,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=112698,1740236920,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png,Here’s Dogecoin Price If DOGE Captures 50% of the Global Crypto Market Cap,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/02/22/heres-dogecoin-price-if-doge-captures-50-of-the-global-crypto-market-cap/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=heres-dogecoin-price-if-doge-captures-50-of-the-global-crypto-market-cap,"The price of Dogecoin could soar to double-digits if DOGE eventually captures half of the global crypto market cap. Dogecoin (DOGE) is still making moves to recover from the recent market downturn. Data from CoinMarketCap indicates that the price of Dogecoin has soared 6.51% over the past 24 hours and 13.39% in the past seven days. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.2423, with a daily volume of $2.56 billion. Currently, Dogecoin has a valuation of $35.26 billion, making it the eighth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Despite being a meme coin, Dogecoin still ranks ahead of several utility tokens, including Cardano (ADA), Tron (TRX), and Chainlink (LINK). Following this latest rally, Dogecoin enthusiasts are speculating on its price if it were to capture 50% of the global crypto market cap. This scenario has sparked a mixed reaction of curiosity and excitement within the Dogecoin community. As a result, we estimated Dogecoin’s price if it eventually clinches half of the global crypto market capitalization. Dogecoin Price If It Captures 50% of Global Crypto Market Cap At the time of writing, the global crypto market cap stands at $3.25 trillion. Dogecoin's valuation of $35.26 billion accounts for 1.26% of the global crypto market cap. Therefore, capturing half of the global crypto market cap will push DOGE’s valuation to approximately $1.63 trillion, surpassing Ethereum’s current value. This represents a surge of 3,850% from the current Dogecoin market cap, which currently stands at $35.26 billion. If Dogecoin eventually achieves a market cap of $1.63 trillion, its price could spike to $11, assuming its circulating supply remains stable at 148.05 billion tokens. The significance of this surge cannot be overemphasized. A portfolio of 100,000 DOGE valued at $27,850 will be worth $1.1 million if Dogecoin clinches 50% of the global crypto market cap and hits a price target of $11. DOGE to $11 Predictions Notably, several market observers believe Dogecoin is capable of reaching the $11 price mark in its lifetime. In November, pseudonymous crypto chartist Trader Tardigrade referenced Dogecoin’s performance within the Gaussian channel to predict a surge to the $11 price territory. At the time, Tardigrade suggested that DOGE will only achieve this feat if it replicates its performance in the 2020/2021 market cycle. Additionally, crypto experts at Changelly also believe Dogecoin could clinch the $11 target. According to the experts, Dogecoin will soar to around $11 in January 2040, nearly 15 years from now. By this time, they expect Dogecoin to trade at an average price of $11.56, with DOGE’s minimum and maximum targets set at $10.80 and $13.74, respectively.

Traditionally, many have relied on the Nasdaq stock exchange, recognized for its consistent performance. However, recent trends indicate a significant pivot as investors, including those who usually prefer conventional investments, start to explore new cryptocurrency ICOs like Panshibi . Especially intriguing to enthusiasts of meme coins such as Shiba Inu, Panshibi promises exciting prospects. A Decade of Nasdaq Stability vs. Panshibi's Untapped Potential Having been a pillar of stock market performance since its inception in 1971, Nasdaq holds significant allure for tech companies, currently listing over 3,000 major players in the industry. Although its index hovers near 20,000 points, showcasing an impressive 28% growth in the past year, some investors seek faster gains. In comparison, Panshibi presents itself as a fresh contender in the fast-moving crypto space, where substantial returns could be realized more quickly. Shiba Inu enthusiasts and daring investors are paying close attention to this nascent opportunity . Shiba Inu: An Evolving Landscape in 2025 Since its launch in 2020, Shiba Inu has ridden the meme coin popularity wave, following in Dogecoin's footsteps. While it remains a staple in the altcoin community, the spotlight dims as market saturation sets in. Currently valued at $0.0000158 , with a market cap of approximately $9.3 billion, Shiba Inu still garners significant interest despite a steadying price trend. Panshibi: A Novel Player with Grand Ambitions Emerging as a strong candidate for attention is Panshibi , an Ethereum-based cryptocurrency ICO launched in early 2025. With its unique blend of meme-inspired elements and community engagement, it offers an inviting alternative for those searching beyond the confines of more established crypto names. Investors who have previously found success with meme coins like Shiba Inu are now eyeing Panshibi, encouraged by its transparent pricing strategy and promising future. Seizing the Moment with Panshibi For those eager to diversify their portfolios with high-reward potential, Panshibi's current presale offers a timely opportunity.

The presale has now passed $1 million in total funding, a sign of rising market interest in AI-powered gaming. The token price sits at $0.005375, while over 200 million tokens rest in staking – showing both value growth and long-term holder confidence. These milestones mark key steps toward Mooshot’s gaming vision. Each dollar of presale funding helps build the Harry Hungry Hipo platform, where AI creates fair matches and rewards skilled gameplay. The large staking pool, earning 100% APY for holders, sets up a stable foundation for gaming rewards. Let’s analyze what crossing the $1 million mark means for Mooshot’s future, starting with how this funding fuels development. The Million Dollar Milestone The presale success opens new paths for Mooshot’s AI gaming development. Each token sale at its current price adds resources for building Harry Hungry Hipo’s core features – from advanced AI matchmaking to skill-based reward systems. The growing staking pool creates stability as the platform moves toward its 2025 launch. Think of this funding like building a new sports arena. The money goes into essential parts: AI systems that act as fair referees, learning from every match to create balanced competition. Gaming rewards that pay out based on skill, not luck. Technical infrastructure that keeps matches running smoothly. The large staking pool shows investor faith in this vision. When holders lock their tokens, they do more than earn rewards – they help create a stable gaming economy. This stability matters because it lets the team focus on development rather than market swings, ensuring the platform arrives ready for serious players. Building on Strong Numbers A carefully planned token supply of 3 billion sets Mooshot’s foundation. Marketing takes 35% to spread awareness, while presale and liquidity each claim 20% for market stability. The project fund holds 15% for development costs, and 10% powers those steady staking rewards. This structure works like a well-designed city plan. Marketing funds act as roads, bringing new players to the platform. Liquidity pools serve as highways, keeping token movement smooth. The development fund builds essential services – AI systems, game features, and security measures that make skilled gameplay profitable. The staking program adds another layer of strength. When players stake tokens, they create a reliable pool for gaming rewards. This matters because when Harry Hungry Hipo launches, winners need confidence their skills will earn real value. From AI development to reward systems, each piece of funding serves a clear purpose in building tomorrow’s gaming platform. AI Gaming Takes Shape Harry Hungry Hipo brings intelligence to every match through layers of AI technology. Like a chess computer that learns from grandmasters, the system studies successful players to understand what makes gameplay skillful. This learning creates matches where strategy beats luck – good moves lead to higher scores and better rewards. The AI adapts to each player’s level, much like a coach who adjusts training difficulty. New players find matches that teach core skills while staying fun. As players improve, the AI raises the challenge, creating tougher games with bigger rewards at stake. This progression keeps games engaging while rewarding genuine skill growth. When Q1 2025 arrives, players see this AI in action. The basic game shows how skill affects outcomes. By Q2, full features arrive with built-in staking options. Q3 adds NFTs and advanced AI that makes each match unique. Throughout this growth, the AI keeps learning, making games smarter and rewards fairer. From Presale to Platform Launch Joining Mooshot today sets up your position for the 2025 gaming world. Starting feels like opening your first gaming account – pick a digital wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet), choose your payment method (ETH, BNB, USDT, or bank card), and buy tokens at the current price. After buying, players take one of two paths. The staking program offers steady rewards while supporting the gaming economy. Think of it as putting your tokens to work – they earn returns while helping build the platform you’ll play on. Others keep tokens ready for gameplay, preparing to dive into matches when Harry Hungry Hipo launches. The first quarter marks your first chance to test the AI gaming system. Those who joined early find themselves ready with both knowledge and tokens. By the third quarter, as NFTs and advanced features arrive, early supporters see their preparation pay off through both gaming skill and token holdings.

The CNN Money fear and greed index remained in the fear zone of 35, while the crypto fear and greed index moved to the greed area of 38. Bitcoin and American equities have retreated because of the elevated market risk about President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the Federal Reserve. This week’s Fed minutes showed that most officials favored maintaining a restrictive policy since inflation remains elevated. Data published earlier this month revealed that the headline and core consumer price index rose to 3% and 3.3% in January, moving further from the 2% target. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies do well when the Federal Reserve has a dovish tone. For example, they crashed in 2022 as the bank hiked rates, but rebounded between 2023 and 2024 as the bank started its pivot. Investors are also concerned about tariffs , likely leading to more market risks. Trump has already implemented tariffs on Chinese imports. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and steel and aluminum will kick off in March. He is also considering levies on European goods. Higher tariffs will likely lead to stagflation, a period where high inflation is accompanied by slow growth rate. It is a difficult period since interest rate hikes to slow inflation lead to a slow economic growth, while rate cuts triggers higher inflation.

Each holds the promise of reaching a significant price point of $1, yet they each approach this target from vastly different perspectives. This tale of two cryptos provides a unique snapshot of the current financial landscape, where popularity meets practicality. The Tumultuous Path of Dogecoin Amidst an unpredictable market, Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to be an enigmatic force. Despite a minor price movement to $0.2540, gaining a mere 1.08% in a single day, enthusiasts speculate over its future. Rumors flutter about potential integrations with platforms like X (formerly Twitter), yet substantial developments remain elusive. As Dogecoin drifts without clear direction, reliance on media buzz over tangible use becomes more apparent. Dogecoin's story is emblematic of crypto's volatile world where hype often overshadows genuine application. Its strength and weakness lie in its identity as a meme-driven currency, offering both the allure of spontaneity and the uncertainty of lacking concrete utility. As analysts ponder the possibility of a price drop, the call for innovative solutions becomes increasingly apparent.

That’s exciting news! But another cheaper coin, currently worth only six cents, may reach the same goal even faster. People are curious about which coin will win this race. Let’s take a look at why these predictions are being made and what could happen next. Dogecoin’s Struggles and the Rise of Remittix Dogecoin (DOGE) , one of the most famous meme coins, has had a rough time recently. As of now, Dogecoin is priced around $0.2540 with only a small increase of 1.08% in the last day. While its trading volume jumped by 14.21%, it’s still not experiencing the huge price surges it once did. Traders are unsure about its future because there’s been talk of using Dogecoin for payments on X (formerly Twitter), but no concrete plans have been revealed. Analysts warn that if DOGE doesn’t break through key price levels soon, its price could fall further. The main problem with Dogecoin is that it still relies heavily on hype and social media attention rather than real-world use. That’s where new projects like Remittix (RTX) stand out. Remittix is solving one of crypto’s biggest challenges: turning digital money into regular money quickly and easily. While Dogecoin struggles to find a strong, practical use case, Remittix allows users to convert over forty cryptocurrencies into regular currency and send it directly to any bank account. Imagine getting paid in cryptocurrency but needing the money in your bank right away. With Remittix, that’s possible without delays or hidden fees. This real-world utility has made Remittix one of the most promising altcoins in 2025. As traders and investors seek more practical solutions, projects like Remittix could become the future of the crypto market, leaving coins like Dogecoin struggling to keep up. Remittix: The Future of Easy Crypto Payments PayFi, short for “payment finance,” is a new way to make using cryptocurrency as simple as paying with a debit card. Instead of converting digital money to cash through complicated steps, PayFi services let users pay with crypto while the person or business receiving the payment gets traditional money (FIAT) straight in their bank account. This could make cryptocurrencies more popular and easier to use in everyday life. One PayFi project that stands out is Remittix (RTX) , currently priced at $0.0628. Remittix has sold over 466 million tokens, raising more than $12.6 million in presale. This has made it one of the most talked-about PayFi platforms. Its goal is simple: convert crypto to fiat in seconds, making payments smoother for everyone. For example, imagine a freelancer in Asia working for a client in Europe. Traditional payments would take days and cost high fees. With Remittix, the client pays in crypto and the freelancer instantly receives local currency in their bank account. It’s fast, easy and saves money for both sides. Businesses also benefit from Remittix. They can accept crypto payments but settle in fiat, avoiding price swings in the crypto market while giving customers more ways to pay. This combination of speed and reliability is why Remittix is gaining attention. Some experts predict Remittix could rise by over 5,800% due to its practical solutions and growing popularity. As PayFi continues to develop, Remittix could lead the way in changing how we use money. Whether or not it hits those big numbers, it’s already capturing the interest of investors and helping bring crypto payments into everyday life. Remittix Presale Soars with Over $12.5 Million Raised for PayFi Innovation Remittix, currently priced at $0.0628, raised over $12.6 million in presale by selling more than 470 million tokens. Its innovative PayFi solutions position it as a leader in seamless crypto payments.

Why Non-Custodial Banking Is the Future of Finance,https://coinpedia.org/information/think-you-own-your-money-why-non-custodial-banking-is-the-future-of-finance/,"The post Think You Own Your Money? Why Non-Custodial Banking Is the Future of Finance appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Imagine waking up one day to discover that your bank has frozen your account. No explanations, no apologies, and no warnings. You can’t access your own money. Think this is unrealistic? Think again. This is exactly what happened to thousands of Silicon Valley Bank customers last year, when the bank collapsed overnight. It was a downright shocking and gut-wrenching reminder of the risks of custodial banking and centralized finance. Custodial banking is the type of banking that we all know – places that hold and manage your money. The moment you deposit funds, you don’t just give them your currency, you give them control, and with that, they have the power to restrict your access, block transactions, and in some cases, lose your funds due to institutional mismanagement. You deserve a better system. The Risks of Custodial Banking Where to start. The banks can arbitrarily do pretty much whatever they like, such as freezing your account, causing you anything from a minor inconvenience to severe financial distress. There have been instances where a husband has died and the bank has frozen his joint-access accounts, locking his bereaved wife out at an excruciating time. On top of that, custodial banks own all of your private financial data, which they routinely lose . Now, of course, accidents happen, but banks and their outdated security infrastructure have become perfect targets for cybercriminals and career hackers, who know that this compromised data is worth a small fortune. It’s not only banks’ data security practices that are weak, so are their antiquated policies, which see them prioritize excessive profits over customers’ best interests. This translates into exorbitant overdraft, loan, and mortgage fees, or poor interest rates on customer savings (while the bankers’ bonuses keep growing). At the same time, a lack of banking transparency means that your funds could be used for risky investments or speculative trading without your knowledge or consent. That is exactly what Silicon Valley Bank did to cripple themselves and lose $1.8bn of customer funds that were entrusted to them. We only have to go back a little further, to the 2008 financial crisis , a terrifying case study that allows us to point our fingers directly at the banks and identify how their reckless behaviour led to devastating consequences for the whole world. Millions of people suffered directly, with many entrusting their life savings with bankers who were more competent at financial mismanagement and fraud than doing their actual jobs. Everyone else suffered through recessions, stagnant wage growth, high debts and unemployment, home foreclosures, an increased cost of living, and more. In 2023, it was found that bankers’ bonuses have more than doubled since 2008. They’re no longer working for us at all. What Is Non-Custodial Banking and Why Is It the Solution? Non-custodial banking means taking full control of your own funds without any reliance on third-party institutions, like banks and building societies. Once upon a time, this meant stuffing cash under the mattress, but these days, we’re talking about decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology. You hold your money in a way that nobody else can touch it. You hold the keys, and only you. With non-custodial banking, the combination of digital wallets, private keys, and smart contracts provide you with complete ownership and control of your assets. No more arbitrary freezes. No more data theft. No more restrictions. In addition, you have enhanced privacy and security, thanks to advanced cryptographic encryption and distributed ledger technology. Beyond improved security and control over your funds, there are other, less obvious advantages to non-custodial banking. One is that you’re no longer exposed to the same dangers of data loss, damage, or access complications as regular banking customers. Natural disasters, fires, and extreme weather have all led to major data loss over the years, not just for paper records, but for digital data too – not to mention service outages . The Rise of Deobanks: A Self-Sovereign Alternative A new generation of financial technologies is now noisily disrupting the traditional banking industry, with WeFi leading the charge. As the first “Deobank”, WeFi represents a novel class of decentralized on-chain banks that are built on blockchain rails. Unlike traditional banks, and even Neobanks (which are still 100% custodial), Deobanks like WeFi provide decentralized and transparent financial services to their users, while still empowering them to retain full control of their non-custodial accounts. It’s the best of both worlds, as WeFi offers non-custodial banking services with additional features, made possible by their smart contract-based accounts. WeFi’s account holders can spend using digital cards and smart wallet transactions, without ever handing over control of their funds to an intermediary. The transparent nature of the blockchain ensures full accountability without compromising user privacy. Everyone can benefit from non-custodial banking using services like WeFi, but one of the earliest case studies and beneficiaries of technology of this nature are overseas workers making remittances. For years, sending money from one country to another has seen sky-high wire fees charged to some of the world’s poorest people. This needed to be stopped, and blockchain technology made it possible. Whether sending $1 or $1,000,000, the blockchain network fee is the same. That’s financial democratization in real-time, smashing down borders and the middlemen who prop them up. Non-Custodial Banking Is Not Just a Trend The rise of non-custodial banking is not a passing trend, it’s a fundamental shift in how modern humans, especially those who have grown up with technology, think about money and finance. In a world where applications, emerging tech, and alternative narratives dominate the digital world, banking has been able to avoid a major disruption for far too long. However, the rise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies (especially stablecoins) now represents a multi-trillion dollar industry that proves people don’t necessarily want to put their financial assets into a bank. Financial freedom, privacy, and personal control have always been important, but perhaps the flexibility afforded by technology has shown people that they not only deserve better options, but can access them immediately. Deobanks like WeFi have the transformative potential to lead us into an era with more secure, trustworthy, and equitable financial management options, far from the grabbing hands of corporate gatekeepers, predatory middlemen, and bonus-focused, self-serving bankers. Human-centric finance will put people back in control of their money.",Information,EN,0,0,FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 15:20:44

The team wants to give back 10% of the funds that anyone is able to recover, according to a press release shared with CryptoPotato. As reported previously, Bybit suffered a security breach, resulting in the theft of over $1.4 billion in ETH. The attack was carried out by the infamous Lazarus group, an organization allegedly run by the North Korean government. In any case, speaking on the matter was Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of bybit, who said: We want to officially reward our community, who lent us their expertise, experience, and support through the Recovery Bounty Program and our efforts to make this difficult lesson a valuable one does not stop here. Bybit is determined to rise above the setback and fundamentally transform our security infrastructure, improve liquidity, and be a steadfast partner to our friends in the crypto community. He also added: Within 24 hours of the event, we were overwhelmed with support from some of the best people and organizations in the industry, and we do not take it for granted. We have shared in a dark moment of crypto history, and we’ve proven we are better than the malicious actors.

Ethereum whales are taking advantage of the affordable presale price and are quietly amassing FloppyPepe (FPPE) as they abandon Ethereum (ETH). This calculated move underscores the growing interest in AI coins, which are reshaping traditional industries through cutting-edge technology. Strategic Moves: Ethereum Whales Sell Ethereum (ETH) And Dive Into AI Crypto Market Ethereum whales are making moves, shaking up the AI crypto market. According to Lookonchain, a prominent Ethereum whale recently sold 10,070 ETH for about $33 million, taking a $1 million loss. This whale had earlier moved 24,029 ETH and now holds 13,959 ETH, worth roughly $45.48 million. This sell-off suggests possible doubts about Ethereum’s (ETH) short-term price stability, potentially influencing market sentiment and increasing selling pressure. The transaction happened at a critical support level of around $3,280, with trading volume spiking and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing oversold conditions. Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $2,639 , signaling a drop. While a short-term bounce is possible, continued whale activity could limit recovery. Ethereum whales are making bold moves, quietly buying FloppyPepe (FPPE), a rising star in the AI crypto market. This strategic play signals growing confidence in this AI crypto potential, hinting that it could lead in the next wave. With momentum building, all eyes are on FloppyPepe (FPPE) as it gears up for a possible breakout in the AI crypto market. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Emerges As AI Crypto Market Game-Changer The AI crypto market is ablaze with excitement, and Ethereum whales are quietly positioning themselves at the forefront. As AI weaves deeper into digital experiences, AI agent cryptocurrencies are emerging as formidable forces. Leading this evolution is FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a meme coin that transcends its playful origins with advanced AI utilities. Meme-o-Matic is an ingenious AI agent that transforms meme creation and distribution. This decentralized platform empowers users to submit text prompts, videos, and images, which the Meme-o-Matic processes to generate unique, shareable memes. This blend of creativity and AI not only fuels community engagement but also sets a new standard for digital content creation within the AI crypto market. Taking a step further, FloppyX—FloppyPepe’s intelligent video AI bot—ushers in a new era of interactive storytelling. By transforming text-based interactions into dynamic videos, FloppyX delivers real-time reactions, self-aware characters, and immersive narratives. Users can engage directly through polls and prompts, adding depth to digital experiences and redefining meme culture. This level of engagement is pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the AI crypto market, making FloppyPepe (FPPE) a standout competitor. With its beta AI agent set to launch in less than two weeks, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is poised to capitalize on the surging demand for AI-driven solutions. This momentum has not gone unnoticed. Ethereum whales have quietly bought this AI crypto token as they drop Ethereum (ETH), signaling a potential investment shift. The excitement around FloppyPepe (FPPE) is amplified by its booming presale, which uses a stage-based pricing system to reward early investors and Ethereum whales while building anticipation with each phase. This strategic approach has generated significant early momentum, drawing the attention of the crypto community and further solidifying FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) standing in the AI crypto market. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale Soars As Community Trust Powers Demand The true strength of FloppyPepe (FPPE) lies in its community-driven growth. Fueled by vibrant Telegram and X communities, the movement is built on trust, transparency, and security. Backed by a SolidProof audit , FloppyPepe (FPPE) assures its users of its commitment to safety and openness. Additionally, 1% of every token transaction is burned to create scarcity, while redistribution rewards incentivize long-term holders. This dual mechanism gives profitability and stabilizes the token’s value as demand surges and supply dwindles. A crucial factor for sustained success in the AI crypto market. The buzz surrounding FloppyPepe (FPPE) is clear. Its private sale sold out in under 24 hours, and the ongoing presale at $0.0000002 continues to gain traction. This meteoric rise is not just about strategic investments; it’s about a vision for the future powered by community trust, technological advancement, and a unique approach to digital engagement.

Reallocation Tactics: From Ethereum (ETH) to AI Ventures The dynamics of the AI crypto market are witnessing a paradigm shift. A well-known Ethereum whale has made headlines by divesting 10,070 ETH—about $33 million at a small loss—indicating a rethink in strategy. Such transactions reveal a cautious approach toward Ethereum's (ETH) near-term growth, aligning with an emerging interest in AI assets, which are increasingly seen as the future of crypto investments. Contributing to this narrative is a notable Ethereum price dip, now at $2,639 . With analysts suggesting potential short-term stability concerns, the ongoing whale activity may further influence market trends. As focus shifts, FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerges as a promising target within this transitional environment. The Arrival of FloppyPepe (FPPE) in the AI Crypto Spotlight Among the new contenders in the AI crypto realm, AI agent coins are becoming significant players.

Addressing rumors circulating within the cryptocurrency community, Zhao explained that some whale investors may be providing liquidity to Bybit, but Binance itself is not involved in such transactions. “These are user transactions and Binance cannot take credit for them,” he said. Zhao had previously responded to a post highlighting Binance’s liquidity moves to Bybit with the phrase “Protect users, protect the industry.” The comment led to speculation that Binance was actively funding the rival exchange.

Its findings indicate that 86% of traders who bought the cryptocurrency collectively lost about $251 million, while a select group of winners walked away with at least $180 million in profits. A Rapid Rise and Fall LIBRA debuted on Valentine’s Day, gaining instant traction after Argentine President Javier Milei appeared to endorse it in a post on X that has since been deleted. The coin was framed as a financial tool to support small businesses in the Latin American country and to boost its economy. While its market cap quickly skyrocketed to an eye-popping $4.5 billion less than an hour after its introduction, the joy was short-lived. Soon after, Hayden Davis, a key figure behind the project, dismissed it as a meme token, contradicting its initial branding. This kicked off an almighty price plunge that erased much of the coin’s value, a situation that worsened when Milei took down his promotional post following increasing backlash. The head of state has since distanced himself from the token, claiming he had no prior knowledge of its details and suggesting that his social media post had been misinterpreted. There has also been suspicion of insider trading, with blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps sharing evidence linking LIBRA’s makers with the MELANIA token. While most people who bought the meme coin suffered huge losses, a handful of opportunists managed to capitalize on its volatility. Winners and Losers According to the Nansen report , two wallets bought and sold the asset in 43 minutes, raking in no less than $5.4 million. The biggest beneficiary in the fiasco reportedly walked away with $25 million, even though the figure is disputed. On-chain data suggests that some of the earlier traders, likely experienced snipers or automated bots, managed to exit before prices crashed, leaving retail investors to suffer most of the losses. Nansen’s analysis shows that only 2,101 wallets turned a profit, with more than 15,000 ending up in the red. Of the losers, the 15 worst-performing addresses allegedly lost a combined $33.7 million, with the biggest realized loss coming from Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. Interestingly, despite its massive slump, some traders kept buying and selling LIBRA, especially after a February 17 Milei tweet briefly reignited interest in the cryptocurrency and pushed up its price by 125%. However, the coin retraced all the gains in the following 24 hours, ensuring that most of those who participated in that post-hype period suffered losses. Per the report, there are over 1,000 wallets still holding the meme coin, with unrealized losses of about $11 million. Another 71 addresses are technically profitable, but their combined gains amounted to just $540,000 as of February 18.

Following a strong rally in early 2025, Solana price prediction models suggest the bulls may step in again and push the coin further by another 50-100% due to network expansion, increased DeFi adoption, and meme coin frenzy. However, while Solana’s growth looks promising, another project is making even bigger waves: Panshibi (SHIBI) . With its presale already surpassing $1,060,000 and projections of 50x returns, SHIBI is quickly emerging as one of the top-performing crypto assets of the year. But one question lingers: Could Panshibi outshine Solana in the next three months? Let’s break down both investment opportunities. Solana Price Prediction: Why Analysts Are Bullish Indeed, Solana’s recent bullish swing has caught the attention of investors, with price predictions showing a continued trajectory in the upward direction. Thanks to the following reasons: ● Enhancement of cross-chain and dApps support : Solana continues to attract new projects that rely on cross-chain and dApps functionalities to thrive, driving up the demand for SOL;● Lower transaction fees compared to ETH: Solana's cheap fees make it a popular choice among developers and dealers;● Increased institutional interest: Hedge funds and institutional investors are investing more capital in Solana-based initiatives;● Meme coin boom in Solana: Meme currencies on Solana, such as BONK, have generated a large trade volume, increasing SOL's value; With SOL hovering at the $170 price mark, several analysts predict a climb to $200 - $250 over the next three months. But what’s more, SOL’s performance is rubbing off on SHIBI such that it’s making heads turn, mainly due to its even greater development potential. Panshibi (SHIBI): The Presale Leading the Market With 50x Potential While SOL price prediction models suggest strong growth, SHIBI leads the charge with even bigger returns. And it’s due to several reasons: ● First, unlike SOL, which already has a $85.29 billion market cap, SHIBI is still in its early presale stage, meaning it has more room for exponential gains.● Second, SOL has over 500 million tokens in circulation, while SHIBI has a burn mechanism, ensuring scarcity and price appreciation. As always, limited supply equals higher long-term value.● Third, SHIBI holders can stake their tokens and earn up to 1,200% APY - that’s some insane staking rewards, something Solana investors don’t get.● Fourth, SHIBI is available at just $0.005 per token, offering an easy 50x potential before listing on major exchanges.● Fifth, unlike Solana, which has seen occasional network downtimes, SHIBI ensures security and stability with 10-year locked liquidity and 2-year locked team tokens. And the list goes on and on… Panshibi’s explosive presale and high staking rewards make it a prime investment for those looking for faster gains than SOL can provide. How to Join the SHIBI Train and Take Advantage of the Explosive Growth Solana investors are already shifting to SHIBI, targeting a 50x jump, higher staking rewards, and bigger short-term gains altogether. Meme coins like SHIBI have historically outperformed Layer 1 blockchains in early-stage growth. Here’s how to join them before the SHIBI presale ends: ● Visit the official website – Panshibi.com ● Connect your wallet – Ensure you have a compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet).● Buy SHIBI at the presale price of $0.005 – Secure your investment before the price rises.● Join the community – Stay updated with the latest announcements by following Panshibi on Twitter and joining the Telegram group . Note: SHIBI’s price will increase at every presale stage, meaning early buyers get the best value. Besides, the biggest gains in crypto come from early investments—SHIBI is that opportunity right now! In conclusion, yes, Solana Price Prediction shows the token is set to grow, but its gains may be limited to 50-100%. On the other hand, SHIBI's presale offers early buyers a potential 50x return before exchange listings.

Driven by a mix of technological advancement and increased adoption, Solana's position as a prominent blockchain platform looks to grow more robust. According to experts , the potential for SOL to further climb by 50-100% exists due to the expanding network and rising popularity in decentralized finance. The Unexpected Challenger: Panshibi's Meteoric Rise Meanwhile, another contender, Panshibi , is capturing investor attention through an impressive presale performance, promising substantial profits. Surpassing $1,060,000 in its initial phase, SHIBI presents a compelling narrative of high returns, potentially overshadowing Solana's gains. But what makes SHIBI a top choice, and can it truly outshine SOL? Solana: The Catalyst for Bullish Optimism Solana's recent positive momentum has piqued the interest of investors worldwide, thanks to several catalysts: ● Expansion of cross-chain and dApp support : Solana continues to draw new projects, enhancing demand for SOL with its versatile cross-chain capabilities and support for decentralized applications.● Cost-effective transactions: With lower fees compared to Ethereum, Solana is a favorite among developers.● Institutional backing: A surge of interest from hedge funds and institutional investors highlights growing confidence in Solana.● Meme coin activities: Solana-based meme coins have significantly impacted its trading volumes, contributing to SOL's rising value. Panshibi: The Presale Powerhouse Even as Solana gears up for continued growth, SHIBI's prospects look brighter, promising exceptional rewards: ● SHIBI is still at the nascent stage of its journey, offering more potential for explosive growth than established coins like SOL.● With fewer circulating tokens due to a burn mechanism, SHIBI ensures scarcity and potential price appreciation over time.● SHIBI's staking rewards, reaching up to 1,200% APY, outpace the benefits offered by Solana.● Priced at just $0.005 per token, SHIBI offers attractive returns before mainstream exchange listings.● Assured stability with locked liquidity for 10 years and team tokens for 2 years, reducing risks of network issues. Riding the SHIBI Wave: How to Get Involved As Solana investors pivot towards SHIBI in search of remarkable profits, here's a guide to securing your investment before the presale concludes: ● Visit the official site: Panshibi.com ● Set up your digital wallet: Ensure compatibility with wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet.● Purchase SHIBI at the presale rate of $0.005, securing your stake before prices climb.● Engage with the community: Stay informed via Twitter and join discussions on Telegram . While Solana promises solid growth, the potential of SHIBI lies in its nascent stage, offering early buyers the chance for a 50x return as it enters the wider market.

Among these rising stars is FloppyPepe (FPPE) , an AI token creating a stir by merging advanced technology with the engaging appeal of meme culture. The Rise of FloppyPepe (FPPE): Beyond Traditional Tokens FloppyPepe (FPPE) is carving out a niche in the competitive cryptocurrency market, marrying AI technology with the entertainment value of meme coins. This distinctive combination draws attention from both new investors and seasoned enthusiasts seeking more than conventional tokens. Unlike Solana (SOL) and Floki (FLOKI), known for their blockchain proficiency and meme popularity respectively, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out by providing practical utility alongside its entertainment factor. The flagship AI tool, FloppyX, is an innovative video agent facilitating user-created content through interactive polls and feedback, offering businesses and artists an engaging platform for audience connection. Complementing this is the Meme-o-Matic, an AI-driven text generator that crafts on-trend memes, making FloppyPepe a lively platform for creativity and engagement. Moreover, FloppyPepe (FPPE) employs a deflationary token model, redistributing and burning a percentage of each transaction to boost scarcity and reward loyal investors. A successful audit by SolidProof underpins its reliability, with the project's transparency further enhancing investor confidence. Its listing on CoinMarketCap and vibrant community engagement on platforms like X and Telegram signal a promising trajectory for FPPE. Solana (SOL): A Blockchain Powerhouse Facing New Rivals Solana (SOL) has gained reputation for its high-speed, scalable blockchain, becoming a formidable entity in the crypto world. Nonetheless, its struggle with issues like network congestion and an absence of AI integration present opportunities for FPPE to excel. The unique AI utilities of FloppyPepe position it favorably as the market gravitates toward technologically advanced solutions. Floki (FLOKI): The Meme Coin Challenged by Tech Advancements Floki (FLOKI) has established a strong community through meme-driven strategies but falls short in technological innovation. Unlike Floki, FloppyPepe's synthesis of AI capabilities with meme culture offers both novelty and potential for sustained growth. This dual focus grants FPPE a significant advantage over its peers, setting the stage for its dominance. Charting the Course: FloppyPepe's Journey Towards 2025 In the rapidly evolving realm of AI-centric tokens, FloppyPepe (FPPE) emerges as a frontrunner, with its potent mix of cutting-edge AI and vibrant meme culture. As investors rally behind this innovative token, its presale success indicates a promising rise. Positioned to outpace traditional cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL) and Floki (FLOKI), FPPE is on track for significant growth by June 2025. Early adopters are seizing the opportunity in the ongoing presale, acquiring tokens at the attractive rate of $0.0000002 each, anticipating substantial gains.

Among them is FloppyPepe (FPPE) , an AI token that is generating buzz for its potential to outpace established coins like Solana (SOL) and Floki (FLOKI). While Solana (SOL) has long been recognized for its blockchain capabilities, and Floki thrives on meme appeal, FloppyPepe (FPPE) offers something unique: a blend of AI technology and strong community engagement. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Merging AI Technology With Meme Coin Potential FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quickly distinguishing itself in the crowded meme coin market by blending AI technology with meme culture, offering both entertainment and real utility. Both novice investors and those seeking something more than a standard meme coin have taken notice of this unusual combination. Unlike typical meme coins like Solana (SOL) and Floki (FLOKI), this AI token offers two powerful features that set it apart. One of its key features is FloppyX, an AI-powered video agent that helps users create engaging video content with polls and feedback. In today's rapidly evolving digital world, this AI token provides businesses, artists, and brands with an entertaining and dynamic way to interact with their audience. The Meme-o-Matic, an AI text generator, allows users to create fresh and funny memes based on inputted text, giving it a real-time connection to the latest meme trends. With these qualities, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is certain to be more than simply another digital currency but rather a vibrant creative platform. In addition to these AI-powered resources, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is notable for its deflationary tokenomics. With every transaction, 1% of the tokens are redistributed to holders, and 1% is burned, reducing the overall supply and increasing scarcity over time. This tactic rewards devoted investors and creates a sense of urgency around the token. SolidProof's successful smart contract audit further supports the​​ long-term viability and profitability of the meme coin. This gives investors assurance about the project's honesty. The expanding FloppyPepe (FPPE) community and CoinMarketCap listing have also contributed to growing investor confidence in this AI token. FloppyPepe (FPPE) has established itself as a potential growth rival with impressive roadmap accomplishments and strong presale outcomes. This AI token's creation of waves on platforms like X and Telegram is evidence of this. This combination of cutting-edge technology, credibility, and strong community support positions the meme coin to outperform traditional assets like Solana (SOL) and Floki (FLOKI) in the coming months and years. Solana (SOL) Solana (SOL) has garnered attention for its speed and scalability, becoming a strong player in the blockchain space. However, it faces challenges like network congestion and a lack of focus on emerging technologies, especially AI. This positions FloppyPepe (FPPE) at an advantage, as its integration of AI tools such as FloppyX and Meme-o-Matic brings a unique combination of meme culture and real utility. As the market shifts towards AI-powered solutions, this AI token is well-positioned to thrive over Solana’s more traditional blockchain approach. Floki (FLOKI) Floki (FLOKI) is a popular meme coin that has built a strong community but struggles with real-world use cases. It lacks the technological advancement that AI tokens like FloppyPepe (FPPE) offer. While Floki (FLOKI) may continue to rely on viral trends, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) unique blend of AI technology and meme appeal gives it an edge for sustained growth and a larger investor base. This dual focus on creativity and community engagement sets FPPE apart from Solana (SOL) and Floki (FLOKI), preparing it to thrive where others may falter. FloppyPepe's (FPPE) Path To Outperformance By June 2025 As AI tokens become a driving force in crypto, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out with its unique blend of AI tools and meme culture. While Solana (SOL) and Floki (FLOKI) have their strengths, FPPE’s advancement positions it for greater growth. With strong community support, advanced tech, and increasing investor interest, this AI token is poised to surpass these rivals by June 2025. With savvy investors flooding into the ongoing presale and buying the token for just $0.0000002 per token, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale could yield massive gains before June 2025.

Solanahas seen healthy adoption, but most holders search for new opportunities as the price struggles to maintain consistent gains. Similarly, Cardano investors fed up with ADA's sluggish momentum are now eyeing a new altcoin that analysts call the new XRP. With institutional backing and amazing use cases, this rising crypto is rapidly becoming a top altcoin, attracting investors searching for something more stable than the Solana price swings. Cardano (ADA) Facing Key Price Test Cardano is at a crossroads, and market analysts anticipate a major price move. Ali Martinez, a crypto analyst, noted that ADA displays an ascending triangle pattern on its three-hour chart. Depending on how it reacts to key levels, this setup suggests a 24% price swing. Source: CoinMarketCap Martinez identified $0.74 and $0.83 as the main levels to watch. If Cardano breaks past $0.83, it could trigger a rally toward $1. If it falls below $0.74, it may drop to $0.56 as selling pressure. As Cardano struggles, many investors are moving to Remittix (RTX), an ERC-20 token gaining traction in its ICO. As investors seek stronger opportunities, RTX is emerging as an attractive option for those looking beyond ADA. Why Some Experts Believe the Solana Price Will Bounce Back The Solana price has been struggling while other layer-1 coins have begun to stabilize. SOLis down 9.1%, breaking below the $180 support level, leaving many traders frustrated after seeing it peak at $293 in January. The current downturn has raised concerns that the Solana price could remain under $200 for the next few months. One major factor weighing the Solana price is Argentina's ongoing $LIBRA controversy and political uncertainty. President Javier Milei's possible impeachment has created market jitters, and SOL has shown increased volatility. However, not everybody considers this a sign of sluggish decline as time passes. Several experts feel the Solana price might rebound strongly. Whales are withdrawing SOL out of exchanges, showing confidence in its future. While the Solana price struggles today, several experts see potential in its solid fundamentals and increasing institutional support. Traders eyeing long-term potential are tracking the Solana price as the latest market moves suggest whales are quietly purchasing SOL in anticipation of a turnaround. Source: CoinMarketCap The Solana price remains uncertain, but many Cardano (ADA) and Solana holders are looking for new investments. Instant crypto-to-FIAT conversions, lower transaction charges, and substantial institutional interest make RTX a more steady investment choice for people looking to diversify their portfolios. Remittix: Cross-Border Payments Redefined Remittix (RTX) simplifies international payments with live crypto-to-FIAT conversion. Users can immediately convert their cryptocurrencies into fiat money without enduring long processing procedures. Whether sending cash across borders or paying for services, Remittixremoves delays and simplifies the complexity of conventional remittance services. Its low fee structure is a key feature that makes Remittix affordable. Traditional remittance platforms charge high fees for cross-border transfers, but Remittix charges much less, so users save more money. Eliminating intermediaries and utilizing blockchain ensure a cheaper payment solution with Remittix. Remittix (RTX) takes privacy and security seriously—all transactions are encrypted and protected. Users keep complete control of their money and can transact knowing their financial and personal information is protected. This privacy-conscious attitude is unusual in an era when conventional payment systems track every transaction. The platform has a simple interface available to individuals with very little to no knowledge of cryptocurrency. Remittix built its platform to be intuitive so that even a complete novice could make payments or transfers effortlessly. This simplicity promotes wider adoption of crypto usage. Lastly, with its crypto debit card and wallet, Remittix hopes to connect conventional finance with crypto. Users can quickly spend their digital assets directly at any merchant that accepts Mastercard or Visa. This particular inclusion of crypto in daily spending means individuals can utilize their digital assets in real-life scenarios, making crypto more practical.

The regulator issued a Wells notice against OpenSea in August 2024, indicating it was planning on pursuing an enforcement action against it. The regulator alleged the platform may have been operating as an unregistered securities marketplace. The SEC’s move comes as the regulator is slated to vote on a deal negotiated with Coinbase to drop its lawsuit against the exchange , which is seen as a boon for the cryptocurrency industry and NFT creators. “This is a win for everyone who is creating and building in our space. Trying to classify NFTs as securities would have been a step backward—one that misinterprets the law and slows innovation,” Finzer posted . Reacting to Finzer’s post, Chris Akhavan, chief business officer of NFT marketplace Magic Eden, suggested it was a victory for the wider cryptocurrency space . “While we are competitors in the trenches, we share a deep belief in NFTs and what they will enable,” Akhavan wrote. The announcement led to an uptick in activity for the native token of NFT marketplace LooksRare. The token, LOOKS, saw a surge in active addresses shortly after the announcement that represents an “approximately fivefold increase compared to the usual figures,” according to data from TheTie.",Markets|OpenSea|NFT|SEC,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-22 15:35:01

They used the account to announce a fake meme coin launch, claiming it was the “national crypto of the Republic of Myanmar.” Within minutes, many fake meme tokens popped up, all claiming to be the official Myanmar meme coin. At least one of them— called MYANMAR—collapsed by 95% almost immediately after it launched. Screenshot of several now delated tweets by the potentially hacked X account of Myanmar’s Prime Minister. Source: X/Twitter The account , posing as the State Administration Council Chairman, made many now-deleted posts hyping the coin for hours. Despite warnings from the community, the account went ahead with its “launch” anyway, dropping this statement: “Today, we are launching $BIRMAS—an experiment designed to show how something as simple as a meme can unite people, support national development, and put the Republic of the Union of Myanmar on the world stage.” Weirdly enough, that post was deleted less than 10 minutes after it went up. Scammers have made a trend out of taking over high-profile political accounts to promote fraudulent tokens. Just two weeks earlier, hackers compromised the X account of Malaysia’s former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and used it to shill a fake MALAYSIA token. The project rug-pulled for $1.7 million, leaving investors empty-handed. In late January, the Cuban government’s official X account was also hacked. A fake “Official Cuba Coin” was launched, and like clockwork, it turned out to be a fraudulent cash grab. This is a developing story.

However, while the XRP price momentum is gaining attention, FloppyPepe (FPPE) , a new AI-driven meme token still in its presale, is stealing the spotlight. Analysts predict that as AI agent tokens gain traction, this new AI-driven meme token could surge 40,000% by year’s end, positioning it as one of the most anticipated crypto opportunities of the year. XRP Price Holds Strong Above Key Support Ripple (XRP) has remained firm above critical support levels, demonstrating resilience despite broader market weakness. Holding steady above $2, the current XRP price action suggests strength rather than vulnerability. Analysts say this sustained stability could set the stage for a new rally. Crypto analyst Dark Defender , for instance, predicted that the XRP price will reach a new all-time high (ATH) of $5. In an X post, he noted that once XRP clears the $2.90 resistance, it could advance toward the Fibonacci target of $5.85. Another major factor that could push Ripple’s XRP price to $5 is the ongoing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, which has been a key point of uncertainty for years. Recent developments suggest a possible resolution, and many analysts believe a Ripple victory could trigger a significant surge in the XRP price. The XRP price surge is undoubtedly exciting, but another opportunity investors should not miss is FloppyPepe (FPPE), the AI-driven meme token poised for a 40,000% surge by year-end. FloppyPepe (FPPE): AI-Driven Meme Token Poised For 40,000% Growth Meme coins have become some of the most explosive assets in the crypto market, with tokens like PEPE soaring to an $8 billion market cap in just months. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is set to follow suit, with analysts projecting the AI-driven meme token could offer 40,000% returns by year-end. However, unlike other Matt Furie-inspired tokens, this AI-driven meme token is built around AI agents, unleashing endless possibilities for real-world adoption and utility. This unique use case positions FloppyPepe (FPPE) for widespread adoption, setting it apart from other meme coins. Among its AI-driven technologies is FloppyX, the project's first AI video agent. This tool creates engaging video content using interactive polls, feedback, and prompts. The second major innovation is Meme-o-Matic, an AI-powered text agent that allows users to generate memes that can be monetized from text inputs and templates. Large investors who recognize the limitless potential of these AI-powered tools are accumulating the AI-driven token in significant quantities. Additionally, a famous analyst on YouTube caught the market's attention when he endorsed the AI-driven meme token to his audience of over a million subscribers. Another key driver in FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) potential 40,000% rally is its CEX and DEX listing strategy. With planned listings on Uniswap, Binance Smart Chain and others, the AI-driven meme token is set to gain increased liquidity and mainstream visibility, further fueling its growth. Adding to its credibility, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has secured a CoinMarketCap listing and successfully passed a smart contract audit by SolidProof, reinforcing its stability and security for long-term success. With its roots as a Matt Furie-inspired coin and its ties to the booming billion-dollar AI crypto agent market, analysts are bullish this AI-driven meme token is well-positioned for a 40,000% by year-end. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Presale: Your One Shot To Earning 40,000% With Less Than $1 While the XRP price is projected to reach $5, Ripple’s ongoing legal challenges could limit its potential. In contrast, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is gaining dominance in the rapidly expanding $20 billion AI crypto industry. With its cutting-edge AI video agent and innovative features, this AI-driven meme token offers investors real utility and many benefits, including referral bonuses and exclusive access to premium tools. As investors increasingly seek tangible value beyond memes, analysts anticipate FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) unique features and strong community back it for a 40,000% surge by year-end. With its low entry price of $0.0000002, savvy investors have a rare chance to get in early and become part of a global movement through the FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale.

Ripple has recently made headlines due to its resilience in the face of market challenges. Currently, the focus is on Ripple's potential to reach a significant milestone of $5. Yet, in an interesting twist, FloppyPepe (FPPE) , an emerging AI-driven meme token, is stirring the interest of investors and experts alike. Ripple's Firm Ground and Aspirations Ripple's journey has been marked by a steadfast hold on critical support levels. Its current price action above $2 indicates not just survival but potential for further growth. This has led analysts like Dark Defender to foresee a future where XRP hits $5, buoyed by the possibility of a favorable outcome in the ongoing legal tussle with the SEC. What captures attention is Ripple's possible surge beyond $5, a feat that might be catalyzed by the resolution of its legal battles, potentially unlocking a fresh wave of investor confidence. While Ripple’s future looks promising, the crypto world’s eyes are also on a different player: the AI-driven FloppyPepe, which is set to redefine the meme token landscape with substantial growth predictions. Emergence of FloppyPepe: A New Age of Meme Tokens In the meme coin sphere, where rapid and unexpected growth is common, FloppyPepe (FPPE) distinguishes itself. Notably, its innovative use of AI agents, which enables real-world applications, marks a significant evolution from its peers. This unique concept has led analysts to predict a staggering 40,000% increase by the year's end. Features like the AI video agent, FloppyX, and the text-based Meme-o-Matic, allow for creative content production, thereby generating revenue for its users. Discover more about FloppyPepe's trajectory . The engagement from major investors is amplified by endorsements from prominent figures on platforms such as YouTube , who advocate for the token's potential, reinforcing its credibility and anticipated market performance.

Despite the uncertainty, many traders remain bullish on DOGE’s potential, pointing to government efficiency efforts that could lower inflation and reignite investor confidence. While DOGE stands in the spotlight once again, another comedic token - Panshibi (SHIBI) , priced at $0.005 and over $1 million in raised funds - grabs the attention of speculators eager for bigger, faster gains. Elon Musk’s Efficiency Department Boosts Dogecoin Price Prediction The Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency has reportedly saved about $1 billion each day since its inception, aiming to combat financial irregularities totaling $4.7 trillion. This figure accounts for around 12% of net U.S. Debt and GDP combined. If the department keeps uncovering more misuse of taxpayer money, it could ease the government’s spending patterns, helping rein in inflation below 2.1%. Such a shift might prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in 2025, thereby ending the liquidity drought that has squeezed the crypto space. Some analysts tie these developments directly to a more upbeat Dogecoin Price Prediction, reasoning that DOGE often benefits when macroeconomic pressures ease. With inflation cooling and the Fed loosening monetary policy, the door may open for a robust rally in meme tokens. Dogecoin enthusiasts argue that once liquidity returns, DOGE’s popularity and long-standing presence could lead the next wave of comedic asset speculation. Nonetheless, skeptics warn that dog-themed coins rely heavily on social media surges so that lasting gains might need intense buy pressure rather than mere policy shifts. Growing Optimism Yet Shifting Meme Coin Focus While DOGE’s fans anticipate a possible price upswing, the meme coin market remains in flux and attention often moves to newer, flashier projects. This dynamic puts the spotlight on comedic tokens that provide tangible security or unique features. Even if inflation abates and liquidity improves, Dogecoin must still stand out among the countless alternatives. Observers highlight that the coin’s market cap near $37 billion provides stability but may limit potential multipliers for risk-hungry investors who prefer smaller caps. Amid these shifting preferences, some watchers see a changing tide. Any positive Dogecoin Price Prediction can trigger excitement among casual traders, drawing them back to DOGE’s brand familiarity. However, other comedic tokens now integrate advanced mechanics - from AI-based engagement to locked liquidity - allowing them to siphon off capital from older dog-themed coins. If DOGE fails to capitalize on a bullish environment, a portion of whale money could migrate to fresh comedic assets promising higher returns. Panshibi (SHIBI): A Prime Alternative at $0.005 While DOGE wrestles with big-picture economics, Panshibi (SHIBI) basks in early presale success, boasting over $1 million raised. This panda-themed token departs from typical canine imagery, targeting comedic flair plus stronger tokenomics. Liquidity is locked for ten years and the team tokens remain locked for two, aiming to prevent swift dumps. The contract has also been audited by Coinsult, encouraging meme coin fans who often worry about sudden “rug pull” scenarios. Crucial to Panshibi (SHIBI) is its AI-driven “social-fi” model, where holders can stake and engage in community quests. Early backers argue that such a setup stands a better chance of retaining user interest than dog coins reliant solely on fleeting hype. With the meme coin space ever-evolving, Panshibi’s structured approach might yield larger multipliers if comedic enthusiasm recharges, especially should Dogecoin Price Prediction chatter fail to deliver actual gains. Experts are tipping Panshibi to do a 50x after the presale stage and with the structured presale phase and amount raised, that prediction is looking more achievable. Conclusion An optimistic Dogecoin Price Prediction points to government cost-saving measures paving the way for liquidity and a potential DOGE rally. If inflation indeed eases and the Fed relaxes rates, Dogecoin could benefit from a market starved for comedic returns. Yet as whales scan for higher-upside plays, Panshibi (SHIBI) emerges as a major contender thanks to its locked liquidity, AI-based features and currently low market cap. While DOGE retains the backing of Elon Musk’s efficiency department narrative and deep-rooted brand recognition, Panshibi aims to carve out its own space through novelty and security. Whether Dogecoin reclaims the throne or Panshibi orchestrates the next big meme coin wave, crypto watchers are braced for a bullish shift if the macro landscape indeed improves. The stakes remain high and investors watch closely to see which comedic token seizes the limelight first.

Much of the excitement is spurred by strategic financial measures within the U.S., designed to streamline costs. Meanwhile, the crypto community is also paying attention to the burgeoning interest in Panshibi (SHIBI) , a new player in the market promising attractive returns and innovative features. The Musk Effect and Dogecoin's Prospects A notable factor influencing the optimism surrounding Dogecoin is the government-backed efficiency program led by none other than Elon Musk. This initiative has been significantly reducing wasteful expenditure, reportedly saving $1 billion daily. As inflation concerns ease and economic conditions stabilize, there is hope that the Federal Reserve might lower interest rates, potentially providing a favorable environment for cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin to flourish. This could set the stage for a resurgence in meme tokens, drawing on DOGE's enduring appeal. Navigating the Dynamic Meme Coin Arena Dogecoin supporters remain optimistic about its trajectory, yet the dynamic nature of meme coins keeps the market vibrant with new contenders. Market cap stability presents both opportunities and challenges for Dogecoin, as it stands against emerging alternatives offering fresh features. Amidst these shifts, Dogecoin's ability to maintain its dominance is contingent on innovation and adaptability. Panshibi's Innovative Approach and Market Potential Enter Panshibi (SHIBI), a token that diverges from the traditional canine-themed memes by embracing a panda motif. With an impressive presale milestone of over $1 million raised, Panshibi offers a unique proposition with features like locked liquidity and community-driven initiatives. Audited by Coinsult, the token aims to reassure investors wary of sudden collapses, enhancing trust through transparency and strategic planning. The cornerstone of Panshibi's appeal lies in its AI-enhanced community engagement, presenting a compelling case for sustained interest and potential for high returns. As the meme coin space evolves, Panshibi's structured strategies offer an attractive alternative to those seeking innovative opportunities. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Meme Coins? As the cryptocurrency landscape adapts to economic developments, Dogecoin and Panshibi exemplify the potential highs of comedic digital assets. While Dogecoin benefits from established recognition and macroeconomic factors, Panshibi attracts attention through novelty and robust tokenomics. The evolving conditions present a thrilling contest to see which will capture the imaginations and investments of the crypto world.

Traders Brace for a Sell-Off,https://coinpedia.org/news/litecoin-ltc-faces-25-crash-traders-brace-for-a-sell-off/,"The post Litecoin (LTC) Faces 25% Crash? Traders Brace for a Sell-Off appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Amid the ongoing market uncertainty, while the majority of cryptocurrencies are witnessing price recovery, Litecoin (LTC) is poised for a massive price drop. The potential reason for this bearish speculation is the formation of negative price action and traders’ bearish sentiment, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass. Current Price Momentum LTC is currently trading near $127 and has experienced a price drop of over 6% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume declined by 23% due to its bearish price momentum, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. Litecoin (LTC) Technical Analysis and Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, LTC appears bearish as it has been moving within a parallel channel pattern between $95 and $141 since November 2024. Despite bearish market sentiment in the past few days, LTC’s price has surged nearly 38%, rising from $95 to $141. However, it is now experiencing selling pressure due to its history of price drops and the current market sentiment. Source: Trading View Based on historical patterns, if LTC fails to break above the $141 level, there is a strong possibility it could drop by 25% to reach the $95 support level. Currently, the asset is trading above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating that LTC is in an uptrend. Mixed On-Chain Metrics When examining the current market sentiment and price at the reversal level, intraday traders appear to be betting on the bearish side, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from the exchange liquidation map shows that traders betting on the short side are over-leveraged at the $141.5 level and have built $67 million worth of short positions in the past week. Meanwhile, traders betting on the long side seem exhausted, having built only $21 million worth of long positions. Source: Coinglass These over-leveraged positions reflect the sentiment of both short and long traders, as some believe the price won’t break above that level. If it does, these positions will be liquidated. Despite LTC’s bearish outlook, investors and long-term holders seem to be accumulating the token. Data from spot inflow/outflow reveals that exchanges have witnessed an outflow of $9.41 million worth of LTC tokens in the past 24 hours, indicating potential accumulation. Source: Coinglass When combining these on-chain metrics with technical analysis, it appears that short-term players are bearish, expecting the price to decline in the coming days. Meanwhile, long-term holders seem to be taking advantage of the price drop and are significantly accumulating the token.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|LTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 15:49:05

XRP surged overnight on expectations that the world’s first spot ETF tracking the cryptocurrency could soon begin trading in Brazil. XRP price, currently trading around $2.70 . Recent data from Whale Alert, a prominent on-chain transaction monitoring platform, revealed that an XRP investor has acquired 20 million tokens—valued at approximately $50.65 million—from the Gemini exchange. This large-scale purchase has ignited speculation within the XRP community. While XRP is shooting for an all-time high with institutional interest and regulatory winds at its back, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) —a hot new utility meme coin—is rapidly gaining traction. Its Yeti Go Play-to-Earn (P2E) game and strong tokenomics have gotten early participants 100% returns in its presale stages. Analysts Say XRP Could Rally Towards $5 and Above XRP has experienced notable growth, currently trading around $2.70. Analysts, including Arthur Azizov, foresee XRP reaching $5 to $7 in the first half of 2025, with potential highs up to $30 if it captures a portion of the global foreign exchange market.

XRP, a cryptocurrency specifically tailored for rapid and cost-effective cross-border transactions, holds promise in global finance. The extent of adoption and Ripple’s strides in forging strategic partnerships are pivotal in shaping XRP’s value trajectory. As with any investment, the outlook for XRP remains uncertain, necessitating a cautious approach and thorough due diligence. Why is XRP up? The XRP/USD crypto pair price has increased as the buying influx was abruptly taken, recovering the price to $2.587. The RSI rose to 47.17; side by side, the continual upside in the past week has led to a substantial gain. How much will XRP cost in 2025? XRP is expected to trade at an average price of $4.50 by the end of 2025. Will XRP reach $5? For XRP to reach $5, its value would need to double. Considering the current bullish trend and XRP’s price action, a surge to $5 by the end of this year is not entirely out of the question, particularly if demand for XRP tokens continues to rise and its growth trajectory remains consistent. However, it’s crucial to remember that XRP’s all-time high stands at $3.84, achieved on January 7, 2018. Can XRP reach $20? According to Ripple’s price prediction, XRP has a high chance of reaching $20 by 2030. It is expected to reach this level if the XRP ecosystem adoption by major financial institutions continues, which still makes it a good option to buy XRP. Will XRP reach $100 dollars? Though there are rumors of XRP reaching $100 in the market, and some pro-XRP analysts are also promoting it, many are raising questions about this possibility. XRP may not reach $100 in the near future, at least. Will XRP reach $1000? If one XRP coin is worth $1000, its market cap must be more than $100 trillion. Comparatively, the total global stock market cap is about $110 trillion. Therefore, it is unlikely that XRP will reach $1000, based on current market dynamics. Does XRP have a good long-term future? XRP is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years, giving good yields to XRP holders and institutional investors. The coin is trading at five times its value from last year, and it is expected to reach the highest price of $23.41 by 2031. This makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains after significant market capitalization with continuous efforts by Ripple Labs. However, regulatory uncertainties still linger with the Ripple lawsuit. Considering these factors, investors must carry out their own research. Recent news/opinions on the Ripple Network XRP is one of the most trending cryptocurrencies at the moment.

XRP historic price sentiment Before 2017, the asset’s value hovered around $0.01; in April 2017, it rose to $0.05; the gradual climb soon continued as it reached $0.25 in May, showing a positive price action as Ripple continued to excel. XRP price history Towards the end of 2019, XRP price stabilized at around $0.30 and did not cross the $0.5 mark throughout the year. However, the bullish run of 2020 pushed the coin’s value to a peak price of $0.8, gaining investor interest before finishing the year at $0.66. Early 2021 was supposed to be bullish for XRP, but the SEC announced a lawsuit that derailed investors. Nonetheless, XRP beat the odds and surged above $1.5 during the year, but by 2022 it plummeted significantly to as low as $0.31. XRP started 2023 at $0.335, and on July 13, it almost doubled its value in a steep spike. It shot from $0.470 to $0.814 while swinging towards $0.9 for a few hours. A partial victory against the SEC triggered the price jump, surging the trading volume. XRP closed 2023 at about $0.62. In 2024, XRP has so far ridden the market wave. The bears earlier on and then a bullish price movement by mid-March resulted in a market price of $0.72, according to data from the cryptocurrency market. In July, XRP traded between $0.418 and $0.658, showing a good recovery. However, the coin went under bearish pressure at the start of August, falling back down to the $0.550 range as per crypto market records showing high volatility. In September 2024, XRP recovered up to the $0.642 level, but the price went down to the $0.500 range in October. A tremendous bullish impulse was observed in November when XRP touched the $1.96 mark, and it reached $2.72 on December 2, 2024. In January 2025, XRP achieved a peak price of $3.19 and is trading near the $2.90 level in February.",Crypto Price Predictions|Ripple|XRP,EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|REGULATION|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-22 15:56:08

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) and XRP (XRP) are two projects analysts believe could surpass ETH in February 2025. XRP continues to expand its role in global payments, while Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing DeFi with its decentralized lending model. With a rapidly growing ecosystem and a successful early fundraising round, Mutuum Finance is drawing attention from investors looking for high-growth opportunities. As both projects strengthen their market presence, many see them as top contenders for significant gains in the months ahead. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is establishing itself as a standout project in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Unlike many altcoins that rely on speculation, Mutuum Finance is building a practical financial ecosystem where users can lend, borrow, and earn passive income through an automated smart contract system. By eliminating the need for intermediaries, the platform offers a seamless lending experience while ensuring fair interest rates for both suppliers and borrowers. When users supply assets to Mutuum Finance, they receive mtTokens (such as mtETH or mtDAI) in return. These tokens represent deposits and automatically accrue interest over time, increasing their redemption value without requiring active trading. This system allows lenders to grow their holdings while maintaining full control over their assets. A key feature of Mutuum Finance is its overcollateralized stablecoin, which provides users with a secure borrowing option. This stablecoin is backed by on-chain assets, maintaining its value through a self-regulating mechanism. Borrowers can mint it by locking up crypto as collateral, and when loans are repaid, the stablecoin is burned, keeping supply and demand balanced. This system allows users to access liquidity without needing to sell their holdings, preserving their investment potential while benefiting from the platform’s lending opportunities. Mutuum Finance’s buy-and-distribute mechanism further strengthens the token’s value by using a portion of the platform’s revenue to repurchase MUTM from the market. These tokens are then distributed to mtToken stakers, rewarding long-term participants and creating sustained buy pressure. This approach not only supports price stability but also incentivizes users to remain engaged in the ecosystem As Mutuum Finance prepares for its token launch and planned exchange listings, anticipation continues to build. Exchange availability will increase accessibility, driving further demand for MUTM. With growing investor interest and a clear roadmap, the project is positioned to attract both DeFi users and long-term investors looking for real-world utility. The project’s rapid presale success has also fueled investor confidence. Raising over $1 million in its early funding phase, Mutuum Finance has demonstrated strong demand among retail and institutional buyers alike. As the platform nears its token launch and planned exchange listings, many investors view MUTM as a promising altcoin that could see significant price appreciation in 2025. Ripple (XRP) XRP has remained a key player in the crypto market, known for its role in cross-border payments and institutional partnerships. Its adoption has steadily grown, with financial institutions using Ripple’s technology to facilitate faster and cheaper transactions. Despite its strong presence, XRP’s price movements have often been influenced by regulatory challenges and broader market conditions, leaving some investors uncertain about its long-term growth potential. While XRP continues to expand within the payments sector, many investors are exploring new opportunities that offer more diverse use cases. Mutuum Finance is gaining attention as a strong alternative, providing a decentralized lending ecosystem with real financial applications. With its ability to generate passive income, an overcollateralized stablecoin, and growing investor demand, Mutuum Finance appears to be a more attractive choice for those seeking higher returns in 2025.

Positioned as a next-generation meme token, #Pepeto is rapidly gaining traction and could even surpass the popularity of Pepe (PEPE). With a structured presale, strong tokenomics, and speculation of a Binance listing, Pepeto has become a major talking point among crypto investors. Pepeto: The Next 100x Memecoin is Trending The rise of meme coins has reshaped the digital asset space, with Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and #Pepe (PEPE) leading the charge. Now, Pepeto has entered the scene with a unique approach, blending meme culture with a structured ecosystem. Unlike Pepe, which relied purely on meme appeal, Pepeto introduces elaborate lore, a strong utility-driven platform, and a strategic tokenomics model. A key factor driving its popularity is its narrative. #Pepeto is not just another meme coin—it is backed by six core principles that guide its mission: Power (P), Energy (E), Precision (P), Efficiency (E), Technology (T), and Optimization (O). These six elements are woven into Pepeto’s branding, creating a cult-like community that believes in its superiority over other meme coins. This approach has contributed to strong community engagement, a critical factor in meme coin success. Pepeto’s Ecosystem and Features Beyond its meme-driven appeal, Pepeto offers a range of features that give it utility beyond speculation. PepetoSwap: A decentralized exchange (DEX) allowing users to trade Pepeto and other tokens seamlessly. Staking: Holders can stake their tokens to earn rewards , with an annual percentage yield (APY) of 380%, attracting long-term investors. Bridge: A cross-chain bridge enabling users to transfer Pepeto between different blockchains, increasing accessibility and liquidity. These features set Pepeto apart from traditional meme coins, aligning it more closely with functional ecosystems like Shiba Inu’s ShibaSwap. Additionally, Pepeto’s well-structured tokenomics ensure liquidity, long-term engagement, and project sustainability. The distribution of its total supply is as follows: 30% is allocated to the presale, providing liquidity, while another 30% funds staking rewards (380% APY). 20% supports marketing, 7.5% goes to project development, and 12.5% maintains liquidity for smooth trading. This balanced distribution fosters long-term stability and investor engagement. This balanced allocation ensures that Pepeto remains liquid, well-marketed, and development-focused. Pepeto’s Presale and Market Excitement Pepeto’s presale has generated significant interest, garnering over $4.5 million, with early investors betting on its potential for massive gains. Social media platforms like X, YouTube, Telegram, and Reddit have been crucial in spreading the word. Influencer endorsements and viral marketing have further fueled speculation that Pepeto could become a 100x meme coin once it hits major exchanges. True power does not lie in fleeting trends, but in the perfect timing and unshakable context of adoption. The year 2025 will reveal those who waited, watched, and seized the moment - PEPETO, The God of Frogs.🔗 : https://t.co/uo5vOks5PH pic.twitter.com/pOsqByfLhA — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) February 15, 2025 A potential Binance listing is one of the biggest drivers of interest in #Pepeto. Although there has been no official confirmation, several indicators suggest it could happen. Community Engagement: Binance often considers the strength of a project’s community before listing a new token, and Pepeto has built an active following. Liquidity and Trading Volume: Pepeto could generate enough trading volume to meet Binance’s listing criteria if the presale momentum continues. Past Binance Listings: Meme coins like PEPE and FLOKI have successfully secured spots on Binance, making it likely that Pepeto could follow suit. Even if Binance does not list Pepeto immediately, the project is expected to secure listings on other tier-1 and tier-2 exchanges, further boosting its visibility. While meme coins are often seen as high-risk, high-reward investments, Pepeto’s structured approach, strong utility, and well-planned tokenomics make it stand out. With a compelling narrative, an ongoing presale, and rumors of a Binance listing, Pepeto has emerged as one of the most promising meme coins of 2024. About Pepeto Pepeto is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency project blending the playful spirit of memecoins with a powerful utility-driven ecosystem. It features a zero-fee exchange, a cross-chain bridge for seamless swaps, and staking rewards designed to support the next generation of tokens.

Amidst this buzzing market, Pepeto (PEPETO) is beginning to create waves, garnering comparisons with famed tokens like Pepe (PEPE). By integrating elements of meme culture with substantial utility, Pepeto is positioning itself as a promising new contender that could redefine the meme coin narrative. Pepeto's Entry into the Cryptocurrency Mainstream The world of cryptocurrency has been significantly reshaped by the advent of memecoins, with iconic names such as Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) becoming household names. Pepeto seeks to carve out its niche in this space by marrying humor with a well-planned ecosystem. Departing from the path taken by its predecessor, Pepe, which thrived solely on its meme allure, Pepeto brings to the table a complex storyline and a robust platform underpinned by strategic tokenomics. Central to Pepeto's identity is a set of guiding principles captured by its name: Power, Energy, Precision, Efficiency, Technology, and Optimization. This multifaceted approach has garnered it a devoted following, lending strength to its campaign for dominance in the meme coin sector. The Extensive World of Pepeto Pepeto distinguishes itself by not just being a symbol of culture but by delivering a suite of features designed for practical use. PepetoSwap offers users a decentralized platform to exchange Pepeto along with other digital tokens, aiming for a user-friendly experience. Through staking , token holders are invited to participate in long-term growth by receiving substantial returns, boasting an annual yield of 380%. The cross-chain bridge promotes interconnectivity by allowing Pepeto to be transferred seamlessly across various blockchain platforms. These tools elevate Pepeto beyond a mere meme token, suggesting a potential transition toward being akin to ecosystems like Shiba Inu’s ShibaSwap. Pepeto's tokenomics blueprint supports sustained market engagement and growth. Its careful distribution dedicates 30% to presale initiatives and another 30% towards staking rewards, among other allocations. This strategy aims to anchor its financial stability while spurring community involvement. A Surge of Enthusiasm Surrounding Pepeto's Launch The current presale phase has seen monumental interest, raising upwards of $4.5 million. This funding spike reflects an investor belief in Pepeto’s potential trajectory. Platforms such as X, YouTube, Telegram, and Reddit have been instrumental in propelling the Pepeto narrative forward. Viral marketing initiatives and influencers have catalyzed the speculated notion that Pepeto could mimic the skyrocketing success of past memecoins once it becomes available on broader platforms. True power does not lie in fleeting trends, but in the perfect timing and unshakable context of adoption. The year 2025 will reveal those who waited, watched, and seized the moment - PEPETO, The God of Frogs.🔗 : https://t.co/uo5vOks5PH pic.twitter.com/pOsqByfLhA — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) February 15, 2025 Among the factors stirring community interest is the potential for a Binance listing. While still speculative, several hints suggest such a development could be on the horizon. A strong community could align with Binance's listing requirements, given the robust following Pepeto has established. The continuation of its presale momentum might lead to sufficient trading activity to fulfill criteria necessary for exchange listings. Historical trends reveal Binance's openness to memecoins, evident in past listings, which could bode well for Pepeto’s prospects. Even if the Binance listing remains speculative, Pepeto is anticipated to make appearances on other notable exchanges, ensuring its continued visibility and market presence. Though the meme coin sector remains fraught with risk, Pepeto stands apart due to its comprehensive approach and ambition to combine entertainment with tangible utility. As it progresses, its story may indeed become one of the defining narratives of the cryptocurrency market's future.

40691898,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/solana-set-to-revert-back-to-120-chart-pattern-shows-more-pain-to-come,1740240069,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/40691898.jpeg,Solana Set to Revert Back to $120? Chart Pattern Shows More Pain to Come,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/02/solana-set-to-revert-back-to-120-chart-pattern-shows-more-pain-to-come,"Solana (SOL) has not avoided the ongoing instability that continues to affect the crypto market. Analysts predict a price adjustment for the Solana price because its recent values encountered selling pressure. Some analysts project the Solana price to fall to $120 before initiating another rally despite long-term positive market sentiment generated by DeFi and NFT contributions. Solana Price Faces Heavy Selling Pressure Solana (SOL) stands as the top-performing Layer-1 blockchain network since it enables faster transaction speeds than Ethereum. Recent market activities show that SOL is losing momentum. Analysts speculate that the falling Solana price is related to the declining SOL meme coin market. Traders are focused on two descending triangle patterns forming on both the daily and 4-hour charts because such forms usually signal an imminent price drop. Market analysts expect the Solana price to decline to $120 as selling pressure remains intense. Additionally, any Bitcoin bearish movement will generate quick downward momentum in SOL. The Role of SOL’s Ecosystem in Price Stability The blockchain industry recognizes Solana as a powerful participant even though it faces current market challenges. The blockchain operates efficiently through thousands of instantaneous transactions while charging minimal fees which makes developers choose SOL for developing their decentralized applications (dApps). Additionally, Solana was in the news for the recent stability of its network. The SOL network hasn’t experienced an outage for more than a year. This has been a cause for celebration, yet analysts are increasingly warning investors that the Solana price may fall below the $120 mark in the near future. DTX Exchange: A Rising Contender in Hybrid Trading A new blockchain-powered trading platform named DTX Exchange takes investor interest because of its disruptive hybrid exchange model. While SOL continues to slip, DTX Exchange enables users to access a combined traditional finance and decentralized finance platform to allow users to trade over 120,000 assets in one platform. The innovative Layer-1 blockchain VulcanX on DTX enables users to exchange crypto, stocks, ETFs, forex, commodities, and oil derivatives in a non-custodial wallet. Through this innovative method, many investors have found the DTX platform very appealing. Having attracted over $14.8 million in presale, DTX Exchange is in the last phase before its debut on Tier-1 exchanges. Having been audited by SolidProof, investors are confident in the future of DTX tokens . Priced at $0.18, they are one of the most undervalued altcoins on the market. The Explosive Growth Potential of DTX Tokens The early development phase of DTX Exchange lets investors take advantage of greater earnings potential than the Solana price. Industry analysts predict the presale phase will deliver a 100x boost after launch once adoption increases significantly. If DTX Exchange were to reach a tenth of the market cap of SOL, each DTX token would bring investors over 9,300% ROI. DTX Exchange stands out from typical exchanges through its features which include no KYC, rapid execution speed and minimal transaction costs thereby challenging established centralized and decentralized environments. Among the factors driving demand for DTX tokens exists the governance framework of the platform. Users who own platform tokens receive voting authority and share in earnings which encourages them to keep using the system. Solana vs. DTX Exchange: Which One Offers Better Returns? Blockchain developers, together with NFT traders, continue to choose SOL, yet the platform is facing increased competition. Many recognize that Solana has a strong TPS speed, however DTX stands out by providing over 200,000 transactions per second, compared to SOL’s 65,000. Additionally, experts point out that Solana’s price is capped because of its large market cap. DTX Exchange, on the other hand, offers a lower entry price and significantly higher growth potential because it has no bull run history.

Top 20 Cryptocurrencies in Red Despite Bybit Hack Response After a week of steady gains, the cryptocurrency market plunged on Friday following the $1.4 billion Bybit hack. The exploit, linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group—implicated in breaches of Atomic Wallet , and Harmony’s Horizon Bridge —which sparked broad sell-offs in recent years. In quick response, Bybit CEO Ben Zhou confirmed that the breach affected only one Ethereum cold wallet, with all other wallets and withdrawals remaining unaffected. In an attempt to stabilize market confidence, Binance sent 50,000 ETH in emergency liquidity support to Bybit. Zhou also reassured users, stating that user funds are safe for withdrawals. “Bybit hot wallets, warm wallets, and all other cold wallets are fine. The only cold wallet that was hacked was ETH cold wallet. ALL withdrawals are NORMAL.” – Ben Zhuo, ByBit CEO, Feb 21, 2025 Despite these efforts, traders remained cautious, with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana posting some of the deepest losses. Cryptocurrency Market Performance after Bybit Hack. Feb 22, 2025 | Source: Coingecko At press time on Saturday, Bitcoin traded at $96,671, marking a 2.4% decline in 24 hours, while Ethereum slipped to $2,736, reflecting a 2.9% drop. Solana extended its losses, plunging 3.0% to $173, bringing its weekly decline to 11.2%. The global cryptocurrency market capitalization currently stands at $3.31 trillion, representing a $75 billion drop, or 4.3%, over the past day. Despite Binance’s emergency liquidity support, trading volume has surged to $148.5 billion, signaling that selling pressure remains elevated as traders move assets, seeking safety amid market uncertainty. This heightened activity suggests further downside risk as investors reassess exposure in response to the Bybit exploit. Derivatives Traders Bet on BGB, TON, and XMR for a Rebound While most cryptocurrencies remain under selling pressure, derivatives data suggests that select traders are positioning for a market recovery. Coinglass liquidation heatmaps reveal a surge in leveraged long positions on BGB, TON, and XMR, with open interest on these assets outpacing broader market trends. Futures market data shows traders accumulating long positions in these three assets despite the downturn, betting on their resilience. XMR, known for its privacy features, often sees demand rise during periods of regulatory scrutiny or hacking incidents. TON, backed by Telegram, has gained traction among retail traders, while BGB, Bybit’s native token, is drawing interest following the exchange’s swift response to the hack. If sentiment improves, these leveraged bets could accelerate gains in the coming trading sessions, setting the stage for a potential relief rally. Bitget (BGB) Traders Mount $3.4M Leverage, Anticipating Profits from Bybit Losses While all top 20 ranked cryptocurrencies are trending in red, Bitget’s native token, BGB, has defied market pressure, rallying 8% in the last 24 hours amid the broader crypto downturn. This surge comes as derivatives traders aggressively accumulate leveraged long positions, betting on BGB’s outperformance in the wake of the Bybit hack. The latest liquidation heatmap data reveals that speculative traders have played a pivotal role in BGB’s ascent. Bullish traders have mounted $3.4 million in long leverage positions, exceeding the $2.5 million in short positions by 36%. This clear bullish dominance emphasizes traders’ confidence in BGB’s ability to capitalize on shifting exchange dynamics. Bitget (BGB) Liquidation Map, Feb 22, 2025 | Coinglass Historically, exchange hacks have triggered asset migrations as disillusioned users seek safer alternatives. Given Bybit’s recent breach, a significant portion of its clientele may choose to withdraw funds and seek refuge on competing platforms. Bitget, a similarly sized exchange with global reach and regulatory compliance, stands poised to absorb this outflow. As new users flock to Bitget, demand for BGB could rise, given its utility in trading fee discounts and staking benefits. This potential influx of users explains why bullish traders have committed substantial leveraged capital to BGB, anticipating that an increase in Bitget’s market share could directly translate into heightened demand for its native token. At press time, the Bitget token price has stabilized above the $4.90 mark. If this scenario materializes, BGB price could attract further speculative interest, potentially propelling a breakout above the $5 territory. Toncoin (TON) and Monero (XMR) Bulls Maintain Dominance Over Short Traders Beyond Bitget’s native token, the Bybit hack has also fueled bullish sentiment in privacy-focused and decentralized blockchain projects. Historically, major centralized exchange breaches have sparked increased interest in privacy-resistant assets, as traders hedge against security vulnerabilities. Coinglass data reveals a surge in leveraged long positions for Toncoin (TON) and Monero (XMR) within Toncoin (TON) vs. Monero (XMR) Liquidation Map 24 hours of the Bybit exploit. Traders appear to be positioning for sustained demand growth, as confidence in centralized platforms wavers. Toncoin price tumbled as low as $3.5 after the hack. However, within 24 hours, bull traders have taken control of derivatives markets, accumulating $3.4 million in active long positions, outpacing the $2.5 million in short interest by 36%. This strong bullish positioning suggests that traders anticipate TON’s continued adoption, particularly among retail investors leveraging Telegram’s ecosystem. Monero (XMR), long regarded as a safe haven for privacy-conscious users, has seen a similar dynamic play out. Long positions on XMR have reached $1.02 million, surpassing short interest of $945,000 by 8%. This sustained long dominance signals that traders expect Monero’s utility to grow as security concerns drive demand for privacy-preserving transactions. The Bybit hack has once again exposed the vulnerabilities of centralized exchanges, leading traders to recalibrate risk strategies. While security concerns mount, privacy coins and Bybit’s rival exchanges appear well-positioned to benefit from the flight-to-safety narrative, as evidenced by traders placing rebound bets on BGB, TON, and XMR in the aftermath of the hack.

This approval will bode well for XRP price but crypto traders are looking for the top XRP rivals that could outperform it and possibly rally by 100x. This analysis explores the three best XRP rivals that could rally by 100 times ahead of Ripple’s ETF approval deadline. XRP Rivals to Buy: 3 Cryptos That Could Rally 100X XRP rivals are poised to benefit from XRP’s rally if the SEC approves an ETF in the coming months. Here are three coins poised for explosive 100x gains. Stellar (XLM) Stellar (XLM) experienced an impressive rally in late 2024 that saw the price rally by more than 500% between November and December. This suggests that in case of an XRP ETF approval, Stellar, which is one of Ripple’s greatest rivals in the crypto payments industry, could experience a 100x gain. XLM traded at $0.33 at the time of writing after a 4% drop caused by a pullback across the broader crypto market. Despite this decline, XLM’s market dominance has not dropped as it ranks as the 14th largest crypto by market capitalization. On the daily chart, XLM’s on-balance volume (OBV) remains elevated suggesting that despite the price decline, demand for the token has not dried up. If the buying sentiment remains, XLM could aim for the 161.8% Fibonacci level at $0.87. XLM/USDT: 1-day Chart Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin is also a major XRP rival to buy because it is among the contenders for a spot ETF. Moreover, unlike XRP, DOGE has a clear regulatory standing with the SEC, making it likely that its ETF could receive approval sooner. Dogecoin traded at $0.24 at press time, with bearish pressure leading to a 5% decline in 24 hours. Despite the recent decline, DOGE price continues to trade within an ascending parallel channel on the weekly chart, which shows the likelihood of a bullish continuation. According to analyst Ali Charts , DOGE needs to hold support between the $0.16 and $0.19 price levels. If this support can hold, the Dogecoin price prediction suggests a rally towards $3, making it one of the top XRP competitors to buy for 100x gains. Dogecoin Chart Cardano (ADA) Cardano price has rallied by 29% over the past year, highlighting a positive outlook on the token that makes it one of the top XRP rivals that could 100x. Despite dropping by 4% in 24 hours to trade at $0.768, at press time, ADA was still defending a multi-month support level at $0.70. ADA price faces an immediate resistance level at the 38.2% Fibonacci level of $0.82. The price has been rejected from this resistance level severally due to reduced retail interest. However, if buyer demand can rise again, and a breakout occurs, Cardano could rally past $1 to the 161.8% Fib level of $1.83. ADA/USDT: 1-day Chart Several bullish triggers could spark the resumption of an uptrend.

Shiba Inu’s astonishing rise turned ordinary investors into millionaires, highlighting the immense potential of meme coins. Once considered one of the best presales to be a part of, Shiba surged from almost nothing to an impressive $9.3 billion market cap. During its peak, it provided returns over 1000x, marking its place in crypto history. A well-known early investor, ""Shibtoshi,"" gained attention after transforming a $95,000 investment in SHIB into an incredible $37 million. This illustrates the huge profit potential of entering meme coins early. Similar success stories have emerged with other meme coins like Pepe, Dogecoin, Floki, dogwifhat, and even Trump tokens. Now, the hunt is on for the next meme coin capable of delivering similar success. However, with Shiba's current price at $0.00001578 and a massive circulating supply of 589.25 trillion SHIB, it’s unlikely to see the same explosive growth again. Although listed on major exchanges like Binance, its market cap is now too large to expect another 1000x increase. As a result, investors are turning their attention to newer, high-potential projects with more room for significant growth. Pepeto – The Next Big Meme Coin A project generating a lot of buzz is Pepeto , often compared to PEPE, the top meme coin of the last bull run. With its presale price currently set at just $0.000000112 , Pepeto is still in its early stages, presenting a prime opportunity for those looking to maximize their investment potential. Pepeto isn’t just another meme token—it has an intriguing backstory, positioning itself as the authentic Pepe, aiming to correct past mistakes while advancing the meme coin legacy. The speculation that a former PEPE co-founder is behind the project has fueled even more excitement, and the growing community is adding to the hype across social media platforms. Pepeto’s Revolutionary Ecosystem – More Than Just Hype What truly distinguishes Pepeto is its innovative ecosystem. The PepetoSwap platform offers zero-fee trading, presenting a groundbreaking solution to the costly fees typically associated with traditional exchanges. Furthermore, Pepeto is working on its own Pepeto Exchange, designed to improve liquidity and reduce slippage, providing an enhanced trading experience.

Could Pepeto Follow in Shiba’s Footsteps? The excitement around Pepeto is rapidly growing, particularly with increasing speculation about its upcoming exchange listings. With a total supply of 420 trillion tokens—matching the original PEPE—many believe Pepeto has the perfect setup for a massive launch. Given its early-stage valuation and growing momentum in the meme coin space, Pepeto offers a unique opportunity for investors looking to get in early before the next big surge.

The exchange is offering 10% of recovered funds as a reward, which could amount to $140 million in the case of full recovery. The initiative invites cybersecurity experts and blockchain analysts to assist in identifying and retrieving the stolen assets. Bybit’s $140M Recovery Bounty and Response Bybit has officially launched a Recovery Bounty Program, promising 10% of recovered funds to ethical hackers, cybersecurity experts, and blockchain analysts who contribute to fund retrieval efforts. The total amount of stolen funds is valued at over $1.4 billion, making this one of the largest crypto thefts ever recorded. Bybit’s co-founder and CEO, Ben Zhou, acknowledged the industry’s support in response to the breach. “Within 24 hours of the event, we were overwhelmed with support from some of the best people and organizations in the industry,” he said. Zhou emphasized that Bybit is committed to strengthening its security measures, improving liquidity, and working closely with the crypto community to prevent future breaches. The company has also engaged with partners, including Galaxy Digital, FalconX, and blockchain security firms, to assist in the recovery process. Bybit recently spent $100 million USDT to purchase 36,893 ETH at $2,711 per ETH through over-the-counter (OTC) trades with Galaxy Digital and FalconX. Lazarus Group’s Involvement and Ongoing Investigations Blockchain investigators, including ZachXBT and Arkham Intelligence, have provided evidence linking the Bybit hack to the North Korean-affiliated Lazarus Group . Their research shows that the attackers used test transactions and laundering methods similar to those seen in previous incidents. Arkham confirmed that ZachXBT submitted definitive proof, identifying the Lazarus Group as the perpetrators. The group has been responsible for several high-profile crypto attacks, including those on Axie Infinity’s Ronin Bridge and Harmony’s Horizon Bridge. Concurrently, additional evidence has linked the stolen funds to laundering activities on the Tron blockchain, which were also used in the Phemex hack. Analysts discovered an overlap address (0xd555789b146256253cd4540da28dcff6e44f6e50) connecting transactions from Bybit, Phemex, and BingX, further confirming that the same group was involved in all three attacks. Subsequently, efforts to retrieve the stolen funds have already yielded some results. On Saturday, February 22, 2025, Mantle’s liquid restaking protocol, mETH Protocol, announced the recovery of 15,000 cmETH tokens worth approximately $43 million at current market prices. Industry Leaders Acknowledge Bybit’s Transparency The crypto industry has shown strong support for Bybit following the breach . Several exchanges and blockchain security firms, including Bitget, Pionex, MEXC, SoSoValueCrypto, Solana, TON Blockchain, and Blockchain UAE, have expressed solidarity and offered assistance. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) also praised Bybit CEO Ben Zhou for his handling of the crisis. “Ben did a good job maintaining transparent communication and calmness in dealing with a challenging situation. That shows a sharp contrast to other less transparent CEOs, like WazirX, FTX, etc.,” CZ stated. Bybit is working closely with partners and law enforcement agencies to track and recover the stolen assets. Moreover, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, has announced that the company has frozen $181,000 in USDT linked to the Bybit hack. “Might not be much, but it’s honest work,” he stated, confirming ongoing monitoring of suspicious transactions.

Ethereum’s RWA market share also went up 3.39% to 54.5% as the number of RWA holders in the ecosystem increased 3.05% to 62.28K. RWA.xyz data also revealed that the number of RWA tokens issued on the Ethereum network had increased to 163. According to Christine Kim, the Vice President of Research at Galaxy Digital, 13 of the 20 financial institutions identified as having built crypto-specific infrastructure and applications were issuing RWAs on Ethereum and its L2s. Kim pointed out that more than 50 traditional companies including financial institutions like Deutsche Bank and Paypal and brands like Louis Vuitton and Adidas, were developing crypto-specific applications on Ethereum and its layer two (L2) networks. RWA.xyz data shows that Ethereum was the blockchain of choice for the issuance of tokenized assets with almost four times the total value of RWAs than the next most popular blockchain for RWAs, zkSync ($1.95B). Kim also noted that the types of RWAs issued on Ethereum so far range from money market funds like the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund to government bonds issued by the likes of the European Investment Bank.

The largest tokenized asset within the Ethereum blockchain as of the time of publication was Tether’s USDT stablecoin with a market share of 58.37%, followed by Circle’s USDC with 29% market share. Kim claimed that the value of RWAs issued on Ethereum alone had quadrupled over the past year. A subset of financial institutions working on RWAs and tokenization within the network were also developing their own stablecoins such as PayPal’s PYUSD. RWAs and stablecoins were crypto-native use cases “finding product market fit” among traditional financial institutions, Kim added. According to Kim, the anticipation of a crypto-friendly regulatory environment in the U.S. was among the factors boosting RWA and stablecoin adoption. Ethereum remained the go-to blockchain for issuing RWAs and stablecoins among traditional finance companies. She also noted that key partnerships and acquisitions established in 2024 were expected to result in new strides of adoption for stablecoins in 2025. The institutional adoption of Ethereum-based RWAs surged as tokenized bonds, real estate, and commodities were increasingly moving on-chain. Competitors in the RWA market lag far behind RWA.xyz data showed that other blockchains played a smaller role in RWA tokenization as zkSync Era’s total RWA value stood at $1.9 billion and Stellar’s total RWA value stood at $405.17 million. Aptos and Polygon had the fourth and fifth-highest total RWA values at $335.5 million and $192.9 million respectively. Further down the list were Avalanche, with a total RWA value of $143.85 million, Solana with $135.75 million, and Arbitrum with $77.47 million. Galaxy’s research reported that Ethereum’s success in RWA tokenization came from its strong smart contract ecosystem, security, and network effects. Institutional adoption of ETH-based RWAs also surged as tokenized bonds, real estate, and commodities were increasingly moving on-chain. Layer 2 networks like zkSync Era further enhanced Ethereum’s scalability, offering lower fees and faster transactions while maintaining security through the base layer. Nick Ducoff, the head of institutional growth at the Solana Foundation, said that Solana was making a strategic push into RWA tokenization with the Securitize integration aiming to provide institutional investors with low-cost, high-speed transactions. He claimed that Securitize’s expansion onto Solana represented another milestone in bringing “institutional-grade financial products on-chain.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",News|ETH|Securitize|SOL|USDC|USDT|ZkSync,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|USDT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-22 16:19:16

Conversely, resistance levels at $0.27 and $0.30 remain pivotal for DOGE’s future upward movement. A breach above these levels may lead to a prolonged rise, whereas a failure to achieve this could result in more consolidation. Market Sentiment & Price Projection Despite the recent decline, the majority of sentiments about Dogecoin are still positive. The trading volume and social media conversation around the meme coin suggest that individual traders are closely keeping tabs of its movements, with many estimating a potential breakout. Additionally, analysts keeping an eye on DOGE’s price movements believe that the symmetrical triangular pattern on the 1-hour chart portends an impending breakthrough. In the coming days, DOGE can face its closest resistance levels if bullish momentum builds.

The response came after Zhou claimed that Pi would never be listed on Bybit, a statement that was fueled by social media debate and allegations of misinformation. According to Pi Network, the debate began when an unrelated social media user made a post that drew Zhou's ire. Pi Network says online discussions can sometimes lead to misunderstandings and that they are trying to provide accurate information about the situation. A key point in Pi’s statement was their statement regarding a recent warning issued by a local police department in China. The warning was reportedly directed at malicious actors falsely claiming to be affiliated with Pi. The developers made it clear that Pi Network has not taken any action regarding the police warning and that they have not been contacted by law enforcement regarding the matter.

Pi Network claims that their project is legitimate, citing its six-year development history and community of over 60 million engaged users. The developers also addressed the social media account that reportedly attacked Zhou, stating that neither Pi Network nor anyone affiliated with the platform is responsible for these comments. They condemned the individuals involved and reaffirmed that Pi Network has made no statements about Bybit or its CEO on social media or elsewhere. Despite the criticism directed at Pi Network, the team has maintained a neutral stance regarding Bybit and Zhou. “To that end, other than the comments noted in this article, Pi Network has not made, and continues to maintain a position of not making, any comments regarding Bybit, Mr. Zhou, or their businesses, despite the comments made about Pi,” the statement said.

The city says FEMA, backed by other federal agencies, seized the money without warning on February 11. The funds were meant to cover migrant housing costs after Homeland Security processed and released noncitizen immigrants into the city. The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court, calls it a “lawless money grab” and demands the funds be returned. The city also wants the court to invalidate FEMA’s actions entirely. No one at the Justice Department responded to comment requests. Meanwhile, Trump’s administration is pushing full-speed ahead with its D.O.G.E initiative, led by Elon Musk, which is slashing federal spending, gutting agencies, and laying off government workers en masse. Federal lawsuit escalates as Trump’s crackdown tightens New York’s lawsuit comes at a time when Trump’s immigration policies are hitting major Democratic cities the hardest. FEMA had already paid the city the $80 million a week prior but suddenly yanked it back without notice. The money was supposed to cover the costs of emergency shelters for noncitizens. New York argues the funds were legally allocated and had already been spent when the administration reversed course and emptied the account. Adding to the chaos, Mayor Eric Adams—a former Trump critic—has been forced to work with the administration on immigration. But Adams is also fighting federal corruption charges. A judge on Friday refused to dismiss the case against him, keeping his legal problems—and his political career—on the edge. The Justice Department tapped Paul Clement, a former U.S. Solicitor General, to review its case against Adams. Critics say it’s a political move, arguing Adams’ freedom might depend on how well he cooperates with Trump’s immigration agenda. Elon Musk pushes deeper spending cuts under D.O.G.E While New York fights to get its money back, Elon Musk is moving ahead with his plan to slash federal spending by $2 trillion. His Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) is gutting everything from welfare programs to entire agencies. At a right-wing political event on Thursday, Musk walked on stage to thunderous applause, wearing a MAGA hat and sunglasses. He held up an actual chainsaw, handed to him by Argentine President Javier Milei, who shouted “Viva la Libertad, carajo!” Musk grinned, lifting the chainsaw over his head. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy!” he declared. The moment underscored D.O.G.E’s aggressive approach to cutting federal programs. Republican Congressman Rich McCormick—one of the few conservatives questioning the strategy—warned that some of the cuts could go too far. But for Musk, it’s full steam ahead. Markets react as Steve Cohen warns of economic slowdown Hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen has turned bearish on the U.S. economy. He’s citing Trump’s tariffs, immigration crackdown, and the federal budget slashes under D.O.G.E as major reasons for concern. “Tariffs cannot be positive, okay? I mean, it’s a tax,” Cohen said at the FII Priority Summit in Miami Beach. He warned that slowing immigration means the labor force will shrink, and Musk’s massive spending cuts will pull billions out of the economy. “When that money has been coursing through the economy for years and now it’s suddenly being cut off, it’s gotta be negative,” Cohen said. The hedge fund manager believes a stock market correction is coming. He predicts U.S. growth will slow from 2.5% to 1.5% by the second half of the year. “I think we’re seeing the regime shift a little bit,” Cohen said. “Wouldn’t surprise me to see a significant correction.” Cryptopolitan Academy: FREE Web3 Resume Cheat Sheet - Download Now",Economy|D.O.G.E|DOJ|USD,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-22 16:44:03

If approved, this regulatory decision could mark a major shift in how investors access XRP, potentially driving a price surge. To this end, the SEC has until mid-October 2025 to approve or reject these ETF proposals. Notable filings include Grayscale’s application to convert its XRP Trust into a spot ETF and submissions from 21Shares and Bitwise. However, depending on the review process, a decision could come as early as mid-April 2025. These applications have emerged despite the ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple . Still, the XRP community remains optimistic, believing approval odds have improved under the cryptocurrency -friendly regulatory environment. Interestingly, as reported by Finbold, Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas project a 65% chance of a spot XRP ETF being approved. https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1889035896428663261 AI predicts XRP’s price Nevertheless, Finbold turned to OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o to determine XRP’s potential price movement if the ETF is approved, considering that such an investment product has the potential to attract institutional capital. The artificial intelligence (AI) model acknowledged that the regulatory go-ahead could drive significant price growth for XRP but cautioned that several factors will influence the strength of the growth. One of the biggest drivers would be institutional demand. If major asset managers like BlackRock (NYSE: BLK ) launch an XRP ETF, it could attract significant capital, boosting prices. ChatGPT also noted that general market sentiment would be crucial; if the broader crypto space remains bullish , XRP could rise alongside it. On the other hand, the AI platform pointed out that, unlike Bitcoin ( BTC ), XRP has a large pre-mined supply, with a significant portion held in escrow by Ripple . Therefore, strong ETF inflows would be needed to offset potential selling pressure. Finally, regulatory clarity will also play a role, as greater acceptance of XRP in the financial system could enhance investor confidence. Regarding price movement, ChatGPT stated that a 10% to 30% increase could push the token to $2.85 to $3.35 in a mildly bullish scenario. A moderate surge of 50% to 100% could send prices from $3.90 to $5.20, while a highly bullish case, similar to Bitcoin’s ETF-driven rally, could propel XRP as high as $7.50 to $10.40. Beyond these estimates, ChatGPT provided a more likely scenario for XRP by drawing a comparison to Bitcoin’s ETF performance. In this case, the AI model projected that if Bitcoin’s ETF is used as a benchmark, XRP could realistically see a twofold to threefold increase over time, making $5 to $7 a reasonable short-term target. In the long run, broader institutional adoption and sustained demand could push XRP beyond $10. XRP price prediction. Source: ChatGPT XRP’s regulatory milestone The ETF approval would serve as a key milestone for XRP, given that the SEC’s case against Ripple has previously weighed down the asset. As things stand, speculation is growing that the legal matter could be resolved soon. With pro-crypto advocate Paul Atkins being nominated to lead the agency, the XRP community anticipates that he may push for a dismissal of the case or promote a settlement favorable to Ripple. After the SEC abruptly withdrew its lawsuit against Coinbase, there is speculation that a similar outcome could be possible in its legal battle with Ripple. The SEC’s decision, filed with prejudice on February 21, 2025, ends a nearly two-year case accusing Coinbase of operating as an unregistered securities exchange.

The recent hack worth $1.5 billion in the Bybit exchange has strengthened the resistance levels. The recent drop in price has been also triggered by low network activities. Several on-chain metrics have now declined, suggesting that SOL price might be preparing for more pain in breaking through resistance levels. Solana’s Address Count Drops Steeply The price of Solana had already been under pressure due to the aftermath of the Libra meme coin scam, and it faced further challenges following a $1.5 billion theft from the Bybit exchange. According to Coinglass, Solana’s total liquidations approached $17 million, with buyers and sellers liquidating approximately $14.3 million and $2.7 million worth of positions, respectively. Despite these challenges, SOL’s price has seen some positive momentum due to excitement around exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Recently, Franklin Templeton took a significant step by filing for a new ETF that aims to track Solana’s spot price, signaling a rising interest in SOL. Despite the positive developments, Solana’s on-chain metrics have been deteriorating. According to data from The Block, the number of transactions on the SOL network decreased from a high of 291 million to 273 million. Furthermore, there has been a significant decline in active addresses, with the count falling from a peak of 5.7 million to just 3.49 million. Also read: Will Solana Reclaim $180 Before the Month-End? Here’s What’s Next for SOL Price Rally This downward trend in key on-chain metrics suggests increasing bearish control for Solana. As network activity weakens, the volatility rate for initiating an upward rally diminishes. Additionally, the SOL price might initiate further bearish rally as the short positions are increasing. Data from Coinglass shows that the long/short ratio has dropped to 0.8993. It suggests that currently 53% of total trades are in short. What’s Next for SOL Price? The crypto market is recovering, resulting in a strong correction in the SOL price following Bybit hack. Buyers are now pushing the price above immediate Fib levels to continue the upward momentum. As of writing, SOL price trades at $173, surging over 2.8% in the last 24 hours. The SOL/USDT trading pair continues to struggle below $180, indicating strong domination from the bears. This price level could be a major obstacle as STHs might continue to liquidate here. However, buyers might soon break above that level if demand surges. If the price falls below the EMA20 trend line on the 1-hour chart, the sellers will likely try to push it back down to $160 support level. However, with the RSI level continuing to trade around the midline at level 48, it might trigger a retest of the resistance channel. If the price manages to hold above $180, it would favor the buyers. The trading pair could then increase to $220.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Solana,EN,0,0,SOL|TRADING|EXCHANGE|ALTCOIN|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 16:46:55

This includes a latest attack on crypto trading platform Bybit which compromised and stole $1.5 billion belonging to customers. The attack, which analysts describe as the largest crypto heist in history, has raised concerns about the lack of regulatory safeguards protecting investors. US SEC Criticized as Bybit Hack Highlights Security Gaps According to a recent post on X , Stark criticized the US SEC’s decision to roll back enforcement actions against cryptocurrency platforms. He pointed out that Bybit’s security breach is a direct consequence of weak regulatory oversight, leaving investors unprotected against sophisticated cyberattacks. The attack on Bybit has been linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group , a state-sponsored hacking collective known for targeting cryptocurrency exchanges. Analysts at blockchain forensics firm Elliptic reported that the group has stolen billions in crypto over the years, using complex laundering methods to fund North Korea’s missile programs. Without strict cybersecurity requirements enforced by the US SEC, exchanges remain vulnerable to such threats. EX SEC John Reed Stark added, “For crypto-exchanges, there’s no regulatory oversight; no consumer protections; no net capital requirements; no licensure of individuals; no US audits, inspections or examinations; no segregation of customer funds; no insurance, no cybersecurity requirements; no transparency; no accountability; no SEC/FDIC/OCC/etc. engagement and the list goes on” Bybit’s $1.5 Billion Hack Exposes Risks The Bybit hack has sparked concerns about the broader security risks in the crypto industry. Crypto exchanges lack oversight, unlike traditional financial institutions. They have no mandatory audits, capital reserves, or customer asset protection. Bybit has responded by securing bridge loans to cover losses and working to recover the stolen assets. However, experts remain skeptical about the likelihood of successful recovery. This incident underscores how the absence of SEC enforcement leaves crypto investors exposed to large-scale losses with no regulatory safeguards. With the US SEC pulling back from crypto-related investigations and enforcement, investors are left without key protections. The lack of insurance, consumer safeguards, and oversight mechanisms means that customers impacted by breaches like the Bybit hack have limited options for recovering their funds. As the US SEC changes its regulatory stance, critics raise concerns. They argue that offshore crypto exchanges may still operate with weak security. This regulatory gap increases the risk of further large-scale hacks, placing investors at continued financial risk. The US SEC decision to halt enforcement actions has sparked debates on crypto regulation. Ongoing cases against major exchanges are now on hold. Some industry participants see reduced oversight as a way to promote innovation. Others warn it increases risks of fraud, security breaches, and financial instability. Following the recent crypto hack, Bybit has launched a $140 million recovery bounty to track and reclaim stolen funds. The exchange is offering rewards to individuals or organizations that provide information leading to the identification of hackers.

A break above $3 could trigger a rally toward $3.2–$3.4, with analysts setting a long-term target of $5.8. Failure to surpass resistance may lead to extended consolidation or a retest of support near $2.50. XRP is nearing a critical resistance level, with technical indicators pointing to a breakout scenario.

XRP Price Prediction As Competition From Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Intensifies,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ripple-xrp-reach-5-in-2025-xrp-price-prediction-as-competition-from-mutuum-finance-mutm-intensifies/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has now raised over $1 million from more than 2,000 investors in the opening phase of its presale, with 94% of tokens snapped up at the current price of $0.01. Early participants are positioning themselves for a guaranteed 600% return when the token launches at $0.06, while those waiting risk paying 50% more when phase 2 starts. As the clock ticks on this limited-time opportunity, analysts are pointing to MUTM’s post-launch potential to hit $1 in 2025, a 100x surge from today’s entry point. Ripple (XRP) faces mounting pressure to justify bullish predictions of a $5 price tag amid rising competition from innovative projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). XRP Price Analysis: Technical Signals and Regulatory Shifts Ripple (XRP) is hovering at $2.55 after weeks of consolidation between $2.30 and $2.50, with technical analyst Dark Defender identifying a potential breakout pattern. The cryptocurrency’s relative strength index (RSI) suggests growing momentum, fueling predictions of a 129% jump to $5.85. A secondary target of $8.76, nearly triple XRP’s all-time high, has also entered discussions. Regulatory developments are adding complexity to XRP’s trajectory. The SEC recently acknowledged Grayscale’s application for an XRP-focused ETF under new leadership, hinting at possible regulatory easing. While this could improve market sentiment, XRP’s path remains uncertain. Resistance levels at $2.66 and $3.12 loom overhead, and despite an 11% weekly gain, the token has dipped 17% over two weeks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly emerging as a high-utility alternative in decentralized finance (DeFi). Its presale has become a focal point for investors, combining a low entry price with measurable growth mechanisms. The project’s lending and borrowing platform, set to launch alongside its exchange debut, allows users to earn passive income through liquidity pools or access loans using crypto collateral. A buy-and-distribute system further stabilizes MUTM’s value: a portion of platform fees automatically purchases tokens from the open market, redistributing them to long-term holders. This built-in demand driver, paired with an upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin, creates a sustainable ecosystem primed for expansion. With a beta platform rollout planned for launch, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is transitioning from concept to functional product faster than most presale projects. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Outshines Traditional Investments While XRP’s potential hinges on market sentiment and regulatory shifts, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers transparent, math-backed returns. The presale’s first phase guarantees a 7x profit at launch, a figure locked in by the token’s pricing structure, not speculation. Post-launch, experts tie the $1 prediction to tangible factors: platform adoption, stablecoin integration, and the token’s role in governance. Early backers also gain access to a $100,000 giveaway, amplifying incentives to join before Phase 1 closes. Unlike XRP, which requires navigating volatile market cycles, MUTM’s presale provides a clear entry-exit strategy. Investors purchasing $1,500 worth of tokens today could see their holdings grow to $10,500 at launch and $150,000 if the $1 target materializes. As the crypto market grows, projects blending innovation with immediate profitability are gaining an edge. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already demonstrated its appeal, outpacing typical presale benchmarks. With under 6% of Phase 1 tokens remaining, the window for securing the lowest price, and highest potential returns, is narrowing by the hour. Ripple (XRP) may still reach $5 in 2025, but its path involves navigating regulatory uncertainty and market volatility. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers predefined profit milestones, a live product roadmap, and a community-driven model designed for exponential growth. For investors prioritizing measurable gains over hopeful projections, MUTM’s presale represents one of 2025’s most actionable opportunities. Act now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Phase 1 presale closes soon, and the next price hike is imminent. Secure your tokens at $0.01 before the 50% increase in Phase 2 locks early-bird advantages behind a higher paywall.

He says the Cardano price could skyrocket if it breaks out of a given range. Also, Ali forecasts the Solana price might rally to $180 soon. However, as these Goliaths fight upper resistance, a new entrant is emerging as the dark horse of the year— IntelMarkets (INTL) . This AI-based trading platform is on the rise, raising $10.6 million in funding. Its price has also risen to $0.091 with the potential to reach $1 by 2025. Cardano (ADA) Predicted To Skyrocket If It Closes Outside Given Range According to Ali Martinez, the Cardano coin is gearing up for a 24% price pump. The Cardano price has been trading in a symmetrical triangle in the past few weeks. Ali notes that a close outside the $0.74-$0.83 range would determine the Cardano price direction in the coming weeks. Another analyst, called Eilert, says the current Cardano price movement is similar to that of the previous cycle. As a result, he expects a Cardano price surge to occur soon. According to Eilert, this is the worst time to exit the market. The analyst posted a Cardano price chart with a potential target of $6. He also highlighted an important support of around $0.75. In the meantime, the Cardano price has seen a minor correction of 0.5% in the weekly timeframe. Currently, technical indicators support a downtrend. The Hull Moving Average (9) and VWMA (10) indicators are in the selling region and support more Cardano price downtrends in the coming days. CoinMarketCap data reveals the Cardano price has been consolidating between $0.6 and $0.8 in the past few weeks. Solana (SOL) Price Plummets By Double Digits The Solana price is still consolidating under the $200 level. CoinMarketCap data shows the Solana price has dipped by 26.8% on the monthly timeframe. Despite this downturn, the Solana price could soar in the coming weeks. Ali Martinez notes the Solana price is about to break out from an inverse head and shoulder pattern. If the breakout is successful, the analyst forecasts the Solana price could rise to $180. Another analyst called Lucky says the Solana price will not remain at the $170 level forever. Lucky predicts the Solana price may rise to $340 in the coming weeks. According to him, the Solana ecosystem is expanding as new projects emerge every day. Lucky argued that the Solana price is undervalued and might pump higher soon if the support at the $160 level holds.

Cardano price analysis reveals ADA’s continued downward trajectory, with a crucial resistance level looming at $0.86. Concurrently, Shiba Inu is grappling with a significant SHIB whale loss of 93% in transaction volume, raising alarms about its future liquidity and potential for recovery due to waning investor interest. As these tokens struggle against market downturns, BlockDAG (BDAG) , hailed as one of the best cryptos for 2025 , charts a contrasting course. Its presale has rocketed to $197 million and is on the brink of reaching $200 million, propelled by the LISTING1000 offer’s imminent closure. Whales are rapidly gathering, eager to capitalize on the 350% bonus and amass significant BDAG holdings without extra expense. Cardano Price Analysis: What Lies Ahead for ADA? Cardano price analysis points to a modest 5% uplift this week, though the overall momentum remains bearish. After tumbling from $1.15 over three weeks, ADA’s price has found some stability around $0.65, providing a brief respite. However, Cardano’s price analysis indicates that the short-term outlook is still bearish. For a shift towards a bullish trajectory, ADA must surpass previous peaks, particularly the $1.15 mark. Should the current support at $0.65 sustain, ADA might slowly recuperate, but failing to uphold these gains could push it back down towards $0.50. Keep an eye on resistance levels at $0.86, $0.988, and $1.15. SHIB Whale Loss: Declining Investor Interest Pressures Price Shiba Inu (SHIB) faces significant hurdles with a drastic 93% reduction in SHIB whale transactions. This SHIB whale loss underlines a sharp decline in substantial investor interest, potentially impacting liquidity and market dynamics. SHIB’s trading price, now around $0.00001646, continues to decline, alongside a reduction in trading volume, painting a grim outlook. Without substantial purchasing or active engagement from major investors, SHIB’s prospects for price recovery appear bleak. Lacking strong demand or a compelling catalyst to counterbalance the SHIB whale loss , the token’s value could persist in its struggle. Final Opportunity to Grab BlockDAG’s 350% Bonus Before Prices Skyrocket! BlockDAG’s LISTING1000 is a golden opportunity for early adopters to engage with BDAG before it goes mainstream. The presale is witnessing an exceptional influx of buyers, with rapid adoption driving the total close to the $200 million mark. The LISTING1000 offer provides a 350% bonus on BDAG purchases, enabling buyers to accumulate a considerable amount of BDAG coins at no additional cost. Moreover, experts consistently rank BlockDAG among the best cryptos for 2025 . Predictions suggest that BDAG, currently priced at $0.0248, might soar to $1 in 2025, offering those who buy now a potential 3932% ROI in the upcoming months. With the 350% bonus, buyers’ potential for profit increases even more, effectively granting them 350% extra returns for free. At its current presale price of $0.0248, BDAG’s cost is the lowest it will ever be, with each batch witnessing a price increase. Whale activity is peaking as major buyers rush to secure their share of BDAG coins. These holdings are propelling BlockDAG towards its $600 million goal sooner than anticipated. For those quick to act, securing BDAG now could result in historic gains as the coin ascends towards its forecasted value. However, with LISTING1000 concluding shortly, delay could mean missing out as BDAG realizes its potential. Identifying The Best Crypto For 2025? While Cardano price analysis continues to signal a downward trend with ADA’s fate hanging on its ability to maintain support at $0.65, and Shiba Inu’s path looks challenging following a massive SHIB whale loss that has diminished liquidity and stifled recovery chances. However, the spotlight shines on what could be the best crypto for 2025 : BlockDAG. Analysts project a $1 valuation for BDAG this year! Additionally, its LISTING1000 promotion enhances the allure, offering buyers the chance for 350% additional returns. Whales are making their moves, and those hesitant to act soon may find themselves missing out on this lucrative bonus and the extraordinary opportunities it presents.

Douver T. Braga, 48, is facing 13 charges of fraud and conspiracy related to the Trade Coin Club (TCC). The platform claimed to offer high profits but was a Ponzi scheme. However, Braga has said he is not guilty. A Global Bitcoin Scam That Looked Like an Investment According to the Department of Justice (DoJ), Braga ran TCC from 2016 to 2021, mostly while living in Florida. The platform, supposedly based in Belize, claimed to use Bitcoin trading software to make profits. More than 126,000 people from 231 countries joined, investing over 82,000 Bitcoin worth over $290 million. However, investigators found out that the trading software does not exist. Instead of investing the money, Braga allegedly took at least $50 million in Bitcoin. Acting U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller said TCC was a classic Ponzi scheme. It paid old investors with money from new ones instead of real profits. Braga promoted the scheme worldwide, holding events in Thailand, Nigeria, and Macau in 2017. By late 2017, investors started complaining they couldn’t withdraw their money. In January 2018, TCC shut down its U.S. operations, leaving many investors with huge losses. Tax Evasion and Fraudulent Earnings Federal investigators also found that Braga avoided paying taxes on his earnings from the scheme. Even though he made millions in Bitcoin, he reported only a tiny part of his income. In 2017, he received $30.5 million in Bitcoin but only reported $152,298. He did the same in later years, declaring much less money than he earned. Braga now faces 12 wire fraud charges and one conspiracy to commit wire fraud. He could get up to 20 years in prison for each charge if found guilty. A Crackdown on Bitcoin Fraud Braga’s case is part of a broader crackdown on crypto fraud worldwide. In August 2024, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Jonathan and Tanner Adam. The brothers were accused of allegedly orchestrating a $60 million Ponzi scheme that promised investors returns through a crypto trading bot that never existed. In the same year, David Caroma, the founder of the fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme IcomTech, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Authorities are increasing their efforts to track down and prosecute crypto fraudsters, working across international borders to recover stolen funds.

Pi Network ( PI ) was trading at $0.76 on Saturday, down from the mainnet launch price of $2. Here are the four main reasons why the Pi coin price crashed. Pi coin price chart | Source: CMC Pi Network prices crashes amid scam accusations A key reason why the Pi coin price crashed is that Ben Zhou, Bybit’s chief executive officer, attacked it of being a scam. He cited a Chinese report that accused Pi of being a scam targeted towards the elderly. 1. Here is a official police warning of $Pi from Chinese police back in 2023 warning to the public that it’s a scam targeted towards elderly folks https://t.co/LaGJqXSOXR which leaks their personal data and loss of their pension. There are multiple other reports out there… https://t.co/gkEu2wZwfo — Ben Zhou (@benbybit) February 20, 2025 Pi Network has rejected these accusations and maintained that it is a genuine crypto project that has been in development in the last six years. Bybit’s CEO statement was notable for two reasons. First, the company has become the second-biggest crypto exchange in terms of volume after Binance. Second, it came on the same day that a $1.4 billion hack happened on its exchange. You might also like: Exclusive: Pi Network co-founders discuss mainnet launch, future, and tokenomics Pioneers likely dumped their tokens amid panic Another reason why the Pi coin price crashed is that many pioneers decided to dump their tokens after the mainnet launch. Historically, most pre-mainnet launch token holders sell them as soon as possible to prevent further losses. In Pi Network’s case, many of these holders have seen other tap-to-earn tokens crash without bouncing back. The chart below shows that all tap-to-earn tokens on the TON blockchain have crashed after their mainnet launch. This includes popular names like Notcoin ( NOT ) and Hamster Kombat. Most tap-to-earn tokens crashed | Source: IntoTheBlock Many newly launched tokens crash Further, Pi Network price crashed because many recently-launched tokens have crashed. For example, a high-utility token like Wormhole ( W ) initially peaked at $1.6 after its airdrop in April last year and has crashed to $0.18. Similarly, ZkSync ( ZK ) price soared to $0.2942 after its airdrop and then dropped to $0.1. EigenLayer ( EIGEN ), another blue-chip coin, dropped from $5.6 in 2024 to $2. Most recently, Official Trump and Melania meme coins have plunged by over 80% from their peak. Pi coin price crashed as cryptocurrencies dived Further, the Pi Network price crash accelerated because of the ongoing weakness in the crypto industry. Bitcoin price remains in a correction after falling by 10% from its all-time high. Other altcoins like Ethereum, Cardano, Algorand, and Near have also pulled back by double digits from their November highs. The crypto fear and greed index has moved from the extreme greed zone of 88 to the neutral point of 40. Historically, newly launched tokens do well when there is a bull market. This is a similar concept as in the initial public offerings, where many newly listed firms rise when stocks are doing well.

It is hard to predict whether the Pi Network coin will bounce back this year since it is in a price-discovery phase. Its rebound will likely depend on more demand coming in from investors, and its ecosystem growth. Pi Network had about 100 apps on its network at the mainnet launch. A strong user growth for some of these apps may be a good catalyst for the price. For example, wildly popular dApps like AAVE and Uniswap have helped to support the Ethereum network in the past few years.

The exchange, which is the second-largest by trading volume, announced that it will reward 10% of any funds recovered to cybersecurity experts, blockchain analysts, and ethical hackers who can track down the missing assets. The February 21 hack saw attackers drain over $1.4 billion worth of liquid-staked Ether (stETH), Mantle Staked ETH (mETH), and other ERC-20 tokens from Bybit’s cold wallets. The stolen funds were quickly moved through mixers and blockchain bridges in an attempt to launder them. North Korea’s Lazarus Group has been linked to the attack, and blockchain investigator ZachXBT confirmed that at least 5,000 ETH from the stolen funds has already been laundered through eXch and bridged to Bitcoin via Chainflip. He initially posted a report on Telegram and later confirmed it on X, but the post was deleted within an hour. Bybit calls on the crypto community to track stolen funds Bybit isn’t waiting for authorities to act. The exchange is rallying the crypto security community to help trace the stolen funds. Ben Zhou, Bybit’s co-founder and CEO, confirmed that the exchange will pay out 10% of any recovered funds to those who help track and reclaim the stolen assets. “Within 24 hours of the event, we were overwhelmed with support from some of the best people and organizations in the industry, and we do not take it for granted,” Ben said. He added that the exchange is determined to “rise above the setback” and is overhauling its security measures to prevent future breaches. Despite the massive $1.4 billion loss, Bybit remains fully solvent, with reserves exceeding liabilities, according to blockchain security firm Hacken, which conducted an independent Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) audit. Hacken stated on X: “Today’s hack was massive—a tough hit for the industry. But here’s the bottom line: Bybit’s reserves still exceed its liabilities. As their independent PoR auditor, we’ve confirmed that user funds remain fully backed.” Meanwhile, Bybit has been actively buying back ETH to maintain liquidity. A suspected Bybit address received $100 million USDT, then moved $50 million to Galaxy Digital and FalconX OTC desks, purchasing 36,900 ETH, which was later deposited back into the exchange. The crypto industry has responded swiftly to Bybit’s crisis. Major firms have stepped up to provide emergency liquidity, including: Binance: 50,000 ETH Bitget: 40,000 ETH HTX co-founder Du Jun: 10,000 ETH Bybit confirmed that Antalpha, Pionex, MEXC, Mirana, Sosovalue, Solana Foundation, TON Foundation, Blockchain Center Dubai, Ghaf Capital, Bitvavo, Tether, and Galaxy Digital all assisted in stabilizing the exchange. “Bybit is overwhelmed by the support that we got from partners and industry friends during last night’s critical time,” Ben said. “We will need a lot more help down the road as well.” Even after suffering the biggest crypto heist in history, Bybit has processed more than 350,000 withdrawal requests in 10 hours, completing 99.9% of them by 1:45 AM UTC, according to Ben. “Although we have been hit by the worst hack possibly in the history of any medians (banks, crypto, finance), all Bybit functions and products remain functional. The whole team has been awake all night to process and answer client questions and concerns,” he wrote on X.

The former Binance CEO admitted via a post on X that the process wasn’t as easy as expected, even for someone who built the world’s largest crypto exchange. “DEX is so much harder to use. 27 minutes to do a test buy… Still haven’t figured out how to add to the liquidity pool. And you have to do this while they are all watching on the blockchain,” CZ wrote . On-chain details of CZ’s TST token purchase. Source: BscScan CZ receives $1 million in crypto, asks what to do with it An hour before his TST purchase, CZ revealed that $1 million in crypto had landed in one of his wallets. He had originally sent $100,000 (150 BNB) from that address as a donation, but the same wallet unexpectedly received ten times that amount back. “I will not keep any of coins/tokens for myself,” CZ tweeted . “What should I do with it? Add to an LP pool? Airdrop? Donate to a charity? Send to a burn address? Any other ideas? Serious question. Limiting replies to people I follow to avoid spam. Will unfollow any spammers.” Crypto users immediately weighed in, with suggestions flooding in from all sides. Some demanded he burn the tokens, others pushed for a charitable donation, while a huge portion of the community begged for an airdrop. CZ hasn’t shared if he has made a decision but he probably used some of that to buy the TST tokens. TST’s interesting origin story $TST, or Test Token, wasn’t supposed to be a real crypto. It was actually created on February 7 as a tutorial asset on Four.meme, a platform designed to teach users how to launch meme coins on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The BNB Chain team featured $ TST in a demo video, inadvertently sharing the token’s name and contract address. That was all the degens needed. Within hours, traders—particularly in China—began sniping the token, and $TST took on a life of its own. Its market cap started at just $500,000, but hype-driven speculation pushed it past $50 million within three days, thanks to social media, speculative hypertrading, and the classic meme coin FOMO cycle. On February 9, 2025, Binance officially listed $TST, introducing TST/USDT and TST/USDC trading pairs. The listing exploded demand, sending prices even higher as retail traders flooded in. Binance repeatedly stated that $TST was not an official Binance-backed token. The exchange clarified that the listing was purely market-driven, saying over and over again that Binance had no control or involvement in its creation.

Whereas traders and investors have traditionally focused on the usual suspects, we are beginning to see a shift toward new entrants with tangible utility and the prospect of staying power coming towards 2025. One such new entrant is Rexas Finance (RXS), a token that stands out by its special emphasis on real-world asset tokenization. Meme Coins: Dogecoin and Shiba Inu’s Struggles and Market Dynamics Driven by celebrity promotions and having a viral community behind it, Dogecoi, once a meme, had a market cap of over $47 billion. Still, its future remains uncertain due to a lack of fundamental use cases, with price fluctuation and volatility being unsurprising, considering the nature of meme coins. It is currently priced at $0.3244 and continues to depend on the development of tangible applications beyond hype. Shiba Inu has also displayed remarkable volatility, priced at $0.0000163 in February 20205. Recent whale activity suggests a potential shift, but its MVRV ratio indicates most holders are at a loss, pointing to an accumulation phase. Despite some buying pressure, SHIB faces resistance at $0.0000169, and its 32% drop in trading volume suggests waning demand. Both tokens need sustained momentum and broader adoption to ensure long-term viability, with market sentiment remaining cautious. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Rising Star with Real Utility Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, which gain popularity through memes, Rexas Finance focuses on tokenizing real-world assets. Meme coins have no value, although Rexas Finance allows users to tokenize and invest in physical assets like real estate, art, and commodities. This massive innovation gives Rexas Finance a huge leap in competition against other cryptocurrencies. Investors in Rexas Finance have already contributed a staggering $45 million to the presale, indicating the strong demand for the project. The platform’s revolutionary tokenization approach enables users to engage in fractional asset ownership, making huge investments easier to access. The project utilizes blockchain technology to guarantee security and transparency for these transactions, making them easier and safer for the world’s market. Rexas Finance will become an industry leader with its $0.25 list price in June 2025, especially with the presale entering its last phase. This project's competent team, favorable market conditions, and enthusiastic community—which continues to grow—add to its promising prospects.

Dogecoin, once merely a joke, peaked with a market capitalization surpassing $47 billion, yet it continues to seek solid use cases to stabilize its fluctuating price. Similarly, Shiba Inu, priced at $0.0000163, grapples with volatility, as indicated by its recent whale activity and a concerning MVRV ratio. As SHIB faces resistance and a decline in trading volume, questions about its long-term sustainability persist. Rexas Finance: Revolutionizing Investment with Real Assets Breaking away from the meme coin narrative, Rexas Finance seeks to revolutionize how we perceive cryptocurrencies by focusing on tokenizing tangible assets. Unlike its meme counterparts, Rexas allows users to invest in asset-backed tokens tied to real estate, art, and commodities.

WeChain Fintech Singapore, which was contracted to manage payroll for Bybit Fintech, employed Ho as a payroll processing staff member. Ho, who was responsible for processing salaries for approximately 900 ByBit employees, exploited her position by manipulating Microsoft Excel files to divert company funds into her own accounts. Bybit Payroll Scandal According to a report from ‘The Straits Times,’ her fraudulent activities began in May 2022 when she altered payroll data to reflect unauthorized payments. She initially stole over $117,000 from WeChain. Encouraged by the absence of detection, she escalated her scheme and ended up misappropriating vast amounts of cryptocurrency directly from Bybit’s electronic wallet. In fact, between May and August 2022, she transferred over 4.2 million USDT into four personal wallets. To facilitate the theft, she inserted fraudulent payment entries into payroll documents and listed her own wallet addresses next to employee names to deceive Bybit into authorizing the transactions. Despite being under investigation and facing legal action from the exchange, Ho continued to lead an extravagant lifestyle. She placed a down payment of nearly $750,000 for a penthouse worth over $3.7 million on Gilstead Road. She also splurged on high-end items, spending close to $30,000 on Louis Vuitton products, including sunglasses, bags, shoes, shirts, and rings. Additionally, she purchased a Mercedes-Benz valued at $420,000. Police later seized over $330,000 worth of her assets, but a significant portion of the stolen funds remains unaccounted for. In February 2023, a WeChain representative reported Ho’s fraudulent activities to the authorities, which led to her arrest two months later. When questioned by police, she attempted to mislead investigators by falsely claiming that an individual named “Jason Teo,” whom she described as a cousin, was responsible for the unauthorized transactions. However, no such person was found to exist. Luxury and Lies Ho pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including cheating, dealing with criminal conduct, and providing false information to public servants. In addition to her nearly decade-long sentence, she was handed a six-week jail term in January 2024 for contempt of court after defying an order prohibiting her from spending her misappropriated funds. Despite court orders, she continued to use the stolen money, spending close to $840,000 on luxury goods. Bybit has managed to recover approximately 1.1 million USDT from her electronic wallets and an additional $140,000 from one of her bank accounts. However, Ho has made no effort to return the outstanding amount.

The 50 EMA at $4.36 and the 100 EMA at $4.32 are acting as critical levels for price stability. A bearish breakdown could send the price toward $4.20, while a recovery above $4.50 may spark renewed momentum. Story (STORY) has seen increased price swings in recent trading, surging to a high of $6.50 before entering a correction phase. The price is now around $4.35 , testing a crucial support level that could decide the token’s next move. Traders are closely watching to see whether this level holds or if further losses are coming. Technical analysis suggests that STORY is forming a descending triangle pattern, typically a bearish signal. If sellers take control, a breakdown below $4.30 could lead to a further decline toward $4.20, with a deeper correction potentially testing the psychological support level at $4.00.

In an X post, CZ pointed out how hackers penetrated the systems of multiple exchanges, such as Bybit, WazirX, and Phemex, stealing large amounts of crypto from their cold storage solutions. CZ points out that North Korea’s Lazarus Group is growing in sophistication On February 21, crypto exchange Bybit saw the largest hack in crypto history, losing over $1.4 billion in liquid-staked Ether (stETH), Mantle Staked ETH (mETH), and other ERC-20 tokens. Multiple blockchain security analysts like Arkham Intelligence and on-chain sleuth ZachXBT have tied the Bybit attack to the North Korean hacker organization, Lazarus Group. CZ stated that the hackers manipulated the front-end interface to display a legitimate transaction while the actual signed transaction was different. He argued that the recent attacks on other exchanges were quite similar, with hackers targeting the multi-sig cold storage. However, Zhao is mostly concerned that all the affected exchanges had different multi-sig solution providers, which goes to show the sophistication and broad skillset of the Lazarus hackers. To make matters worse, it’s not yet clear how the hackers infiltrated the different systems; did they attack the multiple signing devices, the server side, or even both? Zhao believes pausing withdrawals could help exchanges after a security breach Zhao argued that he prefers to stay on the safer side and take precautions by pausing withdrawals after a security breach. He said the pause period could help institutions better understand the situation, learn exactly what happened and which devices were breached, and confirm that everything is safe once again before resuming operations. However, he did point out that pausing withdrawals could lead to panic among traders. He related to the 2019 incident in which Binance had to pause withdrawals for a week after losing $40 million, where after resuming operations, deposits surpassed withdrawals. Overall, he urged exchanges not to take security for granted, asking them to consider some of the tips he wrote some years back.

According to a Department of Justice indictment , Franchesca Calagui knowingly cashed hundreds of forged U.S. Treasury checks while working as a teller at JPMorgan Chase to enrich herself and co-conspirators. The scheme lasted for about ten months. “On or about May 12, 2022, through on or about March 20, 2023, as a Chase Bank teller, CALAGUI accepted and cashed at least 339 forged checks totaling approximately $857,000.” Calagui is facing the charges alongside alleged co-conspirator Dondre Gray. Prosecutors say Calagui, her co-defendant and others coordinated the scheme via brazen text messages, phone calls and other means. According to the indictment, Calagui intentionally flouted her employer’s check-cashing policy. “Calagui [was] knowingly cashing U.S. Treasury checks for non-Chase Bank customers that did not comply with Chase Bank’s check cashing policy, including but not limited to cashing U.S. Treasury checks for non-Chase Bank customers, not verifying valid forms of identification, signatures, or required Chase accounts with sufficient funds.” The Department of Justice says that during the active period of the fraudulent scheme, Calagui deposited $15,000 in cash from the criminal enterprise into her personal Chase Bank account. Approximately $71,000 generated from the scheme was also deposited into her co-defendant’s Chase Bank account over the same period. If proven guilty, the former part-time associate banker at JPMorgan Chase and her co-conspirator face up to 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine on each count.

The exchange received overwhelming support from key players across the industry, all working together to track, contain, and mitigate the impact of the exploit.

Chainalysis rapidly tracked and published the exploiter’s wallet addresses, enabling a coordinated industry-wide response. SIS cross-chain bridge stepped up to block associated addresses, restricting the attacker’s ability to launder assets. Zero Shadows activated its 24/7/365 Global Response team, collaborating closely on Bad Actor Tracing and Identification, Funds Tracing, and Law Enforcement Communications to support the investigation and recovery efforts.

According to blockchain transaction data, an estimated Bybit address (0x2E…1b77) received 100 million USDT from 0xEC…B5E76 around 10 hours ago. Following this, 50 million USDT was transferred to Galaxy Digital and FalconX’s OTC addresses respectively seven hours ago. The exchange then purchased a total of 36,900 ETH just an hour ago. Bybit CEO Ben Zhou said in his statement that they will not purchase ETH to replace stolen assets. In response to the unprecedented security breach, Bybit has officially announced the launch of its “Bounty Recovery Program.” The initiative aims to collaborate with global cybersecurity and blockchain analytics experts to track down the perpetrators behind what has been dubbed the largest theft in crypto history. As part of this program, Bybit is offering a 10% reward to participants who successfully recover stolen funds. The total reward will be calculated based on the verified recovery of stolen ETH, which was worth over $1.4 billion at the time of the incident. If all stolen assets are recovered, the total payout could reach a staggering $140 million. Related News: Pi Network Developers Respond to Bybit CEO's Allegations, Are They True? Bybit CEO Ben Zhou expressed his satisfaction with the industry’s rapid response, saying: “Within 24 hours of the incident, we received strong support from industry leaders and organizations. We hope to officially reward community members who provide us with expertise, experience, and support through the ‘Reward Recovery Program.’ We won’t stop there. Interested participants can contact the platform.” Cobo co-founder and CEO Shenyu weighed in on the security issues uncovered by Bybit’s $1.5 billion security breach. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he highlighted three key weaknesses in blockchain security: Vulnerable Front-End and Plugins: Interfaces can be easily manipulated, making it difficult for users to verify signature data. Multi-Sig Keyholder Issues: The lack of independence and enforced auditing mechanisms in multi-signature environments increases security risks.

The hearing’s witnesses will include Lewis Cohen, a crypto lawyer and partner at Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP; Jonathan Jachym, Kraken’s deputy general counsel and global head of policy and government relations; and Jai Massari, Lightspark’s chief legal officer. Senator Tim Scott (R-SC), the Banking Committee’s new chair, previously said establishing a digital asset framework was one of his top legislative priorities for the 119th Congress. “Crypto has the potential to democratize the financial world. I look forward to working with President Trump, David Sacks, and my colleagues in Congress to develop a regulatory framework for digital assets that encourages innovation here in the United States, not overseas.” Earlier this month, Scott announced the creation of a digital asset working group consisting of members from the Senate Banking Committee, the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate and House Agriculture Committees. “I love the concept that we see today – synergy with the administration, the House, and the Senate – focusing not on ourselves, but focusing on working-class Americans who desperately need to reduce their prices and increase their access [to financial services.] That’s what the bicameral working group will help tackle.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Key DeFi Developments Signal Major Crypto Surge,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altseason-on-the-way-key-defi-developments-signal-major-crypto-surge/,"In every market cycle, the altseason is an anticipated period for investors marked by a general altcoins’ price outperformance against Bitcoin. However, there have been many doubts over an altseason in the current bull run with crypto analysts citing a surge in the number of altcoins over the last four years. Interestingly, Bitwise Chief Investment Officer (CIO) Matt Hougan has backed the potential of a brewing crypto altseason. The key crypto figure and market pundit has stated that certain DeFi developments are pointing to a robust price surge for the crypto market. Related Reading: Altseason At Risk? Expert Believes Ethereum Must Hold $2,600 To Sustain Momentum DeFi Boom Incoming: Jupiter, Ondo, Uniswap Lead Charge To Altseason Via an X post on February 21, Hougan listed several developments, especially in the DeFi industry that hint at an incoming altcoin bull rally. Firstly, Hougan references the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s latest decision to drop its lawsuit against the Coinbase Exchange. In June 2023, the US regulator charged Coinbase to court over several alleged securities violations including serving as an unregistered exchange and broker. However, in a sharp turn of events, the SEC has decided to withdraw its complaint ending a 2-year long legal battle The Bitwise CIO also mentions DEX aggregator Jupiter’s recent move to activate a fee structure introducing a minimum of 0.01% fees on all platform swaps which creates a more efficient operational model. Another development raised by Hougan is Ondo Finance’s announcement of the Ondo Global Market, a tokenization platform designed to introduce on-chain exposure to US securities such as stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ. Finally, Hougan also spotlights the launch of the Unichain – an Ethereum-layer 2 solution designed by Uniswap labs to improve liquidity, cross-chain operatalibility and also significantly reduce transaction fees. In reality, these are all singular developments. However, Hougan explained these developments can be attributed to the ongoing efforts by the current US Government to create a “fair regulatory environment.” In doing so, crypto companies and DeFi projects can run effectively extending their reach beyond the digital asset space. The potential of this scenario is likely to encourage investor engagement serving as an early indicator of altseason. In particular, Matt Hougan explains the DeFi market presents a lot of hidden potential to influence the non-crypto markets under the right conditions. Crypto Market Overview At press time, the crypto market cap is valued at $3.12 trillion after a 1.78% decline in the past day. Bitcoin maintains strong market influence with a dominance of 60.4%, followed by Ethereum (10.2%) and other altcoins (29.5%). Meanwhile, the Altseason index is at 31 strongly in favor of the premier cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Tipped To Hit 57% — Altseason Incoming?

According to a recent report by Arkham Intelligence, Bybit has spent nearly 100 million USDT to buy 54,393 ETH at an average price of $2,711, which was then deposited into the exchange. However, this substantial amount of ETH was purchased by Galaxy Digital and FalconX through over-the-counter (OTC) trades. It seems that #Bybit spent 100M $USDT to buy 36,893 $ETH at $2,711 from Galaxy Digital and FalconX through #OTC . https://t.co/tLKDNz9XJn pic.twitter.com/qT2XTR6QLb — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) February 22, 2025 Bybit CEO Shows Gratitude Following this ETH purchase, Bybit CEO Ben posted on X (formerly Twitter) that they had received support from major crypto companies, including Antalpha, Bitget, Pionex, MEXC, Mirana, Sosovalue, Solana Foundation, TON Foundation, Blockchain Center Dubai, Ghaf Capital, Bitvavo, Tether, and Galaxy. ETH Current Price Momentum With this substantial purchase, ETH has experienced an impressive upward rally. At press time, ETH is trading near $2,780, reflecting a price surge of over 2.50% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, its trading volume has increased by 10% during the same period, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day. $155 Million Worth ETH Inflow Despite ETH’s price rising, long-term holders and investors seem to be dumping their holdings at the same time Bybit began showing interest in purchasing ETH. Data from Coinglass reveals that exchanges have witnessed an inflow of $155.50 million worth of ETH, indicating a potential sell-off. In this market condition, such inflows onto exchanges can create selling pressure and lead to a further price drop. However, the market opposed this trend, and ETH outperformed Bitcoin and XRP with a 2.5% upward momentum. Ethereum (ETH) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels According to expert technical analysis, ETH is currently consolidating within a narrow range between $2,560 and $2,800 and is on the verge of a breakout. Based on recent price action, if ETH breaches this consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $2,820 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 10% to reach $3,100 in the near future. Despite this bullish outlook, ETH is still trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating it remains in a downtrend.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-22 18:05:09
